“ I think I may have just saved your life . ”
George Putnam , the pioneer television news anchorman and conservative commentator whose distinctive stentorian voice was familiar to millions of Southern Californians during his heyday in the 1950s and ‘ 60s , died today .
He was 94 .
Putnam , who had been suffering from a kidney ailment since December , died at Chino Valley Medical Center , said Chuck Wilder , Putnam ’s co-host , producer and announcer .
Perhaps best remembered for his “ One Reporter ’s Opinion ” TV newscast segments , Putnam began his broadcast career on a Minneapolis radio station in 1934 .
More than 70 years later , he was still at the microphone with his weekday , noon to 2 p.m . “ Talk Back with George Putnam ” syndicated program .
Putnam did his last regular broadcast on May 8 but returned on July 14 for a one - hour broadcast marking his 94th birthday , during which he fielded phone calls from well - wishers , including actress Doris Day .
CRN Digital Talk Radio will present a special tribute on CRN - 1 at 12 p.m. today .
When Putnam was working for NBC in New York City in the early 1940s , influential newspaper columnist Walter Winchell declared that “ George Putnam ’s voice is the greatest in radio . ”
But it was on television in Los Angeles a decade later  on KTTV Channel 11  that the tall , wavy - haired broadcaster with the rich baritone voice made his biggest mark .
“ George was the great communicator , before that title was ever applied to anyone , ” veteran KTLA - TV reporter Stan Chambers wrote in his 1994 book “ News at Ten : Fifty Years with Stan Chambers . ”
“ His vibrant enthusiasm , commanding appearance , and booming voice blended to make him a major force in television news , ” wrote Chambers .
“ He not only delivered the news , he cared about it and got involved in his stories . ”
The recipient of three local competitive Emmy Awards , six California Associated Press TV and Radio Assn. awards and more than 300 other honors and citations , Putnam at one time was reportedly the highest - rated and highest - paid TV news anchor in Los Angeles .
On KTTV Channel 11 in the 1950s and early 1960s , Putnam would conclude his 15 - minute 6:45 p.m. news broadcast with his signature theatrical flair .
“ And that ’s the up - to - the - minute news , up to the minute , that ’s all the news , ” he would say , then add : “ Back at 10 , see you then ! ”
Putnam was criticized by some for stepping beyond the bounds between his role as a reporter and that of a commentator .
Indeed , when Los Angeles County Dist .
Atty .
William B. McKesson , who had been appointed after Dist .
Atty .
Ernest Roll ’s death in 1956 , sought election , Putnam proclaimed during his news broadcast : “ Many of you have asked where I stand in the race for Los Angeles district attorney .
I stand for Los Angeles Dist .
Atty . William B. McKesson . ”
He then listed his reasons for endorsing the candidate .
Former President Richard M. Nixon , speaking on videotape during a 1984 roast of Putnam given by KTTV to celebrate his 50th anniversary in broadcasting , said of the outspoken newscaster : “ Some people did n’t like what he said ; some people liked what he said .
But everybody listened to George Putnam .
That is why he has been one of the most influential commentators of our times . ”
Despite his reputation as a staunch conservative , Putnam said in a 1994 interview with The Times that he “ never thought of myself as a conservative . ”
“ I detest labels , ” he said .
“ I ’ve been called many things in my career : right - wing extremist , super - patriot , goose - stepping nationalist , jingoistic SOB .
And those are some of the nice things !
“ But those people have never bothered to determine my background : Farmer - Labor Party , Socialist Party , lifelong member of the NAACP , member of the Urban League .
I went through the Depression , and my father was reduced to selling peanuts door - to - door .
Then , because of that , I fell in love with Franklin D. Roosevelt .
I ’ve been a lifelong Democrat .
I ’m a conservative Democrat . ”
Born in Breckenridge , Minn. , on July 14 , 1914 , Putnam landed his first broadcasting job at age 20 , on WDGY , a 1,000 - watt radio station in Minneapolis .
He began by answering the phone and spinning records .
By the late 1930s , he had moved to New York City , where his professional stock rose considerably after columnist Winchell praised the sound of his voice on radio .
“ Winchell made my career , ” Putnam told The Times .
“ I went from $ 190 a month at NBC to better than $ 200,000 a year . ”
During World War II , Putnam was drafted into the Army and then commissioned in the Marine Corps , for which he was involved with the Armed Forces Radio Service .
Around 1948 , he was hired by the DuMont television network , for which he wrote and delivered six commentaries a week on a news show broadcast from New York .
He added to his professional prestige by sharing the role as the voice of Fox Movietone News with legendary broadcaster Lowell Thomas .
In late 1951 , he was hired at KTTV , the independent station then owned by Times - Mirror Co. , which also owned the Los Angeles Times , which is now owned by Tribune .
TV news at the time , Putnam said in a 1983 Times interview , “ was pretty damn elementary , ” with 15 people at most working on the newscasts , compared with 80 or 90 three decades later .
And covering a story in the field was a challenge unto itself , he said .
“ In those days , it was like moving a house to get the equipment set up . ”
TV news crews shot with 16 - millimeter movie cameras at the time and , Putnam recalled , and all the stations would rush to the same processing lab in the afternoon to get the film developed in time for the evening newscasts .
“ If you got there late , you ’d have to stand in line , ” Putnam said .
“ I remember times when someone would run into the studio and yell , ‘ Hey , the film will be here in 10 minutes .
Ad - lib some stuff !’
You had to be ready for almost anything . ”
Putnam was said to have been one of the inspirations for Ted Baxter , Ted Knight ’s blustery newscaster character on “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show . ”
In the mid-1960s , Putnam moved to KTLA Channel 5 , although he returned to KTTV after about two years and then moved back to KTLA in the early 1970s .
Brief stints at KHJ Channel 9 and KCOP Channel 13 followed , including co-hosting “ Both Sides Now , ” a short - lived talk show with comedian Mort Sahl .
By the early 1980s , most of his professional life was devoted to his daily current - events radio talk show , which he launched on KIEV - AM ( 870 ) in 1976 and where he remained a fixture for nearly three decades .
Since 2004 , CRN Digital Talk Radio has syndicated Putnam ’s “ Talk Back ” program to a national audience on cable TV , radio stations and the Internet .
Putnam broadcast the show from a studio at his ranch in Chino , where he and his companion of 52 years , Sallilee Conlon , bred thoroughbred horses and provided a home for abandoned animals .
For more than 45 years , Putnam rode a silver - saddled palomino in the Tournament of Roses Parade .
He also made cameo appearances as a newscaster in a number of movies over the years , including “ I Want to Live ! , ” “ Helter Skelter ” and “ Independence Day . ”
In addition to Conlon , Putnam is survived by his estranged wife , Virginia ; two daughters , Jan and Jill ; his brother , Robert ; and three grandchildren .
A public memorial service is pending .

The Solar Cube : A Solar and Wind Powered Water Source for Remote Areas
September 22nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Carbon nanotubes may be the water filter wave of the future , but Spectra Watermakers ’ Solar Cube works pretty well in the meantime .
The Cube ( AKA the Spectra Solar Brackish Water System ) is a portable solar and wind powered desalination unit that can produce 950 to 1500 gallons of fresh water each day .
Attached photovoltaic cells generate up to 1240 watts , while the wind generator can produce up to 1000 watts .
The Cube generates more power than is necessary for water production , so excess energy can be used for other things — such as the operation of emergency equipment .
And the Solar Cube has already been tested in tough environments .
Recently , it was deployed for testing by the Chilean military and civilian services , where it was used in identical conditions to those found in Iraq .
During the past year , the Cube was also introduced to remote areas of South America and Asia .
Prototypes were used in Pakistan after the major 1995 earthquake in the country .
The Cube has performed well — the system has a recovery rate of 30 % and produces high quality water that contains less than 170 mg / L of seawater .
While the Solar Cube probably wo n’t be used in major metropolitan areas anytime soon , it is ideal for disaster sites and locations that have limited access to fresh water .
Personally , I ’d like to keep one in storage in case of emergency .
I just need to come up with $ 38,000 to cover the asking price .

Do pharmaceuticals make you healthy ?
In this video , the Health Ranger challenges Big Pharma to a $ 10,000 health challenge , explaining that pharmaceuticals do n't make you healthy ; they make you sick !
Page Not Found
The page you are looking for does n't exist .
This might be due to a number of reasons including a recent redesign of this website .
Your best bet is to try one of the following options :
In the pages that follow , I give a rundown of the new Chrome browser from Google from a technical perspective .
I 'm not giving every detail of the nuts and bolts of Chrome , nor am I giving an overview of the cool new features .
Rather , this is an overview of some of the interesting technical aspects that I discovered while reading the docs on Chrome and looking at some of the open - source code .
If you 're a manager who wants a technical overview , read on .
If you 're a developer , you 'll want to read this before reading my future articles about development for Chrome .
Multiprocessing : Finally !
For those of us who spend 12 hours or more a day at our computer ( that would be me ) , we often start our browser at the beginning of the day and keep opening up new tabs and new tabs as the day progresses .
I 'm not kidding :
There are times I 'll have 50 tabs open in Firefox .
( Okay , maybe that 's indicative of other problems and I should n't admit that .
Ahem , anyway ... )
And as we open more and more tabs , while closing a few here and there , the memory consumed by the browser just keeps growing and growing .
I 've seen the browser easily take up over 300,000K ; there have been a few occasions where it even topped out at a gig .
( Again , maybe I should n't admit that ! )
Now while Chrome does n't totally fix the memory size problem , it does help manage the issue by reducing fragmentation problems .
In one of the traditional browsers , the browser gets one set of virtual memory allocated for the single process .
Each tab , of course , takes up a block of memory within this total set .
And as you open tabs , more memory is allocated .
But as you close tabs , the memory left behind is n't always big enough for future tabs , and you end up with the standard fragmented memory problem .
( Now I should probably clarify that this is the claim that Google makes ; I have n't looked at the Firefox source code to find out for sure how it handles fragmented memory . )
But with Chrome , each tab gets its own process .
You heard that right :
Not just each Chrome window , but each tab .
I 've been doing development for some 20 years now , and I have to be honest :
It has never once occurred to me to have a single window hosting mulitple processes .
But that 's exactly what Chrome does .
Now being a skeptic at heart , I was n't sure I believed this without testing it myself .
I started up Process Explorer ( from Microsoft 's SysInternals ) along with Chrome .
I then opened up new tabs and watched Process Explorer .
Sure enough , there was a new process started as a new page loaded in each tab .
When I would initially open a tab , Chrome would n't allocate a new process yet .
But when I typed an address into the tab and loaded an actual page into the tab , I saw a new instance of chrome .
exe start up .
With the help of Process Explorer , I could look at the command line Chrome used to launch the next instance of chrome.exe .
The instance included various command - line parameters , including -- type=renderer which apparently tells the instance it's a tab window , as well as one called -- channel followed by a string of numbers , which is likely for locating and communicating with the parent process .
This happened each time I loaded a page in a new tab ; I had multiple instances of chrome .exe running .
But further , if I had an existing tab with a page in it , and I went to the address bar and typed in a new URL , that page 's associated chrome .
exe instance closed and a new instance of chrome .
exe started .
That 's perfect : Instead of trying to clean out the memory associated with the existing page that 's closing , chrome just wipes out the whole process and starts fresh .
And that 's one more way Chrome stops memory fragmentation , as well as protection and isolation between pages .
But what 's even more interesting is I saw an oddity when I loaded www.yahoo.com.
I saw two processes starting up .
But for other smaller pages like www.google.com, I only saw one process .
I had a pretty good idea what that second process was , and when I looked at the command line parameters , my suspicion was correct :
The -- type command - line parameter is now set to plugin , and there 's an additional parameter called -- plugin - path that is set to :
c:\windows\system32\macromed\flash
pswf32.dll
That 's the Flash player ; Chrome starts even another process for the Flash player embedded inside the page !
Being a good engineer who likes to blow things up ( virtually speaking that is ) , I did the easiest test I could think of .
I killed that process only while keeping the Yahoo page open in Chrome .
Bingo !
As soon as I did , the Chrome tab displaying the Yahoo page showed a message at the top of the page , and replaced the Flash windows ( wait , plural ?
Apparently the single process controlled all the Flash plugins for the page ) with the Flash logo and a sad face on top of it , as in the following figure .
Figure 1 . Flash crashing in Chrome .
And sure enough , the Yahoo page was still usable .
In other words , a plugin crashed without crashing the browser .
And for a guy who likes to have a few tabs open at once , that 's a godsend .
Just to make sure I tested everything completely ( this was strictly for scientific purposes , of course ) , I killed the process for the Yahoo page as well .
( I suppose Google will be glad I did n't kill their page instead . )
This time , the whole page turned black with a sad face and a message , as shown here :
Figure 2 . Yahoo page crashing .
Meanwhile , the other pages remained running , as I hoped .
Again , that 's a godsend .
No more having the browser crash in my MySpace tab thanks to a bad YouTube video that was the real source of the crash while I 'm right in the middle of an online banking session in another tab where I was making a transfer to hopefully prevent a payment for an amazon.com charge from overdrafting my account , a payment that was in progress in yet another tab showing the amazon.com page for a book I was buying to hopefully provide details to help me answer a question that I was answering from a reader of my blog in yet another tab , a question that at first I was n't sure the answer to and as a diversion I started watching a YouTube video somebody sent me on MySpace before I realized there might be a book available that would help me out .
( See how I operate sometimes ?
Now there 's a browser that supports my neurotic ways . )
Incidentally , Chrome actually has its own task manager you can try out .
While inside Chrome , press Shift + Esc to open it up .
It even lets you kill processes within Chrome , having the same effect as when I killed them from Process Explorer .
And if you really want a lot of info about the tasks , the Chrome 's Task Manager has a " Stats for nerds " link on it , which opens up a new page in Chrome showing all sorts of great techie information on the processes .
Oh yeah , and at the top of the page it has the other browsers that are running ( such as Firefox ) and shows their memory consumption for comparison ( or competition , as Google probably sees it ) .
And incidentally to this incidental , the " Stats for nerds " page is accessible directly by just typing in the address about : memory ( which is in the same style as the about name in the other browsers ) .
Try these about pages as well if you 're using Chrome : about : cache , about : dns , about : histrograms , about : internets , about : network , about : plugins , about : stats , about : version .
Rendering Engine
If somebody were to start out fresh writing a brand new browser , one particularly difficult part is the rendering engine .
( I know - I developed an early rendering engine some 10 years ago in Delphi .
The engine is long gone these days , and even if anyone found it , it would n't be very useful as it's totally outdated . )
Google made the right choice on this one : Instead of starting from scratch , they picked an existing open - source rendering engine that 's mature and packed with several great features such as speed .
The one they chose is WebKit , which , interestingly enough , was developed by Apple ( which in turn based its work on an early code base called KDE HTML Layout Engine ) .
Apple 's own development led to the engine that is the basis of their Safari Web browser ; they then made the engine open source ( WebKit ) , and now Google is basing its engine off that .
This means the rendering in Chrome is n't buggy and slow .
It 's fast , and it works .
But I found something that was intriguing :
While researching this article , I read that the early versions of WebKit has SVG built in .
So I tried something on a whim : I opened a .svg file in chrome - not an HTML file that displays SVG , but an .svg file directly .
And guess what !
It rendered it just fine .
For me , this is particularly intriguing , because various forces in the industry ( such as Microsoft themselves , as well as Adobe ) have kind of pushed SVG aside , forcing many people to drop development on it .
It 's hard to say how this will impact the world of SVG , but it 's definitely interesting .
( However , I should add a caveat : After writing this , I did some searching and found a discussion where somebody pointed out that Chrome 's SVG implementation does n't handle animation .
That 's a major drawback , so we 'll have to wait and see if Google beefs up the support , or if this minimal SVG support is just an artifact within WebKit .
Personally , I 'd like to see them add to the support , because I feel SVG is still an excellent tool for interactive vector graphics that has gotten a raw deal in the past year or so . )
Is the master of the rhetorical question back ?
Well , in spirit at least .
Truthdig contributor Allen McDuffee warns that a group of Democratic foreign policy hawks is pushing one of Donald Rumsfeld ’s big ideas for overhauling the U.S. military .
These are the same security - obsessed Democrats , by the way , who helped sell the Iraq war to the American people .
The New York Observer :
Eighteen months after former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld retreated from his post under heavy criticism for , among other things , mishandling the invasion of Iraq and legitimizing torture as an interrogation technique , some Washington insiders are revisiting his strategies and tactics .
Notably , resurrecting Rumsfeld ’s idea — a comprehensive plan to overhaul the military — has n’t been reintroduced into the public dialog by die - hard neo-conservatives .
The project is being led by a faction of security - obsessed Democrats .
Several weeks ago , military analyst Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution published a 60 - page report , “ Unfinished Business : U.S. Overseas Military Presence in the 21st Century , ” which recommended that the next president return to Rumsfeld ’s “ chief intellectual and policy accomplishment during his six - year tenure at the Pentagon . ”
He was followed shortly afterward by Robert D. Kaplan , who came out with “ What Rumsfeld Got Right ” in the July / August “ Ideas Issue ” of The Atlantic .
The Atlantic also produced , with Kaplan as narrator , a 13 - minute video accompaniment to his essay .

Sarah Palin's visit to Iraq in 2007 consisted of a brief stop at a border crossing between Iraq and Kuwait , the vice presidential candidate 's campaign said yesterday , in the second official revision of her only trip outside North America .
Following her selection last month as John McCain 's running mate , aides said Palin had traveled to Ireland , Germany , Kuwait , and Iraq to meet with members of the Alaska National Guard .
During that trip she was said to have visited a " military outpost " inside Iraq .
The campaign has since repeated that Palin 's foreign travel included an excursion into the Iraq battle zone .
But in response to queries about the details of her trip , campaign aides and National Guard officials in Alaska said by telephone yesterday that she did not venture beyond the Kuwait - Iraq border when she visited Khabari Alawazem Crossing , also known as " K - Crossing , " on July 25 , 2007 .
College Parties and Alcohol Consumption by Hosts
College Parties and Alcohol Consumption by Hosts
In January , 2012 a new study conducted by researchers at Ohio State University examined the drinking patterns of those who host college parties with alcohol on campus versus those who host college parties with alcohol off campus .
Researchers found that on any weekend , 10 percent of students at any college can be hosting a party .
On average the host of an off campus college party with alcohol , consumed more alcohol than the party ’s attendees .
Hosts living off campus tend to drink heavier , set the tone for attendees and what will be consumed , and tend to have more drinking problems than the hosts of on campus parties .
Eighty percent of the parties hosted were held off campus .
Off campus party hosts engaged in more problematic behaviors including : arguments , flashing , vandalism , physical fighting and more .
On campus hosts drank significantly less than their peers off campus and engaged in less problematic behavior .
The negative consequences of alcohol coupled with the risk of getting into trouble with campus police was a factor to be further examined by future researchers .

Old men are dangerous :
It does n’t matter to them what is going to happen to the world .
So says the 88 - year old Captain Shotover in George Bernard Shaw ’s play Heartbreak House .
Of course , this sentiment could just as easily apply to those who believe we are in the End Times .
John McCain , with his questionable temperament , just exacerbates this danger .
Add to this McCain ’s flair for drama , the personality cult that McCain has built around himself , and his tendency to demonize his opponents .
“ It does n’t matter to them what is going to happen to the world . ”
Think of Iran ; deregulation ; “ killing ” the United Nations ; health care ; massive tax cuts offset only by cutting pork ; and of course , war and empire .
A man who lived his youth “ looking for hardship , danger , horror , and death that [ he ] might feel the life in [ him ] more intensely ” now seeks , in market his old age , by invoking the virtues of his being disinterested , of being “ above politics , ” of “ putting country first . ”
This is McCain story – of an irresponsible youth – who is now wise with old age .
Yet , as he wrote , “ Often my haste is a mistake , but I live with the consequences without complaint . ”
Poetic – and an apt description of how McCain ’s wisdom is limited by his personality .
( While Obama ’s wisdom is reinforced by his patience and focus . )
Old men have their uses – but today ’s crises – financial meltdowns , terrorism , war , climate change – call for a young man who will have to live in the world he has wrought , after his power has ebbed .
Just as in 1960 the nuclear standoff of the Cold War needed a new generation to take responsibility , to come into power , to wrest away from their elders the burden and privilege of leadership – so today , we must .
We will live in the nation , the world created by the actions of the next president .
It is important that the next president realize he must live with the consequences of his actions .
Below the jump is the context of this quote in Shaw ’s play which is actually very interesting as well .
The second line – a question by a young woman – describes exactly the tact McCain has taken to marketing his old age .
Captain Shotover ’s response reveals some other similarities with McCain – although I cannot imagine McCain being as honest or reflective .
CAPTAIN SHOTOEVER :
Old men are dangerous :
It does n’t matter to them what is going to happen to the world .
ELLIE : I should have thought nothing else mattered to old men .
They ca n’t be very interested in what is going to happen to themselves .
CAPTAIN SHOTOVER : A man ’s interest in the world is only the overflow from his interest in himself .
When you are a child , your vessel is not yet full ; so you care for nothing but your own affairs .
When you grow up , your vessel overflows ; and you are a politician , a philosopher , or an explorer and adventurer .
In old age the vessel dries up : there is not overflow ; you are a child again .
I can give you the memories of my ancient wisdom : mere scraps and leavings ; but I no longer really care for anything but my own little wants and hobbies .
I sit here working out my ideas as a means of destroying my fellow - creatures .
I see my daughters and their men living foolish lives of romance and sentiment and snobbery .
I see you , the younger generation , turning from their romance and sentiment and snobbery to money and comfort and hard common sense .
You are looking for a rich husband .
At your age , I was looking for hardship , danger , horror , and death that I might feel the life in me more intensely .
I did not let the fear of death govern my life ; and my reward was , I had my life .
You are going to let the fear of poverty govern your life ; and your reward will be that you will eat , but you will not live .

[ Editor 's Note : This article is a promoted comment posted on Rob 's article , My Take on Covering Potentially Taboo Topics Like Bristol Palin's Baby on OEN ]
In principle , I have always agreed with the basic tenets of Rob ’s plea for comity and decorum at OEN .
However , while the children , as individuals should be held harmless –as they are just merely adolescents – the larger narrative about Sarah Palin is germane and should be out front in the public sphere to debate .
I was at the Dublin , Ohio Obama rally on August 30 , 2008 , a mere 10 feet away from Obama while he spoke and reiterated what is at stake is the very core principles of this nation .
Prior to Obama speaking , I circulated in the midst of the VIP section and spoke to a litany of women .
They not only panned Palin , they felt betrayed and insulted ; that McCain ’s attitude was one of ungainly sexism whereas women are interchangeable parts – that one is just as good as the next .
The near ubiquitous “ drip , drip , drip ” that spills over daily into another scandal , another tabloidesque story , is evidence either Sarah Palin was an exercise in extremely poor judgment by John McCain or Palin is a pure gimmick –a gambit to court and woo Hillary Clinton supporters .
The overarching viewpoint is the judgment – or lack thereof – of Palin , her duplicitous actions and double standard , faux Christian values , the exploitation of her infant ( and now unwed pregnant daughter ) for political expediency ; her own failed abstinence only teachings – that clearly does not work , even amongst her own children – and the sum total of her ( Palin ’s ) actions that definitively leads one to conclude she is inept , unwise , reckless , and is unfit to be a heartbeat away from governing this nation as President .
It ’s not about the children , but it is about her inability to govern and make sound , rational choices – that she believes in Creationism and not science .
These flaws need to be exposed and she – as a candidate – needs to be eviscerated for her utter lack of credibility , inexperience , lack of common sense and the extreme fringe values she holds .
As one reader of the local newspaper in Wasilla summed her up in a comment to a reporter , “ she is a kook . ”
Palin may have set ablaze the benighted crowd of sheeple evangelists into a gesticulating frenzy of jubilation , but she is dangerous to this nation , dangerous to a progressive America , and cannot be allowed to become the next VP of this nation , or be a hairs breath away from the presidency .
Everything from “ Troopergate ” to “ Babygate ” is in play when she accepted the nomination as McCain ’s VP .
Palin could have declined the invitation , but she did not .
She could have shielded her family from public scrutiny and spared them the overt embarrassment of her hypocritical stances and statements , but she opted to stand in the national spotlight and allow her disastrous conservative values to be illuminated .
And for that reason alone , America has the right and the responsibility to vet this woman , leave no stone unturned , for in politics , as it has been said , is a contact sport .
World of Warcraft Overview
World of Warcraft is one of the premier subscription MMORPGs , and has helped spread the entire genre into mass markets across the globe .
Players enter the world of Azeroth , a fantasy realm of swords and sorcery , exotic races , mystical creatures , world turmoil , high adventure , and war .
Created by Blizzard Entertainment , and based on the Warcraft series of RTS games first released in the mid 1990s , WoW expanded on the early Warcraft single player franchise and is now a vibrant multiplayer world , where players may engage in roleplaying , PvE , PvP , dungeon instances , battlegrounds , arenas , and raids .
WoW has received five different expansions so far , including The Burning Crusade , Wrath of the Lich King , Cataclysm , and Mists of Pandaria , and Warlords of Draenor , Legion and Battle for Azeroth that launches in August 2018 .
Azeroth paid a terrible price to end the apocalyptic march of the Legion 's crusade -- but even as the world 's wounds are tended , it is the shattered trust between the Alliance and Horde that may prove hardest to mend .
As this age - old conflict reignites , join your allies and champion your faction 's cause -- Azeroth 's future will be forged in the fires of war .

COLUMBUS , Ohio , Oct. 21 ( UPI ) -- U.S. scientists say they 've created a material that overcomes a major obstacle in solar power generation : it absorbs all the energy contained in sunlight .
Ohio State University researchers said the new material , which also generates electrons in a way that makes them easier to capture , combines electrically conductive plastic with metals , including molybdenum and titanium .

" There are other such hybrids out there but the advantage of our material is that we can cover the entire range of the solar spectrum , " said Professor Malcolm Chisholm , chairman of the Ohio State department of chemistry .
Researchers said sunlight contains the entire spectrum of colors that can be seen with the naked eye .
What our eyes interpret as color are really different energy levels , or frequencies of light .
Today 's solar cell materials can only capture a small range of frequencies , so they can only capture a small fraction of the energy contained in sunlight .
The new material , said the scientists , is the first that can absorb all the energy contained in visible light at once .
The study 's findings are reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
MAMMOTH LAKES , California ( CNN ) --
A small amount of human remains has been found in the wreckage of the plane that adventurer Steve Fossett was flying when he disappeared last year , a National Transportation Safety Board official said Thursday .
The wreckage of adventurer Steve Fossett 's plane was found in California 's Sierra Nevada on Thursday .

A search team that was examining the wreckage , which was found Wednesday at an altitude of about 10,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada near Mammoth Lakes , found " very little " remains among the debris , acting NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said .
Asked whether the remains were enough for an identification , Rosenker said , " I believe the coroner will be able to do some work . "
Earlier Thursday , Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said the single - engine Bellanca appeared to have crashed into the side of a mountain in the Sierra Nevada in eastern California , and the damage was " so severe I doubt someone would 've walked away from it . "

Fossett was last seen the morning of September 3 , 2007 , when he took off from the Flying - M Ranch outside Minden , Nevada , on what he said would be a pleasure flight over the Sierra Nevada .

Investigators homed in on the area near Mammoth Lakes on Wednesday after hikers there found a sweatshirt , cash and identification cards with Fossett 's name .
The hikers did not find any wreckage ; an aerial search discovered the airplane parts about a quarter - mile away , Anderson said .
Ground crews confirmed Wednesday night that the wreckage was Fossett 's plane .
The sheriff said authorities were not certain whether the cash and sweatshirt belonged to Fossett .
The engine was about 300 feet higher on the mountain than the fuselage and the wings , Anderson said .
An NTSB team arrived Thursday to investigate the crash .
Rosenker said investigators , based on examinations of the debris , believe that the plane struck the mountain horizontally but not necessarily head - on .
It may take " weeks , perhaps months to have a better understanding of what happened on that mountain that day , " he said .
Watch NTSB say crash was " nonsurvivable " »
Fossett 's disappearance prompted a search that ultimately included thousands of volunteers , hundreds of officials and dozens of aircraft poring over an area more than twice the size of New Jersey .
The search was officially suspended a year ago Friday , and a Chicago probate court judge declared Fossett dead in February .
Fossett made his money in the financial services industry but became renowned for his daredevil exploits .
He was the first person to circle the globe solo in a balloon , accomplishing the feat in 2002 , and the first to fly a plane around the world solo without refueling , which he did three years later .
He also set world records in round - the - world sailing and cross-country skiing .

Using a nifty technique called sub-irrigation , the folks over at Inside Urban Green have been growing all sorts of things , including two tomato plants that yield a half - pint a day , in a Rubbermaid container , or grow box .
They ’re doing so while conserving water and taking up very little space .
Anywhere there is sun , you too can have fresh tomatoes , basil , eggplant , radicchio , sunflowers , whatever your heart desires , for less than the price of ten* local , organic heirloom tomatoes at your local farmer ’s market .
And it ’s organic if you want it to be .
And please believe it ’s local .
And it ’s damn convenient if you ask me .
Though their specific technique involves Rubbermaid and polystyrene , there are a number of different ways to put together sub-irrigation , or self - watering pots .
Learn how after the break .
Simple , sub-irrigation grow box ( article at Inside Urban Green )
image credit : Rooftop Garden Project
This one uses polystyrene that functions as an aquifer cover that separates the soil from the water below .
The soil acts as a wick ( as in most of these boxes ) , drawing up the water as it ’s needed .
Sure , Rubbermaid tote containers and polystyrene are not very “ green ” products , but if you ’re repurposing stuff you ’ve already got , or you can pick them up at Goodwill , your footprint gets a little lighter .
Note that UV - resistant plastic is a good idea if you do n’t want your tub to break down over time .
Again , this is n’t perfect , but it sure beats trucking your tomatoes in via diesel truck from California or Mexico .
Check out successful tomatoes and peppers grown in the grow boxes by the Rooftop Garden Project , and watch your mouth water !
Ecological Grower ( pdf )
The Rooftop Garden Project has instructions and a blueprint for making your own “ Ecological Grower with Water Reservoir ” .
Similar instructions here , but they go into a little more depth about which types of soil to use , fertilizers , and other amendments so you can get great results from your container .
The containers really can be made of anything , and if you stick with it for a couple of years , your yields could be great .

Earthbox
It ’s a commercial version of the grow box and Ecological Grower , if you ’ve got the means , it ’s not a bad alternative .
Plus , they ’ve got a bunch of helpful tips for growing different crops in a setup like this , as well as a guide for setting up your system that you might not have found otherwise .
So , you could just steal those and give the evil laugh of frugality .
Mwahaha !
Tomato Success Kit
This one includes everything but the tomato plants .
For the true lazy gardener ( which seems like kind of an oxymoron … )
This kit will get you there , but no patting yourself on the back , because you did this the easy way .
Seriously .
What are you so busy doing ?
Curing cancer ?
Oh .
You are ?
Nevermind .
Way to go !
With a small amount of space , a nominal investment in supplies , and a little bit of sunlight , you too can have delicious , fresh produce at your fingertips in the middle of the city , the country , or even ( gasp ! ) the ‘ burbs !
Oh , and you ’re going to be pulling CO2 out of the air and fixing it in a very delicious form .
If you want to affect global climate change , why not do it through fresh , homegrown food ?
Oh , and if you live in USDA plant hardiness zones that have double digits , you might be able to do this until November or later .
Lucky !

Yesterday 's 11 % surge on Wall Street is gathering most of the headlines this morning -- and any good news on the economy is welcome news -- but there is clearly a risk of putting too much stock in any single indicator .
As a counterweight , industry leaders speaking at a Harvard Business School symposium yesterday warned that the ongoing economic turmoil is likely to morph into an unemployment crisis that Microsoft 's Bill Gates , for one , predicted could push the jobless rate above 9 % for the first time in a quarter century .
Moreover , life promises to be no bed of roses for those who do manage to hang on to their jobs , particularly in the IT field , according to experts interviewed last week by Network World .
From this morning 's Boston Globe :
" Consumer sentiment has never been so low , " Gates said , despite the efforts in Washington and other world capitals to get credit flowing .
" So no matter how quickly this gets fixed , you 're still going to have an economic cycle with a fairly significant recession . "
Gates was one of several speakers who addressed the risks of the spreading economic turmoil at a long - planned event that had been intended to celebrate Harvard 's contributions to management education over the past 100 years .
Coming in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , however , much of the talk centered on the fallout .
" Little did we imagine two years ago when we began planning this event what the world would look like today , " Harvard Business School dean Jay O. Light said in his opening remarks .
Even mighty Cisco finds itself cutting jobs .
And where companies do not trim staff , the economic difficulties are likely to result in expanded roles and workloads for those who do remain employed .
From Monday 's story in Network World headlined : " Economic crisis means double duty for IT pros . "
" For the average company , the trend is a lot of caution going forward .
There is too much uncertainty around the bailout and the national election for IT leaders to be confident in new investments , " says John Estes , a vice president with IT staffing and consulting firm Robert Half Technology .
...
" No one is losing a job necessarily , but everyone is tight now so we are trying to get more out of the staff we have , " says Bruce Meyer , director of network services at ProMedica Healthcare in Toledo , Ohio .
" Consolidating this Layer 1 functionality -- a jack is a jack and cable is cable and it's all in the same closet now -- prevents us from having two people doing the same thing and adds more efficiency to our staff . "
A survey cited in that story reports 6 in 10 IT executives are re-evaluating 2009 budgets and putting non-essential projects on hold .
Care to look at the bright side ?
Gartner says this mess is n't going to be as bad for the IT sector as the burst of the dot - com bubble in 2001 .

Our true environment is one of total interconnection with others , but we don׳t feel this interconnection .
Why ?
What should we do about it ?

Our Environment : The Collective Soul
Our environment consists of all of the stages in our development prior to where we are , which include everything that went before , and also the situation that we find ourselves in at the moment .
So let ’s just go over what our situation is in terms of where we came from .
In our original first state as we were created in the creation of a creature , the four phases of Direct Light , in this condition , there was one soul in relation to the Creator , with no boundaries on that connection .
This is the collective soul , Adam ha Rishon , and actually , this is the state we still live in , except that we have lost any sensation of our true condition .
As this state was lowered through a number of phases by the force of development , which is the development of desire and also the development of the will to receive rather than the will to bestow , it arrived at the independent desire of the creature .
Now , this is reflected in our experience this way .
This state is experienced rather as a kind of a matrix .
A lattice that contains six hundred thousand independent parts , individual souls , all related to each other .
The relationship , one to another , and the influence between them , is enormous .
They are all interrelated actually , in the way that they were related in their original state , but the awareness of this relationship is lost to each of the individual parts .
Anything that is done in one of these parts — which is an individual desire — is felt through this interconnection in every other part .
That is , there is an influence , an enormous influence that is felt throughout the entire system given the condition or the inner action of a desire of any one of these .
So nothing inside here actually functions as an individual .
We perceive that it does .
This is our sensation of it as a result of the hiddenness of our real state from us .
And rather than feeling the interconnection , what we really feel is something more like this — that a person exists independent of others , and is a user and an exploiter of others .
But really the condition that we feel is more like this ( I ’ll do it like that ) — connected to nothing .
But the truth is that this collective soul is our environment and it puts tremendous pressure on us in the form of our society — societal pressures ; the way that everything in our environment affects us .
So much of what we feel ( and we ’ll see how much ) comes from this and not from this .
So , as you can see , we are influenced from all sides — inside and outside — and yet freedom is still achievable even in the material world , in this lifetime , and not in some other world as most religions say .
But it takes a very special effort , and the effort is to rise above our nature .
Californians have been able to cast election ballots from the comfort of their cars at a one - off drive - through voting booth .
The innovative voting system was opened in Santa Ana , south - east of Los Angeles , as part of a push to encourage eligible voters to register and vote ahead of the November 4 presidential polls .
" We want to do everything we can to take the stress off at the voting precincts on election day , " Orange County Registrar of Voters Neal Kelley said .
The booth was set up at the registrar 's offices in Santa Ana , with voters directed into lanes before casting their ballots at eight voting machines .
The machines used were designed to meet disability requirements , making them a good fit for vehicles , Mr Kelley said .
California election officials are forecasting a record turnout across the state for this year 's polls .
Mr Kelley said the number of people registering to vote by mailed ballots had soared from some 330,000 in 2004 to 600,000 this year .

For decades , Big Auto has fought environmental laws and beaten down attempts to modernize the US industry to produce more fuel efficient cars .
They sell fuel efficient cars overseas but always find reasons why they ca n’t sell them in the US .
Now that their brilliant plan to only produce gas hogs has failed , look who is lining up for $ 50 billion worth of help , as if there ’s cash laying around for the taking .
If we were to prop up these colossal failures , we ought to insist that they are truly on the cutting edge of environmental , safety and efficiency and not just up to our backwards current standards .
Otherwise , why bother ?
What is also puzzling is Chrysler asking to be involved in a bailout .
Chrysler was saved by the American taxpayer in the past , then sold off to the German car maker Daimler - Benz before being sold to one of the richest private equity firms in the US , Cerberus Capital Management .
The private equity folks add big names to their boards and have deep pockets thanks to tax laws that help them avoid paying their fair share of taxes like everyone else .
Cerberus Capital Management purchased Chrysler barely over one year ago so why do taxpayers owe anything to this company ?
Cerberus obviously is doing well , so let them fund * normal * business expenses .
Detroit still believes that it ’s 1950 , when they dominated many aspects of the economy .
In 2008 the majority of Americans work for small businesses so why not make a business decision and do more to promote small business ?
Investing more in Detroit without multiple strings is a waste of taxpayer money and time .
Until Detroit – at least Ford and GM , to hell with Chrysler – can show serious progress on fuel efficiency , environment and new jobs in the US there ’s no reason to throw more money and hope that it somehow all works out .
They made their bad business decisions to the detriment of the US economy so now it ’s our turn to make a sound business decision .
WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission 's new rule designed to limit certain negative stock bets is set to start Monday .
Already , a political backlash is brewing .
Last Tuesday , the SEC said it would tighten short - selling rules for 19 financial firms , including mortgage titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , by requiring traders to " pre-borrow " stock before initiating a so - called short sale .
The SEC said it had concluded " there now exists a substantial threat of sudden and excessive fluctuations of securities prices ...
Metallica played the recent Reading and Leeds festivals
The drummer of rock band Metallica has welcomed an internet leak of their new album , ahead of its release next week .
Speaking on San Francisco radio station Live 105 , Lars Ulrich said : " If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow , happy days . "
" It 's 2008 and it 's part of how it is these days , " the musician added .
Death Magnetic , officially released around the world on 12 September , was posted on the internet after reportedly being sold in a French shop .
Legal action
The band , who were honoured at the Kerrang !
awards in London last month , made one of the album 's tracks , Cyanide , available for download recently .
They have also announced details of an intimate gig due to take place in London on 14 September .
Ulrich appeared on the US radio station to give a sneak preview of the album .
In 2003 , Metallica decided to allow fans to download their music via the internet , three years after taking legal action to prevent digital access to their material .
The band chose to make their entire back catalogue available for download in 2006 - after finally relenting on a refusal to allow their music to be carried by iTunes .
They are due to play London 's O2 Arena on 15 September , and will subsequently embark on an extensive North American tour , ending in January .

Political Will , Political Won't
Introduction Today 's environmental reform movement is founded on two core assumptions .
The first is that most of the technical solutions we need to address the world 's various crises are available , or at least could be swiftly developed by sufficiently intelligent , hard - working people .
The second assumption is that all that 's lacking for a successful outcome is the political will to put these technical solutions into effect .
Whether we 're talking about replacing coal - fired power plants with wind turbines and using electric cars instead of SUVs , converting industrial agriculture to organic permaculture , or reversing the decline of ocean life though international regulations , it is an article of faith in the reformist environmental movement that we know what we need to do and all that 's lacking is a sufficiently visionary leader to put more planet - friendly solutions in place .
Unfortunately , both those assumptions ignore significant aspects of the situation that considerably diminish the prospects that the reforms will succeed .
This article examines those assumptions and uncovers the confounding issues .
Our Origins
In order to understand the role that politics plays in our collective failure to address our predicament we need to examine the nature of modern civilization .
Now , when I use the term " modern civilization " I ’m not just talking about the growth of industrialism over the last two hundred years or even the growth of Western culture over the last two thousand years .
What we usually think of as modern civilization is the development , refinement and culmination of cultural changes that began ten thousand years ago .
To understand who we have become we need to look back at who we were before we became " modern and civilized " and what happened to push us across that threshold .
Human beings have been around in one form or another for over two million years , first as Homo habilis , then as Homo erectus , and finally as Homo sapiens .
For virtually all of those two million years , we lived in harmony with our environment .
While it may not always have been a comfortable life ( how could it have been , without color cable television or cars ? ) , we were nonetheless perfectly adapted to our habitat .
This statement is supported by two facts : over most of that period our presence caused little or no damage to the planetary biosphere ; and during that time the human population was essentially stable , growing to only about five million in two million years – a net addition of a scant two people per year .
So here we have a species that was exquisitely adapted to its environment , living an affluent yet sustainable life , treading lightly on the earth , never outgrowing or overrunning its habitat , at least in terms of the species as a whole .
We lived in harmony with our world for two million years , for 99.5 % of the time we have been on the planet .
Then suddenly , in the last ten thousand years – a mere 0.5 % eye blink of time – our population increased over 1000 times , we decimated the earth 's stocks of non-renewable resources , we cut down 90 % of the planet 's forests , we fished her oceans to the edge of extinction , and we live in a near - constant state of conflict with each other .
In this grievously short time we have brought about all the wicked problems listed above .
So what the hell happened ?
Hunter - Gatherers
There have been some remarkable recent discoveries about the quality of life in the times before modern civilization .
We have always known that society back then consisted of hunter - gatherers , organized as tribes .
The classical impression was that their lives were , in the words of Thomas Hobbes , " solitary , poor , nasty , brutish and short " .
Recent research has shown that in fact hunter - gatherer societies enjoyed a remarkable quality of life characterized by low levels of effort , plenty of leisure time , good nutrition , low levels of disease , egalitarianism , very low levels of suicide , homicide and warfare , a high degree of personal autonomy and close - knit communities .
In the words of anthropologist Marshall Sahlins , hunter - gatherers were " the original affluent society . "
In one of our more damaging semantic restatements we have defined " subsistence " living as bad and " sustainable " living as good – even though in the context of a hunter - gatherer society , they mean exactly the same thing .
What Changed Us ?
In a word , it was agriculture .
About 10,000 years ago humanity developed organized , settled agriculture .
Starting from a small area in the Middle East , over the next few thousand years the world 's predominant social model gradually changed as the new agricultural societies replaced hunter - gatherer or horticultural societies by means of displacement , absorption or genocide .
We settled down ( as one has to , to raise monoculture crops ) , and started to form larger social structures – villages , towns and cities .
Nobody is precisely sure why we developed monocrop agriculture – after all , our previous ways of life had been perfectly satisfactory for millions of years .
It may have been precipitated by climate changes , or growing populations in some areas , or it may have been just one of those things .
Whatever the trigger was , the threshold of radical human change is clearly demarcated by fields of grain .
Humans and Resources
The most far - reaching change that came out of our development of agriculture was a heady awareness of our ability to control the world .
For the first time in our two million year history we did not have to simply take whatever Mother Nature offered .
We suddenly realized that we could control her bounty , we could coax , cajole and coerce her into providing what we wanted .
As we planted the seeds of millet and maize in the earth , we planted a very different seed within ourselves – the seed of a new idea about our relationship with the earth .
We now saw our ability to control the earth 's produce as a sign of our mastery , our ownership , our dominion .
No longer would we need to be just another nexus in the web of life , now the web belonged to us .
And just like any other possession it was ours to do with as we saw fit .
We came to the profound conclusion that the world consisted of only two broad classes of things : human beings and resources .
The Growth of Hierarchy
The shift to settled cultivation entrained a host of other changes .
Our diet was dramatically impoverished .
Levels of chronic disease and malnutrition increased .
Levels of social violence escalated .
And we witnessed the appearance of hierarchies that had not previously existed in our tribal social systems .
Anthropologists are still debating why the development of agriculture resulted in the simultaneous growth of social hierarchies .
In my opinion it happened because the risk to farming communities from crop failures was very high .
If the crops failed , these communities contained too many people to survive on local foraging or hunting – both because population densities were so high and because the habitat destruction caused by farming had reduced the amount of local wild food .
There was also no way to bring in enough food from other unaffected regions .
Therefore the risk of crop failures had to be mitigated .
This mitigation involved many activities .
For example , local hunting kept larger crop-eating pests at bay , irrigation helped in times of drought , and shamanic intercession took care of storms and blights .
Each of these activities of hunter , irrigation engineer and shaman was highly specialized in comparison to the more generic farming skills required for planting and harvesting .
This specialization conferred power on the holders of those skills .
This was especially true in the case of shamans , whose power could not be entirely learned , but was said to emanate from a mysterious connection with the supernatural .
Their attempt to exercise control over nature gave the shamans the real ability to exercise control over other people ( " Obey me or the gods will frown on us , and the crop failure will be your fault ! " ) , and the first power hierarchies were born .
The Effects of Surplus
Centralizing the production of food and managing its distribution introduced new elements to the growing hierarchies .
Since some of the food was needed by people who had no direct hand in producing it ( such as weavers , shamans and granary guards ) , some means had to be found to give them equitable access to it .
This meant we had to come up with a way of defining the relative values of different kinds of work , and to establish a medium of exchange so that people could obtain the amount of food their work was deemed to be worth .
In one stroke the concepts of money and wages appeared .
This of course transferred a lot of of power to those who established the value of work and controlled the money supply .
Yet another major impact of organized agriculture was the psychological effect of reliable food surpluses .
For the previous two million years , our existence had been shaped by sustainable subsistence – our wants had been satisfied by the concept of " enough " .
People worked until they had enough , then they stopped .
Now there was almost always " more than enough " .
This awareness caused yet another radical change in how we looked at the world .
The combination of food surpluses and a medium of exchange made trade for non -food goods possible .
This trade enabled a continuous growth in the material comfort of peoples ' lives , and it did not take long for them to become accustomed to this new state of affairs .
As memories of the past faded over just a few generations , the new conditions of growing abundance were rapidly accepted as the " natural " order of things .
The Roots of Modern Civilization
We now had the three critical preconditions for " modern civilization " : the belief that humans owned the world and all its products ; the belief that continuous growth in material prosperity is the natural order of the universe and the birthright of humanity ; and the belief that hierarchy is essential to manage the rapidly growing complexity of civilization .
Guardian Institutions
As always happens with hierarchies , power flows uphill .
Along with it go the perquisites of power , the most important being the right to higher levels of material abundance than those lower in the pecking order .
To ensure that this comfortable situation is maintained , part of the accumulated social power is used to protect the situation .
This is done by strongly defending the three preconditions set out above .
The people to whom this power flowed quickly realized that the status quo is most easily maintained if the rest of the community sees this situation as the only possible way life can work , and any suggestions to the contrary are the result of either some nefarious agenda or outright insanity .
Over time an interlocking system of guardian institutions grew up to protect and defend the three key ideas of ownership , growth and hierarchy :
Economic and financial institutions cooperate with business and industry to set the value of work and control the money supply ( thereby controlling access to food ) .
In this role it does n't make any difference whether an economy is capitalist , socialist or communist .
The core beliefs it guards are always the same : ownership and growth .

Communications media reinforce this message by enlisting people in the growth paradigm .
They do this both through overt messages like advertising and covert messages embedded in the story lines of entertainment .

Religious institutions ( as distinct from the religions they purport to enshrine ) are primarily normative social structures .
Many incorporate an overt message that we should be content with things as they are .
There are often injunctions against questioning authority , as all authority is seen to devolve from the supernatural – just as it did for the shamans of the early agricultural era .

Legal institutions enforce the norms of ownership and hierarchy in ways too numerous to count .
These range from the protection of privilege ( one law for the rich , one for the poor ) to the preferential defense of property rights over human rights .

These range from the protection of privilege ( one law for the rich , one for the poor ) to the preferential defense of property rights over human rights .
Political institutions sit at the tip of the pyramid .
Political institutions encode , enshrine and manage the application of social power .
Politics is the institution that legitimizes all the others .
Because of its unique ability to make laws and its access to legalized violence to defend those laws , politics is the fullest expression of the power hierarchy of modern civilization .
At the base of the hierarchy , supporting it all , are an ever - diminishing number of farmers who apply ever - increasing amounts of knowledge , technology and petroleum to ensure an ever - expanding supply of food .
Because at the core it is their food that makes the whole edifice possible .
So where does this put us in relation to the array of wicked problems we listed at the beginning ?
Simply put , every one of those problems is the result of unbridled growth .
They are the logical results of the continual exercise of the first two preconditions of modern civilization , the twin drummers of ownership and growth we have been marching to for ten thousand years since the invention of agriculture .
Politics is the problem , not the solution
In light of this analysis it is obvious why we are repeatedly failing to address any of these wicked problems .
The only permanent " solution " to any of them is the secession of growth and the relinquishment of ownership .
That idea is anathema to our guardian institutions .
And as the occupants of the pinnacle of power , our politicians have every reason to derail efforts in that direction , no matter how small .
Politics , regardless of party or ideology , is part of the problem and can never be part of the solution .
While it may be easier for the average person to live under the rule of a more humane parcel of rogues , at its heart politics is the primary guardian institution of modern civilization .
The role of all politics is to manage power , and power is always managed for the benefit of the holders of power .
It does n't matter whether the power managers are Democrats , Republicans , Tories , Grits , Social Democrats , Communists or a military junta .
They all fulfill the same role in service of the same beneficiaries .
In order to fulfill that role they unite with the other guardian institutions – the economic , industrial , legal , religious , educational and communications organizations .
Together they create , maintain and guard a noetic milieu ( a globalized intuitive , non-rational consciousness ) in which any values that challenge the two fundamental preconditions to modern civilization are seen as incomprehensible , self - evidently absurd , dangerous or even insane .
Since the primary value system these guardians protect is the paradigm of continuous material growth , the most dangerous of all radical ideas are any proposals to limit , halt or reverse that growth .
The guardian institutions are so firmly embedded in our global culture that it is ultimately fruitless to try and remove them from power by either direct or indirect confrontation .
The penalties for trying this are severe and ruthlessly applied .
Conclusion
In light of this rather dismal assessment , is there any hope for a return to a sustainable , egalitarian , interconnected , considerate and just civilization ?
I strongly believe that there is , but getting there will be neither sure nor easy .
The institutions that stand between us and such a future are trapped by their dependence on the very paradigm they are sworn to protect .
They defend the belief that permanent material growth is natural , possible and inevitable .
While they defend that belief with laws , guns and television , ultimately their power comes from people who accept that premise .
If people stop believing that such growth is possible the institutions ' power declines , no matter how many defense mechanisms they engage .
If growth falters , the people lose faith and the institutions crack and crumble .
Look back at the list of wicked problems .
Every single one of them is the result of our growth encountering limits .
While we may be able to figure out ways to temporarily circumvent some of these limits , the pattern is now clear .
The growth of modern civilization is slowing down , and is even showing evidence of coming to a halt .
For the guardian institutions that depend on growth for their very survival , this is like a diagnosis of terminal cancer .
What that means is that our guardian institutions will inevitably start losing their monolithic top - down power .
This dis-integration will leave " cracks in the sidewalk of civilization " .
And just as grass grows through cracks in real concrete , small communities and individuals will start to appear through the metaphorical concrete of our industrial civilization .
No one can predict when , where or how the dis- integration will appear .
It will take different forms in different places .
The response of the guardians will probably be violently draconian in most cases .
But there are places where communities have already formed in anticipation of such an opportunity .
Like " Gaia 's antibodies " they will work to heal the wounds , widen the cracks , and let the sunshine and fresh air revitalize the hidden earth .
As the seed stock of the next phase of civilization they will spread their values on the wind .
The next cycle of human experience on this planet will be very different from any that has gone before .
We will have fewer resources , but more knowledge .
We will have to deal with toxic landscapes , a warming climate , shifting rainfall patterns and the emergence of new diseases .
To balance that we will have better communications and longer memories than any civilization that has gone before us .
We will not fall back into the stone age , but neither will we motor off happily into the sunset in our electric cars .
There will be hardship and misery , but there will also be joy – the joy that comes from looking forward , from participating in our communities , from the love of those around us .
Above all , there will be the future .

Comments
Between the Monster and the Saint is the latest in a series of meditations on the nature of morality by the former bishop of Edinburgh - a man who , for many conservative Christians , has stretched the definition of liberal theology past breaking point , while remaining for many non-believers the most humane and persuasive apologist for faith .
In this extended essay on the nature of good and evil and the evolution of the religious impulse , he offers a tangential contribution to what he calls " a very ugly debate " raging between fundamentalist religious thinkers and those he calls " neo-atheists " - clearly Dawkins , Grayling , Hitchens et al , though he politely declines to single them out by name , referring to them only as " some of the ablest thinkers of our time " .
Holloway 's new book is a valuable addition to that debate , based on a plea for more understanding and less dogmatic foot - stamping from both sides , but he walks a difficult tightrope between faith and reason and invites the criticism from his detractors on both sides of simply wanting to have his cake and eat it .
He also lacks the controversial , strident tones of a Dawkins or a Hitchens , so one fears that his still , small voice of tolerance will fail to make the impact it deserves on public awareness of the debate .
Here he considers the place of human beings in the universe , the processes - in particular the response to death - that led us to create the myth of the immortal or transmigratory soul , and the evolution of religious thought to its present position , which he divides into four subsections : " strong " and " weak " religion , a third category he calls " after - religion " , and the modern " neo-atheists " , who preach that religion is the root of all evil .
The terms are deliberate ; Holloway is not the first to observe that " in their evangelical intensity they bear a marked resemblance to the religious protagonists they most despise " .
He also states that faith " gathers strength from what the world deems to be its absurdity , which is why the apostles of secularity are wasting their time trying to challenge its adherents on the grounds of reason " .
Here he has pinpointed the inherent flaw in all the many books produced in the past few years by writers in both camps : because each side has already made its mind up definitively , their arguments can only appeal to those who already agree with them , and are unlikely to persuade the opposition .
Holloway 's own book seems to be aimed principally at those entrenched atheists who view all religion as pernicious and primitive , and to be aimed at them in the hope of persuading them to appreciate some of the enduring values of faith .
It is the after - religion category that most clearly defines his own position , one he set out in his previous book , Looking in the Distance .
" People in this position see religion as an entirely human construct , a work of the human imagination , but one that carries enduring meaning . "
Religious narratives are potent myths , he argues , because of what they reveal about human nature .
He goes on to quote Richard Rorty 's argument that the New Testament and the Communist Manifesto are flawed , but that both are valuable texts because they inspire us to believe that our future could be better .
" It is possible to respect religion , " Holloway concludes , " because , at its best , it challenges our brutish selfishness and our cultivated sadism , as well as offering us the hope of a better future for the world and its children . "
Holloway is an accomplished literary stylist and the book is studded with references to Nietzsche , W H Auden , John Berger , Hannah Arendt , Michel Foucault and Robert Browning , to name but a few , as well as his own rather beautiful images : he speaks of being " more comfortable with the cloudy glimmerings of myth than the diamond - sharp clarities of religion or science " .
But at times he also speaks with a voice of colloquial frankness , reminding the reader that these reflections are the fruit of a personal journey rather than dry theological research .
Nowhere is this clearer than in the introduction , where he relates a disturbing incident from his childhood when he joined a gang of men and boys in holding down a young woman at the shop where he worked so that another man could grope her .
As an illustration of how the individual conscience can so easily be submerged into collective force , it seems particularly shocking coming from a former prelate , but it is these personal anecdotes and admissions of fallibility that make Holloway 's writing so engaging and honest .
Whether or not you are persuaded by his perspective on matters of faith , it is hard to resist his conclusion about the human condition and our relations with one another ; ultimately , this is an exhortation to pity , empathy and , at the last , gratitude .
" It shows ingratitude and a lack of imagination to spend the life we 've been given stamping , literally or metaphorically , on the lives of others , or sneering contemptuously at how they have chosen to make sense of theirs , " he says in the final chapter .
It is an almost identical conclusion to that of A C Grayling 's recent essay Against All Gods , though reached by a different path : more important than the beliefs that divide us are kindness , and compassion for the common humanity that binds us together .

Andrew Sullivan observes that according to the Bush Administrations definitions of “ torture ” than John McCain was never tortured in Viet Nam , merely subjected to perfectly legitimate “ enhanced interrogation . ”
In all the discussion of John McCain ’s recently recovered memory of a religious epiphany in Vietnam , one thing has been missing .
The torture that was deployed against McCain emerges in all the various accounts .
It involved sleep deprivation , the withholding of medical treatment , stress positions , long - time standing , and beating .
Sound familiar ?
According to the Bush administration ’s definition of torture , McCain was therefore not tortured . …
These torture techniques are , according to the president of the United States , merely “ enhanced interrogation . ”
The sickest thing , as Sullivan notes , is how McCain has gone from tortured to torturer by joining with Bush to support these same techniques that were used against him .
McCain has said that he ’ll always “ hate gooks ” ( source ) , so how does he expect to win the hearts and minds of Iraqi ’s using the same tortures on their people ?

I loved Seinfeld , but without Larry David , Jerry Seinfeld himself sort of loses his edge , I think because he does n't make fun of himself as much as he would on the show .
As for this commercial , I just can't hate it .
I was n't sure what to make of it , but the sheer randomness actually made me say " WTF .... but I 'm fuckin ' smiling ! "
Interesting discussion on pgo about embeddable scripting engines .
Another option to experiment with is Syx Smalltalk , created by fellow Smalltalker Luca Bruno .
It has full support for embedding and is quite portable as well .
Smalltalk can do closures as well .
In Smalltalk , closures are known as blocks and are used for just about everything , from enumerating through collections to exception handling .
Even logic control flow ( if , while , etc ) are implemented using blocks .
For example , loops are implemented by sending the #while True message ( amongst others ) to a block .
The block is then executed repeatedly until it returns false .
The beauty of this approach is that one can build custom user - defined control structures .
The only niggle is that classic Smalltalk - 80 closures are not totally re-entrant , and piggy - back off their enclosing method activation .
I intend to fix this in Panda Smalltalk , and I believe it has been fixed in other VMs as well .
Meta -Object Protocols
Thought a lot about Smalltalk ’s meta-system recently , particularly in how its meta - level is explicitly separated from the base level .
This is realized in the form of class objects which describe all objects in the system .
Even classes themselves are instances of classes .
This results in an elaborate unbounded metaclass hierarchy , of infinite regress .
The Metaclass class is an instance of an instance of itself !
On the other hand , Self , Io and Javascript did away with the notion of classes .
In these prototype - based languages , the only way to know an object is to send messages to it and see how it responds .
One creates a new object by cloning another .
Messages to a clone can optionally be delegated to its parent ( the object from which it was cloned ) .
This is a monistic approach compared to Smalltalk ’s dualistic form .
Naturally , it makes the object system a bit more flexible and lightweight .
No need to create a class just to represent a singleton instance .
By manipulating the protos slot , one can even have multiple inheritance ( as supported in Self and Io ) .
Eliminating classes provides some other useful benefits .
Classes represent static ( global ) state , which raises thorny issues related to concurrent access and security .
Not everything about prototypes is rosy though .
To compensate for the lack of classes ( which are useful for describing shared behavior ) , Self and Io came up with traits objects .
These are normal objects like any other , yet act as a repository for common state and behavior .
Cloning these objects is akin to creating an instance of a class .
The problem with trait objects is that they can respond to messages which are not meant for them ( usually resulting in a VM exception ) .
Its not clear - cut whether prototypes are better than classes , or vice versa .
At least one can emulate prototypes in Smalltalk with a bit of meta - object hackery .
Opinions on Concurrency
I am quite excited about Io ‘s actor - based concurrency model .
I think it would be great fit for Smalltalk , and I am keen to implement it in Panda Smalltalk .
Io ’s design seems much more conceptually sound than Smalltalk - 80 ’s concurrency model ( simple user - level threads ) .
It really does fit in the notion of objects sending messages to other objects .
With an actor scheme , objects will be able to send asynchronous messages , which return immediately and never block .
The result of an async message is always a future object .
This kind of object is essentially a proxy for the real value of a method when it is invoked some time in the future by the scheduler .
However , sending a message to a future will result in blocking until the real value becomes available .
Io ’s actors are built upon lightweight threads , which is an aspect I also like .
I would rather not make Panda ’s VM fully multi- threaded , as it would add way too much complexity and non-determinism for my liking .
I can get around the problems of blocking IO by using select ( ) or some other IO multiplexer .
Multi-VMs seem to be all the rage now , having been implemented in Io and Rubinius .
For VM laymen , multi-VMs are virtual machines which support multiple lightweight processes , each running in their own native thread .
Each lightweight process has its own heap , garbage collector , and interpreter instance .
They are thus distinct from lightweight threads .
They were experimented with in Java , as a means to reduce startup time by not having to spend time JIT - compiling that obscenely large class library multiple times .
I believe Emacs has something similar .
Erlang has them as well , but rather as a means of implementing scalable concurrency ( think thousands of independent processes ! ) .
I for one am not convinced of their benefit ( at least in the context of Smalltalk ) .
They have all the disadvantages of shared - nothing processes with few of the advantages .
A crash in one of the lightweight processes will still bring down the entire VM .
I think they make sense in Erlang , where a lot of static state is eliminated , such that forking a lightweight process is quite a cheap operation .
In Smalltalk , all classes and other static state would have to be copied to the new process .
This is a bit too expensive for my liking .
The Government 's case for going to war in Iraq has been torn apart by the publication of previously suppressed evidence that Tony Blair lied over Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
A devastating attack on Mr Blair 's justification for military action by Carne Ross , Britain 's key negotiator at the UN , has been kept under wraps until now because he was threatened with being charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act .
In the testimony revealed today Mr Ross , 40 , who helped negotiate several UN security resolutions on Iraq , makes it clear that Mr Blair must have known Saddam Hussein possessed no weapons of mass destruction .
He said that during his posting to the UN , " at no time did HMG [ Her Majesty 's Government ] assess that Iraq 's WMD ( or any other capability ) posed a threat to the UK or its interests . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Ross revealed it was a commonly held view among British officials dealing with Iraq that any threat by Saddam Hussein had been " effectively contained " .
He also reveals that British officials warned US diplomats that bringing down the Iraqi dictator would lead to the chaos the world has since witnessed .
" I remember on several occasions the UK team stating this view in terms during our discussions with the US ( who agreed ) , " he said .
" At the same time , we would frequently argue when the US raised the subject , that ' regime change ' was inadvisable , primarily on the grounds that Iraq would collapse into chaos . "
He claims " inertia " in the Foreign Office and the " inattention of key ministers " combined to stop the UK carrying out any co-ordinated and sustained attempt to address sanction - busting by Iraq , an approach which could have provided an alternative to war .
Mr Ross delivered the evidence to the Butler inquiry which investigated intelligence blunders in the run-up to the conflict .
The Foreign Office had attempted to prevent the evidence being made public , but it has now been published by the Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs after MPs sought assurances from the Foreign Office that it would not breach the Official Secrets Act .
It shows Mr Ross told the inquiry , chaired by Lord Butler , " there was no intelligence evidence of significant holdings of CW [ chemical warfare ] , BW [ biological warfare ] or nuclear material " held by the Iraqi dictator before the invasion .
" There was , moreover , no intelligence or assessment during my time in the job that Iraq had any intention to launch an attack against its neighbours or the UK or the US , " he added .

Mr Ross 's evidence directly challenges the assertions by the Prime Minster that the war was legally justified because Saddam possessed WMDs which could be " activated " within 45 minutes and posed a threat to British interests .
These claims were also made in two dossiers , subsequently discredited , in spite of the advice by Mr Ross .
His hitherto secret evidence threatens to reopen the row over the legality of the conflict , under which Mr Blair has sought to draw a line as the internecine bloodshed in Iraq has worsened .
Mr Ross says he questioned colleagues at the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence working on Iraq and none said that any new evidence had emerged to change their assessment .
" What had changed was the Government 's determination to present available evidence in a different light , " he added .
Mr Ross said in late 2002 that he " discussed this at some length with David Kelly " , the weapons expert who a year later committed suicide when he was named as the source of a BBC report saying Downing Street had " sexed up " the WMD claims in a dossier .
The Butler inquiry cleared Mr Blair and Downing Street of " sexing up " the dossier , but the publication of the Carne Ross evidence will cast fresh doubts on its findings .
Mr Ross , 40 , was a highly rated diplomat but he resigned because of his misgivings about the legality of the war .
He still fears the threat of action under the Official Secrets Act .
" Mr Ross has n't had any approach to tell him that he is still not liable to be prosecuted , " said one ally .
But he has told friends that he is " glad it is out in the open " and he told MPs it had been " on my conscience for years " .
One member of the Foreign Affairs committee said : " There was blood on the carpet over this .
I think it 's pretty clear the Foreign Office used the Official Secrets
Act to suppress this evidence , by hanging it like a Sword of Damacles over Mr Ross , but we have called their bluff . "
Yesterday , Jack Straw , the Leader of the Commons who was Foreign Secretary during the war - Mr Ross 's boss - announced the Commons will have a debate on the possible change of strategy heralded by the Iraqi Study Group report in the new year .
The Venezuelan government announced Sunday that four Russian naval vessels will participate in joint exercises in the Caribbean this year , a move that could heighten already strained relations between Washington and Moscow .
Venezuela ’s naval intelligence chief , Adm . Salbatore Cammarata Bastidas , said in a statement that a task force including four Russian naval vessels and 1,000 Russian military personnel would take part in mid-November exercises with Venezuelan frigates , patrol boats , submarines and aircraft .
The announcement came shortly after Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin warned that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ’s deployment of several warships to the Black Sea in the aftermath of Russia ’s invasion of Georgia last month would not go unanswered .
It was not immediately clear whether the two events were linked .
The Russian agreement to send ships also could be seen as part of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ’s campaign to build up his military , an effort that includes arms deals , a proposed hemispheric South American Defense Council and a recent decree that gives his armed forces a greater role in carrying out his social agenda .

Chavez , a strident critic of the United States , has said the actions are to ward off what he has described as U.S. imperialist designs on Venezuela and other Latin American countries .
He has accused the U.S. of supporting a 2002 coup attempt against him .
Chavez particularly is unhappy with the re-formation of the U.S. Navy ’s 4th Fleet , based in Mayport , Fla. , which was disbanded in 1953 but is now patrolling the Caribbean .
Officials at the U.S. military ’s Southern Command in Miami have said the 4th Fleet ’s re-creation is organizational in purpose and is not a response to tensions with Chavez .
It involves no addition to forces already stationed at Mayport , the Southern Command said .
The announcement of the November exercises did not come as a total surprise .
Chavez said during a visit to Russia in July that its ships and airplanes were welcome in Venezuela .
In Sunday ’s statement , the Chavez government said an adjutant to Russian Adm. Popov Fedorovichhad been in Venezuela to plan the event .

Cammarata also said Russian vessels may appear in the region before the exercises .
Flush with oil revenue , Venezuela has spent $ 4 billion since 2004 on military hardware , purchased mainly from Russia , according to the Security and Democracy Foundation of Caracas .
Those deals included the purchase of 53 Russian helicopters and 24 Sukhoi fighter jets .
Venezuela is also buying rights and technology for a Kalashnikov assault rifle factory near Caracas .
During his visit to Russia , Chavez said that the two nations had formed a strategic partnership and that he was buying a Russian missile defense system to thwart a potential U.S. air attack .
In recent months , Chavez advisors have said Venezuela is considering buying as many as five diesel - powered Russian submarines .
The deal would make Venezuela the region ’s top naval force , said retired Gen. Alberto Muller Rojas , a Chavez confidant .

Venezuelan officials have justified arms purchases from Russia by noting the U.S. ban on all weapons sales by American companies to Venezuela , a mandate that extends to foreign manufacturers ’ arms that contain U.S. components .
Deals with Israeli , Swedish and Spanish manufacturers were scrubbed because the weapons included U.S. parts .
“ The U.S. . . . has done everything to motivate Venezuela to seek a strategic military rapprochement with Russia , ” said a former advisor to Venezuela ’s Foreign Ministry who requested anonymity .

Time Warp Wives :
Meet the women who really do live in the past
The credit crunch , a knife crime epidemic - no wonder so many of us are sick of the 21st century .
Most of us just grumble , but some women have taken radical action to escape what they see as the soulless grind of modern life .
Meet the ' Time Warp Wives ' , who believe that life , especially marriage , was far more straightforward in the Thirties , Forties and Fifties .
1950s
Joanne Massey , 35 , lives in a recreation of a 1950s home in Stafford with her husband Kevin , 42 , who works as a graphics application designer .
Joanne is a housewife .
She says :
I love nothing better than fastening my pinny round my waist and baking a cake for Kevin in my 1950s kitchen .
I put on some lovely Frank Sinatra music and am completely lost in my own little fantasy world .
In our marriage , I am very much a lady and Kevin is the breadwinner and my protector .
Joanne Massey : ' Living like this makes me happier '
We 've been married for 13 years and we 're extremely happy because we both know our roles .
There is none of the battling for equality that I see in so many marriages today .
What 's wrong with wanting to be adored and spoiled ?
If I see a hat I like , I say ' Oh , we can't afford that ' and Kevin says : ' You have it , I 'll treat you . '
I do n't even put petrol in our Ford Anglia car , which is 43 years old , because I think that is so unladylike .
I ask Kevin to do it .
I make sure our home is immaculate , there is dinner on the table , and I look pretty to welcome my husband home .
My kitchen is an original ' English Rose ' design , with units made from metal , which was very much the ' in thing ' then .
We bought it from a family in Scotland who saw our advert in an antiques magazine .
They had it in their garage to keep tools in , so it needed renovation .
I have an original Kenwood Mixer , the phone is bright pink Bakelite , and even my crockery is original 1950s .
Feel good : Debbie 's lifestyle makes her feel 'as if I ’m living in
one of those old - fashioned TV shows where everything is always wonderful '
We had the hall carpet made for us with an authentic swirling geometric pattern .
I like to close the front door , pull off my gloves and know that I am in my own world .
I only ever wear 1950s clothing , such as tight pencil skirts , a white blouse and a wide belt .
Kevin wears ' modern ' clothes for work , but at weekends he wears a smart suit and a trilby .
I admit I am in retreat from the 21st century .
When I look at the reality of the world today , with all the violence , greed and materialism , I shudder .
I do n't want to live in that world .
Relaxed : Joanne thinks modern life is too hectic and likes to take her time
Neither of us drinks and our social life revolves around visiting like - minded friends for tea and cakes .
I try not to interact with the modern world too much at all .
Shopping in supermarkets is an ordeal , and I only recently realised that Tony Blair is no longer Prime Minister as I do n't read newspapers - they are just too distressing .
We do have a television set , but we hide it in a retro cabinet and only watch things like Miss Marple , Poirot and Foyle 's War .
My obsession began as a teenager , when I loved old movies because they seemed to represent a halcyon time , when women were more feminine and men more protective .
Authentic : Joanne only ever wears 1950s clothing and her furniture is also from the era
I went to a grammar school and could have gone to university , but chose to work in a bank .
I was marking time until I met the right man .
Kevin and I met in 1993 at a Fifties Convention , and we had an old - fashioned courtship before he proposed .
I was ecstatic , because I had found someone with the same passion for the period .
Today 's society is all rush , rush , rush , whereas I like to take my time .
I never leave the house without lipstick on , and I also like to help neighbours - collecting their pensions and doing shopping for them , just as women in the 1950s would do .
It may sound silly , but living like this really does make me happier - as though I 'm existing in one of those old - fashioned TV shows where everything is always wonderful .
My despair at the modern world is one of the reasons why we have n't had children .
I would be terrified they would be offered drugs , or become the victims of violence .
Some women I meet ask me if I feel patronised by being a housewife and spending my time caring for Kevin , but I never would .
At work , he gets teased because he 's the only one with home - made cakes and even home - made jam in his sandwiches .
But I often wonder if his colleagues are n't slightly jealous that he has a wife who devotes herself to his happiness .
How many men these days can really say that ?
1940s
Debbie Cleulow , 34 , lives in Upper Tean in Staffordshire with her husband Martin , 38 , who works for a JCB contractor .
Debbie says :
When I see a girl walking down the street wearing next to nothing , I think : ' Why do n't you have more respect for yourself ? '
Other women may laugh at my determination to make my home perfect for my husband , Martin , but I enjoy spending my leisure time baking cakes and sewing .
Debbie Cleulow : ' I try to make my home perfect for my husband '
I really believe that women today have lost their way , with bingedrinking ladettes and children as young as 11 going out in tiny tops .
The age of innocence has been lost and it is such a shame .
My idol is Ava Gardner and when I watch her films - as I do all the time - I think that so much has been lost from today 's society .
I 've made my home a shrine to the Forties , and I only ever wear clothes from that decade .
Other people may laugh at me , but I really do n't care .
I think I have a far happier marriage than many other people I meet , because we have strict demarcations in our roles .
I do all the cleaning , ironing , washing and cooking , and Martin puts up shelves and looks after the car .
He 's the breadwinner and I create a lovely - and loving - environment for him .
I met Martin when I was 17 - we lived in the same village - and he has been my only serious boyfriend .
It 's so much more romantic only ever to have been in love with one man .
My obsession with the 1940s really began through Martin , as he was already going to Forties events when we met .
I have spent so many happy hours sourcing retro furniture and kitchen gadgets for our home , and gradually we are eradicating every trace of the modern age .
Retro : Debbie and her husband attract plebty of attention when they leave the house
We have an old black Bakelite phone , I use a retro Swan kettle and a full 1940s dinner service which my parents bought for us from an antiques centre .
I inherited our oak bedroom suite from my grandparents .
It 's stamped with the ' CC41 ' utility mark , which shows it complies with the rationing of the time .
Likewise , some of my clothes are stamped with the same mark .
I wear vintage dresses during the day , and for evenings and weekends I will dress up in the full glamour of satin evening dresses with high heels .
I would n't dream of leaving the house without gloves and a hat .
When we go out , we do attract a lot of attention and some people laugh , but I think that is their problem .
We are n't friendly with anyone who does n't share our love of the Forties .
Some people might think I am hiding my head in the sand , harking back to an age that is long gone .
But to me , the 1940s was a time when people were much more friendly to each other - they really cared about their neighbours .
As it is , I hardly know the people who live next to us .
Of course , I 'm not such a Luddite that I do n't use modern medicines and other comforts of modern life when I need to , but I find a genuine happiness in living in a time when life was simpler .
My job is to devote myself to Martin .
He has a physical , stressful job and he loves coming home to a wife who looks pretty , has his meal ready in an immaculate house and has all the time in the world for him .
1930s
Diane Rowlands , 38 , works parttime in a customer service centre .
She lives with Martin , who is 40 and works in a warehouse .
Diane says :
My love for the Thirties started with the music .
As a teenager , I loved to listen to the big band sound and I would sit entranced for hours watching films starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers .
They were so glamorous .
Back then , the world just seemed a sunnier place , even though it was an austere time between the wars .
Diane Rowlands : ' Ideally , I ’d spend all day in my pinny '
Women were these amazingly glamorous creatures , with their perfect hair and immaculate makeup , and they were treated with such respect by men .
Men and women knew their roles in society and there was n't all this pressure on women to have to go out to work and try to be equal to men .
I do work part - time , but only because we need the money .
However , we still have clearly defined roles in the home and I am the one who does most of the cooking and cleaning .
I adore baking cakes and if I had my way I would spend all of my days in my pinny , making my house look immaculate .
Martin and I spend hours sourcing clothes from the 1930s and I am always dressed in period costume .
I usually spend around £ 50 to £ 150 per item .
I buy them from the internet and vintage clothing specialists , and I have wardrobes full of wonderful old clothes and items such as cloche hats and Mary - Jane shoes with T - bar straps .
At first I was a bit dubious about going out dressed in Thirties clothing , but I am totally used to it now .
Anyone for tea ?
Diane spends hours on the internet sourcing items for her 1930s lifestyle
Comments from strangers can be pretty bitchy , though , because people just do n't like anything that 's out of the ordinary .
The Thirties was a much more moral time and there was a real camaraderie between people .
I try to escape from where we are now and rarely read newspapers because I find today 's world so depressing .
The pace of life today is so hectic and I think there is so much pressure on women to be like men .
It is all wrong .
I love to wear dresses and skirts , look immaculate and be treated like a lady .
My home is entirely decorated with 1930s furniture , wallpaper , carpets and ornaments .
Retreating to this world is our sanctuary .

Inspired by the use of microarray chips that look for gene combinations , psychologists are using " pattern array " software to spot movements in rats that might help them predict diseases such as Lou Gehrig 's syndrome .
A report in the August issue of Behavioral Neuroscience , published by the American Psychological Association , describes how this novel use of data mining may enable investigators to test therapies to delay or even prevent disease , starting with hereditary forms .
The authors demonstrated their original software on mutant rats used as an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that 's inherited about one in 10 times .
( The origins of the other cases are still under investigation . )
The disease , which attacks the nerve cells that control movement , is identified with Yankee slugger Lou Gehrig , who died of ALS in 1941 , two years after diagnosis .
Researchers led by Neri Kafkafi , PhD , of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center , part of the University of Maryland 's School of Medicine , mathematically analyzed about 50,000 predetermined movement patterns that resulted when rats roamed freely , one by one , in a small arena .
The software created an abstract space defined by combinations of behavior such as speed , acceleration and direction of movement .
Mining the resulting behavioral data enabled researchers to test many more facets of behavior than they could analyze manually .
After videotaping the movement of two groups of rats – one type with the mutation that results in an ALS - type syndrome , the other type normal controls -- the scientists used the computer to " pan " for differences between groups and identified a unique motor pattern in mutant rats two months before disease onset ( which would equate to roughly five to 10 years in humans ) .
Of the multitude of behavior patterns analyzed , the predefined " heavily braking while slightly turning away from the wall " showed a group difference .
In two independent data sets , rats with the ALS - type mutation were significantly less likely than controls to brake and turn from the arena wall as they approached .
Normal rats used that behavior for about 1.8 percent of their total movement time ; the mutants for 1.2 percent .
" This is a very subtle difference but it is significant , " says Kafkafi , who explains that the very subtlety underscores how hard it would be to tell the rats apart using the naked eye .
" Persons with emerging ALS may also have similarly subtle symptoms . "
" We can only guess why this pattern is less common in the mutants , " Kafkafi adds .
Losing the nerve cells that control leg muscles could result in problems with braking .
The team is working with mechanical engineers to learn more about the meaning of the other movements .
Data mining to detect the subtle behavioral expression of mutations could conceivably allow investigators to test therapies aimed at preventing , slowing or stopping disease .
By being able to predict more accurately which carriers may express the disease before they experience symptoms ( the " premorbid " state ) , researchers could test medicines that might prevent symptoms from emerging .
Kafkafi says , " Such therapies could very well be effective against the non-genetic version of the disease as well . "
Methods such as data mining can be therapeutically useful even before science understands how disease begins .
The authors wrote , " The discovery of reliable behavioral endpoints with predictive validity , even before a good understanding of their etiology is achieved , can significantly improve intervention research . "

Purdue scientists have released a high - resolution map of American per-capita carbon dioxide emissions to Wired.com .
It shows the amount of carbon dioxide produced in 100 square kilometer regions of the United States divided by the number of residents in that area .
You can download the full eight megabyte ultra-high - resolution file here .
The work provides unprecedented resolution into U.S. greenhouse gas emissions .
After all , a single large city like Houston can sprawl over 1,500 square kilometers .
It comes as President Bush , in a major policy reversal , prepares to announce a new plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions that critics say is not likely to go far enough in curbing greenhouse gases .
The new map follows a visualization released last week , which plotted total carbon emissions in 100 square kilometer chunks , and which some complained looked too much like a population density map .
It was generated by The Vulcan Project , led by Kevin Gurney , after Wired.com readers asked for it , following our widely - read story , " Scientists Unveil High - Res Map of U.S. Carbon Footprint . "
We went back to Gurney with that feedback and he was kind enough to put it together .
For comparison 's sake , you can find the original Vulcan Project map below .
There 's a lot of information you could mine from these maps , but one thing stood out to me : the West , for all of our hippie do - gooders , is n't doing well ( as a whole ) from a per-capita emissions perspective .
We simply do n't live in dense enough situations to benefit from the efficiency gains created by urban living .
Lots of infrastructure serving only a few people generates high per-capita emissions .
( I wonder how much better the per-capita footprints of California and Texas would look if the millions of undocumented immigrants living in those states were included in those areas ' populations . )

HP is now offering desktop PCs with virtual web browsers .
Today , the hardware maker unleashed the HP Compaq dc7900 , a business desktop with a version of Firefox that is n't really there .
Developed in tandem with Symantec , the Firefox for HP Virtual Solutions browser operates in a runtime netherworld that 's separate from the rest of the machine .
This means that when malware attacks , the machine itself is unharmed .
" [ This virtual Firefox browser ] ensures that employees can utilize the World Wide Web productively , while keeping business PCs stable and easier to support , " writes Symantec technical product manager Scott Jones .
" Changes made to a PC while surfing the Web are contained in a ' virtual layer ' and do not permanently alter the machine . "
Basically , the browser sits in a " sandbox " cooked up by Symantec 's Software Virtualization Solution ( SVS ) , a tool the company acquired with its purchase of Altiris .
Scott Jones did not return our calls seeking additional info , but in the bloggy thing he posted today , he points out that if anything goes wrong , SVS lets you instantly restore the browser to its original setup - without hosing your user settings .
Symtanec sees this as a turning point in the history of nonexistent software apps - as opposed to nonexistent OSes .
" This is a key milestone event in the evolution of application virtualization as a concept , " read a canned statement from Ken Berryman , Symantec VP of Endpoint Virtualization .
" Application virtualization is no longer an emerging technology .
It has arrived .
Application virtualization is now mainstream . "
Unlike VMware or Microsoft's Virtual PC , SVS does n't virtualize an entire OS .
It virtualizes individual applications , installing them in packages that remain separate from a machine 's registry .
This means apps can be reset or removed without wreaking some sort of havoc with the rest of the system . ®

One could argue that the miniaturization of classic game consoles into a portable device is kind of silly in this day and age .
With the continual re-releases of older titles and [ cough ] emulation , lugging around Super Nintendo cartridges seems like a bit of a hassle .
Seeing the " portablization " of a Super Nintendo by BenHeck.com forum member Life of Brian has completely changed my mind .
He says this is his third mini-SNES overall ; this one was built on commission .
I wonder how much he charges .
This thing is beautiful .
After being wowed by his completion post , I checked out his construction forum thread .
It blew my mind !
I had no idea how much work went into making one of these .
On this new portable , the SNES cartridge sits flush with the top and back , unlike its predecessor .
The new one is a sleek white little number , with original SNES controller buttons and internal batteries .
There 's also a headphone port and A/V jacks .
You can't emulate this stuff !
Be sure to check out this image of an upcoming newer model , which is even smaller in size .
I would gladly pay for one of these .
What about you ?

Google Drive for Mac / PC will be gone soon .
Soon you will get message notifications that will announce you about the upcoming end of Google Drive .
Starting December 11 , these apps will slowly be eliminated and in March 2018 they will be gone for good .
Google Backup and Sync will take their place
The death of the Google Drive apps may sound serious and you are probably a bit worried , but you do not have to .
While these apps will disappear , Google will release a brand new app that will take their place .
The new app is named Google Backup and Sync and you can use it for both photos and files instead of having to use two different apps .
With the upcoming app you can sync what you want from USB keys , PC folders and SD cards .
Additionally , Google Backup and Sync will improve PC backups , making them a process that is more automated .
Drive File Stream will be the new Google Drive for companies
If you own a business or you work for a company you have to know that Google also prepared something for you .
An application called Drive File Stream will be ideal for a company .
Also , this app is better for teamwork and you can use it to access Team Drives or to stream files on demand .
Besides these special features , Drive File Stream can do anything that Backup and Sync can do , you it is very convenient for your business .
Drive File Stream appeared back in March , but it was not available for everyone .
The application had a limited release and only a few users were able to get it .
However , now it is available for everyone so you can already move you files .
What does the world know anyway ?
US - led efforts to tackle the al - Qaeda group are not regarded as successful , an opinion poll carried out for the BBC World Service suggests .
Some 29 % of people said the “ war on terror ” launched by President George W Bush in 2001 had had no effect on the Islamist militant network .
According to 30 % of those surveyed , US policies have strengthened al - Qaeda .
The most commonly held view of al - Qaeda in the 23 nations polled was a negative one – except in Egypt and Pakistan .
Asked who is winning “ the conflict between al - Qaeda and the US ” , 49 % said neither side while 22 % believed the US had gained the upper hand .
Just 10 % said al - Qaeda was winning .
You might have read that for some reason 250 journalists are headed to San Francisco today for an amazing , ‘ earth shattering ’ announcement .
Well , we were n’t invited , but that ’s OK , because we reckon it ’s just the Knights of the Old Republic MMO that ’s been rumoured for ages .
Gamespot , ActionTrip , and DigitalBattle seem to think so too .
All 250 journalists will be manically scrambling to upload screenshots and press releases at 2 pm today , so keep an eye on the internet ( 1UP are live blogging it ) if this is your thing .

The Ford Motor Company , which devoted itself for nearly 20 years to putting millions of Americans into big pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles , is about to drastically alter its focus to building more small cars .
The struggling automaker , reacting to what it sees as a rapid and permanent shift in consumer tastes brought on by high gas prices , plans to unveil its new direction on Thursday , when it will report quarterly earnings .
Among the changes , Ford is expected to announce that it will convert three of its North American assembly plants from trucks to cars , according to people familiar with the plans .
And as part of the huge bet it is placing on the future direction of the troubled American auto industry , Ford will realign factories to manufacture more fuel - efficient engines and produce six of its next European car models for the United States market .

There seems to be an unspoken rule in politics that the Republicans have broken at least a couple of times over the course of the Bush Administration – do n’t create precedents and new powers that you do n’t want used against you when you next fall out of power .
The failed idea of a permanent GOP majority was probably the reason for the Republicans ’ crossing of this particular line , but nonetheless it ’s useful to remind all politicians every once in a while that you really do n’t want to give your ideological opponents tools they can use against you .
This morning I stumbled across a blog post Paul Krugmam made to his Conscience of a Liberal NYTimes blog on Tuesday .
In it he says that he ’s been pointing out to liberals that Paulson ’s dictatorial powers could well fall to Phil Gramm , John McCain ’s unofficial economic adviser , in a little over four months .
In case you do n’t know why this should be downright terrifying , Phil Gramm was responsible for the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act of 1999 that eliminated Depression - era laws requiring that banking , insurance , and brokerage activities be kept separate .
In other words , it ’s some of Phil Gramm ’s work in the Senate that ’s responsible for today ’s financial meltdown .
Krugman also pointed that , were Obama to win , he could come up with an liberal economic name to run the Treasury that would scare the hell out of Republicans – “ Paul Krugman . ”
I can think of many far worse names to head up the Treasury Department .
Henry Paulson comes immediately to mind .

According to a Bloomberg analysis , John McCain ’s plan to revive the U.S. nuclear power industry with 45 new reactors may cost $ 315 billion , with taxpayers bearing much of the financial risk .
The Republican presidential nominee expects a 29 % increase in electricity demand by 2030 , and wants 45 new nuclear power plants built by then .
Industry estimates put their cost at $ 7 billion each .
The Energy Information Administration estimated last year that adding nuclear power capacity would cost $ 2,143 a kilowatt ( kW ) before financing and inflation .
That compared with $ 1,434 to $ 2,302 for clean - coal technologies .
Over the past year , the expense has more than doubled to $ 5,000 a kilowatt , or $ 7 billion for a typical reactor , utility filings and company statements show .
The increase in part reflects rising prices for commodities such as steel and cement .
In comparison , modern wind turbine generators cost between $ 1500 and $ 2000 per kW for wind farms that use multiple - unit arrays of large machines .
Smaller individual units cost up to $ 3000 per kW .
It ’s projected that by 2015 , concentrated solar ( a.k.a. solar thermal ) plants could produce baseload power at approximately $ 3000 per kW as well .
Taxpayers are on the hook for most of the nuclear bill if borrowers default .
A 2003 Congressional Budget Office report said that the default rate on nuclear construction debts might be as high as 50 % , in part because of the project ’s high cost .
In short , such defaults could potentially cost taxpayers $ 100 billion .
Senator McCain ’s primary solutions to the United States ’ energy problems are increased nuclear production and offshore drilling .
He has expressed little confidence or interest in pursuing renewable energy , having said
“ When you say wind solar and tide , most every expert that I know says that , if you maximize that in every possible way , the contribution that that would make given the present state of technology is very small , is very small … the truly clean technologies do n’t work . ”
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has expressed support for nuclear energy , but believes a comprehensive plan including renewable energy and potentially clean coal technology .
“ It is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option , ” his energy plan states .
“ However , before an expansion of nuclear power is considered , key issues must be addressed , including security of nuclear fuel and waste , waste storage and proliferation . ”

Japan ’s Queen Chateau Soapland is at once a grand but squalid folly ; a ruin rising 5 fairy - tale stories into the sky , cornered with towers and capped with bright red tile , representing an era gone mad with indulgence , audacity , and hopefulness .
Flanked by bamboo forests .
A soapland is a kind of Japanese water - brothel , wherein customers ( men , basically ) go to a bedroom equipped with a bath and shower , possibly also bed , and engage in various sexual activities .
Soaplands seem to exist in Japan in a curiously open fashion , flaunting the law with their obvious but veiled allusions to the services available inside .
Prostitution is illegal - but they get away with it by simply stating something like “ the girl is paid for a massage , but if she wants to do something more , that ’s hardly our business , is it ? ”
Roof - tiles crumble while the Queen ’s face sags .
The Queen Chateau was a mega - soapland , abandoned over 10 years ago , was plainly intentioned as a competition - killer of all the other little soaplands in the area .
I could n’t find out much about it through online research - and suspect its founder companies were as criminally borderline as its purpose , probably yakuza , and so unlikely to leave much by way of records .
Down on the trashed central lobby .
Not welcoming in any language .
Now the Queen Chateau lies in crippled ruin , its bright colors fading , its halycon days of glamor and glitz surplanted by ghost - like hangings in its dim and dusty bars .
Its grand playing - card Queen still stands emblazoned across the front of the building , but her stare is now more that of the toothless Ozymandius than a haughty mademoiselle .
Toothless playing - card Queen .
Now the area around it is still filled with smaller less consolidated soaplands .
Clearly the area is able to draw a large clientele , something like a two or three block red light district .
It was odd to wander through in the middle of the day , and even odder once inside the haikyo itself .
Across the main fountain - to the client stairs heading up .
I was n’t alone on this haikyo - I went with Su Young , for whom the experience was probably more powerful than for me .
We entered from round the back , through a small bamboo forest , past a series of large vats and pipes - presumably for storing heated bath - water , then into complete darkness through the girls service entrance .
The first room was a cramped kitchen , adjacent to a tightly packed - in bedroom filled with about 6 bunk - beds , room for 12 girls at once .
Beyond that was a small dining room and bathroom .
I do n’t know for sure , but surmised that some if not all of the girls actually lived there full - time , sleeping , eating and working within the buildings claustrophobic innards .
This led me to wonder about the nationality of the girls , their visa status , and their legitimacy within the country .
Were any of them sexual indentured servants / slaves ?
It was strange to walk through there , seeing here a slip of a gown , there a tiny high - heeled shoe .
What kind of sad lives passed through here , or were forced to pass through here ?
Seeing some of the clothing and shoes hit Su Young pretty hard , particularly the small size of the shoes .
How old were these girls ?
How able were they to look after themselves ?
Of course , I ’m only guessing and judging them to be victims .
It ’s possible they were all empowered women , there by choice and not financial dire straits , making good money and only sleeping over if the last train had already gone .
Somehow I doubt that though .
Crumbling concrete service corridor .
The girls small wing led through a raw concrete passage and through a ragged curtain into the spacious red-carpeted lobby , where a large and complex chandelier once hung , judging from its spiky metal remnants in the defunct fountain - place below .
A mural stood behind the fountain , the first sight greeting men as they entered the large double - doors , of 3 full - figured naked women , now dotted over with crude grafitti .
Crude graffiti anoints everything .
Ladies and the fountain filled with metal chandelier shards .
Paper trash and bits of broken furniture lay strewn across the floor .
In the concierge ’s small office there were small limey stalactites and stalagmites forming .
On the wall by the stairs up to the rooms was the Japanese graffiti - “ If you go upstairs you will die . ”
The girls ’ view as the johns came up the stairs .
Behind the mural facade were 3 dim bars , each of which was hung with ghost - like white sheets .
I ventured in and discovered these were the light - fixtures come loose and hanging by the wires , having brought the white wall - paper from the ceiling down with them in shrouds .
It was otherworldly to walk between them , something the photographs only slightly capture .
Creepy ghost - like sheets .
Up the stairs , we began entering the sento bedrooms .
They all followed the same plan , a simple bed and mini-bar , marble bath , small windows , steam - chair , and bright tile pattern on the wall .
We entered a good number of them , took larking - around photos in the bath of a few , but any high - jinks were somewhat dampened by the memory of what these places had been used for , all of it tinged by the possibility that it might have involved bad exploitation .
A plastic steam chair , within which one person can be fully enclosed , like an iron maiden .
Bland red-mosaic bath .
Brightened up by flash .
Another vivid mural .
On the roof we passed through a machine - room and up a rung - ladder to the very top .
Su Young climbed up the white water - tower 7 stories up and completely exposed while I ducked and weaved between the towers afraid of being spotted from the ground .
I joined her briefly but the extreme height and vulnerability of that windy position , with soapland teamsters on the streets below pointing up at us , soon forced us both down and back into the building .
Here ’s the video -
After that it was the usual movement back through the haikyo , snapping final photos and taking the full measure of the place and its atmosphere , then rolling out and heading home .

Years ago , the desktop dominated the PC market .
It not only provided users with unequaled power , it proved to be a far more suitable machine than its notebook counterpart , which suffered from a short battery life and a prohibitive price tag .
But in the last few years , the industry dynamics have changed and notebooks have quickly pushed desktops aside and become the focus of consumer and vendor attention .
And although desktops will still persist , they will soon only appeal to a niche market that 's looking for a specialized device to perform specialized tasks .
2007 was undoubtedly the " Year of the Notebook . "
According to analysts , laptop shipments rose 21 percent to a total of 31.6 million units , while desktops sales dropped 4 percent to a total of 35 million units .
IDC believes that 2008 will be the first year that notebook sales will exceed desktop sales and by 2011 , it expects laptops to represent 66 percent of corporate purchases , with 71 percent of consumers picking a notebook instead of a tower .
" Notebook purchases are driving consumers beyond one PC per household to one PC per person and manufacturers are reacting by focusing their attention on customization and personalization , " said Bob O'Donnell , IDC 's vice president of Clients and Displays .
" The ability to see and touch these devices in the retail environment and pick one out that matches a consumer 's unique style is a critical part of the buying process for consumers . "
But the intrinsic value of notebooks goes far beyond touching them .
Aside from the obvious — mobility , greater power , and competitive prices — notebooks provide a number of benefits that not only make them an attractive purchase for any consumer , but also make them a far better choice than desktops .
The corporate world
In today 's corporate environment , mobility is one of the most important aspects of running a business .
According to Business Travel News Magazine , business travel is at its highest level ever , and more than 300,000 organizations in the United States alone claim to have " significant business travel expenses . "
The enterprise is a major contributing factor to the notebook 's rise in popularity and one of the main reasons why desktops have become obsolete .
Businesses are finding fewer reasons to acquire desktops , and as employees continue to work outside the office , organizations find that notebooks are a driving factor behind higher ROI .
Employee utilization is also increased and organizations are quickly finding that businesspeople are working on notebooks when they otherwise would not be working at all if they had desktops .
Mobile broadband
Mobility is a key factor in the supremacy of notebooks , but only recently was its true potential harnessed with the widespread adoption of mobile broadband .
Granted , it 's not found in too many areas in the United States — it mostly hugs big cities — but mobile broadband services are helping businesspeople and consumers stay connected to the Web in places where there is n't a WiFi or wired connection .
Over the next few years , adoption rates will increase as mobile broadband becomes more ubiquitous .
The merger of Xohm and Clearwire could be a major first step in accelerating the availability of mobile broadband and keeping users connected in a world that 's requiring greater access to the cloud and network resources .
And once again , the desktop is n't included in that equation .
The enterprise and consumers are demanding Web connectivity wherever they go and mobile companies are delivering .
All the while , desktops stay wired to the router at home and offer no opportunity for mobility .
It 's all about the looks
Technology is quickly becoming an extension of who you are .
Years ago , we were forced to look at beige towers , and most manufacturers realized that design was n't a necessity for consumers .
But today , all that has changed and design has quickly become a key component in the success or failure of notebooks .
Apple 's notebooks are sleek and elegant .
Falcon Northwest offers customizable designs that add your personality to the notebook .
Even HP and Dell — two of the biggest culprits of bad design — are getting in on the act and offering devices that are better looking .
Much like cell phones , notebooks have become a status symbol and an extension of one 's personality , while desktops typically are not .
Laptops come with us wherever we go and the public sees them all times , while desktops sit beneath the desk and their design rarely reflects well or poorly on us .
Working on a MacBook Pro at Starbucks says something about who we are ; a Mac Pro sitting beneath the desk at home does n't say anything .
It may sound simplistic , but technology is a part of who we are now and desktops simply do n't tell that story .
Life 's accessory
On a more sociological level , consider the fact that technology has become an integral extension of our lives .
Almost everywhere we go , someone ( maybe us ) is furiously typing out a text message on a BlackBerry or inputting important data into countless mobile devices that aim to bring our lives on the road .
And laptops are no different .
Like a cell phone on steroids , laptops can bring our lives with us wherever we go .
Instead of leaving sensitive business data or even our shopping list on the desktop at home , notebooks allow us to have that information with us at all times .
And , in the process , we connect personally to our notebook , much like we do with our cell phone , in a way that we never could with a desktop .
Notebooks have become a living accessory that comes along with us wherever we go and houses our digital life , making it a far more important and desired product than the desktop sitting at home , waiting to be turned on .
Computing power
One of the biggest issues facing notebooks in the past was their lack of power .
For years , we were forced to use notebooks that were n't nearly as capable as their desktop counterparts .
Unless we wanted to simply surf the Web , check e-mail , and write up some documents , all the resource - intensive work was saved for the desktop .
But in recent years , notebooks have matched most desktops , and it 's becoming much easier to find a desktop replacement from every major vendor that easily outpaces all but the more advanced towers .
Just three years ago , the concept of a desktop replacement was a pipe dream .
Back then , the super - hot components running desktops were incapable of running in notebooks , while the industry was failing to address battery issues that plagued them and made them less - than ideal desktop replacements .
But with the availability of Intel 's Core Duo and Core 2 Duo chips , all that changed .
Power conservation became a key element in the newest generation of processor technology and that shrank the difference between desktop and laptop processors .
Now , the key differentiator between laptops and desktops is the number of cores and , for most uses , that does n't have a big impact on performance .
Unless more software is made that leverages multiple processing cores , desktops will lose the major advantage they have relied upon to stay relevant .
Price
Given all that flexibility and the notebook 's other appealing attributes like lower power consumption and mobility , it should be far more expensive than a desktop , right ?
Think again .
According to NPD 's pricing figures from June 2008 , the average Windows desktop PC costs $ 550 — $ 2 more expensive than it cost last year — while the average Windows notebook costs just $ 700 .
That 's a $ 92 drop since last year and a whopping $ 177 decline since 2006 .
For just $ 150 more , notebook owners are getting a product that goes above and beyond the functionality already being offered by desktops .
Can you bring your desktop to Starbucks ?
Nope .
Can you use that desktop on the plane ride home ?
Not a chance .
Can you use your desktop to sit in the car , edit video , and burn that movie to a DVD when you 're finished ?
No way .
In essence , notebooks can now do more than a desktop for a price that 's no longer prohibitive , and customers are quickly finding that out .
But one of the main reasons why notebook pricing came down was the commoditization of the technology industry that sees most companies offering the same basic components in a given device class .
And each chip that 's being installed into laptops today also combines functions , making the total unit costs drop significantly and helping to bring notebook price points to a more attractive level .
As a result , notebook prices are dropping significantly and could shortly hit the same average price point as desktops .
Once that happens , the only differentiating factors desktops can cling to will undoubtedly only appeal to a small portion of the worldwide consumer base .
Sticking points
For all of its benefits , the laptop does n't lead desktops on every attribute .
For starters , desktops still provide users with the customizability notebooks simply do n't .
If they 're looking to install a new graphics card or build a new rig from scratch , they can't do that with notebooks .
As powerful as they may be , notebooks still do n't stack up to advanced towers like Apple 's Mac Pro , which makes them less ideal for those needing extremely high performance to edit and encode video .
Lastly , mobility is n't ideal for everyone ; for example , at medical practices , few people really want their personal history walking around in the hands of a doctor or nurse .
Those instances may make desktops relevant to some but , considering the fact that few people are willing to build their own computers , and still others do n't need to worry about heavy video editing , desktops are clinging to benefits that do n't necessarily impact the vast majority of users .
Desktops were once the most practical way to work and perform tasks , but now , they 're nothing more than machines that provide only a handful of benefits that the majority of people simply do n't care about .
While the death of desktops may not yet be upon us , the inertia of the industry and our own buying preferences make it abundantly clear that its days are numbered and it simply does n't offer what the many of us are looking for in a computer any longer .
Everyone remembers the scene in " Who 's The Boss " when Tony is playing for his Softball team and tries to leap over the catcher at home plate , right ?
Well Tony Danza was actually tagged out on the play , and while many others have succeed in the " catcher leap " , I do n't think I 've ever seen this move before .
We shall call it the " Oops , I missed home plate , but la la la .... GOT YOU ! " move ....
That was Durham Bulls Center Fielder Fernando Perez and that 's about the slickest move I 've ever seen .
It 's like the anti-Pierzynski .
I know it has nothing to do with announcing , but I had n't seen it anywhere else , and I thought you 'd enjoy it .
CCIA , CCTEC answering federal subpoenas
Federal investigators are collecting five years worth of documents from Cumberland County 's Improvement Authority and its vocational school district .
Every so often , there is one crazy story that is related to video games and can really make someone scratch his head in confusement .
One of the latest examples comes from a young man named Yang , who conspired with two other men to fake his own kidnapping .
Police captured the two “ kidnapers ” after the 10,000 yuan ransom was taken from an ATM machine .
Yang later admitted that he was hoping he would be able to extort money from his parents , as they were refusing to purchase a “ Nintendo computer ” for him .
I assume that the “ Nintendo computer ” is referring to the Wii , unless Yang was actually looking for a Famicom !

Maciej Stachowiak of the WebKit team has announced that the browser engine behind Safari is the first to fully pass the Acid3 test , including the test 's condition of smooth animation rendering .
Acid3 is a test page from the Web Standards Project that scores how well a rendering engine follows defined web standards , particularly DOM and JavaScript .
The test provided a metric for standards compliance that has resulted in rapid advancement among various rendering engines as each works to earn the top score .
In March , both Safari's WebKit and Opera 's Presto announced earning a 100 % score in developer builds of their browser .
In addition to the numbered score , the test also requires the browser render a test page with pixel perfect accuracy using its default settings and that it render a smooth test animation .
Today , the development build of WebKit passed that last hurdle , which Stachowiak reported was due to " recent speedups in JavaScript , DOM and rendering . "
Actual shipping builds of the world 's various web browsers have n't yet reached 100 % .
According to figures in Wikipedia , the latest Safari 3.1.2 has a score of 75 , while Firefox 3.0.2 has reached 71 , Opera 9.52 has reached 84 , and Internet Explorer 7 is at 14 .
In internal builds , the Safari 4.0 Developer Preview has reached 100 , while the latest build of Firefox Gecko engine has reached 87 , the latest build of Opera earns 99 , Google 's new Chrome beta has reached 79 , and the Internet Explorer 8 Beta 2 scores 21 .
A Canadian record exec has changed his name in order to get off the TSA 's no -fly list : he had his identity stolen and ended up spending one to six hours being questioned every time he boarded a plane :
" I was pulled aside in a room … and you have to wait your turn to finally be released , " Labbé said .
" An hour , an hour and a half , two hours , whatever it is after .
Once I was caught in Miami like that for six hours .
" It 's always the same questions , about if I 've lost my passport , if I 've been to Japan – I do n't know why Japan , but in their file it was something to do with Japan . "
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security wrote a letter to Labbé in 2004 , saying he had been placed on their watch list after falling victim to identity theft .
At the time , the department said there was no way for his name to be removed .
Although Labbé wrote letters to the U.S. department , his efforts were in vain , prompting him to legally change his name .
" So now , my official name is François Mario Labbé , " he said .
" Then you have to change everything : driver 's license , social insurance , medicare , credit card – everything . "
Although it 's not a big change from Mario Labbé , he said it 's been enough to foil the U.S. customs computers .
In this post , I have tried to bring together some of the impacts of the credit crunch on the energy industry that are already being felt .
If you are seeing other impacts , please make note of them in the comments .
The credit crunch is already having an impact on energy markets .
New projects are harder to fund .
Highly leveraged companies are sometimes finding it necessary to shed assets .
Some players are finding themselves to be the indirect casualties of other players , like Lehman , that have already failed .
Long term , we will probably see consolidation and lower production than would have been the case without the credit crunch .
Of course , if there is a major recession , it is possible that we wo n't need as high production .
One article seems to suggest that speculators are being driven away from the oil and gas industry , and that more care is being taken with counter - party risk :
Credit crunch slows oil trading
The OTC markets in oil have not seized up because of credit issues , but liquidity is lower and participants are treading more carefully .
Platts , a unit of the McGraw - Hill Cos. and which provides price assessments in physical oil markets , says derivatives trading , but not physical deals , is slowing down .
" The number of trades and the length of a trading chain are likely to be reduced because of the problems banks are having , " said Jorge Montepeque , Platts global director of market reports .
" But the physical oil markets are carrying on because oil has to be moved from producers to consumers .
They said credit worries were also spurring a shift to clear over - the - counter ( OTC ) oil trades , such as price swaps , on NYMEX Clearport , which offers clearing for some OTC derivatives .
. .
" People are worried about counterparty risk , so if you do n't clear your OTC deal you are simply relying on your counterparty to perform , " said Bellew .
More marginal production seems already to be getting squeezed :
Credit crisis squeezing western juniors
For Canada 's junior oil and gas companies , the credit crunch comes on top of a helter - skelter commodity price drop that has hit company valuations hard .
As a result , new exploration activity now seems more fraught with risk , especially as Alberta is set to implement a new royalty regime in January that will erode profit margins .
" There 's no doubt there 's not enough capital around in the market , " said Kel Johnston , chief executive officer of Alberta Clipper Inc. , a Calgary - based junior oil and gas firm .
" I ca n't see anything other than [ drilling ] levels dropping off , especially in Alberta . "
Newer projects are getting squeezed , especially IPOs .
Russian IPOs fall dramatically amid credit crisis
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Capital raised through initial public offerings in the third quarter by companies from Russia and the former Soviet Union fell to the lowest level since 2004 , as the global credit crisis took its toll , the PBN Company said Thursday .
Forty - three companies from the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) have postponed or pulled their flotations this year , said PBN , a consultancy with a focus on Russia and the CIS .
The CIS consists of former Soviet republics , such as Russia , Ukraine , Belarus , Azerbaijan , Armenia , and Kazakhstan , among others .
The credit crisis is providing buying opportunities for the more cash - rich .
The recent decline in prices is forcing the more highly leveraged companies to put properties up for sale , and this is putting downward pressure on sale prices of assets .
Cash - Rich Oil Firms Snap Up Assets
The turmoil on Wall Street is reshaping the U.S. oil industry , forcing debt - laden smaller producers to sell assets and creating opportunities for larger , cash - rich companies that until recently had been criticized by investors for spending too conservatively .
The latest example : Occidental Petroleum Corp. , one of the largest independent oil producers , Thursday snapped up the 50 % interest it did n't already own in oil and gas fields in Texas and the Rocky Mountains from smaller company Plains Exploration & Production Co .
The $ 1.25 billion price tag was nearly 20 % less than the $ 1.55 billion Occidental paid less than a year ago for the first half of the assets .
Another credit related sale was the purchase of Constellation Energy by Warren Buffet 's Warren Buffet 's Mid-American Energy Holdings .
About this we read :
Constellation in Quick Deal With Buffett
Constellation 's shares had fallen 70 percent since July 31 as investor concerns increased over the liquidity needs of the company 's energy - trading business , which was growing until this year .
That business relies heavily on financing that has all but disappeared with the turmoil in the financial markets .
Investor and lender confidence was damaged by chief executive Mayo A. Shattuck III 's August disclosure that Constellation had dramatically underestimated the collateral it would need to put up if its credit rating were downgraded .
Then late last month , the company took several steps to raise capital , selling off some natural gas reserves .
That appears to have been too little , too late .
Then there are the indirect problems , coming from the failures of other organizations .
For example , the state of Georgia formed the Georgia Municipal Gas Authority in 1987 , to help communities get better prices in natural gas .
This authority formed Main Street gas corporation , to enter into prepaid gas contracts on behalf of communities .
These contracts were entered into with Lehman Brothers , J. P. Morgan , and Merrill Lynch .
Now Lehman has defaulted on its contracts , and Main Street and the communities it represents will need to go looking for more natural gas , probably at higher prices .
Tax exempt bonds were used to purchase this gas which has " gone missing " .
One hopes the contracts with J. P. Morgan and Merrill Lynch will hold up better .
Lehman failure leaves natural gas supplier searching
Main Street , an affiliate of the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia , lost a $ 709 million , 30 - year gas supply contract .
The contract was with a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers , the investment bank which collapsed last week .
Main Street now has to find new gas to replace the low - priced supplies that Lehman was supposed to deliver in Georgia and Florida .
The new gas will almost certainly cost more .
We also have the next layer , a gas marketer , failing as well .
In Thursday 's Atlanta Journal Constitution , we read :
Catalyst Energy Files for Bankruptcy
De Aguero said his company ’s bankruptcy stems directly from the meltdown on Wall Street .
“ We are all aware of what ’s happening with the macro economy , ” he said .
“ And it ’s gone down into the midmarket and now Main Street . ”
“ It ’s very common .
It ’s going on all over the country right now . ”
Catalyst ’s credit line and gas supply contracts were both with Constellation Energy , the nation ’s largest independent energy marketer .
Constellation was a trading partner of Lehman Brothers .
Its stock price collapsed after Lehman Brothers ’ demise two weeks ago .
Constellation announced it was selling itself to Warren Buffett ’s Mid American Holdings for a cheap discount a few days later .
Constellation cut off Catalyst late last week , leaving the marketer scrambling for credit in a market that is n’t giving any .
“ The illiquid credit markets have exacerbated the issue , ” de Aguero said .
The credit crisis can expect to cut back in investment in alternatives .
Where an investment is made , it is likely to be made by the larger , better funded organizations .
Credit Crisis May Delay Biofuels Development
LONDON , Sept 29 ( Reuters ) - A global pull - back from bank lending may dent the commercialisation of biofuel technologies to replace conventional gasoline , said the chief executive of U.S. cellulosic ethanol firm BlueFire Ethanol .
A credit crisis which claimed more bank victims on Monday has raised project finance costs and made ambitious targets to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources look less achievable .
. .
The credit crisis could slow that transition both through more costly finance and by diverting subsidies from renewables , which are often more expensive than conventional fossil fuels .
Credit Crisis Could Lead to Consolidation in Renewables Industry
A clamp down on the credit market will make it difficult for renewable energy developers to finance new projects , putting utility companies in a strong position to increase their share of the renewables pie , according to a Reuters report .
Utilities have large supplies of cash , and even if they have to borrow , they can do so more cheaply as government - regulated businesses , an analyst at Raymond James & Associates notes .
" The big projects being built by big utilities do n't need to borrow from banks for short - term loans , " said JP Morgan analyst Chris Rogers .
" But if banks do n't lend to each other they certainly wo n't lend to small project start - ups . "
Let us know what you are seeing as well .
By Daniel Mitchell - October 1 , 2008
The proposed bailout of the financial system is a misguided scheme that will hurt the U.S. economy in the short run and long run .
The economy currently is stumbling as a consequence of a government - created housing bubble , but a bailout of companies , executives , and shareholders that made unwise decisions would , at best , extend the economy 's adjustment process .
More likely , the bailout would impose considerable additional economic damage because political factors would at least partially supplant market forces in determining the allocation of resources .
Some politicians and government officials are making reckless charges of greater financial turmoil in the absence of a bailout .
These grossly irresponsible statements may cause short - term market losses as investors try to second - guess how other investors will respond , but the assertion that the stock market 's health - especially in the long run - depends on bigger government is belied by real - world evidence .
Japanese politicians made many of the same mistakes in the 1990s that American politicians today are considering , and the Nikkei suffered a lengthy period of decline - and remains today far below its peak level .
Proponents of a bailout also are trying to rattle credit markets by arguing that inaction will cripple commercial and household lending .
Fortunately , there is little evidence of a freeze in credit markets , thought the Administration 's rash rhetoric and the specter of a bailout doubtlessly are causing needless uncertainty and temporarily higher interest rates .
Once the issue is resolved , one way or the other , credit markets will resume normal operations .
The only question is whether capital allocation will be distorted - and long - run growth hindered - by government intervention .
Providing government with enormous - and opaque - new powers is likely to exacerbate economic uncertainty and increase system - wide risk .
There is no need to incur this additional risk when the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have been able to deal with several major institution insolvencies ( Washington Mutual , Wachovia , Bear - Stearns , Lehman Brothers , and AIG ) with existing authority .
Why the Bailout is Bad for America
• The bailout is bad for the economy .
The unfortunate truth is that bad government policy has resulted in excess investment in the housing sector , and the inevitable reallocation of labor and capital is going to cause some economic dislocation .
The good news , though , is that this process - if not hindered - will create a stronger and more vibrant economy .
A bailout , however , will discourage this process and reduce economic efficiency .
This may not seem important in the short run , since modest changes in the rate of economic growth are difficult to perceive .
But in the long run , because of compounding , even small changes in the rate of growth can have a significant impact on living standards .
Small differences in annual growth rates are why disposable income in the United States is substantially higher than disposable income in nations that practice economic interventionism , such as France , Germany , and Japan .
• The bailout repeats the mistakes Japan made in the 1990s .
There are several historical episodes that indicate the dangers of government intervention to prop up a bubble .
Japan faced a similar situation at the end of the 1980s , with real estate prices rising to absurd levels .
The bubble then burst , but rather than let market forces operate , Japanese politicians sought to prop up both insolvent institution and asset prices .
This interfered with the orderly reallocation of labor and capital , created considerable uncertainty , and contributed to a " lost decade " of economic stagnation .
Another worrisome parallel is what happened during the 1930s .
Policy mistakes such as protectionism ( Hoover ) , higher tax rates ( Hoover and Roosevelt ) , increased government spending ( Hoover and Roosevelt ) and increased intervention ( Hoover and Roosevelt ) , helped turn a stock - market correction into the Great Depression .
• The bailout will increase corruption in Washington .
When politicians have more power over the allocation of economic resources , people have an incentive to play the " rent - seeking " game of exchanging campaign contributions and hiring lobbyist in hopes of obtaining unearned wealth ( or , more honorably , taking the same steps in hopes of protecting themselves from those seeking unearned wealth ) .
The squalid mess at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was made possible in part because politicians received enormous amounts of money from advocates of the two government - sponsored enterprises .
If the government obtains power over financial markets , including the ability to steer money to particular firms , it will create a feeding frenzy of lobbying and influence peddling .
• The bailout rewards executives and companies that made poor choices .
Unfettered markets are the best generator of prosperity because people have incentives to make wise decisions .
If an entrepreneur figures out a way to provide a valued good or service to others , he can become wealthy .
But if that entrepreneur makes a mistake , he will suffer losses and maybe even bankruptcy .
If investors put money into a well - run company , they can increase their wealth .
But if they put their money into a poorly - run firm , the opposite can happen .
In other words , market forces encourage people to make smart decisions so they can prosper .
But it is equally important that people bear the consequences when they make wrong choices .
• The bailout will encourage imprudent risk in the future .
The debacles at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , as well as the savings & loan failures from the late 1980s / early 1990s , are compelling examples of the negative economic consequences that occur when profits are privatized but losses are socialized .
Faced with this perverse incentive structure , people engage in riskier behavior ( analogously , if you are in Vegas , and somebody else is going to cover your losses , you obviously have an incentive to make bigger bets ) .
A bailout would extend this risky behavior to the whole financial system , if not the entire economy .
Government Caused the Turmoil in Financial Markets
One of the ironies of the bailout debate is that supporters think that more government intervention is the solution to problems caused by bad government policy .
The main mistake was probably the Federal Reserve 's easy - money policy .
By creating too much liquidity and by driving interest rates to artificially low levels , the Fed set in motion the conditions for a housing bubble .
But this housing bubble is particularly severe because another government mistake - the pernicious and corrupt policies of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - lured many people into mortgages that they could not afford .
When a housing bubble bursts , that can have a negative effect on economic activity because people lose wealth ( or lose the perception of wealth ) .
But when people have been lured into homes they cannot afford and a bubble bursts , the economic consequences are more severe when a bubble bursts because people not only lose wealth , they also lose their homes . .
Other mistakes include policies such as the Community Reinvestment Act , which extorted banks into making loans to consumers with poor credit .
There are also many other policies that have encouraged economically inefficient levels of housing investment , such as the mortgage interest deduction in the tax code .
Short - Term Swings in the Stock Market Should not Determine Policy
Supporters of the bailout breathlessly watch the Dow Jones Industrial Average and interpret any downward movement as evidence that a bailout is necessary .
This is a rather odd benchmark , particularly since it almost goes without saying that a $ 700 billion transfer from taxpayers to the financial industry is going to increase - at least in the short run - the value of financial assets .
A $ 700 billion transfer from taxpayers to the auto industry would increase the value of auto companies , but that is hardly an argument for such a handout .
Moreover , short - term stock market performance is a bad indicator of good government policy .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose substantially in the weeks following the imposition of wage and price controls by Richard Nixon in 1971 .
Yet Nixon 's policy caused considerable economic damage by hindering market forces .
And since it did not address the real cause of rising prices - an easy - money policy by the Federal Reserve , Nixon let the problem fester and worsen , which unavoidably was a major reason for the relatively deep economic recession in 1974 - 75 .
One of the reasons why short - term stock market performance can be misleading is that investors sometimes care more about what other investors think than they do about the underlying fundamentals .
This is known as the " Keynesian beauty contest , " and though it is not a sound approach for long - term investing , it a perfectly reasonable strategy for speculative short - term investments .
And in today 's volatile environment - particularly with the reckless comments by Administration officials and Members of Congress , many investors will assume lower stock prices because they think other investors assume lower stock prices .
When government tries to redistribute wealth from rich people to poor people , it causes economic damage by discouraging productive activity by the most successful and by discouraging productive activity from those who are lured into government dependency .
The proposed bailout is even more pernicious .
It would redistribute wealth from poor people to rich people , and simultaneously encourage reckless behavior by recipients and impose an immoral burden on those that behaved responsibly .

While speaking in Chillicothe , Ohio , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama drew a sharp contrast with John McCain , by the turning the Republican ’s Country First slogan against him by saying that the nation is in crisis , and it is time to put country ahead of politics .
“ I think that folks are looking for something different .
It ’s easy to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division .
But that ’s not what we need right now in the United States .
The times are too serious .
The challenges are too great .
The American people are n’t looking for someone who can divide this country – they ’re looking for someone who will lead it .
We ’re in a serious crisis – now , more than ever , it is time to put country ahead of politics .
Now , more than ever , it is time to bring change to Washington so that it works for the people of this country that we love , ” Obama said .
This is an interesting statement because it works on multiple levels .
He is framing himself as the candidate who is the person to lead the nation out of this crisis .
The negative ads that McCain is running also play into Obama ’s theme of a new kind of politics .
He has managed to reverse roles with McCain , and appear to be the candidate who is putting country first .
Obama is painting McCain as only being interested in winning this election which was an attack that the McCain campaign used against Obama in late summer .

Obama is also trying to demonstrate that he is in tune with the concerns of average people , “ I know my opponent is worried about his campaign .
But that ’s not what I ’m concerned about .
I ’m thinking about the Americans losing their jobs , and their homes , and their life savings .
We ca n’t afford four more years of the economic theory that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
We ca n’t afford four more years of less regulation so that no one in Washington is watching anyone on Wall Street .
We ’ve seen where that ’s led us and we ’re not going back . ”
The roles of the two candidates have changed to the degree that it was Obama who proposed a small business rescue plan .
Obama wants to provide a business tax incentive to encourage new investments , and he also proposed the elimination of all capital gains taxes on investments and small businesses and start ups .
This is a plan that one would expect from the tax cut obsessed McCain campaign .
The biggest reasons that Obama has taken control of this race are that this crisis has now convinced voters that we need change , and Obama ’s response to this crisis has been very presidential .
The economic crisis is a chance to evaluate the two candidates ’ responses to an unexpected event in real time .
Barack Obama is passing this test with flying colors , while John McCain is still struggling to find the answers .
If Obama wins this election , it will be the economy that carries him there .
Full Text of Obama ’s Remarks
Citing most of the same evidence that I have written about over the past few weeks , Washington Post columnist David Ignatius , whose access to key policymakers ( outside of Vice President Dick Cheneyâ€™s office ) is second to no other Washington daily journalist argues in his Sunday column that the Bush administration is unlikely to bomb Iran before it leaves office .
Itâ€™s an important column , not only because he is more specific about the messages conveyed by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm .
Michael Mullen , ( and DNI chief Adm. Michael McConnell before him ) to top officials in Israel this summer â€ ” that the U.S. would â€œoppose overflights of Iraqi airspace to attack Iranâ€ â€ ” but also because he has been told by a â€œsenior officialâ€ that the administration will announce what has been rumored for the past month â€ ” that Washington will indeed open an interest section in Tehran .
Given the trauma of the 1979 - 81 hostage crisis , I personally believe that the presence of U.S. diplomats in Tehran virtually guarantees that the U.S. will not attack Iran so long as they remain there .
If the prediction of Ignatiusâ€ ™ senior official comes true , itâ€™s a very , very big deal in my view .
Ignatius is particularly close to both the Pentagon brass and the intelligence community ( and heâ€™s writing a book to be published in September with Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft ) .
His mention of the study by the Washington Institute for Near Policy ( WINEP ) â€ ” which clearly tries to downplay the international consequences of a U.S. and / or Israeli preventive attack on Iranâ€ ™s nuclear facilities â€ ” is particularly interesting in that respect .
The study , which its authors have strenuously denied is aimed at making such an attack much more â€œthinkable , â€ is nonetheless quite concerning , even more so because Tony Lake and Susan Rice ( among Obamaâ€™s closest foreign - policy advisers ) effectively endorsed it .
Itâ€™s clearly on the minds of some people who count .
After reading the column , you should also look at Col .
Pat Langâ€™s caution about it on his always - incisive blog .
He generally agrees with Ignatiusâ€™ analysis , expands on it in important ways , but notes that the current commander - in - chief could prove disturbingly unpredictable in the wake of the November elections .
If , on the other hand , U.S. diplomats are in place by then , I think his options will have narrowed considerably .
10 % of U.S. Electricity From Solar by 2025
June 17th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
[ social_buttons ]
Solar energy currently generates .1 % of the electricity used in the U.S. According to a study released today , this will change rapidly as the cost of electricity increases and the cost of solar energy drops .
The Utility Solar Assessment Study produced by Clean Edge and Co-op America finds that solar energy is already reaching cost parity with conventional sources in some areas of the U.S. where electric rates are highest .
By 2015 , this will be achieved in many more areas , including Boston , San Diego , and New York .
By 2025 , cost parity will be achieved throughout the U.S .
The implications of this are huge .
The U.S. solar photovoltaic market now relies heavily on state incentives to lower the cost of solar energy .
Many people utilize solar energy because it is “ the right thing to do ” or businesses like the positive publicity solar brings .
Unique Advantages of Solar Electricity
Solar energy does not have fuel costs , like power generated from coal , natural gas , oil , or nuclear energy .
The maintenance costs of solar are relatively low , it can generate electricity at the point of use , and emits no carbon .
Solar is ideally suited to produce peak electricity , when demand is highest on the power grid and utility companies pay the highest rates .
This is also where there is the greatest growth in electricity demand .
“ The daily and seasonal variation in grid load in the United States matches solar availability , ” said John O’Donnell , executive vice president of Ausra .
Solar effectively generates electricity when the rates and demand are the highest .
Action is Needed to Advance Widespread Use of Solar Energy
Solar Companies
Large - scale use of solar energy depends on prices dropping to $ 3 per peak watt of electricity by 2018 , according to the study .
This involves quickly implementing advanced technologies in a cost - effective manner .
Solar technology needs to be easier to install , thus reducing installation costs and other installations barriers .
Utility Companies
Utilities have become more and more interested in solar energy .
California is a great example , where many utilities have signed purchase agreements for solar plant output .
The U.S. will also need trained workers , which is another opportunity for utilities to take the lead .
A large investment in solar energy is needed for 10 % of U.S. electricity to be generated by solar energy by 2025 .
Utilities will need to invest between $ 26 and $ 33 billion per year , a pretty hefty sum .
To put this number in perspective , utilities invested $ 70 billion in 2007 on new power plants and transmission and distribution centers .
Solar Regulation and Policy
There is currently a 30 % commercial tax credit for solar energy , but it is set to expire at the end of the year .
There are purchase agreements for 3.2 gigawatts of concentrated solar power during 2007 , but these solar power plants cannot be constructed before the tax credit expires .
A long - term extension of the renewable energy tax credit is needed for large - scale use of solar energy .
Many states also have renewable portfolio standards , but a national renewable portfolio standard would also help strengthen the industry .
Sarah Lozanova is passionate about the new green economy and is a regular contributor to environmental and energy publications and websites , including Energy International Quarterly , ThinkGreen.com , Triple Pundit , Green Business Quarterly , Renewable Energy World , and Green Business Quarterly .
Her experience includes work with small - scale solar energy installations and utility - scale wind farms .
She earned an MBA in sustainable management from the Presidio Graduate School and is a co-founder of Trees Across the Miles , an urban reforestation initiative .

NAIROBI , Kenya  Pirates in a hijacked ship carrying more than 30 battle tanks were anchored off the coast of Somalia near a notorious pirate den on Saturday , and they vowed not to release the ship until a $ 35 million ransom was paid , Somali and Kenyan officials said .
Meanwhile , a United States Navy destroyer , the Howard , was closing in on the hijacked ship .
“ We ’ve got a constant stare on it , ” said Rear Adm.
Gregory Smith , an American military spokesman .
He would not say how far away the destroyer was from the hijacked vessel , but he acknowledged that the American ship was close enough to maintain visual contact .
He also said there were no imminent operations planned against the hijacked ship .
According to Mohamed Osman Aden , a Somali diplomat in Kenya , the hijacked ship , a Ukrainian - owned vessel , was headed on Saturday afternoon to Xarardheere , on the barren Somali coast .
Xarardheere is an isolated fishing village that has thrived on organized crime and has frequently been used as a pirate hide - out and a place to keep seized ships .
Mr. Mohamed said that while the cargo in this case was extremely unusual 
33 Soviet - designed T - 72 tanks and a large supply of ammunition and grenade launchers , all intended for the Kenyan military  the tactics were pretty typical .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House on Tuesday said it was not proposing a second economic stimulus package , but was open to ideas that would clearly help the economy .
“ We ’re not proposing a second stimulus package right now , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
“ We are open to good ideas , we will listen to people if they put anything forward that we think would actually stimulate the economy ; so far we have not seen that . ”
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday told Congress another wave of government spending may be needed following a first stimulus package earlier this year .
THE TRUTH ABOUT HEMP
by Dr. Lawrence Wilson
© May 2011 , L.D Wilson Consultants , Inc .
The story of hemp in America is a fascinating and interesting one .
Hemp is a most interesting agricultural plant that is currently illegal to grow in America , although it is grown all over the rest of the world for food , medicine , fiber , fuel , paper - making and more .
By the way , I do not support legalizing marijuana for any purpose , including pain relief or cancer treatment .
The reasons for this are detailed in another article entitled Medical Marijuana .
MEET THE HEMP PLANT
Hemp is an amazing example of nature 's blessings .
Few other plants can produce clean fuel , high - quality protein for animal and human food , among the best edible oils that is rich in omega - 3 fatty acids , lubricating and fuel oils , plastics , building material , clothing and paper .
Hemp requires no pesticides , grows almost anywhere on marginal soil , prevents soil erosion and can be grown on the same land year after year .
Hemp played a critical role in American history , but that story is rarely told .
Today it could help our economy , save the forests and soils , and clean up the air and water .
Hemp cultivation was banned in 1937 because it competed with the oil , chemical and timber industries , not because of drug abuse .
Canada and most European and Asian nations permit hemp cultivation .
Growing hemp does not mean legalizing marijuana .
The variety used industrially does not contain much THC , the major psychoactive chemical that some people like to smoke .
HEMP IN HISTORY
Remnants of hemp cloth were found in what was ancient Mesopotamia , now Turkey .
Pottery decorated by pressing strips of hemp cord into it were found in Taiwan from about the same time .
The Egyptians spun hemp around 4000 BC .
The word for hemp in German is hanf , from which we get our English word hemp .
The oldest paper came from China , made from a mixture of flax and hemp .
In Japan , the emperor wore silk , but the common people wore hemp clothing .
The Romans used hemp to make sails and ropes for their ships , and paper on which to write their laws .
The Dutch made a light fabric out of hemp they called canefas , derived from the Latin word cannabis .
It resulted in our word ' canvas ' .
In other words , canvas was originally a hemp product .
Records from the 1600s describe hemp made into towels , tablecloths , napkins , sheets , horse blankets , flags and so forth .
The French philosopher Rablais wrote of hemp ,
" Without it , how could water be drawn from the well ?
What would the scribes , secretaries and writers do without it ?
Would not the noble art of printing perish ? "
HEMP PAPER
Hemp paper does not turn yellow and disintegrate , as wood pulp paper does .
The Library of Congress reports that 300-400 year old hemp paper is still in good shape .
However , 97 percent of the non-fiction books printed between 1900 and 1939 on wood - based paper will be unreadable in 50 years .
Hemp can be made into every grade of paper , from fine stock to index cards , corrugated cardboard and newsprint .
Today it is still used in cigarette paper , currency , fine art stock and security papers like stock certificates .
Bibles are often printed on hemp paper because its lightness allows many thin pages .
Hemp produces about four times as much pulp for paper per acre as trees .
A new crop is produced annually , unlike trees which require 20 years to mature .
In 1988 , 226 million tons of trees were pulped to make paper .
The demand is expected to double by the year 2020 .
Wood - based paper - making is a dirty industry .
Mercury and other toxins are released that have contaminated every water supply in the nation .
Hemp can be made with a soda process that is much cleaner .
It can be bleached with hydrogen peroxide , instead of toxic chlorine .
Hemp paper can be recycled an average of seven times .
Wood - pulp paper can only be recycled an average of three times .
China leads the world today in non-tree paper , with 75 % of their paper made from various crops including hemp .
HEMP IN AMERICA
An early American explorer in 1524 described the American natives as using " threads of wild hemp . "
Christopher Columbus 's ships each carried over 80 tons of hemp rigging and sails .
Many colonies , from Connecticut to Georgia , urged settlers to raise hemp .
Georgia offered hempseed free to farmers in 1767 .
Thomas Paine insisted America could win a war with the British king because " hemp flourishes here " .
George Washington was a hemp farmer who praised native Indian hemp .
The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were drafted on hemp paper .
Thomas Jefferson wrote that hemp " is of first necessity to the commerce and marine , in other words to the wealth and protection of the country . "
In the 19th century , canvas and a lighter weight hemp fabric called ' duck ' covered the Conestoga Wagons .
Kentucky became the leading hemp - producing state .
" Flanders fine hemp linen " was advertised .
An acre of hemp will produces two to three times as much fiber as cotton or flax .
Hemp was always preferred to cotton because of its far greater strength , absorbency and durability .
In 1840 , John Baxter wrote that , " hemp will bleach whiter than flax or cotton , and make the finest fabric , from lace to cambric to good shirting , and far cheaper than either . "
Cotton is the most heavily sprayed crop in America .
Hemp requires no pesticide spraying .
The first Levi jeans were made of duck , a rugged hemp fabric .
Hemp can compete well with synthetic fibers , is breathable , recyclable and non-allergenic .
Hemp can also be spun into rayon .
Growing hemp could help revive the textile industry in America , creating thousands of jobs .
Hemp fiber is two to three times as strong as jute or sisal .
This makes hemp excellent for cordage , ropes and natural carpeting .
Because hemp is unaffected by salt water , it is excellent for fishing lines , fish nets , sail cloth and other items that are routinely exposed to damp weather .
HEMP FOR FOOD AND MEDICINE
Hempseed is about 25 % protein .
It is a high - quality , nutritionally - complete food eaten in many cultures for thousands of years .
In the Orient , it was often eaten like oatmeal .
It is more digestible than soy protein and provides essential omeg - 3 fatty acids , fiber and a complete protein all in one food .
Hempseed cakes make excellent food for fish , birds and livestock .
Hempseed oil is among the very best oil for eating raw or cooking .
It is also excellent for lubricating oil and fuel oil .
It can be used in shampoo , hair and skin cream , soap , cosmetics , massage oil and moisturizers .
The oil also makes excellent paint , varnishes , lacquer and sealants .
In fact , when hemp cultivation was banned in 1937 , hempseed oil was exempted , as it was so important for paints , varnishes and lubricating oil .
Hempseed oil has the highest total concentration of the essential fatty acids of any oil ( about 80 % ) .
Flaxseed oil is higher in linolenic acid , but hempseed is highest in total omega - 6 ( linoleic ) and omega - 3 ( linolenic ) essential fatty acids .
These fatty acids have been shown helpful to combat cancer , AIDS , inflammation , ADHD and most other diseases as well .
It is desperately needed by all people today .
UCLA researchers R. Lee Hamilton , PhD and William Eidelman , MD stated , " essential fatty acids are responsible for our immune response .
In the ( European ) old country , the peasants ate hemp butter .
They were more resistant to disease than the nobility . "
Hemp is a very ancient source of medicine .
It is mentioned by the famous physician Galen .
Several chemicals have been isolated from the hemp leaf and seeds .
Medicinal effects include stimulating the appetite , reducing nausea , lowering pressure in the eyes , stimulating the immune response and reducing pain , especially migraine headache pain .
It is an antibacterial , antiviral , anti-convulsant , bronchodilator and expectorant .
It reduces spasticity and ataxia in multiple sclerosis , stops menstrual bleeding and helps PMS and the pain of childbirth .
Hemp extracts were widely used in medicines in America until it was banned .
HEMP FOR FUEL
Corn , tree pulp and hemp are sources for clean - burning alcohol , ethanol and methane gas .
These ' biofuels ' contain no sulfur , the pollutant that causes acid rain .
Growing the fuel also produces oxygen , to balance the oxygen consumed during combustion .
Engines stay cleaner and the air remains much cleaner .
Hemp may be the most profitable and productive fuel crop that can be grown in many areas of America .
Hemp can produce about 1000 gallons of methanol per acre , four times as much as can be produced from trees .
Fuel can be produced locally , reducing transportation costs .
The production process , called biomass conversion , is safe and clean .
It would create a domestic fuel industry , freeing us from Middle East oil dependency , providing jobs and keeping our currency at home .
Hemp fuel needs no taxpayer subsidies , as oil receives .
The Department of Energy estimated that fuel could be produced from hemp for about 60 cents per gallon .
In New South Wales , Australia the Minister of Energy told the parliament they should consider burning confiscated hemp to produce electricity .
" It burns at extremely high temperature , produces a lot of power and is cheaper ( and much cleaner ) to burn than coal . "
Hemp was the subject of a 1991 conference held in Wisconsin .
One speaker pointed out our government spends $ 26 billion each year to pay farmers not to cultivate their land .
Instead of this waste of taxpayer money , farmers could grow hemp or other fuel crops .
This could completely end our dependence on foreign oil .
HEMP FOR PLASTICS AND CONSTRUCTION
It sounds incredible , but almost any product made from petroleum can be made from hemp or other vegetable sources .
Price has made oil attractive .
However , it is an artificial price .
Oil is heavily subsidized through oil depletion allowances and other tax breaks .
Oil is polluting and is a finite resource .
Henry Ford of Dearborn , Michigan pioneered making plastics from vegetable matter .
He demonstrated how to make plastic steering wheels and many other car parts from soybeans and other vegetable matter .
Vegetable - derived plastics are also more easily recyclable .
Construction materials such as particle board , shingles , blocks , paints , and sealants can also be made from crops such as hemp .
BANNING HEMP
In the late 1800 's hemp had trouble competing with cheaper cotton for clothes , jute for rope , and tree pulp for paper .
However , by 1920 , new processing equipment made hemp very inexpensive .
This was the beginning of the end for hemp .
Sometimes laws arise out of greed and special interests .
Other times , laws have good , but misguided intentions .
The banning of hemp involved both .
Two fledgling industries , oil and timber , ganged up against hemp .
Anything made of petroleum can be made from hemp .
The oil industry wanted cars to burn gasoline , not alcohol fuel derived from plants .
William Randolph Hearst , the newspaper magnate , owned forests across the country .
He wanted trees cut for paper , rather than using hemp .
Mr. Hearst began publishing horror stories in his newspapers across the country about " marijuana " .
By the way , Hurst made up the word based on lyrics in a Mexican drinking song .
He fabricated stories of murderous Mexicans high on ' dope ' .
This was a word for narcotics , not hemp .
The stories frightened and inflamed the public .
It was the time of the great depression .
People had lost confidence in their ability to solve their problems .
They wanted the government to solve them .
President Franklin Roosevelt obliged by creating federal agencies to police every aspect of American life .
One was the Federal Bureau of Narcotics .
Alcohol prohibition had been a failure , so the bureau was looking for a new ' war ' to undertake .
Hemp leaves are not a narcotic drug .
No addiction to hemp was reported , even among hemp laborers .
There was no drug problem in America to speak of at that time .
However , hemp smoking made a good target due to the inflammatory newspaper stories .
The combination of special interest greed and misguided government intervention led to banning all hemp cultivation and possession in 1937 .
Imported hemp oil for medicine and industry was so important to America it was excluded from the ban .
HEMP FOR VICTORY
The hemp ban in America did not last long .
In 1942 , the Japanese seized the Philippine Islands , our source for jute rope fibers .
Hemp became essential for the war effort .
The US government made a stirring film entitled “ Hemp for Victory ” .
They urged farmers to grow hemp for rope , twine , rigging and parachutes .
Each battleship required 34,000 feet of rope .
Cultivation went from zero to one million acres in a few years .
Even rural school children were encouraged to plant hemp to help the war effort .
Oddly , it did not cause a drug epidemic !
All this was forgotten when the war ended and hemp was banned once more .
The Drug Enforcement Agency opposes legalizing hemp because they say it is just a step toward legalizing marijuana .
However , hemp is grown throughout Europe , Canada and Asia , with permits or licenses .
Most of these nations have far less drug problems than we do !
A coalition of farmers in Kentucky has filed suit against the DEA claiming the ban on hemp cultivation for industry was never the intent of Congress .
The hemp law was motivated by special interests .
Banning it has nothing to do with legalizing pot , and it only deprives America and Americans of one of nature 's greatest sources of wealth and abundance .

The 33 - year - old Indian - born writer was also the youngest author on the shortlist for the £ 50,000 prize .
He wrote " the kind of book I 'd like to read " , he told the BBC .
" I like books that have ideas in them and that move and entertain . "
The chairman of the judges , former politician Michael Portillo , said : " In many ways it was the perfect novel . "
Adiga beat favourite Sebastian Barry to take the accolade as well as the other contenders , Amitav Ghosh , Steve Toltz , Linda Grant and Philip Hensher .
The White Tiger , a tale of two Indias , tells the story of Balram , the son of a rickshaw puller in the heartlands , one of the " faceless " poor left behind by the country 's recent economic boom .
It charts his journey from working in a teashop to entrepreneurial success .
It 's a quest to break out of the circumstances you find yourself in - it's a quest for freedom
Aravind Adiga
Adiga on the Today programme " Making it to the shortlist on a first novel is sort of like winning and anything beyond that is quite a bonus , " Adiga said .
He said the book was set in today 's India and " revolves around the great divide between those Indians who have made it and those who have not " .
" At the heart of the book it is something existential , " he added .
" It 's a quest to break out of the circumstances you find yourself in - it's a quest for freedom . "
' Perfect novel '
Announcing the winner at a ceremony in London , Mr Portillo said : " My criteria were ' Does it knock my socks off ? ' and this one did ... the others impressed me ... this one knocked my socks off . "

Mr Portillo said what set the book apart was its originality in showing " the dark side of India " .
He said : " The novel is in many ways perfect .
It is quite difficult to find any structural flaws with it . "
There were more than two contenders for the prize on the shortlist , but the winner was " absolutely not a compromise " , Mr Portillo added .
" There really was a decision .
The judges were asked to express their satisfaction and they all did . "
Adiga is the fourth first - time novelist to win the prize .

State of the Truth
Saturday , Sept 13 , 2008
Jesse Ventura , the former governor of Minnesota , ex Navy Seal Vietnam Veteran , Demolition Expert and an avid spokesperson for 911 Truth .
The governor takes on a swarm of media in the footage below for about 30 minutes .
This is a pretty intense interview !
( The first 2 minutes is n’t worth watching , it ’s just someone walking around with a camera .
Fast forward about 2 minutes to get to the interview . )
Ventura says government not telling 9/11 story
Michael Martinez , Cronkite News Service
Saturday , Sept 13 , 2008
Jesse Ventura , the former Minnesota governor and professional wrestler , accompanied a state senator to Arizona ’s 9/11 Memorial on Thursday to press his claims that the government is n’t telling the truth about the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
“ I think it ’s growing and growing with the population that more and more of us are questioning what happened that day , and we ’re also looking to find out if the truth was withheld from us , ” Ventura said .
“ And the more you study it , the more difficult for me it becomes to believe what my government told me . ”
( Article continues below )
A handful of people were at the memorial as Ventura spoke , some to support him and others simply marking the seventh anniversary of the attacks .
Ventura was also in the Valley to give a speech and attend a book - signing event .
State Sen. Karen Johnson , R - Mesa , said she invited Ventura for the seventh anniversary of the attacks after reading his new book , “ Do n’t Start the Revolution Without Me ! ”
In the book , Ventura says he does n’t know exactly what happened on Sept. 11 , 2001 , but he believes the American people have n’t been told the truth .
Johnson said she shares Ventura ’s doubts .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ I knew that he had spoken out in the past on feelings of wanting to get to the bottom of what happened on 9/11 , and I ’ve been involved in this 9/11 for Truth movement here in the Phoenix area and Arizona for some time now and have some very strong feelings about wanting to get a truly independent investigation going . ”
Ventura said he finds it absurd that the United States entered into two wars since 9/11 but has yet to charge Osama bin Laden with the attacks .
“ The government ’s theory is that 19 Islamic terrorists armed with box cutters defeated our multibillion - dollar air defense system , all while conspiring with a bearded guy in a cave in Afghanistan , ” Ventura said .
“ I find that far - fetched . ”
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil futures on Tuesday tumbled to levels not seen since early April on a strengthening dollar and concerns that an economic slowdown has crippled demand for energy .
U.S. crude futures for October delivery dropped $ 5.75 a barrel to settle $ 109.71 .
It was the lowest oil has settled since April 8 , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
Oil prices hit their lows for the day early Tuesday .
Prices tumbled nearly $ 10 from Friday 's settlement of $ 115.46 a barrel , according to NYMEX , as traders bet that damage to Gulf oil infrastructure from Hurricane Gustav was less than had been anticipated .
However , damage reports from the government and companies operating in the Gulf have not been released .
" We 're still in assessment mode , but so far , things are looking good , " said Cathy Landry , a spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute .
Adding further pressure was the U.S. dollar , which climbed against most major currencies early Tuesday .
Because crude is traded in dollars around the world , a stronger greenback puts downward pressure on oil prices .
When the dollar gains , it costs foreign investors more to purchase the same amount of energy , explained Neal Dingmann , senior energy analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co .
Oil prices have plummeted nearly $ 38 from a record high of $ 147.27 a barrel , set on July 11 , as demand for pricey energy slackened in a struggling economy .
Now that Gustav has passed , " at least for the next 3 or 4 days , the health of the economy has come to the forefront , " said Dingmann .
Another analyst also said now that the market perceives that the storm passed without great disruption , it has very quickly returned its focus on slumping global demand .
" You look at the overall fundamentals , " of the oil market , " and they are bearish really , " said Andrew Lebow , an energy analyst at MF Global .
" Gustav was just a stopping point - a brake for the time being , " until prices continue their long slide .
Assess damage :
While it appears that Gustav did not do major damage to the energy infrastructure in the Gulf - home to 26 % of U.S. oil production and 56 % of imports - the complete story of the aftermath is not yet known .
Oil prices have come off sharply on reports that Gustav was not as bad as expected because " people were sort of bracing for the worst , " said Dingmann .
" Early assessment that I have heard this morning is that some [ production equipment ] could be back on line as early as this evening . "
Other analysts were more skeptical .
" Though I sure hope that the production region dodged a bullet - as many market players have been saying - I think this mindset may be a bit premature , " said Jim Rouiller , senior energy meteorologist at Planalytics , a firm that predicts how weather will impact businesses .
" It will take some time for all the oil and gas companies to send people out for damage assessment , " said Rouiller .
" Many times before , this was the initial mindset only to be followed by bad news , discovery of damage . "
Gustav was a Category 2 hurricane when it touched land on Monday and has since been downgraded to tropical depression status .
Its heavy rain and strong winds threatened oil refineries , according to Rouiller .
" What was really key was that we had a major portion of US refinery capacity shuttered , " said Lebow , because the it can take a long time for refineries to restart .
" Gas stocks are already on the low side so if we lose some refinery capacity for any length of time , that would be problematic . "
Production suspended : Oil production , natural gas production and refineries were suspended as Gustav approached the Gulf Region .
According to a U.S. Department of Energy report issued Tuesday , 100 % of crude oil production was shut down in the Gulf of Mexico .
In addition , 23 refineries in the Gulf region had been shut down or were operating at reduced capacity by Tuesday , according to the report .
In advance of Gustav 's movement into the Gulf Coast region , 95.4 % of natural gas facilities had been shut down .
Even as fears of Gustav settled , Tropical Storm Hanna was brewing , moving over the Turks and Caicos Islands .
The National Hurricane Center predicts Hanna could make landfall as a major hurricane somewhere on the southeastern U.S. coast by Friday evening .
" The US remains under a heightened threat from storm impacts unlike the past few years - it is a whole different ball game this year , " said Rouiller .
" Gustav and Fay were just a beginning . "
One has to be careful when making jokes about the Republican presidential campaign .
They may turn out to be true .
A month ago I wrote a column saying that John McCain wants to drill in your toilet .
This comment was intended as a joke at the time , but it turns out to pretty much reflect the Republican position .
The Republicans ' most effective slogan for the fall election is " drill here , drill now . "
It all depends on your definition of " here " .
The basic issue is straightforward .
There is very little oil potentially available in the areas in which the Republicans are anxious to drill here and now .
The Energy Information Agency ( these are people who work for President Bush ) estimates that the oil in the offshore protected areas will eventually add about 0.2 % to world 's daily oil output .
This would be sufficient to lower the price of gas by 3 - 4 cents a gallon .
Furthermore , even with the best efforts to drill here and now , it will still take many years to get any oil whatsoever from these protected areas .
Regardless of how anxious McCain and the Republicans might be to damage the environment , oil companies will not just spend tens of millions of dollars blindly drilling deepwater wells .
They first have to survey the terrain carefully and then dig test wells .
The EIA projects that it will take 10 years before we get the first drops of oil from drilling in currently protected areas and close to 20 years before we get our full 3 - 4 cent a gallon savings .
That wo n't do a lot of good for people trying to make ends meet this year .
The remarkable story here is that the people who follow energy policy know these basic facts .
Yet , the Republicans are pushing the drill here , drill now line because they are betting the public can be kept in the dark .
Just as tens of millions of people supported the war in Iraq because they thought that Saddam Hussein was tied to the attack on the World Trade Center , the Republicans are betting that they gain votes in November because tens of millions of people will believe that they are offering a credible plan to substantially reduce gas prices in the new future .
In this respect , they are counting on their allies in major national media outlets like CBS , NBC , NPR , the New York Times and Washington Post .
The job of the media is to inform the public .
If the media effectively informed the public on this issue , they would be telling people that the Republicans are proposing an energy policy that can at best have a very modest impact on oil prices in the distant future , and no impact whatsoever for the near - term future .
The Republicans are betting that the media does n't bust them and tell the public the truth on this one .
So far , the Republican 's faith has been rewarded .
Few news stories have given the public the facts on the oil available in the offshore protected areas .
As a result , polls show that the majority of voters believe that drilling in these areas can have a substantial impact on oil prices in the very near future .
Perhaps we should introduce a system of merit pay for reporters and news producers in which their pay depends on their success in educating the public on key issues , just as many school districts make the pay of school teachers dependent on how well their students perform .
School teachers whose students perform badly do n't get raises and could even get fired .
Imagine that we applied the same standards to CBS , NBC , NPR and the Washington Post .
If their audience could n't answer basic questions about important public policy issues then the reporters responsible get their pay cut .
If the audiences are especially poorly informed , then the reporters get fired .
Unfortunately , this sort of accountability in the media does n't exist .
Most political reporters sound like high school drama coaches as they spend their time talking about candidates ' appearance and speaking mannerisms .
They almost never bother to discuss the positions advocated by the candidates – that might require a few minutes of real work .
Of course the candidates know that the reporters wo n't ever bother to verify the claims they make , which gives them incentive to make whatever outlandish claims are most convenient .
This is why we have McCain promising to drill for oil in our toilets and most voters actually believing that this will lower the price of gas .
When announcing her 17 - year - old daughter 's pregnancy on Monday in response to rumors circulating on the internet , Alaska Governor and Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin appealed for the media to respect her daughter 's privacy .
So far , the mainstream press has n't responded to Palin 's entreaties .
But at a time when anyone can set up a blog and be considered " media , " would it make the slightest difference if they did ?
It 's clear that some bloggers will continue to push the story to the ends of the Earth .
" You ca n't get away from the fact that there are incredibly sensationalist elements to this story , " says Kelly McBride , The Poynter Institute 's ethics group leader .
But she says the story about Bristol Palin 's pregnancy would have become news with or without bloggers .
" Keeping that one a secret would have been a long - shot , " she says .
That means it 's not a question of whether the media should continue to cover the story , but how they do it , she says .
The media has an opportunity to provide context and to responsibly shape the tone of the debate .
" There 's a sense of schadenfreude to the coverage , in the sense of , ' Oh , look at this beautiful conservative family , what a shame .
I think the tone of that might actually backfire , since I do n't think this situation of a teen pregnancy [ is that unusual ] "
Liberal bloggers spread a rumor online this weekend that Palin 's four - month - old son Trig is actually her daughter Bristol's .
That prompted Palin to break the news about her daughter 's pregnancy .
But reporters on the campaign trail do n't need to continue to push the issue , McBride says .
Instead , they could refocus the bloggers '
partisan rhetoric and translate it into a substantive policy story .
" The story is not what the Republican stance on teen pregnancy is – that 's such a dumb , shallow political question , " she says .
" The question is what is the reality of teen pregnancy in the United States , and how is it affected by public policy ? "
McBride says that journalists have a responsibility to check out the rumors floated on the blogs in order to get at the facts for readers , and she cites the media 's late response to John Edwards extra-marital affair , uncovered by the National Enquirer , as journalistic malfeasance .
But reporting the story does n't have to come at the expense of Palin 's daughter Bristol .
" You have to find a way to minimize the harm to minors , meaning that you do n't stick the paparazzi on them , or stake out their schools , and you would n't engage in the full - frontal assault as you might on other personalities in the news , " she says .
" But ultimately , your loyalty to your audience is greater . "
Even if mainstream news organizations exercised restraint in their reporting on Sarah Palin 's daughter , that might not necessarily dampen down the public 's attention on the subject , notes Jay Rosen , a journalism professor at New York University , and author of the popular journalism blog PressThink .
Nevertheless , he agrees there are ways to navigate around the story responsibly .
" I agree that her 17 - year - old daughter 's life should be kept out of public life , " he says .
" I think there is something to asking the press to lay off , because within the campaign security perimeters , the only people who can ask questions are the political reporters . "
Ultimately , reporters should ask themselves how their stories serve their readers , says McBride .

Researchers led by Dr Robin Allaby of the University of Warwick ’s plant research arm Warwick HRI have found evidence that genetics supports the idea that the emergence of agriculture in prehistory took much longer than originally thought .
Until recently researchers say the story of the origin of agriculture was one of a relatively sudden appearance of plant cultivation in the Near East around 10,000 years ago spreading quickly into Europe and dovetailing conveniently with ideas about how quickly language and population genes spread from the Near East to Europe .
Initially , genetics appeared to support this idea but now cracks are beginning to appear in the evidence underpinning that model
Now a team led by Dr Robin Allaby from the University of Warwick have developed a new mathematical model that shows how plant agriculture actually began much earlier than first thought , well before the Younger Dryas ( the last “ big freeze ” with glacial conditions in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere ) .
It also shows that useful gene types could have actually taken thousands of years to become stable .
Up till now researchers believed in a rapid establishment of efficient agriculture which came about as artificial selection was easily able to dominate natural plant selection , and , crucially , as a consequence they thought most crops came from a single location and single domestication event .
However recent archaeological evidence has already begun to undermine this model pushing back the date of the first appearance of plant agriculture .
The best example of this being the archaeological site Ohalo II in Syria where more than 90,000 plant fragments from 23,000 years ago show that wild cereals were being gathered over 10,000 years earlier than previously thought , and before the last glacial maximum ( 18,000 - 15,000 years ago ) .
The field of Archaeobotany is also producing further evidence to undermine the quick development model .
The tough rachis mutant is caused by a single recessive allele ( one gene on a pair or group of genes ) , and this mutant is easily identifiable in the archaeological specimens as a jagged scar on the chaff of the plant noting an abscission ( shedding of a body part ) as opposed to the smooth abscission scar associated with the wild type brittle rachis .

Simply counting the proportion of chaff types in a sample gives a direct measure of frequency of the two different gene types in this plant .
That study has shown that the tough rachis mutant appeared some 9,250 years ago and had not reached fixation over 3,000 years later even after the spread of agriculture into Europe was well underway .
Studies like these have shown that the rise of the domestication syndrome was a slow process and that plant traits appeared in slow sequence , not together over a short period of time .
Genome wide surveys of crops such as einkorn and barley that in the past that have suggested a single origin from a narrow geographical range , supporting the rapid establishment view , have long been in conflict with other gene studies .
The most notable conflict is in the case of barley for which there is a large body of evidence that suggests more than one common ancestor was used in its development .
These challenges to the fast model of agricultural development need a new model to explain how and why the development was so slow and demonstrate why artificial selection of just one plant type does not have the expected quick result .
This computer model has now been provided by Dr Robin Allaby and his team at the University of Warwick , the Institute of Archaeology , University College London , and Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre has outlined the new mathematical model in a paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 2008 and in a summary article in the Biologist ( 2008 55:94-99 ) .
Their paper entitled
The genetic expectations of a protracted model for the origins of domesticated crops used computer simulations that showed that over time a cultivated population will become monophyletic ( settle into one stable species ) at a rate proportional to its population size as compared various gene variations in the wild populations .
They found this rate of change matched closely the 3000 years it took the tough rachis mutant to become established .
Ironically , this process is actually accelerated if there is more than one
wild source population ( in other words if attempts at domestication happen more than once ) because any resulting hybrid between those domesticated populations then has a heightened differentiation compared with either one of the wild populations of the two parent plants .
advertisement
This mathematical model also more supportive of a longer complex origin of plants through cross breeding of a number of attempts at domestication rather than a single plant type being selectively bred and from a single useful mutation that is selectively grown quickly out paces the benefits natural selection
Dr Robin Allaby says :
“ This picture of protracted development of crops has major implications for the understanding of the biology of the domestication process and these strike chords with other areas of evolutionary biology . ”
“ This lengthy development should favour the close linkage of domestication syndrome trait genes which may become much more important because linked genes will not be broken up by gene flow – and this makes trait selection and retention easier .
Interestingly , as more crop genomes become mapped , the close linkage of two or more domestication syndrome genes has been reported on several occasions . ”
“ This process has similarities to the evolution of ‘ supergenes ’ in which many genes cluster around a single locus to contribute to one overall purpose . ”
“ We now need to move this research area to a new level .
Domestication was a complex process and can now be viewed more legitimately as the paragon of evolutionary process that Darwin originally recognized .
There are many interacting factors involved that we know about operating on a wide range of levels from the gene to the farmer and climate – the challenge is to integrate them into a single story . ”

Chances are you ’ve heard about the bacchanal known as the Minerals Management Service .
The arm of the Interior Department charged with collecting some $ 10 billion a year in royalties from oil and gas companies , it has been caught up in scandal after scandal , including this week ’s revelations that top employees were in bed ( and not just figuratively ) with the oil officials they were supposed to regulate .
In between glacially slow - to - arrive FOIA requests , I ’ve been looking into MMS and its weird party culture off and on for more than a year .
Here ’s a few juicy details that you wo n’t read in the Inspector General ’s report .
The IG tells us about two MMS oil marketers , Stacy Leyshon and Crystel Edler , who became known among oil executives as the “ MMS Chicks . ”
Between 2002 and 2006 , each received more than $ 2,700 in gifts on more than 60 occasions from oil companies , including meals , booze , lodging , and golf outings .
Leyshon , who slept with two oil company employees , operated a sex toys side business known as “ Passion Parties ” ( think Tupperware parties , but with dildos ) and bragged that it paid more than her day job at MMS .
She told the IG that nobody in the oil industry had purchased sex products from her ( though three subordinates at MMS had ) .
However , that account is contradicted by former MMS Deputy Junius Walker , a high - ranking employee who worked in Leyshon ’s Denver office before retiring .
“ She ’s selling that stuff to oil and gas companies , ” he told me last year .
“ I mean , that ’s what she was doing .
She was going around , going down to the oil and gas companies , putting on presentations .
. . They were having a really , really good time . ”
The highest ranking official criticized in the IG reports was Lucy Querques Denett , the former associate director of the minerals revenue management department , who retired earlier this year .
The reports found that Denett worked with two employees to steer a lucrative consulting contract to one of them after he retired , violating competitive procurement rules .
The other employee later retired to work on the same contract .
Denett ’s eagerness to look out for her aides went further than this , several sources told me .
Oil royalty auditor Bobby Maxwell , who gained national attention in 2006 for his $ 50 million False Claims
Act case against the department and oil company Kerr - McGee , told me he had wanted to audit contracts signed between oil companies and the department ’s problem - plagued Royalty In Kind division , which collects $ 4 billion a year in oil and gas instead of cash royalties .
But in 2002 the RIK department refused to hand over the contracts , Maxwell says , and Denett told him , “ Leave it alone . ”
He says she never explained why RIK could n’t be audited .
That year Denett also began hobbling her auditors in other ways .
Since 1996 , they ’d operated by pouring over oil and gas leases looking for irregularities .
Federal law allows MMS to demand that an oil company correct all of its production figures if an auditor finds evidence of royalty underpayments “ based on repeated , systemic reporting errors for a significant number of leases . ”
These demand letters to industry are known as orders for restructured accounting .
Maxwell ’s office would typically send out two of the orders each month , often resulting in the collection of millions in unpaid royalties , but in 2002 Denett stopped signing off on them .
Dennis Roller , audit manager for the North Dakota state auditors office , told me he faced the same problem , and asked Denett why she ’d stopped approving them .
He says she told him , “ ‘ Well , I have a hard time defining ‘ significant ’ and ‘ systemic . ' ”
The change meant that auditors now had to pore over every lease individually , even when they ’d identified a recurring error–an impossible feat with the department ’s limited resources , Maxwell says .
He estimates the change has caused MMS to lose “ tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of dollars over the years . ”
Denett and Leyshon could not be reached for comment today and the MMS did not return a call .
This stuff just scratches the surface of the MMS free - for - all .
So far the grand prize for depravity goes to former RIK manager Gregory Smith , who pitched the oil companies he regulated to do business with his outside consulting firm , slept with two subordinates , and bought cocaine from another RIK employee while on the job ( DOJ , where are you ? ) .
Of course , last time I checked , there was also an ongoing GAO investigation , four False Claims
Act cases pending against MMS in Oklahoma City , and a DOJ investigation of a Virginia - based MMS employee who allegedly traveled to Atlanta to have sex with someone he ’d met in a teen online chat room who he thought was a 13 - year - old girl .
“ Unfortunately , as the Inspector General pointed out , the conduct of a few has cast a shadow on an entire agency , ” Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said in a statement today .
That ’s certainly true , but given how long this mess has been brewing , eliminating the bad apples has got to start at the top .

The torture techniques deployed against anyone George W. Bush unilaterally labeled an enemy combatant drove some of them insane :
A U.S. military officer warned Pentagon officials that an American detainee was being driven nearly insane by months of punishing isolation and sensory deprivation in a U.S. military brig , according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union and provided to The Associated Press ...
They were deprived of natural light for months and for years were forbidden even minor distractions such as a soccer ball or a dictionary .
" I will continue to do what I can to help this individual maintain his sanity , but in my opinion we 're working with borrowed time , " an unidentified Navy brig official wrote of prisoner Yaser Esam Hamdi in 2002 .
" I would like to have some form of an incentive program in place to reward him for his continued good behavior , but more so , to keep him from whacking out on me . "
This was not even in Gitmo .
It was in a military brig in Norfolk , Virginia and Charleston , South Carolina , where the torture occurred on American soil and even against an American citizen , Jose Padilla .
Many decent people in the armed forces resisted Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld , but they could n't stop them :
An officer was still raising alarms about Hamdi 's mental state after 14 months of jail with no contact with lawyers , his family or even other prisoners .
" I told him the last thing that I wanted to have happen was to send him anywhere from here as a ' basket case , ' of use to no one , to include himself , " the officer wrote in an e-mail to undisclosed government officials in June 2003 .
" I fear the rubber band is nearing its breaking point here and not totally confident I can keep his head in the game much longer . "
These people we made insane are the people we were trying to get intelligence from !
You think insane people give us reliable information ?
Now recall the consequences of this torture with respect to Jose Padilla :
" During questioning , he often exhibits facial tics , unusual eye movements and contortions of his body , " Mr. Patel said .
" The contortions are particularly poignant since he is usually manacled and bound by a belly chain when he has meetings with counsel . " ...
Now recall what we found out about Qahtani :
At the end of months of sleep deprivation and other forms of torture , Qahtani , according to an FBI letter , " was evidencing behavior consistent with extreme psychological trauma ( talking to non existent people , reporting hearing voices , crouching in a cell covered with a sheet for hours on end ) . "
The established legal definition of torture is the infliction of " severe mental or physical " " pain or suffering " to gain intelligence .
If you do believe these individuals have been subjected to severe mental pain and suffering , then George W. Bush is a war criminal .
( Photo : an official photograph showing the lengths to which Padilla 's guards went to maintain his total sensory deprivation .
The goggles and earmuffs block out all sound and light , and he is manacled hand and foot , while being taken to have a tooth fixed .
He is no security threat , but he is treated like an animal . )

Goldman says its returns are primarily driven by economic growth , its market share and pricing power , not by leverage .
It adds that it does not expect changes in its business strategies and expects a 20 percent return on equity in the future .
IF Mr. Hintz is right , and Goldman ’s legendary returns decline , so will its paychecks .
Without those multimillion - dollar paydays , those top - notch investment bankers , elite traders and private - equity superstars may well stroll out the door and try their luck at starting small , boutique investment - banking firms or hedge funds  if they can .
“ Over time , the smart people will migrate out of the firm because commercial banks do n’t pay out 50 percent of their revenues as compensation , ” said Christopher Whalen , a managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics .
“ Banks simply are n’t that profitable . ”
As the game of musical chairs continues on Wall Street , with banks like JPMorgan scooping up troubled competitors like Washington Mutual , some analysts are wondering what Goldman ’s next move will be .
Goldman is unlikely to join with a commercial bank with a broad retail network , because a plain - vanilla consumer business is costly to operate and is the polar opposite of Goldman ’s rarefied culture .
“ If they go too far afield or get too large in terms of personnel , then they become Citigroup , with the corporate bureaucracy and slowness and the inability to make consensus - type decisions that come with that , ” Mr. Hintz said .
A better fit for Goldman would be a bank that caters to corporations and other institutions , like Northern Trust or State Street Bank , he said .
“ I do n’t think they ’re going to move too fast , no matter what the environment on Wall Street is , ” Mr. Hintz said .
“ They ’re going to take some time and consider what exactly the new Goldman Sachs is going to be . ”
Everyone knows that almost any blog post is better with images .
However , getting them can be a difficult matter .
With a maze of licensing and fair use issues making it hard to decide what is and is not legal to use , many bloggers do n’t wish to use images that they have not taken themselves .
But while using your own images is always the best way to go , there are several great sources to help you find and locate images that you can use as part of your blog posts .
In fact , there are some very neat tools designed specifically to help you correctly license and use other people ’s photography , art and more .
The best part of all is that these tools are free .
They will not cost you a dime to use and , if used correctly , can let you fill up your blog posts with as many images as your heart desires .
Photo Dropper
Photo Dropper is hands down one of my favorite WordPress plugins .
Not only does it make excellent use of Creative Commons - licensed photos , but it solves one of the biggest problems with CC licensing , incomplete compliance with the terms of the license .
Photo Dropper is extremely simple to use .
Simply install it in your WordPress plugins , activate it , set your options and then , on the “ Write Post ” page you can either click the “ PD ” icon next to the other media items or scroll down below the post entry box .
From there , you ’ll be able to search for keywords related to your post .
Photo Dropper will then search Flickr for Creative Commons - licensed works that might fit with your description .
When you find one you like , you select the size you want and Photo Dropper inserts it into your post , complete with a CC - compliant attribution line .
Photo Dropper may take some fiddling to get relevant images and you might have to tweak the HTML to get it to fit well in your posts .
However , it is still by far the easiest way to insert legal images into your posts .
Zemanta
Zemanta is a Firefox extension / IE plugin that integrates itself with most major blogging platforms , including both self - installed and hosted WordPress blogs , Blogger accounts , MovableType and more .
When the user pulls up their blog ’s editing interface , they are presented with related links , stories , tags and images that they can use with the post .
The advantage of Zemanta is that its images come from a variety of sources including public domain sources , Creative Commons sources , including Flickr , and other sources that license their images for use at low resolution .
This provides a much greater variety of images to the user and it automatically performs a license - compliant insertion of the image into the post .
The drawback to Zemanta is that it can make modifications to the post beyond what is selected .
You may need to go through your post ’s HTML code thoroughly after insertion to be certain that nothing unwanted was inserted .
GumGum
While the sources above are great for those that need abstract photographs or just something quirky to go with a story , finding an image to go with a news or politics story can be very tricky .
Fortunately there are also a series of services to help with that , including GumGum .
The service allows publishers to search through related images and then embed interesting photos as a line of JavaScript code .
Why JavaScript ?
Because that is how GumGum provides the service for free , using the JavaScript to both protect the image and display ads on top of it .
This use of ads is what may upset many .
Where Photo Dropper and Zamanta do n’t display ads , GumGum does .
Also , the use of JavaScript may prevent the image from showing up in some RSS readers .
These drawbacks , along with the need to apply for an account , are but a small price to pay for high - quality images .
Update : GumGum has clarified this article and said that they only require a one - time JavaScript insertion and then grant access to the full images , this negates many of these drawbacks .
There is also a pay - per view model that allows you to skip the ads and just pay every time the image is displayed .
PicApp
Similar to GumGum , PicApp lets you search through newsworthy images to find ones that might interest you and then lets you embed the one that works best as a JavaScript .
However , PicApp also lets you search for “ creative ” as well as “ editorial ” images , giving you a slightly wider variety .
PicApp comes with many of the same concerns and drawbacks as GumGum and uses a similar advertising model to pay for the free service .
PicApp , however , does not require you to register for the service and you can begin embedding images from the very first time you visit .
Whether you use PicApp or GumGum will likely be a matter of personal preference as the two sites largely fill the same niche .
It comes down to which site has the best images for your content and which embeds you prefer .
Voxant Newsroom
Voxant Newsroom is another service that functions similar to GumGum or PicApp , letting users embed content , this time as a Flash app .
But this service , unlike the former two , get their images exclusively from major mainstream media outlets including the Associated Press , CBS News and more .
As neat as Voxant is , I previously covered it in my broader article about getting free content for your site , there is not much flexibility regarding the layout of the embedded images .
However , the site does offer a variety of content , including video and articles , all from major news sources .
Once again you and your visitors will be putting up with advertisements over the media , at least in many cases , but what is more likely a deal breaker for many is that the layouts of the images may not fit in many blog layouts and are often too large to go neatly with posts .
This is definitely one to consider though and see if it can work for you .
Conclusions
The bottom line is this , content licensing is hard , even with Creative Commons .
Fortunately though , there are a series of sites that have come up to do the hard work for you and let you easily and legally use images with your blog posts .
In addition to these sites , there are also a slew of stock photography sites that let you download and use photographs and images for free or a small license .
However , they generally provide no help with the insertion process and , if there are licensing terms , provide little help in complying with them .
A solution such as these tools can help not only keep your site legal , but speed up the writing process dramatically , saving you time and money .

DNS security has been a hot topic this summer , ever since the news broke that security researcher Dan Kaminsky had discovered a new flaw in the system .
That particular issue has since been patched , but the announcement refocused attention on the DNS protocol and its many security shortcomings .
Now , the United States government has announced that all .gov domains will begin to transition to the secure DNS protocol known as DNSSEC , and must complete the adoption process by December 2009 .
.gov is the second gTLD to announce such a switch ; .org announced it would convert to DNSSEC in late July of this year .
The primary purpose , and main security feature , of the DNSSEC protocol is its ability to protect users from DNS cache poisoning .
Poisoned DNS servers have been fooled into returning false information in response to a DNS lookup request .
A client querying a poisoned DNS server for the location of any particular website , for example , might actually receive information that aims it straight at a different , malware - contaminated site .
Part of what makes DNS cache poisoning such a nasty attack vector is that the user , client , and DNS server all believe they have acted appropriately .
A user presented with a page of hot barnyard action when he or she originally attempted to reach ToonTown may , in fact , conclude that the website has been hacked or compromised , and avoid it in the future .
This flaw exists because the DNS protocol is the ultimate Pollyanna .
DNS inherently trusts everyone and is not capable of evaluating or classifying sources into trustworthy / untrustworthy categories .
DNSSEC solves this problem by requiring that all DNS responses be digitally signed .
This allows the DNS server to check and confirm that the information it's about to return to the client actually points at the address it 's supposed to point at .
The government 's decision to adopt DNSSEC is an important step toward universally rolling out the protocol , but there 's still a great deal of work ahead before that can happen .
DNSSEC can only be truly effective if it 's widely adopted , but switching from DNS to DNSSEC is n't trivial , and it is n't cheap .
There are also a number of questions regarding when the .com and .net gTLDs will adopt DNSSEC , and no clear timeline for when they might do so .
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration ( NTIA ) has stated that it recognizes the importance of DNSSEC , but will take no actions that might compromise the stability or efficiency of DNS .
The questions do n't stop there .
If the root servers are signed , who holds the keys , and what security measures would be considered appropriate to guard against malicious / illegal use of said keys ?
Is ICANN sufficiently detached from the US government to be trusted with such a responsibility , or does the situation call for a third - party contractor ?
It 's also important to remember that DNSSEC is designed to solve a particular problem and is not a security blanket that will , in and of itself , make the Internet " safe . "
While it does provide a certain amount of indirect protection against DoS attacks , for example , DNSSEC does not encrypt data , and it can't protect against any false assumptions a user might make .
At the very least , the government 's decision to adopt the security standard puts indirect pressure on any gTLD 's to adopt it as well .
The more widespread adoption is , the more effective the standard can be , but even if .com and .net leap aboard tomorrow , full - scale deployment could still take years .
One does not secure Internet simply with the flick of a switch , however enticing such a solution might be .

Park attendants ordered to interrogate adults spotted without children
Telford Town Park in Shropshire , where council workers have been told to confront lone adults in the park to check if they are paedophiles
Park wardens have been ordered to stop and interrogate anyone who is not accompanied by children .
The visitors who are quizzed have to explain their presence and risk being thrown out or reported to police if their answers are not satisfactory .
The policy has been introduced at Telford Town Park in Shropshire .
The council which manages the 420 - acre area says it is a ' commonsense approach ' aimed at safeguarding children .
But park users accused it of ' authoritarian madness ' and said the ruling risked panicking parents about the dangers faced from potential paedophiles .
The policy came to light after two environmental campaigners dressed as penguins were thrown out of the park last month when caught handing out leaflets on climate change .
Telford and Wrekin Council said Rachel Whittaker and Neil Donaldson were ejected because they had not undergone Criminal Records Bureau checks or risk assessments before entering the park - a requirement under the Child Protection Act .
David Ottley , recreation manager at the Tory - run council , said in a letter to a member of the public over that issue : ' Our town park staff approach adults that are not associated with any children in the park and request the reason for them being there .
' In particular , this applies to those areas where children or more vulnerable groups gather . '
Miss Whittaker , 34 , from Wellington , near Telford , said the policy carried a ' dangerous implication that if you have a child with you than everything is OK and you wo n't be questioned ' .
Former childcare social worker John Evans said : ' It is authoritarian madness which can only be based on ignorance .
It is absurd , it is insulting and it is dangerous as it panics people about the dangers their children face . '
A council spokesman insisted that only those ' acting suspiciously ' would be stopped and questioned .

Malalai Kakar was not allowed to work as a police officer under the Taleban Gunmen in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar have killed the country 's most prominent policewoman , officials say .
Lt - Col Malalai Kakar , head of Kandahar 's department of crimes against women , was shot in her car as she was about to leave for work .
Her son was also wounded in the attack , and is said to be seriously injured .
Taleban rebels , who banned women from joining the police when they were in power , said they had carried out the shooting .
" We killed Malalai Kakar , " a Taleban spokesman told AFP news agency .
" She was our target , and we successfully eliminated our target . "
The BBC's Martin Patience in Kabul says Ms Kakar was one of only a few hundred female police officers in Afghanistan and that she had previously received death threats .
Prominent Ms Kakar , who was reported to be in her early 40s and had six children , was one of the most high - profile women in the country .
She has figured prominently in the national and international media , partly due to a famous episode in which she killed three would - be assassins in a shoot - out - although she said her everyday life involved tackling theft , fights and murders .
Ms Kakar joined Kandahar 's police force in 1982 , after her father and brothers were also police officers .
But when the hard - line Taleban regime took over Afghanistan she was prevented from working .
Working in the police force in Afghanistan has become an increasingly dangerous occupation , says our correspondent .
According to the Ministry of Interior , more than 700 police officers were killed in the first six months of 2008 .
The majority of the casualties were killed in suicide attacks and roadside bombings .
In June , another woman police officer was gunned down in Herat province in a killing believed to have been the first of its kind .
Kandahar is a key battleground of the Taleban insurgency , where Afghan and foreign troops are fighting the rebels .

What are these ?
Desmond Tutu 's advice for the next U.S. president
For several years now , American pundits have commented sadly on the alleged rise of anti-Americanism abroad .
I am not aware of any such anti-Americanism .
What has been growing is resentment of and opposition to certain , current U.S. government policies .
America itself still stands tall in international eyes as a stronghold of democratic values and the ideals of individual liberty .
All that remains is for informed citizens to stand up in November and call the country back to its roots .
Yet how does a nation accomplish such change ?
South Africa completed such a transition a decade ago when it addressed the horrors of apartheid .
At the time , a peaceful reconciliation between blacks and whites - between the long oppressed black majority and the controlling white minority - was by no means certain .
Skeptics viewed our first black - led government with concern and uncertainty , wondering whether the natural urges for revenge and retribution would tear the country apart .
That story had already played out time and again across the African continent , as it does today in Zimbabwe and elsewhere .
It was thus with amazement that the world witnessed South Africa 's tranquil transition .
The new democracy did n't descend into the predicted pit of vengeance or become ensnared in years of frustrating red tape over Nuremberg - type show trials for the accused .
At the same time , Pretoria also rejected blanket amnesty , which would have deepened the national wound by victimizing the victims a second time around .
Instead , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , which steered us through these difficult times , provided a third alternative : that of restorative justice .
The commission chose to grant amnesty in exchange for the whole truth : a complete disclosure of all the relevant facts relating to the offense for which amnesty was being sought .
A confessing perpetrator bore the stigma of public shame and humiliation regarding his crime , which frequently included very real family and career consequences .
The commission also created a means by which rehabilitation and re-acceptance into the community was possible , providing healing and reconciliation for victims and perpetrators alike .
Victims were able to share their stories in a friendly and supportive forum , affirming that they had not struggled in vain , while truly contrite perpetrators were given a chance to be salvaged and ultimately reintegrated into the community .
By offering amnesty for a high price , the commission managed to reconcile the bitterly wronged with the wrongdoers .
World history has proved that forgiveness is never cheap or easy .
Even in South Africa , there were some who said the truth made them want to see the perpetrators facing trial and others who refused to forgive , often because they claimed that the amnesty applicants had not told the entire truth .
But the rare success stories like South Africa prove that reconciliation can happen on the basis of truth and there can be no future without forgiveness .
Revenge only begets further violence .
In the end , an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind .
American voters would do well to keep South Africa 's lessons in mind when they head to the polls in November .
America 's strained relationships in the global community are due largely to the fear and siege mentality that set in after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , causing many in Washington on both sides of the aisle to reject certain civil liberties considered core American values .
If the next U.S. president cares for global reconciliation , then he will stand up for these values and reject those policies that have weakened or undermined individual liberty .
In this regard , I suggest that your new president would be surprised at the reaction of the world if he were to say to the world , " We made big mistakes over Iraq . "
And while he is at it , shut down Guantanamo Bay .
And just as in South Africa a decade ago , it never hurts to say " I 'm sorry . "
With honesty , humility and international forgiveness , the United States can and should remain a beacon for liberty for the world long into the future .

Second , recursions or iterations over a data structure are almost always either fmap or one of the Data .
Foldable functions .
Third , the list monad ( and list comprehensions ) capture a common recursion pattern , one found especially in path - finding , alpha - beta AI , and other try - every - path problem spaces .
If you ’re recursing , and lists are involved , the recursion pattern has already been captured in a Prelude or Data .
List function .
map , the fold * s , the scan * s , filter , find , unfoldr and group ( By ) cover , I think , every loop I ’ve ever written in an imperative language .
The dynamic “ scripting ” languages like Perl and Python have had foreach loops for years , to cover the most common case of looping over every element of an array .
Java 1.6 and C# have this too .
That ’s a handy bit of syntactic sugar , but it is only a weak replacement for map , and does n’t help at all for any of the others .
Programmers new to FP , including me when I was learning Haskell , often find it hard to think in terms of folds and maps .
So go ahead , write the explicitly recursive version .
But when you ’re done , replace it with the appropriate library function .
In time , you wo n’t need to write it down any more and will think of what you would write , recognize it as one of these higher - order functions , and write that down instead .
Eventually , you ’ll think in the folds and maps directly .
What about when you ’re not working on lists ?
Take another common structure , trees .
Or any other data structure , really .
Consider this binary tree implementation :
data Tree a = Empty | Node a ( Tree a ) ( Tree a )
It ’s fairly obvious that we could map a function over the tree .
This common pattern is represented by the typeclass Functor .
Functor s represent “ things which can be mapped over ” , or containers to whose contents we might like to apply a function .
Note that any Monad is also a Functor , though Haskell 98 does not enforce this .
Some existing , handy Functor s : Maybe , lists , functions ( (-> ) a ) , tuples ( a , ) , Either a , Map k .
The Functor typeclass contains a single function , fmap :: ( Functor f ) => ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b .
It turns an ordinary function into one “ inside the functor ” .
For our tree :
instance Functor
Tree where fmap _ Empty = Empty fmap f ( Node x l r ) = Node ( f x ) ( fmap f l ) ( fmap f r )
It ’s similar in spirit to map over lists , and in fact fmap = map for lists .
Writing the instance for the Functor or Foldable type classes , which you only do once , has huge maintenance and conciseness advantages over writing the explicit recursion in even two places .
That would be true of a treeMap function for a tree that is n’t a Functor .
The advantage of the typeclasses is that they provide a standard interface common to many libraries .
Finally , many seemingly complex recursion patterns , especially in the path - finding and alpha - beta AI spaces can be written in a list comprehension , or ( if you prefer ) in list monad do - notation .

Becoming a Buddhist minister is an opportunity and calling open to anyone interested .
Despite the lack of formal qualifications needed to become ordained within the Buddhist faith , however , an acceptance of the Buddhist teachings and a willingness to apply these teachings where they can aid society is expected .
Although ordination is n't necessarily for life and many people leave the life of a minister after a few years , the commitment requires considerable thought and consideration .
1 Research Buddhism thoroughly Research Buddhism thoroughly , paying attention to the three main schools of Buddhist thought : Dharmaguptaka , Mulasarvastivadin and Theravada .
Though differing slightly in their beliefs , all schools of Buddhism uphold the teachings of the Buddha and relate only to the monastic bows and lineage .
Studying them ensures you are adequately prepared for whichever lineage you choose .
2 Join a Buddhist Sangha Join a Buddhist Sangha ( temple , church or meeting group ) that matches the Buddhist beliefs into which you want to be ordained .
The Internet or your area 's telephone directory should be your first point of call when finding a Sangha .
3 Demonstrate an awareness of the Buddhist teachings Demonstrate an awareness of the Buddhist teachings and way of life to the Sangha 's other members .
Show that you continually read the Buddha 's teachings and apply them to your life .
Many monasteries have a probationary period of about one year , during which application of the teachings must be shown before applying for ordination .

I do n’t know about you , but it ’s been a while since I ’ve seen a good fat - people - are - chewing - up - the - world - and - spitting - the - pits - in - babies ’ - eyes story in the traditional media .
I suppose most of them are having too much fun these days blaming the mortgage crisis on poor black and brown people greedily insisting on having their own house keys .
( And if you actually do believe that all , or even a visible - to - naked - eye percentage of , those defaulted - upon jumbo loans for jumbo McMansions were actually issued to minimum - wage - earning black and brown people , I have a jumbo planet made out of cheese to sell you .
Nothing due on principal for the first year , hurry on in ! )
But have no fear , my fellow fatasses , Rolling Stone has n’t forgotten how bad fat people suck and that we are to blame for everything that ’s wrong with America .
Whew .
In their October 2 issue , there is a story by Matt Taibbi called “ The Lies of Sarah Palin ” ( which was n’t available online while the issue was on the stands , which is why I waited until now to blog about it ) .
In it , Taibbi speaks of the “ four - chinned delegates ” and their “ turkey - necked companions ” who gathered at the Xcel Center in Minneapolis back in August to witness Sarah Palin ’s vice - presidential acceptance speech at the Republican Convention and lapped up her every mendacious word like hungry kittehs .
Hm , so that ’s how you gross out your readers about Republicans , huh Matt ?
By saying they ’re fat ?
Because fat equals stupid equals fat equals stupid , on and on into infinity , and everybody knows that — even all your fat readers who just know that for every pound they lose they ’ll gain an IQ point to go along with it , which will only be with them for as long as the pound of fat is gone .
Yeah , stunningly enough , fat people ( dieting or not ) actually read your magazine .
Or did .
I ’m perfectly willing not to ever again , though , if having fat readers will just ruin everything for you .
Anyway , Republicans are all fat ?
Glenn Beck , fatass ?
Ann Coulter , fatass ?
Mitt Romney , fatass ?
Michelle Malkin , fatass ?
Really ?
And just how fat are Sarah Palin and John McCain themselves ?
How is Matt going to scare us to death about them , if the Fat Bat is knocked out of his grimy little paws ?
Oh , but no , he does n’t mean prominent Republicans are fat — he means those dingbat sows at home who are as indiscriminate about what they eat as about what data they lap up .
If it comes in a pretty wrapper , they ’ll scarf it by the truckload without asking , because that ’s what fat people do !
Therefore , fat people all love Sarah Palin .
Matt just proved it .
How much do you think Matt Taibbi gets paid to write this stuff for RS every month ?
Ten thousand a month ?
Fifteen ?
Twenty ?
More ?
You ’d think , then , that for that kind of money , there might have been a little bit of , ahem , vision , to go with his invective .
The word that kept leaping to mind when I read about his depiction of “ Gidget address[ing ] the Reichstag ” and the eediots
Matt is thinner and better than who hung on her every word , was this : Embarrassing .
Because Matt , when he filed his story , had no idea that it was even possible for this woman to go up in flames the way she has over the last six weeks .
He had no idea that all those Stupid Americans were not as easily led as he thought .
But hey , we were fat .
And we lived in middle America , far far away from the lovely slender white parts of Manhattan .
How was he supposed to know any of us could think ?
( Oh , and N.B. : Careerism and wanting to write like Hunter S. Thompson , which Matt Taibbi obviously wants so badly he can smell his frontal lobe molting with desire for it , do n’t mix .
Because in order to write like Hunter S. Thompson , you have to sink your entire brain into hot Crisco two feet deep until it singes , roll it around in powdered ketamine , then toss it back into the boiling grease and crank it up to 13 until the fire department shows up .
And accept the fact that you probably wo n’t even be able to type your name straight after the age of 40 .
And … and … yeah . )
Oh , but it gets even better .
Later on in the story , there ’s this :
Here ’s what Sarah Palin represents : being a fat fucking pig who pins “ Country First ” buttons on his man titties and chants “ U - S - A ! U - S - A ! ” at the top of his lungs while his kids live off credit cards and Saudis buy up all the mortgages in Kansas .
Dude .
You complain that Sarah Palin is “ all caricature ” and then you puke up that ?
I will bet a lifetime supply of the McDonald ’s fries you probably secretly love to eat that you are one of those fauxgressives who thinks of Barack Obama as “ one of the good black people , ” although you ’d never be so impolitic as to utter those actual words to your neohipster brethren ( though Joe Biden more or less did , and now the poor guy will just have to settle for being vice president ) .
Because I am now going to call out that pair of bent clownshoes for what it really is : Racist , sexist , classist , and ablist .
Yes , that ’s right .
Racist , sexist , classist and ablist .
And do n’t give me “ but I was talking about a white guy with plenty of money who can move around just fine . ”
Here is why .
What you are saying , by putting down this mythic dude whose politics you do n’t care for as “ fat , ” is that he does not appear white ( i.e. classically chiseled from head to toe in keeping with White Anglo - Saxon Protestant appearance standards ) or male ( i.e. strong , tough , able , hardworking breadwinner ) enough for your personal yuppie aesthetics .
Like all fat - haters , you have taken a bunch of human properties socially engineered to be squirm - inducing — non-WASPiness , non-ableness , non-youthfulness , non-affluentness , and non-gender - binaryness — smooshed them all up into a ball with manboobs , and rationalized all the squirming by deciding on the basis of evidence flimsier than a Charmin airplane that he did it to himself , and thus it ’s absolutely fine to declare open season .
Therefore ?
CLOWNSHOES .
( Oh , and just as an aside ?
It really does not matter if Matt Taibbi himself is a WASP or not .
If only WASPs bought into WASP behavior and appearance standards , those standards would be deader than Heil Honey , I ’m Home !. )
And here ’s the fauxgressive twist to all this fathatebaggery , which I ’ve been around enough leftish Web sites to witness over the years , which is this :
It ’s okay to make fun of fat people you do n’t like , but it ’s not okay to make fun of fat people you do like .
In other words , Ralph Nader calling Michael Moore a giant beach ball is unkosher , but John Kerry calling Rush Limbaugh “ doughy ” ( or yes , Al Franken writing a entire bestselling book whose title refers to Limbaugh ’s avoirdupois , although that was over a decade ago ) is just rockin’ , because no reasonable person likes Limbaugh anyway .
They do not see that by insulting Rush Limbaugh for being fat , they are also insulting Michael Moore .
Because by doing so , you are ( whether you intend to or not ) folding your arms and demanding that Moore prove he ’s better , smarter , more sensitive and aware , etc. , than your average fatass at the Republican convention .
A thin guy does n’t have to supply that extra proof that he ’s okay , that ’s implicit until he proves otherwise .
See ?
That ’s what ’s wrong with America , and for that matter , with most of the rest of the planet , Matt .
People thinking they know someone just from looking at them .
Here ’s the thing .
I have not actually seen a full - body image of Rush Limbaugh in many years .
Nor do I care to .
Rush Limbaugh is a festering projectile hatezit crying out for moral Accutane .
His words repulse me enough ; I do not give a simpering fuck if today , right this second , he looks like Jeff Bridges or like Jar Jar Binks or , for that matter , exactly like me .
( Would n’t that be a kick in the head .
I really really hope not , though . )
Mostly , though , putting down someone ’s looks as shorthand for their rotten ideas is just plain lazy , and is n’t laziness one of the things the Matt Taibbis of the world allegedly despise us for ?
Or , as Melissa McEwan once put it in her brilliant piece about Ann Coulter and the unfelicitousness of all the Coulter - is - a - tranny putdowns :
Ann Coulter is the high priestess of screeching hyperbole , whose natural habitat is the nearest studio chair on a right - wing cable hatefest , from whence she spews her bile - rich nuggets of insane vitriol like a mama bird projectile vomiting chunks of hate fuel to nourish her repellent babies , as they sit , gape - mouthed and wanting , waiting for their vile supper on couches in front of tellies across the nation so they may ever stay plump with outrage .
And not only is she a monstrous font of diarrheic vitriol who disgorges a continual torrent of loathsome rhetoric to poison the public discourse ; the frequency with which she manages to emit accurate ( and original ) assertions is approximate to photographic evidence of unicorns .
She is as devoid of facts as she is of kindness and compassion .
I ’ve heard more astute political observations from a pile of day - old puke — and it did n’t have to plagiarize , either .
And you expect me to care about her oversized forehead ?
Seriously ?
Now , someone tell me why Liss is n’t the one making five figures a month writing for Rolling Stone .
I ’ll be in the living room I do n’t own , hunched over my voter pamphlet .

Advertisement Thousands of passengers hoping to travel through the Channel Tunnel face further disruption after a fire .
Both the tunnel operator Eurotunnel and Eurostar have said passengers with travel plans for Friday night and the weekend should find alternative routes .
The tunnel was closed after fire broke out on a freight train about seven miles from Calais on Thursday .
Thirty - two people on board were led to safety .
Fourteen had suffered minor injuries , including smoke inhalation .
The 16 - hour blaze was put out on Friday morning .
Passengers were still arriving at St Pancras International in London on Friday hoping services to the Continent would resume .
But later on Friday Eurotunnel said services remained suspended for Saturday and Sunday .
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CHANNEL TUNNEL - 11 SEPTEMBER 2008
Fire started on lorry ( 1 ) just before 1500 BST on train from Folkestone to Calais .
Lorry drivers heard series of explosions .
They broke windows ( 2 ) to get out of amenity car .
Altogether 32 people , including seven Britons , were evacuated into service tunnel ( 3 ) .
The operator said passengers due to make return journeys on Saturday or Sunday were advised to arrive at the Port of Calais or Port of Dover where their return travel would be honoured by other cross-channel operators .
The firm said while it wanted rail services to resume as quickly as possible it could happen only once approval had been given by the authorities at the French end .
Rail company Eurostar said about 30,000 passengers had been due to travel on 50 services on Friday , and would be offered a full refund or exchange .
Speaking from St Pancras International finance manager Kirsty McIntyre said she had planned to spend the weekend in the Champagne region .
She said they checked Eurostar 's website on Thursday evening : " It just said delays are expected but it did n't say anything about cancelled services , so we came today and it 's not happening .
We are going to see if we can get a bus to Dover and a ferry to Calais . "
Others who had planned to take the Eurostar on Thursday and were unable to get hotel accommodation were forced to sleep in the station .

The tunnel carries Eurostar express trains between London , Paris and Brussels , as well as freight and passenger shuttles between Folkestone and Calais .
The source of the blaze has not yet been identified but French officials say a lorry carrying chemicals , which is understood to have overturned on the freight train , was close to the seat of the fire .
It was carrying the chemical phenol , a toxic product used by the pharmaceutical industry .
Eurotunnel chairman Jacque Gounon - who earlier said they hoped to return to half capacity during Friday - said the north tunnel , where the fire took place , would be closed for several weeks .
The BBC's Europe editor , Mark Mardell , said Mr Gounon would not speculate on the cause of the fire , saying only that nothing had been ruled out or in .
He added an investigation could only begin once the affected area had cooled down enough to enable the removal of the train .
France 's transport minister Dominique Bussereau told French radio station Europe - 1 the cause appeared to be " something accidental " .
Exhausting conditions
The blaze broke out yesterday just before 1500 BST on a train carrying lorries from Folkestone to Calais .
Thirty - two people , including seven Britons , were evacuated to the service tunnel and a train ferried them to France .
More than 300 French and British firefighters tackled the blaze overnight and some 27 vehicles were affected .
Chief Fire Officer Bill Feeley , of Kent Fire and Rescue Service , said a large crew had been needed because of the difficult and tiring conditions and would remain in place until the emergency services were satisfied the fire was completely extinguished .
A French police spokesman said the main seat of the fire was extinguished at 0700 BST after burning for more than 16 hours .

Firefighters then spent two hours smothering minor fires nearby , he said .
Kent Fire and Rescue Service has now said they were " scaling down " their efforts .
Two fire engines were still at the scene with 12 firefighters and specialist crews , a spokeswoman said .
" The bi-national status of the operation was lifted at midday so it is now a French incident , " she said .
" Eurotunnel has retaken control of the infrastructure and its technicians have started to carry out a physical inspection so operations can resume in the south tunnel . "
John Keefe , a Eurotunnel spokesman , said much of the tunnel was unaffected by the blaze .
" Two thirds of the tunnel are still open , " he said .
" So we believe we should be able to get services back into operation very quickly . "
Transport chaos
The closure has caused huge tailbacks on roads near the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone as dozens of lorries have been forced to park on the M20 and other surrounding roads .
Kent Police say sections of the motorway - between junctions eight and nine - are still being used to queue lorries as part of Operation Stack and are advising motorists to avoid the area .
Sections of the M20 remain closed
An estimated 2,000 lorries are delayed by between six to eight hours .
Superintendent Peter Wedlake said : " We anticipate there will be some congestion .
" People heading coastbound from Maidstone down towards Folkestone and Dover wo n't be able to use the M20 . "
Eurolines , which is part of National Express , says it has increased the number of coaches on its services to Paris and Brussels to help passengers stranded on both sides of the Channel Tunnel .
The Channel Tunnel has suffered several incidents since it opened to traffic in 1994 although only one - a fire in 1996 - caused injuries .
The fire caused £ 200 m worth of damage and burned for more than five hours , wrecking the concrete lining and facilities over about half a mile of tunnel .
In August 2006 , 34 people had to be led to safety after a fire broke out on a lorry being carried on a freight train .
Security exercises are staged in the Channel Tunnel by police , fire and ambulance services from both England and France to ensure preparedness for such incidents .

Recently we bought a OCZ NIA device for our lab .
Having designed similar hardware myself , I simply * had to * take the thing apart to inspect it , as others have done -- see Joe Pit 's teardown ( with schematic ! ! ) .
Of course , I graciously let the others try it for a few hours ( it does n't work all that well ) before taking the anodized , extruded , surface - ground aluminum case apart .
Below is the top side of the 4 - layer circuit board inside the case , as well as a key to indicate the function of the labeled devices .
( some of the labels are hard to read due to the clutter of the silkscreen on the board ; sorry ) .
A - Input connector .
Center channel is isolated ground ; outside two channels are the signal .
They had to make this custom so people could n't plug it into other ( possibly dangerous ) stuff .
B - Input current limiting resistors , in series with signal , 4.02K
C - Dual capacitor from input channels to shared ground ( I think ; the cap has 4 contacts , 2 at the end , 2 in the middle ; I assume they use this package to get very accurately matched capacitance so as not to hurt the CMRR of the instrumentation amplifier ) .
D - Gain- setting resistor , 1.00 K .
Sets the instrumentation amplifier gain to 50 ( I think ) .
I do not know what devices were intended for the 1206 footprints above and below this resistor ...
E - Instrumentation amplifier , Analog Devices logo , AD8220 by my guess , A - grade .
Measures the difference in voltage between the two input channels ( left and right electrodes on the headband ) .
F - 47 ohm resistors & capacitors to filter the power supply to the instrumentation amplifier .
H - Opamp , Texas Instruments OPA348A .
Looks like it is used as feedback to the instrumentation amplifier reference pin to effect highpass operation ( ? ) .
I - Quad opamp , TI OPA4348A .
Used to filter the signal ; I did not go through the filter topology , but they might have copied it off the AD8220 datasheet ;)
J - Stereo ADC , Texas Instruments ( Burr - Brown logo , TI bought BB ) PCM1803A .
Only one channel is used .
24 bits , 96 khz max sampling rate ; device in master mode ( Mode1 = 0V , Mode0 = 3.3v ) ; Fs = SCLK / 512 -> sampling rate = 3.90625 KHz .
K - Three channel digital isolator , Analog Devices ADUM1300 .
Transmits the ADC's DOUT , BCK , and LRCLK signals to the USB ( non-isolated ) side .
L - Two - channel optical (? ) isolator ; unknown type ; used to drive the ADC 's SCLK and some other signal ?
from Joe Pits : " Yeah , optical isolator with logic gates for high speed I guess ( HCPL2631S ) .
I 'm also not sure what the second signal does , it goes to U4 ( JSR marking ) .
I suspect it could be a switch which adds C14 + R17 in the feedback loop of U2C ( see the schematic ) .
But I do n't know what the reason for this is . "
M - Isolated supply daughterboard , Texas Instruments logo , very simple design : driver is 2 BJTs ( which get hot ! ) in push - pull topology ; bases are driven by windings on the toroidal transformer ; transformer center tap seems to go to USB VCC .
Output is +- 5V .
N - +3.9V , +3.3 , and - 3.9V power supply circuitry .
I cannot identify the SOT - 23 - 5's and SC - 70 's here .
O - PIC18F2455 , with USB 2.0 ( obviously ! ) SOIC - 28 package .
device comes up as ( on my Linux box , Debian Lenny , kernel 2.6.24 ) :
usb 4 - 1 : new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 8
hiddev96hidraw1 : USB HID v1.10 Device [ Brain Actuated Technologies Neural Impulse Actuator Prototype 1.0 ] on usb-0000:00:1a.1-1
I 'll put up a usbmon trace later , maybe .
P - Transistors for driving the tricolor LEDS on the bottom of the board .
Q - 16.0000 MHz crystal .
Needed for correct USB timing ; clocks the PIC at 48 Mhz .
R - USB type B connector .
Note the ferrites to the left .
( I though they were fuses , but I accidentally shorted Vdd to ground while probing the programming connector , and these let out a little smoke rather than blowing completely .
Had they been fuses , they would be open circuit now .
This is consistent with Joe Pit 's analysis . )
S - 74HCT595A 8 - bit shift registers , to convert the serial data into parallel data for the PIC to read in .
3 devices = 24 bits in total .
Note that the 74HCT595A has a output enable , which permits the PIC to read the 3 bytes of the sample sequentially .
Otherwise , as Stefan Jung ( via the openeeg - list ) points out , the PIC would not have enough data pins ( 28 pins vs. 24 bits ) !
T - 74HCT393 , Texas Instruments logo , Dual 4 - bit binary ripple counter .
Used to drive the ADC with a 2 Mhz clock , which puts the sampling rate at ( as before ) 3.90625 KHz .
U - Programming connector .
That 's right , a programming connector !
Looks to be the same as a PIC ICSP connector ( pointed out on hack a day )
Looks to be the same as a PIC ICSP connector ( pointed out on hack a day )
So far as I can tell :
Pin 1 = +5V , PIC pin 1 , ( through 100 ohm resistor ) , Vpp ( ? )
Pin 2 = PIC pin 20 , Vdd
Pin 3 = PIC pin 19 , Vss
Pin 4 = PIC pin 28 ( through 100 ohm resistor ) , PGD
Pin 5 = PIC pin 27 ( through 100 ohm resistor ) , PGC
I do not know if the device can be reprogrammed , though it looks that way .
if the device can be reprogrammed , though it that way .
from here - bootloader ( to address 0x07 ff ) can be read , but everything above that is read - protected .

Bits from the Debian GNU / Hurd porters
From : Michael Banck < mbanck - AT- debian.org >

Subject : Bits from the Debian GNU / Hurd porters Date : Mon , 15 Sep 2008 12:07:16 +0200 Message -ID : <20080915100716.GY24267@nighthawk.chemicalconnection.dyndns.org >
Hello , it has been more than three years since the last " Bits from the Debian GNU / Hurd porters " [ 1 ] , high time for an update on the port .
* Snapshot releases
Three new snapshot releases have been done by Philip Charles , K14 , K15 ( which was only done as an updated mini CD - ISO , not a full snapshot ) , and K16 . K16 has been released [ 2 ] on December 18th , 2007 featuring four CDs or two DVDs .
Additionally , it also features a ready - to - go qemu-image [ 3 ] for the first time .
K16 was also the first snapshot which included TLS ( Thread Local Storage ) , a requirement for modern glibcs .
New ported packages include Qt3 , Qt4 , SDL and Emacs22 . * Base and toolchain status Currently , most base packages are current , with the notable exception of util - linux , which has been a big problem over the last years .
However , Samuel Thibault got all outstanding issues of util - linux applied upstream so the version in experimental is mostly working .
The toolchain is in pretty good shape as well since TLS support got implemented ; we are using the current glibc , binutils and gcc Debian packages unmodified .
* Xen support Besides qemu , which can be very slow to run , a Xen DomU port for GNU Mach has been made available by Samuel Thibault .
It requires a non-PAE hypervisor and some minor manual tweaking , but is otherwise quite functional and stable already , see its wiki page [ 4 ] for further information .
This will make people running the Hurd less dependent on specific hardware , as a lot of newer computers do not work with the underlying GNU Mach kernel anymore .
* Autobuilder availability and archive coverage improved
The percentage of packages built for Debian GNU / Hurd has improved from 40 % to now nearly 60 % [ 5 ] since the last Bits from the porters .
Further , the backlog of outdated packages has been greatly reduced .
This is due to the addition of two [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Xen autobuilders earlier this year , which made the hurd - i386 autobuilders far more robust and fault - tolerant as they not need local admin attention anymore in case of problems with the GNU / Hurd guests .
The remaining 40 % of packages are either waiting for other packages to become available ( see [ 8 ] for a ( big ) graph of those relationships ) or are failing for some reason [ 9 ] ; a complete list of build failures can be found at [ 10 ] .
* Developer machine
We are currently working on getting a general DD - accessible porter box setup .
In the meantime , interested people can contact hurd-shell-account@gnu.org to get an account on one of the publically accessible ( Debian ) GNU / Hurd developer machines .
For further details , see [ 11 ] .
* Summer of Code 2008
This year , the GNU Hurd participated as its own organization at Google 's Summer of Code , thanks to the coordination done by Olaf Buddenhagen [ 12 ] .
All of the 5 projects were carried out quite successfully .
The most practically relevant project for Debian GNU / Hurd was the implementation of a procfs translator [ 13 ] by Madhusudan C.S. , which provides a traditional Unix - style / proc file system and the subsequent porting of the procps package , so utilities like pgrep etc. will be available after lenny , and procps Build - Depends no longer need to be special - cased on hurd - i386 .
Other GSoC projects were lisp bindings by Flavio Cruz , better system debugging and tracing by Andrei Barbu , namespace - based translator selection by Sergiu Ivanov and network virtualization by Zheng Da .
More information on the details and outcome of those projects can be found on the wiki [ 14 ] .
* Still no debian - installer Unfortunately , the Debian GNU / Hurd port still lacks d-i support .
On the other hand , debootstrap now mostly works , even to cross - debootstrap a hurd - i386 installation from GNU / Linux , if one works around bug # 498731 .
A relatively easy solution could be to use the GNU / Linux d-i to cross-install and setup a Debian GNU / Hurd system .
People who have experience in d-i and possibly Debian GNU / Hurd are more than welcome to contact us at debian-hurd@lists.debian.org . for the Debian GNU / Hurd porters , Michael Banck [ 1 ]

Jazz Arranging An Interactive Course on Jazz Arranging written by the legendary Bill Evans bassist and professor of jazz
The software development department might envision a marvelous solution to the company 's IT or business need , but the technology goal can't be achieved unless the Big Boss commits to the new strategy .
How do you get there — and ensure that the user need really is filled ?
The key , say three former CIOs , is accurate business process requirements , a common language for the business and IT to communicate , and executive steering .
" It 's what happens before a project gets to IT that often creates the challenges , " says Brian Kilcourse , former CIO of Longs Drug Stores , and now a managing partner at Retail Systems Research .
While conflicting demands for IT resources and the propensity for a short - term view are significant challenges , he says , the most basic quality issue that IT efforts face is a lack of business involvement .
" Businesses tend to think of IT efforts as separate from their overall strategic agenda , in spite of the fact that to a large extent it is a company 's ability to use its digital assets effectively that distinguish winners from losers , " he says .
Bob Doyle , former CIO of Alliant Foodservice ( formerly Kraft Foodservice ) , agrees .
" My major challenge — the reason I was brought in to five different companies in four distinct industries — was to enable major business change by implementing integrated IT application solutions that fundamentally changed the way the business operated .
And do it as quickly as possible , " says Doyle , who now runs a consulting firm .
Management staff usually did not fully understand their role or responsibility in the development process , he says , so they felt no accountability .
Plus , says Doyle , who has more than 30 years experience with Fortune 100 and smaller companies , company management had no process to involve , manage and set expectations .
For an IT strategy to succeed — or simply to sell the business on a major development project — you need full executive buy - in and support .
Reports Kilcourse , a CIO friend of his said it simply : the most important word a CIO must learn is " No , " and his most important skill is to say it when the business is n't ready to commit .
" Top level guidance and visibility is an absolute must , " Kilcourse adds .
Given the challenge , how does one address it ?
Winning the Boss ' Trust
To win over the business side , Doyle suggests three overall solutions :
Educate at all management levels : explain and engage .
Establish Executive IT strategy committees to create a formal executive and management reporting and feedback process .
Win their confidence and trust by demonstrating successful implementations .
A successful CIO of a $ 60 billion company once told Kilcourse that the perfect IT budget was one that was 100 percent allocatable to business initiatives .
" That might be a little bit of hyperbole , " he says , " But it 's a stretch goal that companies should try to reach . "
Doyle says , " The business exec is concerned with , ' Will I get the system when I need it , for the price I agreed to , and will it perform as requested ( meet expectations ) ? '
Whereas the CIO is also looking across all projects to determine manpower requirements and effective resource allocation . "
That makes it even more important to gauge the progress of a project .
Unfortunately , says Doyle , most development departments are very weak in collecting and reporting meaningful metrics .
Disparate processes and lack of tools can make it very difficult to accurately report a development team 's efforts to both IT management and business partners .
Most data is collected and reported manually , which is labor intensive , not timely and prone to error , he says .
" Often , you had to rely on ' gut ' experience and judgment when explaining the ' health ' of a project , " says Doyle .
Doyle suggests that IT managers explore recently available tools , such as CIO dashboards , which are integrated into the software development process .
Doing so , he says , can facilitate the collection and reporting of development activities — and improve communication with the business people .
A Common Language for the Business and IT
Visibility into IT processes and services is a must , says Kilcourse .
" The biggest part of that is getting agreement on what will be measured , and then measuring it , " he says .
He urges IT managers to develop a common language that both IT and the business can use to communicate about both a problem 's business description and its technical description .
" [ That language ] needs to map its processes and their output ( always , digital assets ) to the business , and not leave it to the business to figure it out .
Inevitably , that leads to development methodologies and portfolio management techniques . "
Sponsoring business leaders lose the thread of IT driven change initiatives pretty early in the process , Kilcourse says , usually between requirements definition and system specification phases .
That happens when they can't understand the correlations between the requirements and the use cases that define how the requirement will be met .
The fault here may not be all on the business side , though .
IT might think it got the use cases right , only to discover — usually much later — that the scope is wrong .
" This , more than any other reason that I can think of , is why projects fail , " says Kilcourse .
Part of a CIO 's job , says Kilcourse , is to create and maintain the " bubble " wherein software engineers can stay focused and do what they 're paid to do .
But that is very hard to do in an " open " environment where there is free interplay between IT 'ers and their business cohorts .
Creating that bubble really boils down to getting the " contract " right at the outset : what will be built , what it will do , what it wo n't do , and ( most important ) how it will set a foundation for future value generation , says Kilcourse .
That means you need to put extra emphasis on finding out what users and the business executives truly want and to communicate it effectively .
" User requirements , no matter what the development style , must be rigorously developed , detailed and documented , " says Frank J. Fanzilli Jr. , the former managing director and Global CIO of Credit Suisse First Boston , from which he retired in 2002 after 18 years of service .
Rigorous change control processes need to be mutually agreed upon and adhered to , he says .
Kilcourse agrees .
" The most important thing to get down is the process , and then the rules and data that the process need .
As they say , ' A picture is worth a thousand words , ' and there are good tools today that define or describe business processes — often in easy to understand graphic form .
Having business operatives and IT 'ers working on these together is crucial . "
Even a great staff who understands the business functions they support very well is , at the end of the day , just IT folks with a somewhat idealized view of reality , he points out .
" Any coder will tell you that it 's the exception logic that complicates a program — and the same is true for business processes .
So you need the operations professionals to help define what is and what will be .
Then IT can start talking about the digital assets needed to get the agreed - upon process to flow . "
To get others to buy into your solution , you need to understand them — and there is no substitute for getting to know your users as well as you can , adds Fanzilli .
" Developers are very cognizant of the impact that user involvement has on them .
Requirements definition , change control , education and the like have a significant impact upon their lives , and they know that by experience .
He says , " One problem is that they may not see it as their role to help manage those processes . "

A new JavaScript Engine has hit the pavement running :
The new V8 engine ( powering the brand - new Google Chrome browser ) .
There are now a ton of JavaScript engines on the market ( even when you only look at the ones being actively used in browsers ) :
JavaScriptCore :
The engine that powers Safari / WebKit ( up until Safari 3.1 ) .
Squirrel
Fish : The engine used by Safari 4.0 .
Note :
The latest WebKit nightly for Windows crashes on Dromaeo , so it ’s passed for now .
V8 : The engine used by Google Chrome .
SpiderMonkey :
The engine that powers Firefox ( up to , and including , Firefox 3.0 ) .
TraceMonkey :
The engine that will power Firefox 3.1 and newer ( currently in nightlies , but disabled by default ) .
Futhark :
The engine used in Opera 9.5 and newer .
IE JScript : The engine that powers Internet Explorer .
There have , already , been a number of performance tests run on the above browsers – and a few of those runs have also included the new Chrome browser .
It ’s important to look at these numbers and try and gain some perspective on what the tests are testing and how those numbers relate to actual web page performance .
We have three test suites that we ’re going to look at :
SunSpider : The popular JavaScript performance test suite released by the WebKit team .
Tests only the performance of the JavaScript engine ( no rendering or DOM manipulation ) .
Has a wide variety of tests ( objects , function calls , math , recursion , etc . )
the performance of the JavaScript engine ( no rendering or DOM manipulation ) .
Has a wide variety of tests ( objects , function calls , math , recursion , etc. ) V8 Benchmark : A benchmark built by the V8 team , only tests JavaScript performance – with a heavy emphasis on testing the performance of recursion .
tests JavaScript performance – with a heavy emphasis on testing the performance of recursion .
Dromaeo : A test suite built by Mozilla , tests JavaScript , DOM , and JavaScript Library performance .
Has a wide variety of tests , with the majority of time spent analyzing DOM and JavaScript library performance .
SunSpider
Let ’s start by taking a look at some results from WebKit ’s SunSpider test ( which covers a wide selection of pure - JavaScript functionality ) .
Here is the break down :
We see a fairly steady curve , heading down to Chrome ( ignoring the Internet Explorer outliers ) .
Chrome is definitely the fastest in these results – although the results from the new TraceMonkey engine are n’t included .
Brendan Eich pulled together a comparison , last night , of the latest TraceMonkey code against V8 .
We already see TraceMonkey ( under development for about 2 months ) performing better than V8 ( under development for about 2 years ) .
The biggest thing holding TraceMonkey back , at this point , is its recursion tracing .
As of this moment no tracing is done across recursive calls ( which puts TraceMonkey as being about 10 x slower than V8 at recursion ) .
Once recursion tracing lands for Firefox 3.1 I ’ll be sure to revisit the above results .
Google Chrome Benchmark
The Chrome team released their own benchmark for analyzing JavaScript performance .
This includes a few new tests ( different from the SunSpider ones ) and is very recursion - heavy :
We can see Chrome decimating that other browsers on these tests .
Its debatable as to how representative these tests are of real browser performance , considering the hyper- specific focus on minute features within JavaScript .
Note TraceMonkey performing poorly :
It ’s unable to benefit from any of the tracing due to the lack of recursion tracing ( as explained above ) .
Dromaeo with DOM
Finally , let ’s take a more holistic look at JavaScript performance .
I ’ve been working on the Dromaeo test suite , adding in a ton of new DOM and JavaScript library tests .
This assortment provides a much stronger look at how browsers might perform under a normal web browsing situation .
Considering that most web pages are being held back by the performance of the DOM ( think table sorters and the like ) and not , necessarily , the performance of JavaScript ( games , graphics ) it ’s important to look at these particular details for extended analysis .
The results of a run against the JavaScript , DOM , and library tests ( thanks to Asa Dotzler for helping me run the tests ) :
( No results for IE were provided as the browser crashes when running the tests , unfortunately – also I had trouble getting the WebKit nightlies , with Squirrelfish , to run on Windows , see bug 20626 . )
We see a very different picture here .
WebKit - based engines are absolutely ahead – but Chrome is lagging behind the latest release of Safari .
And while there is a small speed improvement while using TraceMonkey , over regular Firefox , the full potential wo n’t be unlocked until tracing can be performed over DOM structures ( which it is currently incapable of – may not be ready until Firefox 3.2 or so ) .
One thing is clear , though :
The game of JavaScript Performance leapfrog is continuing .
With another JavaScript engine in the mix that rapid iteration will only have to increase – which is simply fantastic for end users and application developers .
Update : I ’ve posted results for Safari 4.0 wherever I could .

Whether you ’re a Web developer , Web designer or blogger , you ’ve probably had to deal with the headache of converting many images to different sizes and formats .
It ’s not much fun if you have to convert all of them by hand .
Batch image processing can reduce this process from hours of work to just a few simple clicks .
Whether you ’re a Web developer , Web designer or blogger , you ’ve probably had to deal with the headache of converting many images to different sizes and formats .
It ’s not much fun if you have to convert all of them by hand .
Batch image processing can reduce this process from hours of work to just a few simple clicks .
With batch image processing , you can specify a size or file type , and then a script runs to convert the images .
You can process hundreds or thousands of images with just a few clicks .
And nearly every image processor comes with a unique feature set .
You may want to take a look at the following related posts :
Many of the articles here on Smashing Magazine have screenshots that have to be resized and configured to fit within the website ’s layout .
We use batch image processors to quickly resize all of the screenshots and larger images that we feature in the articles .
Types of Batch Processors
Batch image processors usually come with some very standard functions :
Resizing images ,
Scaling images ,
Converting to different image formats .
Some image processors also perform some advanced functionality , such as graphic editing ( rotating , blurring , borders , adding watermarks ) , and some can even create slideshows , display other types of multimedia and perform other advanced functions .
Image processors are worth their weight in gold if you ’re a designer or developer spending a good chunk of time converting images by hand in Photoshop .
Let ’s take a look at 15 useful batch image processors for both Mac and PC .
Use Photoshop CS3 to Batch Convert Images
Adobe Photoshop is far and away the most popular image processor for designers , so some might prefer the option of using the native tools provided by Photoshop .
Photoshop comes with many advanced features , and one of them is the ability to batch convert image files .
According to the Photoshop documentation , it ’s as simple as choosing either :
File > Scripts > Image Processor ( Photoshop ) or
Tools > Photoshop > Image Processor ( Bridge ) ,
and then selecting the images or file that you want to convert .
Once you ’ve selected them , select a location where you would like to save the files , select the file types you ’d like to convert to along with any other configuration options and click “ Run . ”
Advanced Batch Converter ( Win )
Advanced Batch Converter is a Windows - only program that can convert images to over 120 different file formats on the fly and can convert over 25 different types of images .
Aside from the ability to convert images , the software can also do basic photo editing , such as cropping and resizing images .
There is a 30 - day free trial , and after that the software costs $ 49.95 .
Irfran View ( Win )
Irfran View is a freeware application for Windows users .
Aside from converting images , Irfran View has many unique features , like a multimedia player , hotkeys , and many more .
Infran View also allows you to extend the software by using plug-ins .
DBP - David ’s Batch Processor ( Linux , Mac OS X , Win )
David ’s Batch Processor is a Gimp plug - in that performs batch editing functions on images .
Instead of having to download a separate program , Gimp users can simply call the plug - in from within Gimp .
The user simply selects the images that he or she wants to resize and creates a quick ruleset that will process the images .
However , the plug - in is only intended to resize RGB images , not indexed images .
The plug - in is licensed under the open - source GPL license .
Image Converter .EXE
( Win )
Image converter .exe is a free image converter that is set up slightly differently than other batch processors in that it offers a Conversion Wizard .
The Conversion Wizard allows users who do n’t have much experience with batch image processing to quickly and easily convert and rename images .
EasyBatchPhoto ( Mac )
EasyBatchPhoto is a fast and responsive batch image processor for the Mac. EasyBatch
Photo can easily watermark images as well , which is a function that many image processors do n’t have .
The tool takes care of many repetitive tasks by processing images with a single drag - and - drop .
A single license costs $ 24 .
Using Automator on a Mac
If you ’re a Mac user , you can batch edit images using a program that comes bundled with OS X : Automator .
Automator essentially allows you to create tiny applications for specific purposes , and you can create one of these applications just for resizing images .
eHow has an excellent tutorial on how to create an Automator action that resizes , names and saves your images to a folder , without having to open Photoshop .
Sizerox ( Mac )
With Sizerox you can drag and drop images or folders into a simple graphical interface , and it will convert the images quickly and rename them if you ’d like .
You can use Sizerox to resize , rename , crop , rotate and watermark hundreds or thousands of images with a single Drag - and - Drop .
Sizerox uses Apple Quicktime to save the resized images , so the quality of the resized images is high .
You can also use the Renamer engine to rename the images while resizing them .
Because the software costs only $ 10 , it wo n’t break the bank either .
It ’s simple , yet effective .
QuickScale ( Mac )
QuickScale is another Mac- only application that is simple and easy to use .
Like photo Drop , QuickScale has the ability to create “ droplets ” ( saved resize presets ) .
It may not have as many features as some other batch image processors , but it has all of the basics and has a short learning curve .
It ’s perfect for the user who only needs basic batch image processing functionality .
A license for QuickScale costs $ 15 .
FastStone Photo Resizer ( Win , free )
FastStone Photo Resizer is a fairly robust image processor .
The software is free for home users and runs on the Windows platform .
It offers a nicer graphical interface than some of the other image processors and also supports droplets .
The tool can convert and rename images in batch mode , resize , crop , change color depth , apply color effects , add text , watermark and border effects and rename images with a sequential number .
Pixillion Image Converter ( Win , free )
The Pixillion Image Converter can convert just about any image file type , including PDF .
It has a few nice features that other batch image processors do n’t have , like allowing you to right - click an image and resize it from anywhere .
Pixillion is a free application for Windows users .
When the new Alexa ranking system was launched back in April , many of us were disappointed as our ranking position went down .
I read so many blogs that were truly stunned by this change from Alexa , but trust me it was for the better .
Alexa today is more accurate in ranking web sites ; they rank more than 22 million web sites .
Many popular web sites that offer tools and utilities still use Alexa as a major score card .
I know there are a few people who think Alexa has nothing to do with how well your site is doing as far as traffic goes , but they ’re wrong .
Since buying TechJaws back in May , we managed to go from an Alexa rank of 180 K to 71 K where we are currently ranked today .
I analyze my traffic daily and I can confirm the traffic is consistent with how Alexa scores your site .
Your Alexa ranking reflects the interests and surfing habits of the broader population of Web users .
Alexa the “ Web Information Company ” has been around for a long time ( 1996 ) .
I recommend that you download “ Sparky ” at Alexa .
This will show you every site ranking you browse to .
The add - on is free and is located in your browser status bar and it ’s non-intrusive with your web browsing .
Alexa currently gathers approximately 1.6 Terabytes ( 1600 gigabytes ) of Web content per day .
After each snapshot of the Web , which takes approximately two months to complete , Alexa has gathered 4.5 Billion pages from over 16 million sites .
This information tells us that Alexa ranking is from 1 to 22 + million .

Well , now we know what it takes to get a response to legitimate questions about their candidate out of the McCain / Palin campaign : Appear on CNN .
I did so today , on Rick Sanchez 's CNN Newsroom program , where we discussed the Salon piece Max Blumenthal and I co-wrote and its ramifications .
Sanchez was particularly focused on Palin 's connections to the Alaskan Independence Party , so that was the bulk of our discussion .
( I 'll update with the transcript when it 's available . )
[ Update : Here is the transcript . ]
Now , when we were preparing the Salon piece for publication , I contacted the McCain / Palin campaign first by phone to ask for their reactions to our report 's findings .
They asked me to send an e-mail , which I did .
But I never heard a word back from them .
So today , after CNN picked up the story , they were in fact able to elicit the following response :
CNN is furthering a smear with this report , no different than if your network ran a piece questioning Senator Obama 's religion .
No serious news organization has tried to make this connection , and it is unfortunate that CNN would be the first .
We are trying to arrange to have one of the Governor 's people come on air to respond in the event you do run this piece .
A few points about this :
-- A smear by definition is untrue .
However , everything in our story is fully documented .
We 've even posted the relevant documents here so readers can judge the accuracy of the story for themselves .
--
This is not about Sarah Palin 's faith ; it 's about her conduct as a public official .
--
In fact , CNN is not the first network to pick up on this story .
Rachel Maddow at MSNBC in fact featured Blumenthal on her Thursday night broadcast , when the story first broke , to talk about it .
If Team McCain wants to convince anyone this is merely a " smear " , they 're going to have to demonstrate some falsity or distortion first .
What we 've already heard from some Palin defenders is that this report is merely another attempt at " guilt by association . "
But " guilt by association , " by definition , involves an entirely irrelevant association ( which describes the William Ayers " connection " to a T ) .
Palin 's associations with the " Patriot " right , however , are entirely relevant , because they reflect directly on her conduct as a public official and her judgment .
They also , I should add , reflect on a deeper level the kind of right - wing populism she 's been indulging in recent weeks .
It turns out that Psystar , the company being sued by Apple , is owned by two brothers , ages 22 and 24 , according to a story in the Miami Herald , now on Free Republic 's site : Attorneys for Apple are accusing Psystar Corp. , owned by Rudy and Robert Pedraza , of copyright and trademark infringement and breach of contract for building and selling " cloned " computers that run on Apple 's Leopard operating system ....
Rudy and Robert Pedraza , 24 and 22 , grew up tinkering with computers and helping out at their parents ' networking and IT business ....
" Apple had to sue , " attorney Randy Friedberg said Monday from Olshan Law in New York , where he handles intellectual property and technology matters .
" They 're very protective of their IP and their brand . "
Friedberg called the lawsuit " far - reaching " because of its demand to recall all computers Psystar has sold , which Apple estimates is in the thousands .
" I think Apple 's goal was to say : ' Do n't screw with us , ' " Friedberg said .
" And I do believe they 'll end up putting these kids out of business . "
Someone sent me a link to a comment on the Internet alleging a supposed connection between Psystar and a securities fraud case , but after hours of digging , I believe I can demonstrate that it is n't the same folks .
Let me show you what I found .
First , I 'll show you what led to the confusion .
If you go to Wayback and look up www.psystar.com, here are the results .
And here 's the way the website psystar.com looked in 2001 , when it was purportedly an investor site of some kind .
Notice all the links on the left ?
If you mouse over them , you 'll see they all are psystar.com urls .
If you view the source for the Psystar page dated September of 2001 , though , you 'll see that back then , someone there was building a site called RAZORFX.com , but the url was psystar.com .
The webmaster is listed as webmaster at razorfx.com , and there was a link to a graphic , razorfxrings.jpg which is a picture of a map to Psystar .
If you click on the link for support on that same page , you end up here , on Psystar 's current support page .
So there is a link of some kind between Psystar.com and razorfx.com .
The criminal case , 1:08 - cr-00401-DLI -JMA , USA v. Eisner et al , was against two partners in a company called Razor FX .
But hang on a moment .
After researching the criminal case and two civil suits against the Razor FX partners , I think the two sites can be distinguished , because the criminal Information [ PDF ] in the securities fraud case lists the website used for the Ponzi scheme as being razorfx .
net , not com , and the ownership is not the same for the two sites .
BetterWhoIs lists [ fill in the numbers ] one of the partners in the securities fraud case as the owner of razorfx.net ; razorfx.com , however , is listed by Network Solutions as belonging to Expressi Networks , in Miami , as of 2002 , although not at any of the addresses that Charles Arthur reported in the Guardian when trying to figure out who or what Psystar was .
Here are the ARIN details on razorfx.com .
So it appears not to be the same people , although a very weird coincidence that two sites would use the same name .
How a 22 - year - old had a site regarding his portfolio in 2001 , however , is a mystery .
Perhaps he shares a name with his dad .
It 's not something I can explain with current facts .
And while I can imagine all sorts of things , I like to stick to provable facts .
Here 's what razorfx .
net used to look like in 2007 , from Wayback 's list .
Quite a difference from the 2001 investor site calling itself Psystar and linking to razorfx.com , do n't you think ?
Just so no one needs to duplicate all the research I did already , here are the complaints from the two civil cases .
One is Pransky et al v. Eisner et al , and here 's the Complaint [ PDF ] , and the second is Horizon FX Limited Partnership v. Razor FX , Inc. et al , and here 's the Complaint in that litigation and the Amended Complaint [ PDFs ] , brought by the Canadian company , Horizon FX , against Razor FX and both partners .
Razorfx.com shares or shared servers with other sites , which you can see here and here .
Another web site using their servers , with a Miami , FL address , lists a contact name of Esteban Alonso at Emenee Technical .
The address is n't identical to what Charles Arthur published , although it appears to be in the vicinity .
Gizmodo actually visited all the Psystar addresses in April ( scroll all the way down the page to get the full story ) .
The registered agent for Psystar is listed for a number of companies in Florida , all shown on Gizmodo 's site , and the one that is active is at floridatek.com -- FloridaTek -- a computer services company , which if you recall was what Arthur was told Psystar was before it began doing its Apple thing .
So that checks out .
Except that Gizmodo has a warning that some of the pages download an exe , and they show a screenshot of it trying to do so , so they warn not to visit .
Gizmodo links to Tom's Hardware , an interview it did with Rudy Pedraza :
When we asked about Apples EULA for Leopard and that no one was allowed to use Leopard on a computer that wasnt Apple - labeled , Pedraza said " were going to do it whether Steve Jobs likes it or not . "
Uh oh .
Talk about asking for treble damages .
Well .
When you 're in your early 20s , sometimes you talk like that .
Could there be more to this story than just a couple of kids tilting at windmills ?
Of course .
And I 'll keep my eyes open .
But I do n't believe there is a link to the securities fraud people , or at least none that I can find .

The meeting , at the UN , is looking at ways of meeting the Millennium Development Goals - targets on reducing global poverty by the year 2015 .
Donors hope the money will be enough to eradicate malaria by that time .
The money includes $ 1.1 bn ( £ 598 m ) from the World Bank and $ 1.6bn ( £ 870 m ) from the Global Fund to Fight Aids , Tuberculosis and Malaria .

The British government and private organisations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have promised the rest .
Malaria still kills more than a million people each year , according to the World Health Organization .
The funding , will be used to support rapid implementation of the first ever Global Malaria Action Plan ( Gmap ) .
Long - term effort World Bank President Robert Zoellick said in a statement that the extra money would help " sharply reduce the numbers of malaria - related deaths and illness " in the next three years .
According to Gmap 's projections , more than 4.2 million lives can be saved between 2008 and 2015 , if its plan is put into action , and the foundation can be laid for a longer - term effort to eradicate the disease .
The BBC's Heather Alexander says leaders are focusing on eradicating malaria to counter criticisms that the millennium targets will not be met .
If we build on this momentum , we can save million of lives and chart a long - term course for eradication of this disease
Bill Gates British Prime Minister Gordon Brown joined the presidents of Rwanda and Tanzania as well as the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to reassure the world that their goal is achievable .
Alongside the offers of money came reassurance from African leaders that efforts are working .
President Paul Kagame , of Rwanda , said malaria deaths have fallen by more than 60 % in his country .
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is to provide $ 168.7 m ( £ 91 m ) to fund a Malaria Vaccine Initiative for research on a new generation of anti-malaria vaccines .
Microsoft founder Mr Gates said : " We need innovation , new drugs , and the most dramatic thing we need is vaccine .
" If we build on this momentum , we can save million of lives and chart a long - term course for eradication of this disease . "
Britain 's Department for International Development pledged £ 40 m ( $ 73.5 m ) to support the Affordable Medicines Facility for Malaria .
It also pledged to increase its malaria research funding to at least £ 5 m ( $ 9.1 m ) a year by 2010 and supply 20 million of the 125 million bed nets still needed in affected areas .

What are these ?
2/15/09 : This post has been rehashed in light of Mr. Wild 's appearance on the Tyra Banks show further discussing his termination from Subway .
Since this time Subway has enacted a non-discrimination policy protecting employees based on sexual orientation and gender identity .
Please urge them to uphold their policy and reinstate this worker as well as issue an apology .
9/5/08 : " 22 - year - old gay porn star Kurt Wild was fired from his day job at a Subway restaurant outside of St. Louis when a customer recognized him and threatened to boycott the fast food joint if Wild was n't fired .
Wild says in an email :
Hey everyone .
I just wanted to tell everyone that I was just fired from my work at subway because I have done gay porn .
A customer said they would n't even eat there at subway anymore because of my past work and said that if I was n't fired then they would boycott the store .
What I say is , if one person can try to ruin me everywhere I work ... maybe I should take a stand and boycott their store too if they can't let people 's privacy be treated right .
I should have the right to work anywhere I can and it is n't right or fair that people can keep me from working simply because of a " gay " issue .
If a girl did what we do it would probably be ok .. and if a guy does straight porn .. he is bragged about .
When I do gay porn , I feel a bit lynched for the rest of my life .
Not right .
Thanks for reading .- Kurt Wild " ( BGay.com
People have the right to make their own choices , and Mr. Wild should not be fired from employment due to sexual orientation and his former career in pornography .
Sadly the state of Missouri does not have employment protections for people based on sexual orientation so Subway did not violate any laws .
I urge you to join me in calling on Subway to apologize for firing Mr. Kurt Wild at one of their St. Louis locations and letting them know we will not stand for this type of discrimination .
For specific store contact please type in St. Louis , Missouri .

The Netflix Movie Watching World Championship : The Quest for the Popcorn Bowl
underway in New York City ( Credit : Gothamist )
EarthCam Times Square Cam 11 last night at
11:20 PM ( Credit : EarthCam )
Forget David Blaine 's recent antics of hanging upside down for 60 straight hours in New York City 's Central Park .
The real challenge of human endurance commenced yesterday morning about a mile south of Blaine 's stunt , in the middle of Times Square .
There in a makeshift " plexi - glass living room " for the world to see , eight brave souls commenced a competition to determine who is the world 's greatest couch potato .
The contest is sponsored by Netflix , and the winner takes home " a $ 10,000 cash prize , a lifetime subscription to Netflix and the first - ever Popcorn Bowl trophy . "
At stake is a " new Guinness World Record , for most consecutive hours spent watching movies . "
The current record stands at 120 hours and 23 minutes and is held by Ashish Sharma of Mathura , India , who is one of the contestants currently looking to set a new record .
In order to win , the contestants will need to watch 56 movies consecutively over a period of 121 hours .
Their eyes must never leave the screen , except during the 10 - minute breaks they are allowed to take between movies .
" Guinness World Records rules require the contestants to watch films non -stop without averting their eyes from the screen .
Competitors will be given 10 minutes between each movie , or approximately every two hours , to refresh themselves .
Eating , drinking , standing and stretching are allowed as long as eyes are on the screen ...
Medical professionals will monitor the contestants ' conditions throughout the event and assess if contestants are truly ' watching ' or are simply staring blankly at the screen .
" Assuming the competition makes it all the way to its planned conclusion , it is scheduled to end after five days on October 7 .
The first day kicked off with Iron Man , Best in Show , and Ghostbusters .
Several blogs have commented that the first real challenge came last night when the contestants viewed the somnifacient film , The English Patient .
Perhaps more challenging for the contestants will be the potentially boisterous and idiosyncratic New York City crowd that could attempt to distract the contestants from their task .
It might be difficult to stay focused with the Naked Cowboy ( NSFW ) serenading them , or with the fear that an out - of - control taxi cab could come careening through the flimsy , temporary building constructed on a small island that separates two of the business streets in Manhattan .
For these eight people , New York truly is the city that never sleeps .

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has paid tribute to nine soldiers who were wounded in battle , one of whom has life - threatening injuries , and said the Government remains committed to restoring peace in Afghanistan .
The troops were members of a Special Operations Task Group ( SOTG ) detachment fighting an overnight battle with the Taliban in Uruzgan province .
It is the largest number of casualties in a single combat incident suffered by Australian troops since the Vietnam war .
Mr Rudd has told Parliament the operation is still continuing and says Australia will continue to help Afghanistan in the fight against the Taliban .
" The Australian Government remains committed to assisting the people of Afghanistan and their democratically elected Government to achieve a measure of the stability and prosperity that we take for granted in our country , " he said .
" Our adversaries should take heed of the resolve of Australia 's soldiers , the resolve of the Australian Government and the resolve of the Australian people in bringing to an end this unsustainable instability and conflict in Afghanistan .
" On behalf of all Australians let me say our thoughts and our prayers are with the wounded soldiers , their comrades in the field of battle , their families and their loved ones . "
Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson also paid tribute to the wounded troops and their families and agreed with the Prime Minister 's comments .
" I join with the Prime Minister in ensuring that the political will and resolve of this Parliament will remain as firm as it has ever been to see this through and see that we are able to liberate the people of Afghanistan , " he said .
Mr Rudd said those still involved in the operation were undertaking essential but dangerous work which was part of a vital mission .
" The Taliban can never again be allowed to use Afghanistan as a training ground , a hiding place or a launching pad for terrorist operations around the world , " he said .
Five of the soldiers have serious wounds and three others have slight wounds , while one is seriously injured .
The Defence Director - General of Public Affairs , Brigadier Brian Dawson , says the soldiers were wounded by gunfire and grenades .
They were in vehicles at the time of the attack and were evacuated within two hours for further treatment .
Brigadier Dawson says the troops are performing exceptionally well but more fighting can be expected .
" We are of course in the midst of fighting season in Afghanistan , " he said .
" With winter approaching , Taliban extremists are stepping up their activity across the country before the snow falls and the poor weather limits further operations . "
Earlier today Chief of the Defence Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston confirmed the troops were ambushed .
" It 's a very dangerous place and we were involved in an activity with other forces , and I guess we were ambushed and this is what happened , " he said .
The incident follows the death in July of 25 - year - old SAS Signaller Sean McCarthy , the sixth Australian soldier to die in theatre in Afghanistan .
Leading Senate Republican : McCain offers a third Bush term on the economy
What ’s the top message priority for Democrats hoping to win this year ’s presidential election ?
When it comes to defining John McCain , it ’s pretty obvious : he ’d offer more of the same .
On the key issues , McCain and George W. Bush share a script .
McCain is aware of the dangers here — no one wants to be closely associated with the most unpopular president since the dawn of modern polling , and no one wants to run on a “ stay the course ” platform when four out of five Americans believe the country is on the wrong track .
With that in mind , it ’s always encouraging when some leading Republicans seem anxious to make it easier for Democrats to hammer their message home .
Take Rep. Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) , the second highest - ranking Republican in the House .
As a rule , Republicans are supposed to disagree with the Democrats ’ central criticism of the GOP presidential candidate .
But if Blunt & Co. want to tell national television audiences that we ’re right , I could n’t be more pleased .
As Faiz explained very well :
All of this sounds familiar , of course , because it ’s the same approach embraced by the Bush gang for the last eight years .
McCain is n’t in a position to deny his support for Bush ’s economic policies , and apparently , neither are his campaign surrogates in the Senate .
Here ’s the transcript from CNN :
BLITZER : When it comes to domestic economic issues , what is the major difference between President Bush ’s policies , what he wants to do , and what John McCain would do if he were president ?
BLUNT : Well , I think what John McCain wants to do is continue these pro-growth tax policies that our friends on the other side have been talking …
BLITZER : But that ’s what President Bush wants to do too .
BLUNT : And there is nothing wrong with that .
There is nothing wrong with that .
BLITZER : So it would be in effect a third Bush term when it came to pro-growth tax policies ?
BLUNT : It would be .
I think it would be .
And I think that ’s a good thing .
Somehow , I have a hunch , based on the number of Americans who approve of Bush ’s handling of the economy , that most voters are going to disagree .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) - The Bush administration on Friday proposed keeping potentially oil - rich wetlands in Arctic Alaska off - limits to drilling because of their ecological sensitivity , a reversal of its earlier plan .
The Bureau of Land Management proposed a 10 - year leasing moratorium for 430,000 acres of wetlands north and east of vast Teshekpuk Lake in the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska .
Environmentalists and local groups hailed the decision .
“ This plan provides a balanced approach to energy development and wildlife protection , and forms a solid basis for the Bureau of Land Management to proceed with an oil and gas lease sale later this year , ” Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said in a statement .
The area , the North Slope ’s biggest freshwater lake , is considered potentially rich in oil and gas as well as a critical habitat for migrating birds and caribou .
Two years ago , the administration was poised to sell leases to energy companies seeking to drill .
But a lawsuit by environmentalists and native groups forced the agency to revisit the plan in late 2006 .
Extensive public comment , input from the local government and practical considerations contributed to the policy change , said Jim Ducker , an environmental program analyst for the BLM .
Ducker noted that the area is 40 to 70 miles away from any oil - field infrastructure .
“ Our thinking is , it ’s pretty darn unlikely that we ’re going to have any development there ” in the near future , he said .
Ducker said the BLM hopes the new plan will result in a lease sale this fall , to encompass essentially the same area offered for lease by the Clinton administration in 1999 .
Geologists estimate the area holds 2.8 billion barrels of oil , he said , with 800 million barrels in the deferral area .
Environmentalists were pleased with the BLM ’s new plan .
“ It is a win , ” said Stan Senner , executive director of Audubon Alaska , one of the groups campaigning for preservation .
“ I think they ’ve responded to public interest in seeing that the area ’s protected , and it gives people who care about the place time to work on a permanent solution . ”
The BLM statement noted that North Slope Borough Mayor Edward Itta said “ The lease sale can proceed while one of the region ’s most sensitive wildlife habitats will be protected .
It ’s a win-win . ”
The borough , which opposed oil development in the area because it is important to Inupiat Eskimo hunters , was enlisted to help prepare the new plan after a federal judge voided the previous leasing plan .
The 23 million acre National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska , on the central North Slope , was created in 1923 as a potential source of energy for the military .
Despite sporadic exploration drilling since the 1940s , almost all the successful oil development that ensued on the North Slope occurred on state land east of the reserve .
Industry interest in the petroleum reserve resurfaced in the 1990s , after Arco Alaska Inc. discovered the Alpine oil field on state land bordering the federal unit .
Alpine is now operated by Arco successor ConocoPhillips .
While there has never been any commercial oil production in the petroleum reserve , ConocoPhillips and partner Anadarko plan to develop Alpine satellite fields on the federal land there .

James Baker ’s 7 Rules for Running Washington
Across decades and presidencies , he excelled at the sort of deal - making that no longer seems possible .
Here are his most indelible lessons for getting and keeping power in the capital .
Enlarge By Karie Hamilton for USA TODAY Stephanie Papke , 33 , reveals a scar on her left arm from a surgery for a very rare and mysterious bone disease called melorheostosis .
Griffin O'Neal Handout AN INSIDE LOOK AT 'MELO ' AN INSIDE LOOK AT ' MELO ' Enlarge
An X -ray of a patient who has melorheostosis shows bone growth in the affected leg .
The shortened name for the disease may sound like " mellow , " but it 's anything but .
Melorheostosis , or melo , leads new bone to grow irregularly on top of old bone .
Sometimes there 's no pain .
Sometimes the pain is excruciating and can get worse over time .
The new growth on the outside , or cortical , part of the bone can be extremely hard , and surgery is not always an option .
Information is available from the Melorheostosis Association , an all - volunteer organization of patients and parents of patients that works to find the cause , treatments and a cure .

He was jumping it off a large bump that had grown on his left shin .
Just 6 years old , O'Neal thought the bump was a result of the swift kicks a girl he had a crush on was doling out .
His mother , Joanna Cook Moore , thought otherwise .
" My mother looked down and said , ' Well what , Lord Jesus , is that ? ' " recalls O'Neal , the 43 - year - old son of actor Ryan O'Neal and brother of Tatum O'Neal .
BETTER LIFE : News for healthy living
That bump turned out to be the outward signs of a rare and mysterious bone disease called melorheostosis , often referred to by doctors , researchers and patients familiar with it simply as " melo . "
O'Neal had the bump surgically shaved , but it grew back quickly .
As a child , he did n't think much about it .
" I just kind of felt like I was deformed — like I was a genetic misfire of some sort because no one else had it in my family .
I was the guy with the freaky leg — with the Elephant Man leg . "
But over the years the condition has gotten worse .
Much worse .
Today it causes so much pain that when he makes the wrong move , " I'm on the ground and crying like a little girl , " O'Neal says .
" And that 's sad to see a 43 - year - old man on the ground . "
The pain has been so debilitating that O'Neal is on disability from his job making custom guitars because he can't stand .
He has even considered having his leg amputated , but he recently learned that the surgery probably would n't help — and it could actually make things worse .
At this point he 's not quite sure what he 'll do .
But " I 'm scared to death , " he says .
" What 's next ?
I have no idea . "
When it comes to melorheostosis — which afflicts just one in 1 million people — there are more questions than answers .
What doctors do know is what melorheostosis does :
It causes new bone to grow irregularly on top of normal bones .
On X -rays , bones afflicted with melorheostosis often resemble dripping candle wax .
The new growth is often extremely hard — hard enough to actually break surgical equipment — and erratic .
It can range from fairly benign — some patients do n't even know they have it until an X - ray reveals it — to excruciatingly painful and disfiguring when the bone grows into soft tissue and other bones .
It often affects just one bone in the limbs .
But sometimes it spreads .
And sometimes , it can get worse over the course of a patient 's life , as with O'Neal .
That 's also what happened with Stephanie Papke , a business owner in Tacoma , Wash .
Papke was a college volleyball player when she noticed a strange lump on her arm .
The trainers figured it was a calcium deposit .
She simply put a pad over it .
But after college , the bump grew and began " infringing on my nerves and the function of my arm . "
Papke , 33 , had it biopsied and was diagnosed .
She tried an operation that doctors thought might help .
They cut her from elbow to wrist and shaved the bone .
" It was almost as hard as diamonds , " she says .
The bone " grew back immediately . "
And then it became " much more painful .
I will not have another surgery , even if they say it will make it better , because it 's so painful . "
It 's frustrating for doctors and researchers as well .
" It 's such a weird , unusual condition , " says Mary O'Connor , an orthopedic oncologist with the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville .
" The spectrum of symptoms and how patients present is very broad . "
Doctors believe the disease is most likely genetically based and can be influenced by environmental factors , says Jill Helms , a researcher and associate professor in the department of surgery at Stanford University .
But they do n't know for sure .
Papke , for instance , has an identical twin sister who does not have the disease .
" That 's the frustrating part , " Helms says .
And because the disease is so rare , it is often misdiagnosed , says Kathleen Harper , president of the Melorheostosis Association , which she founded eight years ago in hopes of finding others with the condition .
When Harper began the organization , " I had never met another melo patient in my life . "
So Harper , an attorney , started a website , melorheostosis.com .
Today , she knows of 400 patients worldwide .
And this month , the all - volunteer association will hold its fifth annual international convention in Washington , D.C. Recently she met with O'Neal , who has had his own share of difficulties in life .
Those include a turbulent relationship with his father and battles with drugs and alcohol .
And he was found guilty of reckless boating in an accident in 1986 that killed Francis Ford Coppola 's son , Gian - Carlo Coppola .
Today , O'Neal says , he has been sober for two years .
" Now that I 've met the people who are leading the charge on this disease , I 'm right there with them , " O'Neal says .
" I 'm going to help out as much as I possibly can , because I do n't want anyone else to feel what I feel . "

BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
Do not sleep outdoors to save money at the Olympics .
It is banned to “ maintain public hygiene and the cultured image of cities . ”
Do not let the stifling summer heat tempt you into streaking , do not get drunk nor set off fireworks nor wave “ insulting banners . ”
Anyone with mental illnesses or sexually transmitted diseases is banned .
Smoking is not allowed at Olympic venues .
The rules on the organizers ’ official website say it all :
“ Foreigners must respect Chinese laws while in China and must not harm China ’s national security or damage social order . ”
The security - obsessed authorities are taking no chances with the 500,000 tourists set to hit Beijing for the Games .
A battery of surface - to - air missile launchers are being deployed around the showpiece sites .
No detail is too trivial .
Lighters have been banned on domestic flights .
Commuters are being asked to take a swig from water bottles on the subway to ensure they do not contain suspicious substances .
All public swimming pools in Shanghai will check shampoos and body wash .

OBSESSIVE MANAGEMENT
Authorities have promised “ civilized and convenient ” security checks but have been accused of obsessive stage management -- visa restrictions have been tightened for visitors and Beijing is being rid of petitioners , the homeless and migrant workers .
Up to 1,000 Chinese families are opening up their homes to Olympic visitors , a move that would have been unheard of before the reform and opening up of China in the 1980s .
But the hosts could still be in for a culture shock .
Retired school teacher Yuan Xioaoqing , who is opening up her home , said “ Foreign students like to stay out all night on the weekend .
But in more intellectual and traditional Chinese households there is no way the kids would go out like that . ”
Beijing has learnt a lesson from the 1988 Seoul Olympics .
Dog meat is off the menu in the Chinese capital during the Olympics in case animal rights groups are offended .
Exotic names and alarming translations abound in Chinese restaurants which are being given a linguistic makeover , though only in select restaurants .
Out goes the traditionally named “ husband and wife ’s lung slice ” appetizer which is being replaced by the more linguistically correct “ beef and ox tripe in chili sauce . ”
But no mention was made of the many popular establishments that have donkey on the menu .
The authorities have also worked hard to eliminate “ Chinglish ” from road signs and menus in the run-up to the Olympics , even if efforts have been a little hit and miss .
Gone is the infamous “ Racist Park ” signpost for the Ethnic Minorities Park .
Anyone hoping to scoop up a bagful of cheap pirate movies or music could be in for a disappointment .
The city has announced a round - the - clock drive to stamp out bootleg sellers , but pirated DVDs are still available if you know where to look .
Yet however much they are obsessed by security and a burning desire to portray the squeaky clean image of a well ordered society , the Chinese insist the welcome will be warm .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said : “ China is a safe place .
Please be assured .
China is a nation with great hospitality and courtesy . ”

I 've been spending plenty of time talking to people , reading up and listening to various views on the whole financial crisis .
Last week , I asked a bunch of folks I knew in the tech , economics and financial worlds for their thoughts on the situation and I 'm hopeful that I may end up with a few guest posts out of it .
In the meantime , I wanted to start with my own thoughts .
First off : this situation is complicated .
The deeper you dig into it , the more you can begin to sketch out a picture of what 's really happening , but no one ( ) can accurately understand all the different variables at play here .
Anyone claiming to have all the answers is wrong .
They 're either ignorant or lying .
Also , the blame game is n't just pointless , wrong and silly , it 's dangerous .
I 've been seeing too many folks on both sides of the political aisle trying to use this crisis as a political football , and all that 's doing is making it that much more difficult to come up with real solutions .
If you see anyone focus on playing the " blame game , " ignore them .
They 're not worth listening to and they 'll only be misleading .
Finally , any explanation you read that is n't multiple - book - length will probably be greatly simplified -- including this one .
But I 'm hoping that it at least kicks off an interesting discussion .
Well , there are tons of good resources that can give you bits and pieces of it .
A good place to start , however , may be The Giant Pool of Money podcast that was ona few months back ( which we mentioned recently ) .
The NY Times just had an article about what led to that podcast being created .
It 's also worth noting ( oddly not mentioned in the NYT piece ) that the two reporters who put that together -- Adam Davidson and Alex Blumberg -- are collaborating on a new daily podcast and blog for NPR called Planet Money , which is fantastic .
They 're also working on a new episode offor next week about the current crisis .
That will be a must - listen as well , I 'm sure .
But , the basic summary is that a chain of events all resulted in more and more money being put into riskier and riskier mortgages , where much of the risk was hidden away by computer models and the repackaging of those risky mortgages in bulk .
Normally speaking , the idea of bundling up a bunch of risky projects into one actually does make some sense -- because you 're figuring that while some will fail , the successes will greatly outweigh the failures .
And , in many cases , that 's true ( it 's basic diversification ) .
But the problem was that very few , if any , of the models seemed to take into account the fact that these weren ' trisky items , but that many were very dependent on each other .
Thus , rather than a small group of risky deals going south , outweighed by the success stories , people started to realize that you could have a domino effect , where a large portion of the risky stuff going bad could actually lead to even more of it going bad .
That 's just what you get for creating bad models that do n't take dependencies into account .
What made this even worse , however , is that a bunch of the risk was eventually pawned off to the least knowledgeable investor : the public markets .
In a world where you 're always looking for the last sucker to invest , the public markets are always going to be your best bet -- and many investment banks took advantage of that .
While , historically , many investment banks were partnerships , where the partners understood the risk of what they were doing , once these banks were public , the risk was shifted from the folks who at least understood some of the more complex details to those who did n't .
Whether that rises to the level of fraud , in falsely portraying the real risk at hand , is something that we 'll leave to federal investigators to sort out .
Either way , we had a long chain of players , who effectively kept " laundering " the risk through various ways until it ended up being held by people who simply had no clue how risky the products were that they owned .
Then , once stuff started to go bad , the dependencies started to snowball and make everything worse -- and the confusion over how bad and how risky things were made those who actually had money on hand reasonably afraid to keep lending it to those who could n't accurately express the risk .
That resulted in a lack of liquidity -- effectively the oil in the economy 's engine .
Without liquidity , a lot of stuff freezes up pretty quickly and dangerously .
That 's what caused Treasury boss Paulson and Fed chair Bernanke to ask for the " bailout " plan .
Actually , while almost everyone is calling it a " bailout , " it 's not quite a true bailout , and it's not clear that it really " rewards " those who created the mess .
Like everything else , it 's quite complicated .
Personally , I like Fred Wilson 's use of the phrase " The Splurge " to describe it , because in many ways it 's more accurate than a bailout .
Basically , the government is asking for $ 700 billion to try to buy up distressed assets .
The details suggest that it 's starting out with $ 350 billion , with another $ 350 billion to be handed out later , if necessary .
There are plenty who believe that $ 700 billion is just the tip of the iceberg , and eventually that number will grow to be much higher .
So , why is n't this a full " bailout " ?
Well , because the government would be getting equity back as well , and there are plenty of smart folks who believe that this could lead to the government making a profit .
Indeed , buying up distressed assets historically is n't a bad way to make a profit -- if you know what you 're doing .
Lots of folks tend to shy away from distressed assets , and a good fund manager can buy up distressed assets for pennies on the dollar and figure out ways to sell them down the road for nickels or dimes on the dollar .
It 's a perfectly reasonable business proposition , and historically , there are plenty of stories of folks who made out like bandits buying distressed assets following bursting bubbles .
So , if the government can drive a hard bargain and buy up these assets at a reasonable price , it could work .
So , thenews is that there 's a chance that the " splurge " could result in a best case scenario : it pumps liquidity into the market , stabilizes things , gets the economy moving againlets the government profit .
But that 's the best case scenario .
Others are a lot less sure , noting that the upside pales compared to the downside risk , and even if an upside scenario may seem a lot more likely , theof the downside is much , much bigger ( at least $ 700 billion at this point , and perhaps more ) .
In fact , there are those who suggest that a poorly done splurge will almost certainly make things even worse .
And , plenty are pointing out that the smart money seems to be betting that the government is entering the game as the " last sucker " we were discussing earlier .
Given that there 's still confusion over how the gov't will value these assets , it seems reasonable to worry .
Plus , there 's the thought that if the hard bargain is really a good bargain , then others will come in and do the deal -- such as JP Morgan Chase buying up WaMu or Barclays with Lehman or BofA with Country Wide or Merrill Lynch .
But , there 's a question of how much those companies can handle , and if it 's enough to keep the economy from stalling .
So , really , a lot of it comes down to how well such a government fund is managed -- and right now that 's a huge open question .
If it 's managed well , by folks who actually have the ability to get a pretty good read on the likely real value of these distressed assets -- then the splurge plan could work wonders .
But how often do you see the government do anything right -- especially when it comes to managing money ?
So , while , in theory , I do n't have a problem with the government entering the market as a buyer , you have to worry significantly about the fact that it's the government , and they 're prone to screwing things up badly -- especially once politicians get involved .
Once you have people trying to get elected on a regular basis messing around with the decision making , you know things are going to get bad fast .
That 's why , if such a plan does need to move forward , I 'm actually all for limited oversightif ( and this is a big if ) there 's real transparency into what the fund is doing .
I might be more convinced if there were oversight from a group of economists instead .
Also , you 'veheard a bunch of folks warning about " moral hazard " lately , which is an economics term basically meaning that if you protect someone via insurance of some sort , it makes them more likely to do risky behavior .
That is , if you tell someone you 'll protect their downside loss on something , they 're more likely to do it .
Or , more specifically , if you tell someone that if they jump out of a tree , you 'll catch them , they 're more likely to jump out of that tree .
In this case , the idea is that " rescuing " the banks makes them more likely to do risky things again , knowing that the government will rescue them .
In this case , however , the risk of moral hazard seems overblown .
This is hardly a pleasant time to be working in the financial sector , and I do n't think this is exactly an enjoyable experience .
Plus , if the Splurge works by buying stuff at pennies on the dollar , that 's not going to be particularly pleasant either .
It may be more like saying you 'll have insurance to fix your broken legs from jumping out of a tree .
Yeah , you 've got insurance , but the broken legs are pretty good incentive not to do this again .
Oddly , there 's almost no talk of the risk of adverse selection , which is moral hazard 's sibling in looking at any sort of " insurance " market .
I would think that the risk of adverse selection is much greater here than the risk of moral hazard .
With adverse selection , the problem is that when you have asymmetric information ( one party has a lot more info than the insuring party ) , the riskier deals end up gravitating towards the insurer .
Thus , the insurer thinks its covering a uniform population , but only the riskiest bets take up the insurer .
That seems a hell of a lot more likely in this scenario .
The government does not know how to value these distressed assets , but the banks selling them probably have a much better idea , and are more likely to try to pawn off the worst of the worst on the government -- meaning that the gov't may get stuck with assets that are more distressed than they expect .
Perhaps the most worrisome aspect of this is the rush to get this done .
Deals done in a panic are rarely good deals .
And while I can understand and agree with the idea that perfect is the enemy of good , rushing through is n't a good idea either .
Will it mean that some firms go into bankruptcy in the meantime ?
Yes , almost certainly .
But is the whole economy going to collapse ?
Unlikely to happen right away , and it should be preventable with minor tweaks while the larger details are worked out .
There 's a common refrain among many , many people , that this is just the result of greedy Wall Street bankers , and the proper thing to do here is to just let them all fail .
It 's not that easy .
The ripple effects here would be pretty serious -- and while I do n't think the economy would fully seize up , it would be really painful across the board .
The lack of liquidity in the commercial paper world ( short term lending , mostly ) would impact aof businesses that you might not think have such exposure to Wall Street .
And that , in turn , could create an ongoing spiral .
It would stop somewhere , but where is anybody 's guess at this point , and it may be pretty far down a hole , with a pretty massive destruction of wealth in the meantime .
Some may believe this is the best way to get through things ( the rip the band - aid off quickly belief ) , but the overall damage could be significant , and not so easy to come back from .
Ripping the band - aid off quickly does n't always yield the best result if it rips the scab with it , causing more damage .
So , simply letting everything fail , while an option , could have serious long term consequences .
Well , for those of us in tech , the good news is that we 'reinsulated than others .
The tech industry is less reliant on investment banks for cash ( with some exceptions ) and , on the whole , does n't have huge exposure to the commercial paper markets either .
There is some fear of a loss in customers , especially for those who service Wall Street -- but there should be lots of integration work in the meantime .
On the startup front , VCs still have plenty of cash for investing , and while they only put out cash calls on committed money when it 's needed , it 's unlikely that most limited partners ( i.e. , investors ) in VC funds will be unable to meet those calls .
The big investors , like university endowments , are n't likely to be impacted too badly .
You 'll likely see some slowdown in startup investing , as VCs get nervous about the overall environment and the potential decrease in exit opportunities .
But , for the most part , that should just meanandstartups get funded , as the investors end up asking better questions , and only the best survive .
Downturns are the times when the best startups get created .
I 'd expect there also to be some fallout in the online ad market , for a few reasons .
The mortgage / real estate industry has always been a big spender in the space , and that 's going to drop off ( if it has n't already ) .
Some of the other businesses impacted by the whole mess will also cut back on advertising .
However , the market may start to consolidate around advertising models that actually show strong ROI , but will move away from " advertise and pray " models .
Once again , the long run result may be better advertising models , rather than a lot of the crap we see today -- and that 's a good thing .
It is a huge mess , no doubt .
The splurge is quite risky -- and while I can appreciate the upside potential , if done right , that " if " scares me a lot .
I 'd be much more comfortable with it if it was n't being pushed through in its entirely in such a quick manner , with partisan players on both sides going on the news yelling at the other side each night .
Instead , focus on a smaller initial package and spend a bit more time working out the bigger deal later , with a lot more input .
In the short term , there 's still going to be a fair amount of bloodshed , and the downside will impact companies outside of the financial sector , but for those in tech , the good news is that we 're probablyisolated than other industries , though certainly not completely isolated .
And , since everything is changing so rapidly , you never know what shoe might drop next .
However , in the long run , there is still money out there , and there are still opportunities .
People will need to put that money to work one way or another , and rather than freaking out , now is a time to be looking for the opportunities created by this mess , and the tech industry is likely to have a lot of those opportunities .
Remember that for every bubble bursting , ends up getting devalued below its real value .
The trick is just figuring out what it is before anyone else notices .

Two Japanese firms are building a solar power system to augment the diesel engines aboard a cargo ship that carries new Toyotas to the United States , a fuel - saving move that makes solar panels on a Prius look like a drop in the bucket .
Slapping photovoltaic cells on a 60,000 - ton boat will cut fuel consumption by 6.5 percent , which seems paltry until you realize the average cargo ship burns 120 gallons per mile .
The system Nippon Yusen KK is paying Nippon Oil Corp .
$ 1.4 million to develop will save about 46,800 gallons of fuel carrying all those cars 6,000 miles from Japan to Califonia .
To put that in perspective , if you bought a Toyota that arrived on a solar ship with 4,999 other cars , it would have saved nine gallons of fuel before you ever even saw it .
But solar ships do more than save fuel .
They also clear the air .
Cargo ships burn " bunker fuel , " the truly nasty stuff that literally comes from the bottom of the barrel .
It 's kind of like the Milwaukee 's Best of fossil fuels .
A study published in Environmental Science and Technology found emissions from the bunker fuel cargo ships burn may cause 60,000 deaths worldwide .
Subsequent research found ship exhaust contributed as much as 44 percent of the sulphate found in fine particulate matter in the atmosphere of coastal California .
Anything that cuts the amount of bunker fuel ships burn is nothing to sneeze at .
Nippon Yusen , Japan 's largest shipping line , says the solar assist will cut CO2 emissions by 1 to 2 percent per year , or about 20 tons , according to Reuters .
Although solar panels have been used at sea to generate power for crews quarters , this is the first time anyone 's tried to use them to help propel cargo ships .
Beyond seagull - proofing the system , the engineers must figure out how to make it tough enough to withstand salt and vibration .
Ikutoshi Matsumura , executive vice president of Nippon Oil , says the first solar ship will be ready to sail by December with " full commercialization of the system in three to five years . "
Nippon Yusen could be ahead of the curve , as there is a worldwide push to ban bunker fuel ( aka Chanel No. 6 ) in coastal waters .
California , naturally , is among the first , banning its use within 24 miles of shore beginning in July .
Similar rules will be in effect worldwide by
2015 .
Such bans could make shipping cargo more expensive because bunker fuel , as disgusting as it is , is cheap and does the job .
Kind of like Milwaukee 's Best .
The solar boat is n't the first attempt at cleaning up cargo ships .
A much earlier system developed by the Sumerians used wind .
More recently , Germany 's SkySails has developed a modern interpretation of the sailboat that uses sails the size of football fields to cut fuel use by up to 35 percent .
A 2006 design study by Scandanavian shipbuilder Wallenius found ships could use wind and solar power along with fuel cells to create zero-emission shipping .
New technology is another way shipping companies can reduce the cost of transporting cargo in the face of rising fuel prices and stricter emissions standards , all while shortening the " long tailpipe "
and giving car buyers something to feel good about .
Still , just like the old " double - nickel " speed limit , the less advanced ships can save some fuel by simply slowing down : Dropping speeds by two knots can increase fuel efficiency by up to 5 percent .

Some sanity here from Mark DeMoss , former chief of staff to Jerry Falwell and now a leading Christian public relations executive :
" Too many evangelicals and religious conservative are too preoccupied with values and faith and pay no attention to competence .
We do n't apply this approach to anything else in life , including choosing a pastor . "
Imagine , he said , if a church was searching for a pastor and the leadership was brought a candidate with great values but little experience .
" They 've been a pastor for two years at a church with 150 people but he shares our values , so we hired him to be pastor of our 5,000 person church ?
It would n't happen !
We do n't say , ' He shares our values , so let 's hire him . '
That 's absurd .
Yet we apply that to choosing presidents .
It blows my mind . " ...
To be clear , DeMoss is n't saying Palin is unqualified .
" The reality is , we do n't know - and neither does McCain if he only met her once . "
The other Christian leaders who rallied around her did n't know much either .
" I 'm not hinting something 's amiss but we do n't know her and the people who gave her glowing response Friday did n't know .
The euphoric rush to anoint without knowing -- it 's a dangerous thing . "
You can say that again .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
That ’s another request ; the exact wording was " The five best reasons to think you should be more dogmatic about the economic beliefs you are not dogmatic about . "
I ’ll give one reason , namely that , somewhat counterintuitively , dogmatism can further the generation of new ideas .
Yes , this does require a special meaning of the word dogmatic .
I ’m not talking about a grouchy guy who goes " harumph " whenever he counters a new idea .
I ’m talking about the person who generates the new idea !
In strict Bayesian terms , most innovators are not justified in thinking that their new ideas are in fact correct .
Most new ideas are wrong and the creator ’s " gut feeling " that he is " onto something " is sometimes as epistemologically dubious as is the opinion of the previous scientific consensus .
Yet we still want that they promote these new ideas , even if most of them turn out to be wrong .
In this view , the so - called " reasonable " people are selfishly building up their personal reputations at the expense of scientific progress .
They are too reasonable to generate new ideas .
To put it another way , there are two kinds of truth - seeking behavior :
1. Hold and promote the view which leads to society most likely settling upon truth in the future , or
2 . Hold and promote the view which is most likely to be correct .
These two strategies coincide less than many people think .
Which do you prefer and why ?
Addendum :
Here is a recent NYT article .
Excerpt :
Voters who insist that they are undecided about a contentious issue are
sometimes fooling themselves , having already made a choice at a
subconscious level , a new study suggests .
Scientists have long known that subtle biases can skew evaluations of
an issue or candidate in ways people are not aware of .
But the new
study , appearing Thursday in the journal Science , suggests that
professed neutrality – sitting on the fence – leaves people more
vulnerable to their own inherent biases than choosing sides early .
Will Bryan Caplan endorse this ?
Newspaper website users are 52 % more likely to be Influencers * than newspaper website non-users – 47 % vs. 31 % – according to ( pdf ) a new study by the Newspaper National Network LP .
Immediate family , friends and coworkers are the core subjects within their influence circle .
Moreover , adults who use newspaper websites and read printed newspapers ( “ Crossovers ” ) influence , on average , 18 people per week – some 38 % more than web users who do not use a newspaper website ( 13 people per week ) .
Newspaper website users are also more likely to be asked their opinion in all product categories measured in the study , particularly Investments ( +63 % ) , Fashion ( +69 % ) and Sports ( +38 % ) .
In addition , newspaper website users are more confident than non-newspaper website users that their advice is taken by others , especially by business colleagues ( +64 % ) and common interest groups ( +45 % ) .
Newspapers website users are even more likely than social network users to be rated more highly in key Influencer metrics .
For example , newspaper website users are 37 % more likely to say they are thought of as a thought leader than a follower .
“ Newspaper publishers should work more creatively with their advertisers to find ways to engage this highly influential audience in word of mouth conversation , both online as well as offline , ” said Ed Keller , CEO of the Keller Fay Group and coauthor of The Influentials .
“ The impact could be dramatic . ”
Additional findings from the study :
Adults who use newspaper websites and read printed newspapers are 82 % more likely to be early adopters of new products and the latest technology as compared to newspaper website non-users .
Newspaper website users are more apt to believe their newspaper websites have credible advertising as compared with users of other non-newspaper websites : 37 % newspaper website users 17 % social network website users 25 % search engine users 26 % special interest users
Key engagement metrics for newspaper websites :
Influence the way users think about things ( +64 % ) Reliable source of information ( +35 % )
Give me something to talk about ( +27 % ) Seen as a thought leader rather than a follower ( +60 % )
* Adults who share their opinions in at least three different ways , according to the MRI definition .

An Oregon City couple who tried to heal their gravely ill son with prayer will appear in court today in a case that could test Oregon laws on religious freedom , parental responsibility and the rights of teenagers to make their own medical decisions .
Jeffrey Dean Beagley , 50 , and Marci Rae Beagley , 46 , surrendered to Clackamas County authorities on Thursday , a day after they were indicted by a grand jury on charges of criminally negligent homicide .
The Beagleys could not be reached for comment .
Their son , 16 - year - old Neil Jeffrey Beagley , died June 17 of complications from a urinary - tract blockage .
A deputy state medical examiner said the boy apparently suffered for years from the intensely painful but medically treatable condition .
The blockage ultimately caused kidney failure , uremic poisoning and heart failure , according to autopsy results .
When Neil Beagley died at his grandmother 's Gladstone home , he was surrounded by dozens of church and family members .
Some of those present told police that Neil Beagley , despite his prolonged suffering , chose faith healing over medical care .
Chief Deputy District Attorney Gregory D. Horner declined comment on the case .
If it goes to trial , the case is likely to draw national attention , said Marci A. Hamilton , a law professor and author of the book " God vs. the Gavel , " which explores conflicts between society and the laws intended to protect religious freedoms .
" Increasingly , prosecutors and grand juries are becoming less willing to turn a blind eye to child suffering or death when it is religiously motivated , " said Hamilton , who teaches at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York City .
" We are in the midst of a coming civil rights movement for children .
The willingness to prosecute for the death of a child in a religious circumstance is part and parcel of that . "
Beagley 's death came less than four months after his 15 - month - old niece , Ava Worthington , died in similar circumstances from treatable bronchial pneumonia and a blood infection that could have been cleared up with antibiotics .
Her parents , Carl and Raylene Worthington , go to trial Jan. 26 on charges of manslaughter and criminal mistreatment .
Before taking the Beagley case to a grand jury , prosecutors spent months researching the tangle of Oregon laws relevant to the case .
Under a law passed in 1971 , children 15 and older have the right to seek medical care independent of their parents .
The law was intended , in part , to give girls access to birth - control information , contraceptives and abortions .
It was later expanded to cover treatment for sexually transmitted diseases , mental health and substance abuse .
While not expressly stated in state statutes , some legal experts believe the right to seek medical care also grants the right to refuse medical care .
Oregon law also offers some religious - defense protections for parents who try to heal their children with prayer , but those exemptions have changed over time .
In 1995 , lobbied by the Christian Science Church , Oregon legislators introduced a religious defense to Oregon 's homicide statutes .
In 1997 , they extended religious protections to cases of first - and second - degree manslaughter .
Then in 1999 , after a series of faith - healing deaths involving the Followers of Christ , legislators eliminated Oregon 's " spiritual - healing defense " in certain cases of manslaughter and criminal mistreatment .
According to a 1998 analysis by The Oregonian , at least 21 of the dozens of children buried since the 1950s in the Followers of Christ church cemetery south of Oregon City could have been saved by medical intervention .
None of the deaths from that era resulted in prosecution .
Oregon law gives parents the right to determine their children 's religious upbringing .
Prosecutors will have to prove that reasonable medical care was withheld , and the defense may have to show that Neil Beagley made an independent decision to forgo medical treatment , said Jenny Cooke , an Oregon City defense attorney who has handled numerous homicide cases .
The maximum penalty for criminally negligent homicide in Oregon is 10 years in prison , although sentencing guidelines call for a lesser penalties , ranging from probation to 18 months in prison .

Weapon May ' Tag ' Suspects , So There Is No Escape
Surge Played Only a Minor Role
Jon Ponder Byon
9/12/2008 , 5:01 am PT
Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
In an interview on NPR's " Fresh Air " about his new book , The War Within : A Secret White House History 2006 - 2008 , Bob Woodward said that his reporting had uncovered a top - secret new weapon introduced by U.S forces into Iraq that is primarily responsible for the current period of stability there .
The Bush / McCain Surge is just one of four factors that have tamped down violence , according to Woodward .
The other factors include the Anbar Awakening , in which the Sunnis rejected Al Qaeda 's extremism ; the stand - down of Muqtada al Sadr 's Shiite militia ; and this new top secret weapon :
BOB WOODWARD : The fourth [ element ] is very top secret .
And that is a series of operations that have been developed that allow U.S. forces to locate targets and kill extremists , al Qaeda members and members of the insurgency .
On Friday [ Sept. 5 , 2008 ] , the White House in responding to the book for the first time confirmed that there were " newly developed techniques and operations which helped the situation stabilize in Iraq . "
TERRY GROSS :
At the request of the military and the White House , you 're not revealing any of the details you found about what these top - secret operations are .
What can you tell us ?
BW : That it 's like any war .
There 's always something --- there 's a game - changer , a new development .
In the early 20th century , it was the tank or the airplane .
World War II , the Manhattan Project and the development of the Atomic Bomb .
These [ new ] operations and techniques are not something where you 're going to see an explosion like an Atomic Bomb but they are incredibly effective .
They are something that --- as Pres .
Bush said to people that I quote in the book , " We are killing them all .
We are killing all of the people who are the leaders . "
Now , it 's not literally " all , " but they are killing hundreds and hundreds of key people on the other side in this conflict .
So what could this new weapon be ?
Sharon Weinberger at Wired.com has a guess :
I believe he is talking about the much ballyhooed ( in defense geek circles ) " Tagging , Tracking and Locating " [ TTL ] program ...
These are newfangled technologies designed to track people from long distances , without the targeted people realizing they are being tracked .
That can theoretically include thermal signatures , or some sort of " taggant " placed on a person .
Think Will Smith in Enemy of the State .
Well , not so many cameras , maybe .
Why do I think this is the technology Woodward is referring to ?
Well , first , because it pretty much fits the bill , in terms of the type of capability he appears to be talking about .
It has involvement from a number of players , including the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and Special Operations Command .
Also , the Defense Science Board has talked about this capability in similar terms , saying " the global war on terrorism cannot be won without a ‘ Manhattan Project ’ - like TTL ... program . "
Here 's how an unclassified military document describes the weapon system :
The Ability to Locate , Track , and Identify Human Beings and Other Important Targets
Directly Supports DoD ’s Ability to Prosecute the Global War on Terrorism ( GWOT )
Forces Require an Ability to Apply and Monitor Tags
Detect and Identify Targets Based on Their Unique Observable Characteristics Without Undue Exposure of Personnel to Risks and With Devices That are Sufficiently Clandestine to be Effective
And :
Objective : Conduct a Collaborative Effort to Develop New Capabilities for Clandestine Tagging , Tracking , and Locating in Response to Priorities Established in a Quick - look Capability - based Assessment Conducted in Response to the Findings of the QDR
Approach : Transition Existing State - of - the - Art Technologies in Nanotechnology , Chemistry , and Biology to Operational Systems Through the USSOCOM Acquisition Process and Conduct RDT&E From Basic Research Through Prototyping to Provide Continuous Improvements in the CTTL Technology Available for Transition to the Operators .
Specific Capability Projections Are Classified .
Sounds pretty effective , but there 's a downside that ought to make every red- blooded American 's blood run cold , and that is the thought of a weapon like this in the hands of crypto- fascists like George Bush and Dick Cheney , and their ideological clones , John McCain and Sarah Palin .
Nate Silver believes so - and has some good evidence to back him up .
I know they are tilted right editorially , which is their prerogative , but I did n't realize they were now massaging their polls to favor McCain :
Look --
I 'm not going to tell you that my site is completely devoid of spin .
I am a Democrat , and I see the world through a Democratic lens .
But what I can promise you is that we 'll keep the spin separate from our metrics .
The spin is a side dish , which you can choose to consume or ignore .
Unfortunately , that is not a choice you have at RCP .
Their partisan leaning is infused into their numbers .
If RCP disclosed their methodology -- articulated their rationale for excluding or including certain polls -- I would give them the benefit of the doubt .
But they do not , so I do not .

To the Editor :
Re “ Politics of Attack ” ( editorial , Oct. 8 ) and “ Obama and ’ 60s Bomber : A Look Into Crossed Paths ” ( front page , Oct. 4 ) :
As the lead federal prosecutor of the Weathermen in the 1970s ( I was then chief of the criminal division in the Eastern District of Michigan and took over the Weathermen prosecution in 1972 ) , I am amazed and outraged that Senator Barack Obama is being linked to William Ayers ’s terrorist activities 40 years ago when Mr. Obama was , as he has noted , just a child .
Although I dearly wanted to obtain convictions against all the Weathermen , including Bill Ayers , I am very pleased to learn that he has become a responsible citizen .
Because Senator Obama recently served on a board of a charitable organization with Mr. Ayers cannot possibly link the senator to acts perpetrated by Mr. Ayers so many years ago .
I do take issue with the statement in your news article that the Weathermen indictment was dismissed because of “ prosecutorial misconduct . ”
It was dismissed because of illegal activities , including wiretaps , break - ins and mail interceptions , initiated by John N. Mitchell , attorney general at that time , and W. Mark Felt , an F.B.I. assistant director .
Police sealed off the area after the explosions
Two explosions have rocked a police station in Afghanistan 's southern city of Kandahar , killing at least two policemen , officials say .
They say about 30 people - including civilians - were injured when two suicide bombers detonated their bombs in quick succession inside the station .
US - led and Afghan forces have been battling Taleban insurgents in the region in recent weeks .
In June , at least 350 rebels were freed during a jailbreak from Kandahar jail .
' General targeted '
" There were two suicide bombers who blew themselves up inside the police headquarters one after another , " Ahmad Wali Karzai , head of Kandahar 's provincial council , was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency .
The bombers targeted a senior border police commander , General Abdul Razaaq , who was injured in the attacks , reports say .
Earlier reports said at least six people had been killed in the blasts .
Police sealed off the area shortly after the explosions .
Kandahar is one of the key battlegrounds of the current rebel insurgency against the Afghan government and troops from Nato and a US - led coalition .
In a separate development , a suicide bomber attacked a Nato convoy in the western city of Herat but caused no casualties , officials say .
The US - led coalition said its forces had killed more than 10 insurgents in an operation in the eastern province of Khost on Saturday .
Afghanistan has seen rising levels of violence in recent months .
There are about 70,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan , most of them serving under Nato 's command .
I have been working on a little early Kwanzaa present for all ye who , for years , have harassed me without mercy , written truly loathsome emails and engaged in horrific acts of cyber bullying - all because this stupid game did n't work right .
That 's right .
I could have gone into a shell , pretended to have a learning disability , anorexia or cerebral palsy or whatever else these posers try to say they have in place of their accountability .
But no .
Lesson here is that bullying actually works .
Enjoy .
As I enjoy the fact that , if not for this , you all might have actually graduated from college .
How should we teach programming ?
One of Shimon Schocken ’s colleagues says that “ Computer science is a thousand layers of abstraction . ”
This is quite true , and the same applies for programming .
Recently I ’ve been thinking a lot about how we can get more people involved with programming .
I do n’t necessarily mean programming as professionals , but just to develop enough of an understanding on what software is and how it works .
So I wrote a book aimed at teaching games programming in Python to the 9 to 12 year age range ( get ’em while they ’re young ) .
In my “ Python is the new BASIC ” post , ( which was a plug for my free , Creative Commons - licensed book , “ Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python ” ) I received this comment :
You know , I took a look at that game book and it struck me how so 1980s the thing was .
It brought me down to memory lane .
Now , looking at the alternative ( Squeak ) , which is fully OOP all the way down to the very menus and icons , buttons , which has a much richer environment and is totally ready for multimedia , along with the derived ( written in Squeak )
Scratch language , I think it ’s very bad that we ’re returning to Basic .
Kids deserve something better in 2008 , and we can deliver it , just as long as we keep our prejudice at bay against Smalltalk ( because it really is about prejudice and lack of information ) .
1980s would be right .
I based the book I wrote on a 1983 book that taught me BASIC programming ( adding Python ’s modern features ) .
However , my book specifically avoids higher - level concepts such as object - oriented progamming , event - driven applications , and graphics .
I thought these concepts would hide the actual underlying workings of the programs .
By using textual input and output from simple raw_input ( ) calls and print statements , my book could focus on variables , expressions , and flow control .
I wanted as little “ magic ” as possible .
“ Programming is a thousand layers of abstractions . ”
I ’ll argue that to really understand software , one has to go down this rabbit hole all the way to the bottom , as far as assembly or machine language .
But one does n’t need to understand assembly ( arguably the lowest of the programming abstraction layers ) in order to actually write useful software , even professionally .
And for the purpose of teaching programming , those layers of abstractions save us a lot of tedious details .
The key to teaching programming is to find that ideal middle ground : low enough to pull back the “ automagic ” curtain , high enough to stay above minutia .
My book aims low .
There are already several high - level game engine SDKs and drag - and - drop game creator packages to make programming easy ( well , easier ) .
I would lose the appeal of graphics , animation , and sprites , and instead rely on text and ASCII art .
I would use function calls and loops , a level below recursion and callbacks but above dread goto statements .
The high - level space already has lots of ink or bytes devoted to it already , so I aimed low .
But maybe I ’ve gone too low .
I fell back on my target audience ( which I pictured as my 9 - year - old self ) .
I learned programming from a book that taught games programming in BASIC ( which I used as a starting template for IYOCGwP ) .
It covered a lot less ground than my book ( the syntax for Python makes complex programming tasks easier ) .
That book had opened up an entirely new creative world for me , which I hope my book will also do .
Ask any software developer with motivation that extends beyond a mere paycheck , and they will have a similar “ How I Learned to Program ” story .
And even though the games in the BASIC book I read were only text , they still held my attention .
Console video games of the day ( i.e. my 16 - bit Super Nintendo ) had games that were far more engaging than anything I ever made , but coding my own Tic Tac Toe program still appealed to me .
Programming was a fun , creative task .
The fruits of my labor were simple , but they were mine .
Is this low approach what we ’ve been missing in programming education ?
Michael Kölling ’s Greenfoot and MIT ’s Scratch environments have been great successes at general computer science education .
Both make liberal use of graphics and automagic techniques that make introducing high - level computer science concepts accessible to the general audience .
But I feel that a low enough level of understanding software may be lost in this approach as well .
I ’ll be the first to admit , my book ’s approach is experimental .
I have no trouble confessing that it will probably not appeal to a wide audience of children .
But for the neophyte geeks ( such as my 9 - year - old self ) , I think a more direct approach gives the young ( and not so young ) programmer an education that can be applied to a much wider scope of software .
Python is both easy to learn , but scales into almost every domain of software development and the professional world .
I ’ve been putting some thought into the next book , whose content will be determined by the success ( or lack thereof ) of this first book .
I ’m going to keep the teach - by - example format of presenting an entire game ’s source code and explaining the principles from the code ( unlike teaching principles without immediate and complete application ) , but I do n’t know how high of a step up the abstraction stack I want to take it .
I want to introduce graphics , but I do n’t know if I will continue with ASCII text with the curses library , or dive into PyGame or Pyglet .
I encourage anyone to take a look at the book ( I offer it on http://pythonbook.coffeeghost.net in full for free under a Creative Commons license . ) and offer an opinion : how high or low on the abstraction stack should we teach computer programming to those new to the skill ?
( Especially young folks . )
Should we use real languages ( like BASIC , Python , Smalltalk , or Java ) or languages made specifically for teaching ( Scratch , Logo , etc . )
Should we have them learn pointers , object - oriented programming , assembly , functional programming , GUIs and / or graphics ?
Should we aim high or aim low ?
Mobile phone carrier Orange Poland admitted today that it hired actors to stand in line for the country 's iPhone debut .
" It was a part of our marketing strategy , the concept was thought up at Orange Poland , " the company told the Associated Press .
" The aim was to ' warm up ' the atmosphere around the launch of the iPhone . "
Orange said they set up fake queues in front of about 20 stores around the country .
Meanwhile , there were no lines outside of rival Era retail stores which also carry the iPhone in Poland according to several reports .
We assume it 's mostly been honest - to - goodness Apple fanatics that queued up across the globe to pay tithe to the Jesus Phone .
Apple certainly does n't seem to have much trouble stirring hearts elsewhere into a froth of consumer zealotry without dipping into the local talent pool .
Alas , Polish hearts are clearly made of sterner stuff — no doubt a side effect of red beet soup and cabbage rolls .
And hey , even
The Beatles allegedly paid for a few screamers to prime the pump when they first started .
But is n't it a bit stupid — and correct us if we 're wrong here — to immediately give away that you had to pay people to feign interest ?
They 're selling the Jesus Phone for Job 's sakes !
Apple must need some serious missionary merchandising there if carriers need to call in the bold and the beautiful . ®
Cellphone technology has moved from a simple communications device to a small supercomputer that can help make your life easier .

Race has been a sensitive issue in the campaign
Democrat presidential hopeful Barack Obama says rival John McCain 's campaign has been cynical , not racist , in trying to raise fears about his candidacy .
" I think they want to distract people from talking about real issues , " the Illinois senator said .
Mr McCain 's campaign said earlier this week that Mr Obama had " played the race card " by implying that his Republican rival was racist .
But Mr Obama in turn accused Mr McCain of bringing up the race issue .
Mr Obama was talking to reporters as he campaigned for a second day in Florida .
On Friday , he caused a stir when he signalled he was willing to compromise his stand against further offshore drilling along the US coastline .
' Negative campaigning '
The latest row began when the McCain campaign claimed that Mr Obama had " played the race card " by warning that the Republican would try to scare voters about how Mr Obama looked unlike " all those other presidents on the dollar bills " - all white men .
Mr McCain said a sense of humour was important
Talking to reporters on Saturday , Mr Obama said : " In no way do I think that John McCain 's campaign was being racist .
I think they 're cynical . "
He said no - one had thought his comments were accusations of racism until Mr McCain 's team " started pushing it " .
" They 're very good at negative campaigning , " he added .
He said Mr McCain was seeking to cast him as a risky choice because he did not fit the traditional profile of a presidential candidate .
On Friday , Mr McCain defended a series of television ads mocking Mr Obama as a messianic figure and linking him to celebrities Paris Hilton and Britney Spears .
Mr McCain said it was important to " display a sense of humour " in the presidential contest .
McCain admits that , as of Tuesday at least , he had n’t had a chance to look at the Paulson plan yet .
Is he kidding ?
The Paulson plan is like three pages long .
CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS :
DERIVATIVE DISASTER DU JOUR
When the smartest guys in the room designed their credit default swaps , they forgot to ask one thing – what if the parties on the other side of the bet do n't have the money to pay up ?
Credit default swaps ( CDS ) are insurance - like contracts that are sold as protection against default on loans , but CDS are not ordinary insurance .
Insurance companies are regulated by the government , with reserve requirements , statutory limits , and examiners routinely showing up to check the books to make sure the money is there to cover potential claims .
CDS are private bets , and the Federal Reserve from the time of Alan Greenspan has insisted that regulators keep hands off .
The sacrosanct free market would supposedly regulate itself .
The problem with that approach is that regulations are just rules .
If there are no rules , the players can cheat ; and cheat they have , with a gambler 's addiction .
In December 2007 , the Bank for International Settlements reported derivative trades tallying in at $ 681 trillion – ten times the gross domestic product of all the countries in the world combined .
Somebody is obviously bluffing about the money being brought to the game , and that realization has made for some very jittery markets .
" Derivatives " are complex bank creations that are very hard to understand , but the basic idea is that you can insure an investment you want to go up by betting it will go down .
The simplest form of derivative is a short sale : you can place a bet that some asset you own will go down , so that you are covered whichever way the asset moves .
Credit default swaps are the most widely traded form of credit derivative .
They are bets between two parties on whether or not a company will default on its bonds .
In a typical default swap , the " protection buyer " gets a large payoff if the company defaults within a certain period of time , while the " protection seller " collects periodic payments for assuming the risk of default .
CDS thus resemble insurance policies , but there is no requirement to actually hold any asset or suffer any loss , so CDS are widely used just to speculate on market changes .
In one blogger 's example , a hedge fund wanting to increase its profits could sit back and collect $ 320,000 a year in premiums just for selling " protection " on a risky BBB junk bond .
The premiums are " free " money – free until the bond actually goes into default , when the hedge fund could be on the hook for $ 100 million in claims .
And there 's the catch : what if the hedge fund does n't have the $ 100 million ?
The fund 's corporate shell or limited partnership is put into bankruptcy , but that hardly helps the " protection buyers " who thought they were covered .
To the extent that CDS are being sold as " insurance , " they are looking more like insurance fraud ; and that fact has particularly hit home with the ratings downgrades of the " monoline " insurers and the recent collapse of Bear Stearns , a leading Wall Street investment brokerage .
The monolines are so - called because they are allowed to insure only one industry , the bond industry .
Monoline bond insurers are the biggest protection writers for CDS , and Bear Stearns was the twelfth largest counterparty to credit default swap trades in 2006 .
1
These players have been major protection sellers in a massive web of credit default swaps , and when the " protection " goes , the whole fragile derivative pyramid will go with it .
The collapse of the derivative monster thus appears to be both imminent and inevitable , but that fact need not be cause for despair .
The $ 681 trillion derivatives trade is the last supersized bubble in a 300 - year Ponzi scheme , one that has now taken over the entire monetary system .
The nation 's wealth has been drained into private vaults , leaving scarcity in its wake .
It is a corrupt system , and change is long overdue .
Major crises are major opportunities for change .
The Wall Street Ponzi Scheme
The Ponzi scheme that has gone bad is not just another misguided investment strategy .
It is at the very heart of the banking business , the thing that has propped it up over the course of three centuries .
A Ponzi scheme is a form of pyramid scheme in which new investors must continually be sucked in at the bottom to support the investors at the top .
In this case , new borrowers must continually be sucked in to support the creditors at the top .
The Wall Street Ponzi scheme is built on " fractional reserve " lending , which allows banks to create " credit " ( or " debt " ) with accounting entries .
Banks are now allowed to lend from 10 to 30 times their " reserves , " essentially counterfeiting the money they lend .
Over 97 percent of the U.S. money supply ( M3 ) has been created by banks in this way .
2
The problem is that banks create only the principal and not the interest necessary to pay back their loans , so new borrowers must continually be found to take out new loans just to create enough " money " ( or " credit " ) to service the old loans composing the money supply .
The scramble to find new debtors has now gone on for over 300 years – ever since the founding of the Bank of England in 1694 – until the whole world has become mired in debt to the bankers ' private money monopoly .
The Ponzi scheme has finally reached its mathematical limits : we are " all borrowed up . "
When the banks ran out of creditworthy borrowers , they had to turn to uncreditworthy " subprime " borrowers ; and to avoid losses from default , they moved these risky mortgages off their books by bundling them into " securities " and selling them to investors .
To induce investors to buy , these securities were then " insured " with credit default swaps .
But the housing bubble itself was another Ponzi scheme , and eventually there were no more borrowers to be sucked in at the bottom who could afford the ever - inflating home prices .
When the subprime borrowers quit paying , the investors quit buying mortgage - backed securities .
The banks were then left holding their own suspect paper ; and without triple - A ratings , there is little chance that buyers for this " junk " will be found .
The crisis is not , however , in the economy itself , which is fundamentally sound – or would be with a proper credit system to oil the wheels of production .
The crisis is in the banking system , which can no longer cover up the shell game it has played for three centuries with other people 's money .
The Derivatives Chernobyl
The latest jolt to the massive derivatives edifice came with the collapse of Bear Stearns on March 16 , 2008 .
Bear Stearns helped fuel the explosive growth in the credit derivative market , where banks , hedge funds and other investors have engaged in $ 45 trillion worth of bets on the credit - worthiness of companies and countries .
Before it collapsed , Bear was the counterparty to $ 13 trillion in derivative trades .
On March 14 , 2008 , Bear 's ratings were downgraded by Moody's , a major rating agency ; and on March 16 , the brokerage was bought by JPMorgan for pennies on the dollar , a token buyout designed to avoid the legal complications of bankruptcy .
The deal was backed by a $ 29 billion " non-recourse " loan from the Federal Reserve .
" Non-recourse " meant that the Fed got only Bear 's shaky paper assets as collateral .
If those proved to be worthless , JPM was off the hook .
It was an unprecedented move , of questionable legality ; but it was said to be justified because , as one headline put it , " Fed 's Rescue of Bear Halted Derivatives Chernobyl . "
The notion either that Bear was " rescued " or that the Chernobyl was halted , however , was grossly misleading .
The CEOs managed to salvage their enormous bonuses , but it was a " bailout " only for JPM and Bear 's creditors .
For the shareholders , it was a wipeout .
Their stock initially dropped from $ 156 to $ 2 , and 30 percent of it was held by the employees .
Another big chunk was held by the pension funds of teachers and other public servants .
The share price was later raised to $ 10 a share in response to shareholder outrage , but the shareholders were still essentially wiped out ; and the fact that one Wall Street bank had to be fed to the lions to rescue the others hardly inspires a feeling of confidence .
Neutron bombs are not so easily contained .
The Bear Stearns hit from the derivatives iceberg followed an earlier one in January , when global markets took their worst tumble since September 11 , 2001 .
Commentators were asking if this was " the big one " – a 1929 - style crash ; and it probably would have been if deft market manipulations had not swiftly covered over the approaching catastrophe .
The precipitous drop was blamed on the threat of downgrades in the ratings of two major monoline insurers , Ambac and MBIA , followed by a $ 7.2 billion loss in derivative trades by Societe Generale , France 's second - largest bank .
Like Bear Stearns , the monolines serve as counterparties in a web of credit default swaps , and a downgrade in their ratings would jeopardize the whole shaky derivatives edifice .
Without the monoline insurers ' traiple - A seal , billions of dollars worth of triple - A investments would revert to junk bonds .
Many institutional investors ( pension funds , municipal governments and the like ) have a fiduciary duty to invest in only the " safest " triple - A bonds .
Downgraded bonds therefore get dumped on the market , jeopardizing the banks that are still holding billions of dollars worth of these bonds .
The downgrade of Ambac in January signaled a simultaneous downgrade of bonds from over 100,000 municipalities and institutions , totaling more than $ 500 billion .
3
Institutional investors have lost a good deal of money in all this , but the real calamity is to the banks .
The institutional investors that formerly bought mortgage - backed bonds stopped buying them in 2007 , when the housing market slumped .
But the big investment houses that were selling them have billions ' worth left on their books , and it is these banks that particularly stand to lose as the derivative Chernobyl implodes .

A Parade of Bailout Schemes
Now that some highly leveraged banks and hedge funds have had to lay their cards on the table and expose their worthless hands , these avid free marketers are crying out for government intervention to save them from monumental losses , while preserving the monumental gains raked in when their bluff was still good .
In response to their pleas , the men behind the curtain have scrambled to devise various bailout schemes ; but the schemes have been bandaids at best .
To bail out a $ 681 trillion derivative scheme with taxpayer money is obviously impossible .
As Michael Panzer observed on SeekingAlpha.com :
As the slow - motion train wreck in our financial system continues to unfold , there are going to be plenty of ill - conceived rescue attempts and dubious turnaround plans , as well as propagandizing , dissembling and scheming by banks , regulators and politicians .
This is all happening in an effort to try and buy time or to figure out how the losses can be dumped onto the lap of some patsy ( e.g. , the taxpayer ) .
The idea seems to be to keep the violins playing while the Big Money Boys slip into the mist and man the lifeboats .
As was pointed out in a blog called " Jesse 's Café Americain " concerning the bailout of Ambac :
It seems that the real heart of the problem is that AMBAC was being used as a " cover " by the banks which originated these bundles of mortgages to get their mispriced ratings .
Now that the mortgages are failing and the banks are stuck with them , AMBAC cannot possibly pay , they cannot cover the debt .
And the banks do n't wish to mark these CDOs [ collateralized debt obligations ] to market [ downgrade them to their real market value ] because they are probably at best worth 60 cents on the dollar , but are being held by the banks on balance at roughly par .
That 's a 40 percent haircut on enough debt to sink every bank involved in this situation . . . .
Indeed for all intents and purposes if marked to market banks are now insolvent .
So , the banks will provide capital to AMBAC . . . [ but ] it 's just a game of passing money around .
. . .
So why are the banks engaging in this charade ?
This looks like an attempt to extend the payouts on a vast Ponzi scheme gone bad that is starting to collapse . . . . 5
The banks will therefore no doubt be looking for one bailout after another from the only pocket deeper than their own , the U.S. government's .
But if the federal government acquiesces , it too could be dragged into the voracious debt cyclone of the mortgage mess .
The federal government 's triple A rating is already in jeopardy , due to its gargantuan $ 9 trillion debt .
Before the government agrees to bail out the banks , it should insist on some adequate quid pro quo .
In England , the government agreed to bail out bankrupt mortgage bank Northern Rock , but only in return for the bank 's stock .
On March 31 , 2008 , The London Daily Telegraph reported that Federal Reserve strategists were eyeing the nationalizations that saved Norway , Sweden and Finland from a banking crisis from 1991 to 1993 .
In Norway , according to one Norwegian adviser , " The law was amended so that we could take 100 percent control of any bank where its equity had fallen below zero . "
6
If their assets were " marked to market , " some major Wall Street banks could already be in that category .
Benjamin Franklin's Solution
Nationalization has traditionally had a bad name in the United States , but it could be an attractive alternative for the American people and our representative government as well .
Turning bankrupt Wall Street banks into public institutions might allow the government to get out of the debt cyclone by undoing what got us into it .
Instead of robbing Peter to pay Paul , flapping around in a sea of debt trying to stay afloat by creating more debt , the government could address the problem at its source : it could restore the right to create money to Congress , the public body to which that solemn duty was delegated under the Constitution .
The most brilliant banking model in our national history was established in the first half of the eighteenth century , in Benjamin Franklin 's home province of Pennsylvania .
The local government created its own bank , which issued money and lent it to farmers at a modest interest .
The provincial government created enough extra money to cover the interest not created in the original loans , spending it into the economy on public services .
The bank was publicly owned , and the bankers it employed were public servants .
T he interest generated on its loans was sufficient to fund the government without taxes ; and because the newly issued money came back to the government , the result was not inflationary .
7
The Pennsylvania banking scheme was a sensible and highly workable system that was a product of American ingenuity but that never got a chance to prove itself after the colonies became a nation .
It was an ironic twist , since according to Benjamin Franklin and others , restoring the power to create their own currency was a chief reason the colonists fought for independence .
The bankers ' money - creating machine has had two centuries of empirical testing and has proven to be a failure .
It is time the sovereign right to create money is taken from a private banking elite and restored to the American people to whom it properly belongs .

WASHINGTON ( Fortune ) -- Barely containing his temper , Virginia 's Eric Cantor , deputy whip for the House Republicans , stepped to the microphone this afternoon to blame the bailout defeat on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's " failure to listen " and her charged partisan rhetoric in condemning President George Bush 's " budgetary recklessness " and " anything - goes mentality . "
If only it were that simple .
If only the failure of the White House to muster enough votes from its own party to avert what it calls looming financial disaster could be blamed on a few ill - chosen words uttered on the House floor by San Francisco 's hyper- partisan speaker .
In fact , Monday 's surprise defeat of the $ 700 billion rescue package - meant to blunt a burgeoning financial crisis - can be traced to a failure on the part of the president and his treasury secretary , Henry Paulson , to fully appreciate the ferocity of the popular revolt they touched off nine days ago .
Republicans today voted against the measure by two to one .
With only 60 % of Democrats also voting in favor , the plan to have the government buy up hundreds of billions in assets , mostly mortgage - backed securities , went down to defeat .
The voters said no
The reality is that conservative House members were less interested in the ear - ache they got from Pelosi than the earful they 've been getting from constituents .
Calls to Congressional offices have been running overwhelmingly against the rescue - just five weeks before constituents go to the polls to vote on their members .
In the week since Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke rushed to Capitol Hill urging Congress to ward off a financial collapse by passing a bailout within 48 hours , they 've argued that the situation is urgent and that financial markets are in crisis .
But the dire warnings did n't provide enough political cover for lawmakers facing voter wrath .
They may have even backfired in some cases , stirring suspicion that the White House and Treasury were over - blowing the magnitude of the crisis to shove through unprecedented intervention in the financial markets that would benefit Wall Street 's fat cats .
On the House floor today , voting members raised a host of concerns about the bailout package - from the burden it would leave on future taxpayers to fears that it " could permanently and fundamentally change the role of government in the American free enterprise system , " in the words of Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( R - Texas ) , a leader of dissenting Republicans .
' A tough vote '
But outside of staunch opponents like Hensarling , there were many fence - sitters who , as of Monday morning , the White House had assumed were in its column .
Pelosi may not have helped , but the plan died because Republicans were n't willing to ignore a revolt among the folks back home and cast a rushed vote on a massively complex subject with an almost unfathomable price tag .
" If on the substance , you 're undecided , then the politics tips you into the ' no ' category , " Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana , a Republican who supported the package , told Fortune .
" It was a tough vote politically in their view . "
McCrery 's own experience leading up to the vote provides insight into what the White House was up against .
McCrery is the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee .
He 's a Shreveport lawyer known for immersing himself in the details of complex tax and entitlement issues .
He 's one of the chamber 's most thoughtful and studious lawmakers - and he 's retiring , so he 's less interested in playing it safe politically than figuring out what 's right to do for the country .
McCrery has been cramming on the state of today 's credit markets , reading everything he could get his hands on , consulting with every expert he could find .
" It 's been like drinking from a fire hose , " he said .
I asked McCrery if his yes vote meant that he was now persuaded that the country faced a dire financial emergency requiring a $ 700 billion market intervention .
His answer : " I 'm still not knowledgeable enough about the credit markets . "
Faced with competing views from competing experts on a subject that no one outside a few top economists understands , McCrery threw his lot in with Paulson and Bernanke .
" I had to pick a group of experts whose opinion I was going to go with , " McCrery said .
And for those lawmakers who have their doubts - or are in dicey districts and in danger of losing their seats come November - there are plenty of economic experts to choose from on the other side , starting with the group of 200 economists who signed a letter opposing the Paulson plan .
Former FDIC Chairman William Isaac was on the Hill yesterday , peddling his own , radically more limited federal assistance plan , to the House Republican Study Group .
So those Republicans who sided with their constituents and voted against their President - but only by a close call - will find themselves the object of intense courting in the days ahead .
Both Pelosi and the Republican leadership say they are eager to try again to pass a bill , probably later in the week .
" We 'd like to find a way , " said Republican Whip Roy Blunt , " to deliver enough Republican votes to make this happen . "
Even if Pelosi speaks not a single partisan word , that 's a tough mission .
Cognitive science and moral philosophy might seem like strange bedfellows , but in the past decade they have become partners .
In a recent issue of Cognition , the Harvard University psychologist Joshua Greene and colleagues extend this trend .
Their experiment utilizes conventional behavioral methods , but it was designed to test a hypothesis stemming from previous fMRI investigations into the neural bases of moral judgments ( see here and here ) .
In their study Greene et al. give subjects difficult moral dilemmas in which one alternative leads to better consequences ( such as more lives saved ) but also violates an intuitive moral restriction ( it requires a person to directly or intentionally cause harm to someone else ) .
For example , in the “ crying baby ” dilemma subjects must judge whether it is wrong to smother their own baby in order to save a large group of people that includes the baby .
In this scenario , which was also used by the television show M.A.S.H. , enemy soldiers will hear the baby cry unless it is smothered .
Sixty percent of people choose to smother the baby in order to save more lives .
A judgment that it is appropriate to save the most lives , even if it requires you to suffocate a child , is labeled “ utilitarian ” by Greene et al. , whereas a judgment that it is not appropriate is called “ deontological . ”
These names pay homage to traditional moral philosophies .
Emotion vs. Rationality
Based on previous fMRI studies , Greene proposes a dual - process model of moral judgments .
This model makes two central claims .
First , when subjects form deontological judgments , emotional processes are said to override controlled cognitive processes .
In other words , the subjects who are unwilling to smother the baby are being swayed by their emotions , and they ca n’t bear the idea of hurting a helpless child .
This claim has been supported by a flurry of recent behavioral studies and neural studies .
Greene ’s dual - process model also claims that controlled cognitive processes cause utilitarian moral judgments .
The new Cognition study puts that second claim to the test .
Neuroimaging reveals only correlations ; it cannot determine whether a certain brain area is causing a particular judgment .
But intervening in a process can provide evidence of causation .
In the Cognition study , Greene et al. attempted to interfere with moral reasoning by increasing the cognitive load on subjects .
They had subjects perform the moral judgment task at the same time as a monitoring task , in which subjects viewed a stream of numerals and responded to occurrences of “ 5 . ”
If this added cognitive load interferes with the controlled cognitive processes that cause utilitarian judgments , the researchers surmised , then subjects should make fewer utilitarian judgments and should form these judgments more slowly .
( For more on factors that influence judgment speed , see here . )
As hypothesized , added cognitive load led to longer reaction times for utilitarian judgments , but the researchers found no effect on reaction times for deontological judgments .
Although it took subjects longer to approve of acts like smothering a baby when also looking for the number 5 , it did not take them longer to approve of acts like not smothering the baby .
This differential effect suggests that some of the cognitive processes involved in the monitoring task are also needed for the processes that lead to utilitarian judgments but not for those that lead to deontological judgments .
The cognitive load did not , however , decrease the proportion of utilitarian judgments , as the dual process model predicts .
People were just as likely to approve of smothering the baby , even if it took them a little bit longer to make that judgment .
This is puzzling , and suggests that the two processes do not compete .
Greene et al. try to explain away this counterevidence by speculating that subjects “ were determined to push through ” the cognitive load , but this story makes sense only if subjects knew in advance that they wanted to reach a utilitarian judgment .
Anomalous Result
The dual process model also predicts that in the absence of cognitive load utilitarian judgments will still be slower than deontological judgments .
Because utilitarian judgments ( such as that it is appropriate to smother the baby ) rely on controlled , deliberate processes , they should take longer than deontological judgments , which depend on emotions , instincts and other fast , automatic processes .
Greene et al. found this difference for low - utilitarian participants ( who made fewer utilitarian judgments ) but not for high - utilitarian participants .
To explain this anomaly , Greene et al. postulate “ an additional process ” that enables high - utilitarian participants to make utilitarian judgments quickly .
These gaps in the theory are , perhaps , not very serious in the absence of any alternative explanation of Greene et al . ’s main finding that utilitarian judgments were slowed by cognitive load and deontological judgments were not .
This effect might be due to the particular form of cognitive load , however .
Greene et al. used numbers to create the cognitive load , but utilitarian judgments often hinge on numbers .
Hence , confusion caused by the stream of numbers might lead subjects to recheck before forming utilitarian judgments , but not before forming deontological judgments that do not depend on getting the numbers right .
Scientists might test this alternative explanation by checking whether the same differential effect arises when the cognitive load takes other forms , such as monitoring for letters , colors or faces .
Future studies should explore the distinctions that the current literature roughly characterizes as emotion versus cognition , and deontological judgments versus utilitarian judgments .
Further clarification will come with a more precise specification of which functional processes constitute the controlled cognition that is supposed to cause utilitarian moral judgments .
Clearly , more work needs to be done .
But that is the sign of a useful experiment : it raises tractable questions that further research can illuminate .
For the time being , this study takes an important step forward both by addressing a crucial issue for the dual - process model and also by presenting strong , though not conclusive , evidence for the role of controlled cognition in utilitarian moral judgment .

Financial Crisis In The Media : Is The Economic Crisis Overhyped ?
With the economy making headline news , what do you think of the way the media is handling the financial crisis ?
Is it just me or does it smack of drama and hyperbole ?
Financial panic .
Distressing scenarios .
The market is not functioning properly .
Widespread loss of confidence .
We can not risk an economic catastrophe .
Long and painful recession .
Our entire economy is in danger .
Disturbing words from Dubya and it all sounds critical and precarious .
Tell us again how we ’re this close to financial collapse unless we succumb to a bailout .
How we ’re on the verge of ruin .
Times like these , I want to put my head in the sand , or fingers in my ears while I sing “ Lalala , I ca n’t hear you ” .
No , I ’m not going nuts here just yet , but I ’m beginning to approach “ financial crisis overload ” from the stuff I ’ve been reading and hearing about lately .
As I digest each day ’s financial events , I ’m not sure what to make of all the media madness trumpeting how everything is falling apart in our economy .
How much of this should I believe in ?
How much should I take with a grain of salt ?
Is it all overplayed or overhyped ?
I know it ’s “ bad ” but I wonder just how bad .
Should I be so afraid that I become motivated to take out all my money and hide it in my kid ’s toy chest in the closet ?
( Of course that ’s just a hyperbole 😉 ) .
So I frequent the CNN Business section and all I ’m seeing there right now are gratuitous expressions of gloom and doom , news to frighten us out of our britches and stoke us into panic .
Yet so far , my empirical observations are n’t in line with what I ’m reading as I have n’t personally felt the consequences of this economic malaise , except perhaps when I look upon my somewhat ravaged long - term stock portfolio .
It makes me uncomfortable some , but occasional slumps in my portfolio are nothing new to me , and for the most part , I ’ve ( wisely ? ) shrugged off these occurrences each time .
The Financial Crisis : Do You Feel It ?
So is this financial slide any different ?
How the media has jumped on the story of our economy , making it constant front page news complete with “ financial crisis timeline ” , makes it sure seem like it is .
But depending on where you ’re perched , you may not see evidence of the real estate market contraction ; for instance , with prime real estate in the Bay Area still selling for ridiculous amounts ( something I ’ve reported earlier ) and business as usual everywhere else , my only window into this crisis is through what ’s offered by media outlets and my favorite news channels .
I wonder now whether I ’m miscalculating the severity of our financial situation , as implied by these bailout talks and Fed ’s threats of recession .
In the midst of all the ruckus and rumblings of economic carnage , here I am still conducting myself in the same way I ’ve always been , except now , I ’m wondering how much more worried I should be .
Certainly , the foreclosures are vividly real and painful for those in the thick of these predicaments .
Bankruptcies have spiked , job losses abound , and more riches - to - rags stories are unfolding everyday .
The pain of losing your money in a failed bank when your savings are over FDIC limits is also very real .
But what I ’m seeing is a financial tempest that ’s behaving like some kind of nasty twister ( to use a weather term ) or a bad flu epidemic ( to use a medical analogy ) wherein some people get hit , while most others are spared .
To some degree , I do n’t really like how this economic crisis is playing out — not only because it ’s temporarily wrecking my net worth ( which is to be expected ) — but also for the offbeat reason that I believe it makes us personal finance bloggers look bad .
How ?
Well , the news changes week to week , and developments happen day to day such that whatever we write one day may no longer be so up to date or even completely accurate the next .
I do n’t like how this crisis is compelling me to keep bringing it up — who wants to keep bringing up negativity anyway ?
But I ’ve noticed that this seems to be what readers are hungry to digest , since I ’m noticing a surge of visits from those readers interested in knowing more about the economy and the crappy markets .
I continue to mandate that we should n’t panic and that we should avoid emotional decisions involving our money .
After all , when blood is in the streets , that ’s when we should pump up our courage and think about buying low .
But this media , the talking heads and our political leaders have n’t been too encouraging .
Any thoughts on the financial crisis talk ?
How much is spin and how much is the real deal ?
I do n’t want to understate the gravity of the situation if we ’re really on the brink of something big .

Overview
Some Americans are having a change of heart about mixing religion and politics .
A new survey finds a narrow majority of the public saying that churches and other houses of worship should keep out of political matters and not express their views on day - to - day social and political matters .
For a decade , majorities of Americans had voiced support for religious institutions speaking out on such issues .
The new national survey by the Pew Research Center reveals that most of the reconsideration of the desirability of religious involvement in politics has occurred among conservatives .
Four years ago , just 30 % of conservatives believed that churches and other houses of worship should stay out of politics .
Today , 50 % of conservatives express this view .
As a result , conservatives ’ views on this issue are much more in line with the views of moderates and liberals than was previously the case .
Similarly , the sharp divisions between Republicans and Democrats that previously existed on this issue have disappeared .
There are other signs in the new poll about a potential change in the climate of opinion about mixing religion and politics .
First , the survey finds a small but significant increase since 2004 in the percentage of respondents saying that they are uncomfortable when they hear politicians talk about how religious they are – from 40 % to 46 % .
Again , the increase in negative sentiment about religion and politics is much more apparent among Republicans than among Democrats .
Second , while the Republican Party is most often seen as the party friendly toward religion , the Democratic Party has made gains in this area .
Nearly four - in - ten ( 38 % ) now say the Democratic Party is generally friendly toward religion , up from just 26 % two years ago .
Nevertheless , considerably more people ( 52 % ) continue to view the GOP as friendly toward religion .
The poll by Pew Research Center for the People & the Press and the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life finds increasing numbers of Americans believing that religiously defined ideological groups have too much control over the parties themselves .
Nearly half ( 48 % ) say religious conservatives have too much influence over the Republican Party , up from 43 % in August 2007 .
At the same time , more people say that liberals who are not religious have too much sway over the Democrats than did so last year ( 43 % today vs. 37 % then ) .
Social Conservatives ’ Discontents
In addition to somewhat greater worries about the way religious and non-religious groups are influencing the parties , the survey suggests that frustration and disillusionment among social conservatives may be a part of the reason why a greater number now think that religious institutions should keep out of politics .
However , there is little to suggest that social conservatives want religion to be a less important element in American politics .
The greatest increases since 2004 in the view that churches and other houses of worship should not express themselves on political matters have occurred among less - educated Republicans and people who say that social issues such as abortion and same - sex marriage will be important to their vote .
For example , among people who rate gay marriage as a top voting issue , the percentage saying that churches should stay out of politics soared from 25 % in 2004 to 50 % currently ; there was little change over this period on this question among people who do not view same - sex marriage as a very important issue .
Another indication that disillusionment may be in play in increased opposition to the mixing of religion and politics is seen in the fact that this sentiment has increased most among people who rate the major parties as unfriendly toward religion .
The views of citizens who see the parties as neutral or friendly toward religion have been more stable on the question of whether churches and other houses of worship should speak out on political issues .
In short , the change of mind about the role of religious institutions in politics is most apparent among people who are most concerned about the very issues that churches and other houses of worship have focused on , and among those who fault the parties for their friendliness toward religion .
Changes in views about the role of churches in politics notwithstanding , many of the contours of American public opinion relating to broad questions of religion and politics remain largely unchanged .
Two - thirds of the public ( 66 % ) say that churches and other houses of worship should not endorse one candidate over another , which is unchanged since 2004 ( 65 % ) .
And while most say it is important for presidents to have strong religious beliefs , they are divided about whether there currently is too much , or too little , in the way of expressions of faith by contemporary political leaders .
Roughly comparable numbers say political leaders express their religious beliefs too much ( 29 % ) , too little ( 36 % ) or the right amount ( 28 % ) .
Despite their increased reluctance to see religious institutions speaking out on politics , conservatives and Republicans continue to express very strong support for a religious president and relatively high levels of support for expressions of religious faith and prayer by political leaders .
Soft Support Among Social Conservatives for McCain
While some social conservatives are expressing changed views about religion and politics , there is little indication that they are changing their voting preferences : John McCain has about as large a lead over Barack Obama among conservatives and white evangelicals as George Bush did at this stage in the campaign four years ago .
However , as has been the case since June , the current survey shows much more tepid support for McCain among white evangelical Protestants and conservatives generally than Bush enjoyed in August 2004 .
Just 28 % of white evangelical Protestants say they are strong backers of the Arizona senator .
Four years ago , 57 % of white evangelicals described themselves as strong backers of President Bush .
As was the case in previous presidential elections , the voting inclinations of Catholic voters – especially white non-Hispanic Catholics – remain fluid .
Four years ago at this time John Kerry held a slight edge over Bush among white non-Hispanic Catholics ; but he lost that lead by the election .
In the current poll , this group , which accounts for 18 % of the electorate , is divided almost evenly : 45 % support McCain , while 44 % favor Obama .
Other Findings
The survey was conducted by telephone – both landline phones and cell phones – from July 31 - Aug. 10 among a national sample of 2,905 adults .
It finds that as the Democratic Party ’s advantage in party identification has grown , there have been some notable changes in party affiliation within key religious groups .
In 2008 , about half of registered voters ( 51 % ) identify themselves as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party , while just 38 % identify as Republicans or Republican leaners .
In 2004 , Democrats held only a slight , three - point advantage in party affiliation ( 47 % to 44 % ) .
While white non-Hispanic Catholics are divided in their presidential choices , they are increasingly identifying as Democrats .
In surveys conducted this year , 49 % of white non-Hispanic Catholics either affiliate with or lean toward the Democratic Party , while 40 % identify with the GOP .
In 2004 , 47 % of white non-Hispanic Catholics identified with the GOP while 45 % affiliated with the Democratic Party .
The survey finds that the economy continues to dominate the concerns of voters .
Nearly nine - in - ten ( 87 % ) say the economy will be very important to their vote this fall , up from 78 % in October 2004 .
Energy has surged among voters ’ concerns : 77 % view energy as very important , compared with only 54 % in the closing weeks of the last campaign .
For the most part , the issues that are important to the public as a whole are also important to particular religious groups .
However , social issues , such as same - sex marriage , continue to be more important for white evangelicals than for other registered voters .
Currently , 46 % of white evangelicals say same - sex marriage will be a very important voting issue , compared with 28 % of all voters .
That is only somewhat less than the percentage of white evangelical voters who viewed same - sex marriage as very important in October 2004 ( 49 % ) .

People have found teeth , money , and bacon inside their books .
Be careful what you use as a bookmark .
Thousands of dollars , a Christmas card signed by Frank Baum , a Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card , a marriage certificate from 1879 , a baby ’s tooth , a diamond ring and a handwritten poem by Irish writer Katharine Tynan Hickson are just some of the stranger objects discovered inside books by AbeBooks.com booksellers .
I recently opened a secondhand book and an airline boarding pass from Liberia in west Africa to Fort Worth , Texas , fell to the floor .
Was there a story behind this little slip of paper ?
Was someone fleeing from a country ravaged by two civil wars since 1989 ?
I will never know , but used and rare booksellers discover countless objects - some mundane , some bizarre , some deeply personal - inside books as they sort and catalog books for resale .
Adam Tobin , owner of Unnameable Books in Brooklyn , New York , has created a display inside his bookstore dedicated to objects discovered in books .
“ It ’s a motley assortment , ” he said .
“ We ’ve been doing it for about two years since opening the store .
The display quickly took over the back wall and now it ’s spreading to other places , and there ’s a backlog of stuff that we have n’t put up yet .
There are postcards , shopping lists , and concert tickets but my favorites are the cryptic notes .
They are often deeply personal and can be very moving . ”
Used booksellers often take ownership of books that have been in a family or a household for decades or even generations .
“ It ’s easy to find things in books that are very dated , ” explained Adam , ” Such as a newspaper advert for elastic bands from the 19th century .
My personal favorite is an ad from the 1950s that reads ‘ Rinsing Dacron Curtains in Milk Makes Them Crisp , Stiff , Just Like New . ’ ”
The most valuable item discovered by Adam is a letter written by CS Lewis - author of the Narnia series – but his monetary finds have been limited to a $ 1 note now pinned to the display .
Eager to learn more , AbeBooks.com asked its booksellers to reveal their finds .
You might be surprised to learn what people will leave inside a book .
THE FINANCIAL Money was a constant theme .
As well as legal tender US dollar bills , there were plenty of foreign notes as well as credit cards , debit cards , social security cards , domestic bills , credit card receipts , and cancelled checks .
“ A wealthy , elderly woman in my town died a few years ago and left a large book collection with many fine books , much of which wound up in my inventory .
The remaining books went to a local thrift shop , including a microwave cookbook which , as it turned out , contained 40 $ 1000 bills .
The book was purchased by someone from out of town who was idling away the time waiting for her ride .
She took the money to a local bank to verify its authenticity and that was how we heard about it .
She did n't give a cent back to the thrift shop , either .
A deeply frustrating experience for many , I can assure you . ”

Barack Obama talks with customers during a campaign stop at O'Keefe 's Pub in Clearwater , Fla. , on Sept. 23 .
Obama makes key gains in tight race
Riding a wave of worry about the nation 's financial health , Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) has broken into a lead in a national poll and has made slight but notable progress in several crucial battleground states , including Florida and Virginia .
Obama moved decisively ahead of Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) in a Washington Post - ABC News Poll .
And a new Bloomberg / Los Angeles Times poll found that respondents thought Obama would do a better job handing the financial crisis than McCain , by 45 percent to 33 percent .

Perhaps more worrisome for his campaign , however , was a wave of polls this week showing Obama making gains in Florida and Virginia , both of which had looked favorable for McCain .
McCain is also having to sweat states that should be in his back pocket .
He is adding staff in North Carolina , and Republicans are considering airing TV ads in Indiana .
The electoral math still shows several opportunities for McCain , and the Republican ticket remains strong in traditional toss - ups like Michigan , Pennsylvania and Ohio , and emerging battlegrounds like Minnesota .
Since the conventions , Obama has also gained ground in the battlegrounds of Michigan , Colorado and New Mexico .
McCain has his own bragging points : Obama has moved staff out of Georgia and North Dakota , and has not put away Wisconsin .
The two campaigns disagree on whether or not Obama has clinched Iowa , with both claiming gains that are sticking .
McCain has showed progress in Wisconsin ; Minnesota , where Republicans held their convention ; Alaska , the home state of running mate Sarah Palin ; and North Dakota .
McCain has also made gains in New Hampshire , according to two new polls by ARG and the University of New Hampshire , which showed McCain up by 3 points and 2 points , respectively , in the one state that flipped from red to blue between 2000 and 2004 .
Ohio and Pennsylvania remain super tight .
Nationally , the Real Clear Politics polling average has Obama up 2.5 points in a race that had been tied , suggesting that the bounce from McCain ’s selection of Palin has peaked .
Republican uber - strategist Karl Rove , who keeps running state - by - state projections on Rove.com , wrote this week : “ [ I ] f the movement toward Obama in national polls continues to percolate down to the states , we could see an Obama lead later this week . ”
Friday ’s opening debate should shake up the race yet again , and both campaigns say the race is close and will remain close .
But key strategists in both parties say the sudden focus on the economy , and McCain ’s mixed messages following the implosion on Wall Street , have given Obama a solid footing just as many undecided voters begin to tune in .
“ The shift is significant but it ’s not big , ” said a top Obama official .
“ The more Barack Obama can convince voters that he has the strength to handle the economic concerns of the country , the better likelihood he ’s going to have to get elected .
And I think we ’re winning that argument . ”
Obama has moved staff out of Georgia , although his campaign says the remaining staff of 53 is the most a Democratic presidential campaign has had in the state in at least 30 years .
In Florida , Obama had a two - point lead in an NBC / Mason - Dixon poll released Tuesday – a statistical tie .
Perhaps more significant than the top - line number , the poll showed Obama trailing McCain by just six points among Florida ’s Latino population , which has tended to support the GOP in past elections .
Other recent Florida polls also show McCain leading , but within the margin of error .
A St. Petersburg Times poll released over the weekend gave McCain a 47 - 45 percent lead in the state , and a recent American Research Group survey had the two candidates tied at 46 percent .
In Virginia , too , the Democratic nominee seems in a substantially stronger position than he was just weeks ago .
An ABC News / Washington Post survey conducted from Sept. 18 - 21 placed Obama three points ahead of his opponent , leading 49 - 46 percent .
A poll by SurveyUSA released Monday by WJLA ABC 7 and other news organizations gave Obama a wider , six - point lead .
As in Florida , some polls have still shown McCain ahead – but every recent survey has shown Obama within very plausible reach in the Old Dominion , which has not supported a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964 .
In Minnesota , which had previously looked out of reach for the Republican ticket , two new polls by Quinnipiac and ARG measured Obama ’s edge at two points or less .
In June , a Quinnipiac poll gave the Democrat a 17 - point lead in the state .
Through the swath of battlegrounds surrounding the Great Lakes , McCain is consistently within a few points of the Democratic nominee , and even slightly ahead in the state of Ohio , where a poll sponsored by several state newspapers showed McCain with a six - point lead over the weekend .
But with states like Florida , Virginia and , in the mountain West , Colorado and Nevada looking increasingly favorable to Obama , McCain may not be able to reach 270 by picking off just one or two of these Midwestern swing states .
If Obama ’s upward trend continues , McCain would have to run the tables in these states , or win a big surprise victory elsewhere , in order to make up for it .

DEATH TO ALL MONSTERS !
SEX SIN AND ZEN
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP !
In this new digital era that we ’re all living in , a lot of people who think they are n’t geeks actually are .
Just look at the following illustration by David Armano and you ’ll understand right away .

On Monday , March 10 , Wall Street was tense , as it had been for months .
The mortgage market had crashed ; major companies like Citigroup and Merrill Lynch had written off billions of dollars in bad loans .
In what the economists called a “ credit crisis , ” the big banks were so spooked they had all but stopped lending money , a trend which , if it continued , would spell disaster on 21st - century Wall Street , where trading firms routinely borrow as much as 50 times the cash in their accounts to trade complex financial instruments such as derivatives .
Still , as he drove in from his Connecticut home to the glass - sheathed Midtown Manhattan headquarters of Bear Stearns , Sam Molinaro was n’t expecting trouble .
Molinaro , 50 , Bear ’s popular chief financial officer , thought he could spot the first rays of daylight at the end of nine solid months of nonstop crisis .
The nation ’s fifth - largest investment bank , known for its notoriously freewheeling — some would say maverick — culture , Bear had pledged to fork over more than $ 3 billion the previous summer to bail out one of its two hedge funds that had bet heavily on subprime loans .
At the time , rumors flew it would go bankrupt .
Bear ’s swashbuckling C.E.O. , 74 - year - old Jimmy Cayne , pilloried as a detached figure who played bridge and rounds of golf while his firm was in crisis , had been ousted in January .
His replacement , an easygoing 58 - year - old investment banker named Alan Schwartz , was down at the Breakers resort in Palm Beach that morning , rubbing elbows with News Corp . ’s Rupert Murdoch and Viacom ’s Sumner Redstone at Bear ’s annual media conference .
It was an uneventful morning — at first .
Molinaro sat in his sixth - floor corner office , overlooking Madison Avenue , catching up on paperwork after a week - long trip visiting European investors .
Then , around 11 , something happened .
Exactly what , no one knows to this day .
But Bear ’s stock began to fall .
It was then , questioning his trading desks downstairs , that Molinaro first heard the rumor : Bear was having liquidity troubles , Wall Street ’s way of saying the firm was running out of money .
Molinaro made a face .
This was crazy .
There was no liquidity problem .
Bear had about $ 18 billion in cash reserves .

IN THE annals of fashion the snap - fastener , or press - stud , holds a humble place .
Few care that it was invented in Germany , as the Federknopf - Verschluss , in the 1880s .
Not many appreciate that some varieties have discs and grooves , while others boast sockets with studs .
And almost no one considers that they give a man style .
But Jack Weil did .
Mr Weil reckoned that a cowboy on a horse , if wearing a shirt with buttons , was liable to get snagged on sagebrush or cactus or , worse than that , get a steerhorn straight through his fancy buttonhole .
He was pretty certain , too , that a cowboy losing a button would feel disinclined to sew it on again .
The answer to all those difficulties was to make shirts with snap - fasteners .
And for 62 years , in a red - brick warehouse in the LoDo district of Denver , Mr Weil did exactly that .
He also added a few more customisings .
Pockets with sawtooth flaps , to keep tobacco in ; a yoke fit , to broaden out the shoulders ; body - hugging seams , to show the fine muscles of a cattleman ; and deep cuffs .
The hats , belts , buckles and bolo ties , which he also commercialised , were optional .
But the snap - fasteners were de rigueur : topped with pearl and backed with tin , square or circular or diamond - shaped , strong enough to pass without cracking through the wringer of a 1940s washing - machine , and flash enough to turn heads on the streets of Denver on a Saturday night .
“ A cinch ” , as Mr Weil proudly said .
Until he created his shirts , there was no distinctively western look in American couture .
There were cowboys ; but they wore dusty working clothes , accessorised with sweaty bandannas and clanking spurs , that no one much cared to copy .
Indeed , Mr Weil early on in his career made work - gear for cowboys , and learnt an important fact : they had no money .
If he wanted to make any money himself , he would have to appeal not to the catwalk instincts of cattlemen , which were hard to spot , but to wannabe easterner cowboys who lived in , say , New York .
Fortunately , there were plenty of them .
His shirts , sold after 1946 through his company , Rockmount Ranch Wear , became extremely famous .
The Premium Blue Flannel Plaid was worn by Ronald Reagan , and the Pink Gabardine by Bob Dylan .
Eric Clapton liked the diamond - snap number ; Robert Redford in “ The Horse Whisperer ” wore a rayon plaid .
Mr Weil 's company clad Elvis Presley , John Travolta and almost everyone , gay or straight , in “ Brokeback Mountain ” .
It also made the shirts , in red , white and blue , for the Colorado House delegation at this year 's Democratic convention .
Mr Weil very narrowly missed seeing them , but that would not have troubled him .
He thought that “ any young man worth his salt ” ought to be a Democrat ; but that once he had a bit of money , the only way to keep hold of it was to turn Republican .
In his long , long life , Mr Weil accumulated plenty of simple business sense .
He knew J.C. Penney , and thought him smart .
Levi-Strauss was a nice fellow , but got too big for his britches ; Sam Walton , founder of Wal - Mart , was a “ hillbilly son of a bitch ” .
Walton constantly harassed him to supply Wal - Mart with shirts , but Mr Weil never wanted any customer to take more than 5 % of his business .
He felt he would lose control that way , and he considered discounters low - life in general .
What mattered were two things , quality , and knowing the customer : which was why , until a few weeks before his death , “ Papa Jack ” was always to be found from 8 am till noon at his front desk in the company store on Wazee Street , poring over the past - due accounts and shaking hands with whoever came in , asking “ Where you from ? ” and frequently being astounded at the answer .
Republican or not , globalisation was lost on him .
He insisted that his shirts were manufactured in America .
Sure , it cost more than getting them sewn in China ; but if Chinese people made them , that would take jobs from Americans and mean they could n't buy his shirts anyway .
When Reagan declared once that America had become a service economy , Mr Weil wrote to him complaining that “ where I come from in southern Indiana , servicing meant when you took the mare to the stud . ”
Reagan gently pointed out to “ Jack ” that things were less simple in Washington .
Ungartered socks
Much as he loved them , Mr Weil had not begun in shirts .
The farm boy had started off , at $ 25 a week , inspecting navy dungarees , and had moved on eventually to be a travelling rep for Paris Garters ( “ Not once , but many times ” , the advert ran , “ she had noticed his ungartered socks crumpling down around his shoe tops . ” )
His territory ran from the Mexican border to the Canadian .
He supposed , diffidently , that he might need a car ; though something better than the Model - T Ford he first drove , with wire wheels attached so loosely that if you backed up the street too far , they fell off .
He arrived in Denver in 1928 to find a rough - and - rumble cow - town of 200,000 people , famous mostly for the gold that had been discovered there .
By his 107th year , as he noted with wonder , it was a city of 2 m ; and there was a Jack A. Weil Way in it , besides his own face looking down from the billboards of the Denver Visitors Bureau .
And he , his grandson liked to say , had become the Henry Ford of the western look , snap - fasteners and all .

Observations :
– Rather ’s language suggests he has knowledge of a news clip in custody of CBS in which Giuliani “ holds up ” what he claims is a “ flight data recorder ” from the WTC wreckage .
– Rather introduces this clip , but immediately a BBC - style “ technical problem ” prevents its being aired .
– Giuliani would not make such an announcement to the national media casually –much less “ hold up ” the object in question –without confirmation that what had been found was indeed a “ flight data recorder ” and not the remains of some other electronic appliance from the debris .
This episode supports claims by FDNY personnel and an NTSB “ insider ” that the WTC “ black boxes ” were in fact found , and suggests the actual moment the blackout curtain descends on this matter in the corporate media .
Like his brief echo of the George Washington Bridge “ bomb van ” , this appears to be another telling , quickly muted , never - corrected departure from the official narrative by Rather , giving further context to his ominous comments about the “ flaming necklace ” of “ lack of patriotism ” inflicted upon free - thinking journalists after 9/11 .
Does anyone , anywhere have video or a transcript of Giuliani making such an announcement ?
Is there any follow - up to Rather ’s intro in the archives ?

The search giant Google has pledged to fund research aimed at detecting and preventing virulent new diseases
Google has pledged to try to stop the next global pandemic by investing $ 15 m in a series of hi-tech health schemes .
Money from the internet giant will provide funding for six projects that aim to detect new diseases and understand the conditions that help them spread – potentially saving millions of lives in the process .
" Business as usual wo n't prevent the next Aids or Sars , " said Dr Larry Brilliant , the executive director of Google.org .
" The teams we 're funding today are on the frontiers of digital and genetic early - detection technology . "
In the first round of grants , $ 15 m ( £ 8.8 m ) is being spread among organisations working to identify and prevent infectious diseases that have the potential to become global pandemics .
Among the biggest beneficiaries is the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative , a group that collects blood samples from humans and animals around the world in order to spot dangerous pathogens that leap from animals to humans .
Examples of pandemic diseases that have followed this route include HIV , Sars and bird flu – even if the link has taken years or even decades to be determined .
The initiative will receive $ 5.5 m from Google.org in order to expand its remit .
Its founder , Dr Nathan Wolfe , said that the development could have a huge impact .
" Every hour , on every continent , viruses move from animals into people , " he said .
" Working in animal markets , with restaurant workers and with hunters at the end of the road , we sort through this traffic to stop deadly diseases before they spread . "
Google will also be contributing $ 2.5 m to a scheme run by the Mailman School of Public Health , based at Columbia University in New York , which aims to speed up its programme to discover new pathogens .
The other organisations receiving grants as part of the announcement include the International Research Institute for Climate and Society – also at Columbia – and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research , which will both receive $ 900,000 to improve weather prediction and forecasting .
Although it may not appear that the weather has a strong influence on the spread of diseases , Google.org programme director Frank Rijsberman said it was crucial to improve forecasting in conjunction with the identification of disease " hot spots " across Africa and south - east Asia .
" We think it has a critical role to play , " he said .
" For example , the last major outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Kenya – which affects cattle and spills over into people – was actually predicted several months in advance through a weather forecast .
It was going to be wet , and that meant there were going to be a lot more mosquitos , and the mosquitos – if they reach a certain threshold – were likely to pass on the disease . "
The Woods Hole Research Center , based in Massachusetts , will receive $ 2 m to produce satellite images of forests in the developing world to help understand how the environment affects the spread of diseases .
Google has pledged to contribute 1 % of all its profits to charity , as well as giving Google.org 3 m shares in the parent company – currently valued at more than $ 1bn .
As part of its wide - ranging mission to develop new ideas in energy , the environment and global poverty , the organisation has already made significant investments in geothermal energy , solar technologies and wind power .
Rijsberman said that how much more was put into these schemes would depend on how successful they become .
" In renewable energy we have started with large investments , while in this initiative we have started with grants but expect to move into investments in diagnostics companies later .
Over the next several years we expect some of them might be more successful than others , or we might find better ways of putting our resources to work . "

In the early morning hours there ’s a din in the air ; mayhem ’s on the loose .
Stormtroopers comin’ , and you better be prepared .
Got no time to choose ….
Comin ’ up that street , jackboots steppin’ high .
Got to make a stand .
Looking in your windows and listen to your phone .
Keep a gun in your hand … .
Two hundred down , and it ’s comin ’ ’ round again .
Got no second choice .
Where ’s the justice and where ’s that law .
Raise your healthy voice ….
Get ready .
Stormtroopers comin’… .

The recently concluded Republican National Convention in St. Paul served as the grand coming - out party for the Homeland Security State .
Its enforcers , fully panoplied in the military regalia that is rapidly becoming standard police attire , could be seen either strutting through the streets hungry to conduct a beat - down or marching to military cadences .
Armored vehicles prowled the streets , while military helicopters rattled overhead .
Several journalists , including Amy Goodman and two associates from the independent Democracy Now !
media enterprise , were arrested and assaulted by police while covering protest marches .
Large sections of Minneapolis / St. Paul , a placid Midwestern American community , were made to resemble Baghdad under military occupation .
As in Baghdad , homes in the Twin Cities were subjected to “ pre-emptive ” military raids on the eve of the Republican Convention .
Beginning the night of Friday , August 29 , multi-jurisdictional paramilitary police units armed with automatic weapons stormed residences where left - wing activists were billeted in anticipation of protest demonstrations .
More than one hundred people were handcuffed and questioned during those raids , many of them forced to lie face - down on the ground while officers searched for evidence of various purported plots to disrupt and “ terrorize ” the convention .
According to Glenn Greenwald , a civil libertarian commentator who was on - site immediately after the raids , at least some of the police who conducted the raids could n’t resist tormenting helpless detainees with jocular talk about summary executions .
In total more than 800 people were arrested during convention - related demonstrations .
The most significant of those arrests involved eight people detained during the pre-convention raids who were eventually charged with “ conspiracy to riot in furtherance of terrorism ” under Minnesota ’s version of the PATRIOT ( sic ) Act .
Where mere " conspiracy to riot " is a misdemeanor , re-classifying it as an act of terrorism leaves the defendants facing the prospect of seven years in prison .
This is the first time American citizens have been accused , in a civilian court , of committing a crime “ in furtherance ” of terrorism .
It will not be the last .
Some elements of the protest “ community ” that materialized in St. Paul were incontestably seeking a confrontation with the police as a form of ideological street theater .
While some consider this approach to be useless at best , it ’s not that different in principle from tactics perfected by Samuel Adams and like - minded patriots of our founding period .
Other street activists in the Twin Cities expressed their contempt for the criminal violence of the State by deliberately impeding peaceful commerce and destroying private property , which is neither useful nor justified .
But it is the prosecution of the eight " terrorist " suspects , and the long - term surveillance project involving the RNC Welcoming Committee ( RNCWC ) , that will have the most important tangible consequences .
The methods of infiltration , surveillance , and apprehension used against those activists will provide a model for future crackdowns against any organized dissent .
Accounts of the arrests in the corporatist press retailed prosecution claims that the activists planned a campaign of mayhem and violence that would have included attacks on public transportation and attempts to kidnap Republican delegates .
The “ evidence ” seized during the raids consists of unremarkable construction materials — cans of paint , rope , roofing nails — that could be used in various disruptive ways .
The search warrant application also permitted police to confiscate “ computer systems ” and “ media in whatever form , ” in order to obtain detailed information about the activities of the RNCWC , which is described as an “ organized criminal enterprise . ”
That document also claims that “ possession of the property above described constitutes a crime . ”
Thus someone who owned a computer or a single can of paint could be arrested , indicted , and perhaps convicted of terrorism charges in absence of a single documented criminal act if the prosecution can supply a convincing narrative .
And in this case , as with so many others , the job of supply the appropriate narrative has been given to “ confidential informants , ” two of whom ( along with an “ undercover investigator ” ) are cited copiously in the warrant application and the criminal complaint .
The “ corroboration ” offered for the most lurid and disturbing charges — those dealing with actual violence and property destruction — consists entirely of the accounts provided by paid informants .
“ Of the stuff that was seized by the police , about ninety percent is just common household items that we ’re told were going to be used for criminal acts , ” commented Bruce Nestor , a defense attorney for the detainees , in a telephone interview with Pro Libertate .
“ In fact , there is nothing here that in itself constitutes evidence of a crime or a plot to commit a crime .
[ The prosecution ] wants us to view these items in light of the story being told by the paid informants , and the presumed political beliefs of the detainees . ”
Police who conducted the pre-convention raids claim to have found 37 “ caltrops ” — spikes that are scattered on a motorway to disable cars during a police pursuit .
What was actually found was not a supply of standard - issue caltrops , but roofing nails that had supposedly been “ weaponized . ”
“ To be fair , roofing nails could be used as caltrops , but they could also be used as roofing nails , ” Nestor pointed out when I asked him about that reported discovery .
“ Some police experts insist that these particular roofing nails had been modified or bundled together in some way that suggests the intention to use them to disrupt traffic .
But this is suggestive , once again , largely because of the stories told by the informants .
Otherwise you ’ve got common roofing nails ” — possession of which is evidence only of a plot to repair one ’s roof .
Similar considerations apply in evaluating the claim that police discovered “ weaponized urine ” ( no , I ’m not kidding ) during the pre-convention raids .
What the police , citing breathless reports from their confidential informants , triumphantly described as an attempt to create a very crude bio-chem anti-personnel weapon was described by activists as a rudimentary chamber pot .
Given the frequency with which well - publicized “ international terrorist plots ” prove to be media spectacles choreographed by the FBI through paid informant / provocateurs , it ’s reasonable to suspect that the case against RNCWC activists may involve a domestic application of the same approach .
Former CIA analyst Ray McGovern , who was present in St. Paul to speak to peace activists at a St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church , believes that “ what violence there was [ during protests ] bore the earmarks of provocation by the likes of Sheriff Fletcher and his Homeland Security , FBI , and — according to one well - sourced report — Blackwater buddies . ”
McGovern describes one instance in which “ a man who looked like a protester — dark clothes , backpack , a bit disheveled ” — was identified as one of the police officers who had carried out the Friday night raid against the RNCWC .
“ The young protesters asked the man , and two associates , to leave [ the protest ] , at which point the three hustled into a nearby unmarked sedan , ” writes McGovern .
“ The license plate , observed by a Pioneer Press reporter , traced back to the detective unit of the Hennepin County Sheriff ’s office … . ”
It ’s worth remembering that the same time - honored tactic was on display during the August 2007 Security and Prosperity Partnership summit in Montebello , Quebec almost exactly a year earlier .
In an incident captured on video , a group of ineptly disguised police infiltrators , armed with rocks and reeking of foul intentions , were caught trying to infiltrate and radicalize a peaceful protest march .

CBS takes down McCain webad , suggests it 's ' misleading '
YouTube has removed a webad that casts Sarah Palin as the victim of sexism on the request of CBS , whose anchor Katie Couric was featured in the ad .
“ One of the great lessons of that campaign is the continued and accepted role of sexism in American life , " Couric is quoted in the ad .
In the original clip , which aired months before Palin entered the race , Couric was talking about Hillary Clinton .
The ad applies her words to Palin .
Asked about the ad , CBS spokeswoman Leigh Farris said , " CBS News does not endorse any candidate in the Presidential race .
Any use of CBS personnel in political advertising that suggests the contrary is misleading . "
YouTube 's page displaying the ad now tells visitors , " This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by CBS Interactive Inc . "
Couric 's original commentary can be seen here .
McCain still has the ad , " Lipstick , " on his website .

The German zookeeper who hand - reared Knut the polar bear and helped turn the animal into a global celebrity has been found dead in his Berlin flat , police said today .
Thomas Dörflein was said to have been seriously ill for some time , and officers do not believe any foul play was involved .
Dörflein became Knut 's surrogate parent when the cub was rejected by his mother , Tosca , after being born at the Zoologischer Garten Berlin in December 2006 .
Thanks to round - the - clock care from the 44 - year - old , who hand - fed Knut and slept in the same cage , the polar bear cub became the first at the zoo to survive past infancy for more than 30 years .
Knut - mania gripped the world last March when Dörflein accompanied the cub on his first public appearance in front of the global media .
The ensuing attention turned the bear and his keeper into media stars .
Knut appeared on the cover of a German edition of Vanity Fair , and his popularity drew record numbers of visitors to the zoo .
Dörflein and Knut built a special rapport , and the bearded zookeeper was rarely seen without the white bear following close behind .
As Knut grew , however , it became too dangerous for Dörflein to play with him .
Last November , the zoo decided it would be best if all contact between the two was cut off .
Not everyone had appreciated Dörflein 's work .
Some animal rights activists argued that Knut should have been killed rather than turned into a " domestic pet " , and others claim the animal is showing signs of disturbed behaviour .
Last year , Dörflein , a father of three , was awarded the Medal of Merit by the city of Berlin for his work in rearing Knut and raising the zoo 's profile .

Gas can be stored in dry water
' Dry water ' looks like a powder - but a quick squeeze is enough to release the fluid .
A. Cooper et al / ACS
Methane and natural gas are usually shipped around in pressurized pipelines and canisters .
But chemists have now developed a new way to transport the gases : as a powder .
Andrew Cooper and his colleagues at the University of Liverpool , UK , have found that they can trap methane in a bizarre material dubbed ' dry water ' , a mixture of silica and water that looks and acts like a fine white powder1 .
The methane reacts with the water to produce a crystalline material called methane gas hydrate , in which individual methane molecules sit inside ice - like cages of water molecules .
In principle , this could offer a way to store methane conveniently for use as a vehicle fuel .
Methane - powered vehicles produce less pollution than those running off petroleum fuels .
“ It looks like a powder , but if you wipe it on your skin , it smears and feels cold . ”
Andrew Cooper
University of Liverpool , UK
Natural gas is mostly methane , and so the new material could even be used as an alternative to pipelines to ship it from gas fields .
" This is a very important issue " , says E. Dendy Sloan , a specialist in natural hydrates at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden , who was not connected with the research .
About 70 % of the world 's natural - gas stores , says Sloan , are in small , remote reservoirs from which it is not economical to run a pipeline .
The paradox of dry water
Methane gas hydrate forms naturally when water is mixed with methane at high pressure and low temperature .
Huge deposits of the crystalline substance exist in the deep sea , where they could provide vast fuel reserves .
But rising global temperatures increase the chances of the hydrate decomposing , releasing the greenhouse gas and accelerating further warming .
This mechanism has been proposed as a cause of dramatic environmental change in the distant past .
Using methane gas hydrate as a kind of ' solid methane ' for storage and transport has been mooted before .
The Japanese company Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding has a pilot project for producing natural - gas hydrates on board ships that would then transport the gas from remote marine deposits — and using some of the stored gas to power the ships themselves .
The problem is that the hydrate forms only under cold , pressurized conditions , and then very slowly .
Typically , a skin of the material forms at the surface of water and prevents further growth .
The formation rate can be speeded up by vigorously mixing the gas with water , but that is costly and cumbersome .
Cooper and his colleagues have got round this problem by finding a way to break the water up into many tiny , stable droplets , massively increasing the surface area in contact with gas .
They do this by converting water to ' dry water ' by stirring it up with a special form of silica , called hydrophobic fumed silica .
This consists of tiny grains of silica – the same basic material as sand – coated with a chemical layer that makes them water - repellent .
The silica particles cover the surface of water droplets and stop them from coalescing .
" If you 've ever seen water drops in dry dust , it 's the same thing " , says Cooper .
" They form a ball with the dust on the surface . "
The resulting ' dry water ' is a very odd substance .
" It looks like a powder " , says Cooper , " but if you wipe it on your skin , it smears and feels cold " as the water is released .
The researchers found that their powder soaks up large quantities of methane at water 's normal freezing point , producing crystalline methane gas hydrate within the silica - coated drops .
A litre of methane gas can be stored in about 6 grammes of the material .
This storage capacity , they say , is very close to the target set by the US Department of Energy for such materials , and compares well with that of other candidate storage media .
And crucially , it is made from cheap raw materials , helping to make this method economical relative to other , more exotic potential methane - capture materials such as designed molecular frameworks2 .
Cool it down , whizz it up
But there remain many obstacles to making this a viable industrial process .
For one thing , the hydrate remains stable only if kept cold .
It must be refrigerated to about minus 70 °C at atmospheric pressure , although this temperature threshold is higher if the hydrate sits within an environment of pressurized methane .
The methane is released again if the material warms up .
Cooper says that , by using salts dissolved in water , his group has recently developed hydrates that remain stable at room temperature .
But it 's hard to make stable ' dry water ' from this mixture .
That 's the next step , which Cooper admits is " very difficult " .
Another problem is that the droplets start to coalesce and therefore react more slowly with methane after several cycles of gas uptake and release .
But the original fine powder can be regenerated by whizzing the mixture again in a blender — handy , but not if it has to be done too regularly .
" In general with gas storage , it 's difficult to hit all the targets at once " , says Cooper , adding that " we 're not anywhere close to working out the economics of this method yet " .
The following is from a Chase Wholesale Broker Bulletin sent to me by " BZ " a senior loan officer in the mortgage business .
Chase has made a business decision to suspend our Non-Agency Fixed and ARM ( Amortizing and Interest - Only ) Product offerings within the Wholesale Lending Business .
We have made this decision based on a variety of reasons including the following :
· A dramatic reduction in Jumbo volume levels over the past six months
· A lack of Capital Markets appetite for Jumbo products
· Worse than expected delinquency performance on these loans
US Bank Places Strict Requirements on Jumbos , and Second Loans
" INTEREST ONLY " PAYMENT OPTION :
1. For PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS : The Interest Only payment option will no longer be allowed for U.S. Bank Consumer Finance 1st liens when the LTV / CLTV exceeds 80 %
2. For REFINANCE TRANSACTIONS :
When the LTV / CLTV is greater than 80 % on any U.S. Bank Wholesale ARM the following requirements will apply for the file to be eligible for Interest Only :
A ) An escrow account for taxes , homeowners insurance ( and flood insurance if applicable ) , and HOA fees if any will be required
B ) A minimum of $ 250,000 of assets / reserves seasoned for a minimum of 60 days will be required .
WHOLESALE SECOND POSITION LOANS / LINES :
1 . The maximum CLTV for any 2nd loan / line is now capped at 80 % in the following states :
Maryland , Missouri , Connecticut , Ohio , New Hampshire , Minnesota , Virginia , Delaware , and Colorado .
This is incredible ; to get a refi with an arm with interest only payments , you need to have $ 250,000 in the bank !
Mortgage money IS available ; but only to those who do n’t need it .
This is more proof of your peak credit / credit crunch scenario .
Chase stops doing all jumbo arms AND fixed products with their wholesale lending business .
This is what US Bank should have done instead of their ridiculous requirement of $ 250000 in liquid assets .
US
Bank is essentially saying that they do n't want to do this type of product , but the important point is there are still more restrictions being placed on mortgage lending
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
One day after President Bush said the nation 's economy is at grave risk , the high - stakes negotiations over the proposed $ 700 billion bailout of the financial system ended in chaos on Thursday .
Lawmakers bickered over competing counterproposals and hours of meetings between key lawmakers broke down without any progress late into the evening .
A meeting at the White House between President Bush , congressional leaders and the presidential candidates was meant to speed approval of an agreement .
Instead , the session revealed deep divisions between Democrats and House Republicans .
As a result , House and Senate leaders and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson rushed to Capitol Hill at 8 p.m. to try to hash out a deal .
But shortly after 10 p.m. , Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , the lead House Democrat on the issue who had been in close talks with Paulson for days , accused Republicans of refusing to negotiate .
" At this point , we have absolutely no participation or cooperation from House Republicans , " Frank said .
The next step was not clear late Thursday night .
One thing seems certain : Lawmakers wo n't recess for the year on Friday , as originally planned .
Instead , if they can't reach a deal in the next 24 hours , they 're likely to work through the weekend .
The page many thought they were on
Leading Democrats said they were presented for the first time with the House Republican principles at the White House meeting .
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , said the White House meeting was thrown off course when participants were blindsided by a new " core agreement " that emerged in the meeting that not many had seen before .
Earlier in the day , congressional negotiators said they had agreed to a set of principles on revisions to the rescue plan , which calls for the Treasury Department to buy up bad mortgage securities from banks in an effort to get them to lend again .
The proposal , as amended by leaders in both chambers , will help homeowners , curb executive pay packages at participating firms and provide oversight of Treasury 's actions , Dodd said in a lunchtime address .
" We 've reached a fundamental agreement on a set of principles , one , for taxpayers , which is tremendously important , " he said .
" We 're very confident we can act expeditiously . "
Details on the plans
The principles the Democrats said had been agreed upon call for Congress to make $ 250 billion available immediately with $ 100 billion available , if needed , without requiring additional congressional approval , said two senior Democratic aides familiar with the negotiations .
The second half of $ 350 billion would then become available by a special approval of Congress .
On executive compensation , the draft would require limits on compensation for executives of any company participating in the bailout .
These caps would apply for as long as the company is in the program .
This would include some language to limit excess " golden parachutes . "
Treasury will also get an equity stake in the companies being helped by the bailout , though what type remains to be worked out .
Still to be worked out is whether to allow bankruptcy judges to modify mortgage terms , a provision backed by many Democrats and community activists but opposed by Republicans and the banking industry .
What House Republicans want
The bankruptcy provision is not the only sticking point , however .
House Republicans are not on board , according to Minority Leader Rep. John Boehner , R - Ohio .
" House Republicans have not agreed to any plan at this point , " Boehner said .
Instead , they issued a statement of economic rescue principles that calls for Wall Street to fund the recovery by injecting private capital - not taxpayer dollars - into the financial markets .
Easing tax laws would prompt investors to put in their own dollars , they said .
The plan also calls for : participating firms to disclose the value of the mortgage assets on their books , ending Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 's securitization of " unsound mortgages , " reviewing the performance of the credit rating agencies and having the Securities and Exchange Commission audit failed companies to ensure their financial standing was accurately portrayed .
House Republicans also want to create a panel to make recommendations for reforming the financial industry by year 's end .
Meanwhile , the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee has another idea .
Sen. Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , said he does n't support the Treasury plan until there is serious consideration of alternatives .
He proposed Thursday adding funds to the Federal Reserve and Treasury to allow them to lend more to financial institutions .
Bush still hopeful
Before the afternoon meeting , Bush said he expects a deal " very shortly . "
After , a counselor to the president said " we 're getting closer .
There 's some more that has to be done .
It 's going to be a consensus plan at the end of the day . "
" Both sides are going to have to work hard to get to an agreement , " presidential counselor Ed Gillespie said on CNN .
Administration officials have spent countless hours this week behind closed doors with and in public hearings before Congress .
Lawmakers were hoping to have a deal agreeable to both parties hammered out before Thursday 's meeting at the White House .
On Wednesday night , Bush took the nation 's airwaves in a prime - time address in which he laid out a looming economic disaster .
" The government 's top economic experts warn that , without immediate action by Congress , America could slip into a financial panic and a distressing scenario would unfold , " Bush said .
" More banks could fail , including some in your community .
The stock market would drop even more , which would reduce the value of your retirement account .
The value of your home could plummet .
Foreclosures would rise dramatically . "

THE PROSECUTION OF GEORGE W. BUSH FOR MURDER
By : Devvy

ï¿½ 2008 - NewsWithViews.com
" The most important thing is for us to find Osama bin Laden .
It is our number one priority and we will not rest until we find him . "
George W. Bush , September 13 , 2001 .
" I do n't know where bin Laden is .
I have no idea and really do n't care .
It 's not that important .
It 's not our priority . "
George W. Bush , March 13 , 2002
The move to impeach President George W. Bush has been around for years .
A large number of Americans actually thought that by voting in Democrats and " taking back " Congress in 2006 , not only would America withdraw from this heinous , unconstitutional war in Iraq ( and Afghanistan ) , they could also expect the incompetent , Nancy Pelosi , to spear head the impeachment of Bush .
Of course , these duped Americans were played , again .
There was never any doubt in my mind that there would be no impeachment .
Many years ago , the foolish Republicans went after Marxist Bill Clinton for the wrong reason .
Clinton sold our most sensitive defense secrets to the communist Chinese .
Instead of Congress going after him for provable treason , gutless Republicans in the House went after Clinton over a sex charge .
Of course , if one has read David Schippers book , Sellout : The Inside Story of President Clinton 's Impeachment , they will fully understand the whole episode was rigged and there was never any serious intention of removing Clinton from office .
The same applies to Bush .
The Democrats want him to stay in office for political currency - in other words , American soldiers are expendable to get closet communist , Barack Hussein Obama , into the White House .
Millions of Democrats have come to realize they were had , but continue to support the ring leaders of such treachery .
A form of insanity .
I am not a fan of Michael Moore .
I 've never seen any of his movies , but I am going to quote from his site because this is the heart of the matter .
The gut wrenching question tens of millions have asked .
The heart breaking questions from mothers who ask , " Did my son die for nothing ? " :
October 22 , 2004 .
WASHINGTON - October 11 - “ How do you think it feels for a grieving mother to hear Charles Duelfer , the top CIA weapons inspector for Iraq , state last week that Iraq destroyed its weapons of mass destruction years ago and had no ability to produce more , under sanctions ?
How do you think it feels to hear White House officials now admit that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11 ?
I want to know : did Michael die for a lie ? ” asked Lila Lipscomb , the military mother from Flint , Michigan , who is featured in Michael Moore ’s “ Fahrenheit 9/11 ” reading from the last letter her son , Michael , sent home from Iraq before he died .
Heartbroken and angry , Mrs. Lipscomb has embarked on a Tour of Duty around America , imploring audiences to question why we invaded Iraq and why our troops are still there . "
These are facts Americans continue to ignore :
1 . It is not our duty or obligation to remove any dictator from any foreign country by invading and killing anyone in our way .
The Monroe Doctrine , December 2 , 1823
2 . It is not our responsibility to invade a foreign country to promote the evil of democracy .
The Monroe Doctrine , December 2 , 1823
3 - It is not our responsibility to invade any foreign country to allegedly protect a neighboring country to settle squabbling , religious or tribal differences between them that have lasted decades or a thousand years .
The Monroe Doctrine , December 2 , 1823
4 . The U.S. Constitution does not authorize the American people to be robbed using borrowed money to fund wars based on lies and what is known as nation building .
Our military is for our defense , period .
We have the right to defend if attacked .
5. Bush has acknowledged the fact that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with September 11 , 2001 .
6 . There were no weapons of mass destruction .
7. Iraq was NOT any kind of threat to these united States of America .
8. Bush and his co conspirators planned the invasion of Iraq long before September 11 , 2001 , because it is the agenda being pursued for world government and every country who does n't fall lock step into line will be invaded and occupied until the desired results are achieved .
That agenda includes making sure control of the world 's oil supply is in the hands of the power brokers who own the U.S. Congress .
Paid mouth pieces and party hacks on the stupid tube shout that any American questioning Bush 's motives during a time of war and and the invasions of two non threatening countries are somehow aiding and abetting the enemy .
" Soft on terrorism . "
Classic propaganda .
It is our duty to question the motives and policies of those allegedly elected to public office on any issue - especially war .
I have not participated in the efforts by dozens of groups and organizations out to impeach Bush because as I said above , I knew it would never happen .
Should Americans remain silent when a president commits ' high crimes and misdemeanors ' ?
Absolutely not .
However , reality is reality and that 's the bitter pill Americans have been tasting for years as the Democrats continue to go right along with Bush 's insanity .
Both parties continue to approve hundreds of billions of dollars that do n't exist to fund his lunacy .
Every single penny thrown away in the Middle East has to be borrowed because these crooks , cowards and criminals called Congress , have spent this country into a $ 9.5 TRILLION dollar debt .
It makes no difference to them .
They keep spending on these endless wars because the people allow it .
There are plans underway to prosecute George W. Bush for war crimes :
Law School Plans to Prosecute Bush
" The Massachusetts School of Law at Andover will convene a conference in September to lay plans to prosecute President Bush and other high administration officials for war crimes .
" This is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred , " says MSL 's dean Lawrence Velvel in a statement announcing the conference .
" It is , rather , intended to be a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up , to pursue the guilty as long as necessary and , if need be , to the ends of the Earth . "
" The ends of the earth , in this case , may be Crawford , Texas , where President Bush is likely to be found after his term is up at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
The Wild West locale could be the perfect place for such a trial , given the punishment Velvel proposes for anyone who is convicted .
" We must insist on appropriate punishments , " Velvel said , " including , if guilt is found , the hangings visited upon top German and Japanese war criminals in the 1940s . "
Sending administration officials to the gallows , he added , " would be a powerful lesson to future American leaders . "
Such a process as proposed above will not be an easy one to sell .
Can anything be done to hold Bush and his coconspirators accountable ?
I believe the answer is found in a new book titled , The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder , by Vincent Bugliosi .
For those unfamiliar with that name , Bugliosi successfully prosecuted Charles Manson for the Tate / LaBianca murders ; his bio is here .
This man is no light weight in legal circles .
And while I believe he 's a Democrat and unnecessarily devotes time at the end of the book to vent in a partisan fashion , Bugliosi presents his case as a skilled prosecutor and goes after both parties for their failure to stop the madness of the infantile and quite mad , George W. Bush .
Bugliosi also whacks the corporate media for their role in never putting forth the hard questions and selling these grotesque wars .
He has nothing good to say about the American people either when talking about the massive failures of Bush and his ' war on terrorism , ' page 173 : " But the majority of Americans , while most of this was happening , did not [ question ] .
Why not ?
In large part it 's because most people love to rest their minds , being much more fond of talking than thinking ... "

The inside front and back covers of this book is a mosaic of soldiers from all 50 states killed in Iraq .
The inside flap succinctly and accurately tells the reader what this book does : " ... Bugliosi presents a tight , meticulously researched legal case that puts George .
W. Bush on trial in an American court room for the murder of nearly 4,000 American soliders fighting the war in Iraq .
Bugliosi sets forth the legal architecture and incontrovertible evidence that President Bush took this nation to war in Iraq under false pretenses -- a war that has not only caused the deaths of American soldiers , but also over 100,000 innocent Iraqi men , women and children .... "
I read this book in a few days because it was so compelling , I could n't put it down .
Not only does Bugliosi present an air tight case against Bush , there can be no question that Dick Cheney and Condelezza Rice should also be tried as coconspirators .
There is nothing in this book about September 11 , 2001 other than mention of the 9/11 Omission Commission .
It focuses squarely on Bush and his lies , backed up by Cheney and Rice .
This is the right way to approach this legal issue .
Bush cannot be indicted and prosecuted until the day after he leaves office .
Can Bush be indicted and in what jurisdiction ?
Bugliosi explains this in detail on page 308 : " .. any state attorney general in the fifty states could bring a murder charge against Bush for any soldiers in that state who lost their lives fighting Bush 's war .
" Bush could be expected to make one more legal challenge to the jurisdiction of any state court to prosecute him for murder , including citing the language of Article III , §2 , cl. 3 of the U. S. Constitution ( and 18 U.S.C. § 3238 ) ... "
He goes on to explain how Bush 's conspiracy to commit murder is proper in the jurisdiction he lays out in this book using U.S. Supreme Court cases .
For those who want to blow this off as the work of a ' Bush hater ' and other popular propaganda , you are in denial about the intentions of Bush and his coconspirators .
These are evil people who must be held accountable .
Patrick Henry 's ' Give me liberty ' speech was magnificent in so many ways .
He and others were willing to put it all on the line for this country .
For our country .
For honor , integrity and birthing a nation of free individuals who were willing to fight to give all of us freedom - not to fight wars based on lies .
Bush and his coconspirators must be indicted and prosecuted .
For those who died on September 11 , 2001 .
For our soldiers who have died for their lies .
For their families who will grieve every day until they take their last breath .
We the people are bleeding for those families .
We do care .
We are not unpatriotic , but we will not condone what Bush and his coconspirators have done to this nation .
Bush and his coconspirators must be indicted and prosecuted .
For the hopes of dreams of our young people , gone and blowing into the dust bin of a distorted history .
For the children of our soldiers who will never know their mom or dad past the last time they saw them as they were being shipped to hell to fight an unnecessary war .
America 's plate is heaped with corruption and danger .
But , we must not , we cannot ignore the crimes of Bush , Cheney and Rice , because it 's the easiest path or because " they 're out of office now . "
No .
This must be pursued as a screaming warning to future presidents that they cannot and will not be allowed to destroy this country by sending our soldiers into useless wars based on lies , causing so much grief and agony .
Vincent Bugliosi has given the American people and the legal system the blueprint for prosecution .
The question remains is there one single Attorney General in the 50 states of the Union who has the guts and courage to take on a criminal like George W. Bush ?
You wo n't read about this in any mainstream newspaper , which is why we need real newspapers .
The push to replace our controlled media is now underway , but in the meantime , it is up to you and me to get this information out to America and demand the Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder as well as his coconspirators , Dick Cheney and Condelezza Rice .

The conflict between Georgia and Russia over the disputed region of South Ossetia may have huge consequences for NASA ’s ability to send astronauts to the International Space Station in the future .
The US has criticised the Russian military action , prompting concerns for the future NASA use of the Russian Soyuz space vehicle .
This comes at a particularly critical time , as concerns were already high due to the Shuttle decommissioning in 2010 .
The US is only allowed to use Soyuz up until 2011 as that is when the exemption from the Iran Non-Proliferation
Act runs out .
If US - Russian relations turn even more sour , an extension to the exemption may not be allowed , freezing the US out of any involvement with routine manned access into space .
US Senator Bill Nelson ( Democrat ) , an outspoken critic of the government ’s funding of the US space program , has brought these concerns to light blaming the Bush administration for an over reliance on Russia for future space access …
The Iran Non-Proliferation
Act of 2000 was signed by US Congress as a means to encourage Russian involvement in the nuclear ambitions of Iran to cease .
The Act restricts US funding to Russia by limiting all purchasing of technology and services relating to the Space Station .
A waiver was granted to NASA so the US could make use of the Russian Soyuz space vehicle , and it was hoped that the waiver would be renewed in 2011 so the US could still have manned access to space during the “ 5 - year gap ” between Shuttle decommissioning and Constellation completion .
However , the lawmakers in Congress will be very reluctant to renew the waiver if relations between the US and Russia degrade , throwing NASA into a very difficult situation once the Shuttle is mothballed .
This concern has been amplified since the military action in the disputed region of South Ossetia in Georgia , a US ally .
Regardless of whether the waiver gets renewed , Senator Nelson is deeply suspicious of Russia ’s intentions when NASA will need to take Soyuz flights after 2010 .
Deteriorating US - Russia politics may result in “ Russia denying us rides or charging exorbitant amounts for them , ” he said on Tuesday .
In response to the problem with the renewing of the Act waiver in light of the recent Georgia violence , he stated :
“ It was a tough sell before [ to Congress ] , but it was doable simply because we did n’t have a choice .
We do n’t want to deny ourselves access to the space station , the very place we have built and paid .
It ’s going to be a tougher sell now unless there are critical developments during the next 48 to 72 hours . ”
– US Sen .
Bill Nelson
So have there been any critical developments in Georgia ?
Today , US Defence Chief Robert Gates warned that relations between the US and Russia will be damaged “ for years ” if Russia does not step down from aggressive operations in the region .
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov responded by saying the rebelling Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions will never integrate back under Georgian rule .
He also stated that the military has started to hand back the Georgian town of Gori , although a military presence will remain .
So no , although the brunt of the military action by Russia appears to have calmed , there will still be huge pressure on the region and innocent civilians will be caught in the middle for some time to come .
As if to make matters worse the US and Poland have just signed a defence deal , hosting part of the US missile shield to protect against rogue states launching missiles into Europe and the US .
Russia has outright rejected the US proposal , saying that a US controlled system near its border will destabilize the military balance in the region .
Today ’s signing will only contribute to the tension between the two nations .
For further details on the US - Poland missile plans , see Poland “ agrees ” to host controversial US missile defence system .
Nelson strongly believes the Iran Non-Proliferation
Act waiver is “ dead on arrival .
Nobody thinks itâ€™s going to happen , and the reality is there is no back - up plan for the space station . ”
Many critics believe the Act will have a self - defeating effect as it will stop NASA from accessing the $ 100 billion ISS investment .
“ There will be consequences not just for Russia but for the U.S. too , ” Nelson added .

I like to spot sentences that have probably never been uttered .
This hobby is like bird watching but without the inconvenience of the outdoors .
The trick is that the unique sentences have to be natural , not just a bunch of random words strung together .
Take for example the following question :
Did you hear about the inflatable Swiss dog turd that attacked an orphanage ?
That sentence qualifies even though I wrote it myself , because the event actually happened .
http://www.cbc.ca/arts/artdesign/story/2008/08/12/poo-sculpture-escape.html?ref=rss
Luckily no orphans were injured in the attack .
And no one is more relieved , so to speak , than the artist who squeezed out that masterpiece .
I mean , if just once in your entire life you create a huge inflatable turd that injures an orphan , it sort of erases anything else you might do .
You ’ll always be that guy .
I wonder how you get rid of a huge inflatable turd when you no longer want it .
Do you take it to the dump just to be ironic ?
Or do you rent it on weekends for kid parties ?
I ’d probably put stucco on it and make it my home .
That way when company came over , and I had n’t bothered to clean up , I would just say , “ I ’m sorry our house looks like crap . ”
Everyone would laugh and laugh , and not even care that the floor is seven layers of toys , clothing , and miscellaneous remote controls .
Anyway , if you accept a dinner invitation inside a giant turd , you probably started out with low expectations .
And what if the inflatable dog turd gets punctured ?
Would the first person to notice exclaim “ Holy crap ! ” ?
And if not , would that person regret the missed opportunity for the rest of his natural life ?
I know I would .
I have trouble releasing that sort of thing .
For me , it would be like training all my life for the Olympics and forgetting to set my alarm on the day of my event .
It would haunt me .

< revealing the multicolored Assyrian plastering photo : by courtesy of the Ziyaret Tepe Archaeological Project None
< discovery of a rare treasure trove of more than 20 bronze vessels under the paving stones in the cou ... photo : by courtesy of the Ziyaret Tepe Archaeological Project None
Within the scope of an international rescue excavation project , a team of four archaeologists specialized in Middle Eastern affairs headed by Dr. Dirk Wicke ( Institute of Egyptology and Ancient Oriental Studies ) have unearthed parts of a Neo - Assyrian governor 's palace dating back to 900 - 700 B.C. in a two - month excavation program amongst the ruins on Ziyaret Tepe Hill .
The discoveries were extraordinary .
The site in the south - east of Turkey ( Diyarbakir province ) is at risk from the construction of the Ilisu Dam .
For several years now it has been investigated by teams from the universities of Akron ( Ohio ) , Cambridge , Munich and Istanbul in a joint excavation project .
Sponsorship from the research funds of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in 2007 and 2008 gave its archaeologists the opportunity to become involved in this international and multi-disciplinary project .
There are plans to continue the project for another three years .
The Upper Tigris region came under the sway of the Assyrians in the middle of the second millenium B.C.
They established their provincial capital in Tuschan which is identified today as Ziyaret Tepe .
According to historical inscriptions by the Assyrian ruler Assurnasirpal II it is certain that the construction of an administration palace in Tuschan dates back to the year 882 B.C.
The excavation sector of the Mainz team includes the area around the acropolis , which must have been subsumed by the governor 's palace .
Parts of the private residential area and a courtyard have already been uncovered .
The main rooms were well equipped - amongst the findings were colorful wall paintings and a facility for an oven on wheels .
Tiled bathrooms with proper sanitary fittings are proof of the high living standards at the end of the first pre-Christian millenium .
But the most unusual discovery was the excavation of cremation sites within the extensive courtyard area .
Five have been found to date , two of which were undisturbed and contained opulent burial objects .
In the rectangular graves of approximately 1.50 m x 2.00 m in size , for example , a considerable layer of ash and burned bones as well as numerous bronze vessels , sumptuous stone and ivory receptacles , carved ivory inlays , seals , and pearls were found .
These items show the high status the people buried here enjoyed .
They are believed to have been residents of the palace .
These objects are very similar to those found in the Assyrian towns of Assur and Nimrud in modern day Iraq .
In addition to the cremation remains found this year , a rare treasure trove of more than 20 bronze vessels was discovered under the paving stones in the courtyard .
These include a jug , a wine ladle , a sieve , several bowls and cups , mostly made from embossed bronze .
These are now waiting to be restored .
This will reveal their elaborate ornamentation which can already be made out under the corroded layer .
The archaeological research project at Ziyaret Tepe ( Turkey ) undertaken by the Middle East Archaeology Institute of Mainz University , which was set up 10 years ago , adds a new field archaeological portfolio alongside the excavations in Haft Tappeh and Tchogha Zanbil ( Iran ) .
It enables its students to work in the region in which they specialize and makes them part of an international research project .

Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama turned the tables on John McCain ’s call to delay the debate on Friday by saying that people need to hear from their leaders right now , and called for Friday ’s debate to go on as scheduled .
Obama said that this is the time when people need to hear from the candidates the most , “ This is exactly the time the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible with dealing with this mess . ”
Obama believes that the negotiations should not be infused with presidential politics , and that he that he will be in Washington if he can be helpful , “ What I ’ve told the leadership in Congress is that if I can be helpful then I am prepared to be anywhere , anytime .
What I think is important is that we do n’t suddenly infuse Capitol Hill with presidential politics … ”

Obama also took a jab at McCain twice by saying that presidents need to be able to do more than one thing at a time , “ Presidents are going to have to deal with more than one thing at a time .
It ’s not necessary for us to think that we can only do one thing and suspend everything else . ”
This is a stunt by the McCain which is designed to allow McCain to run ads that claim that Obama puts politics over country .
I am a little surprised because I thought that Obama might agree to postpone the debate , but he has decided to play hardball and call McCain ’s bluff .
After hearing Obama ’s side , I do believe that since President Bush has been invisible on this issue , until tonight , somebody has to fill the leadership vacuum .
It seems like the McCain campaign is so afraid to debate the economy that they are willing to take a gamble in order to turn our attention away from the economy and back to the issue of character .
My big question about McCain ’s position is that he is constantly touting how unpopular he is with his fellow Congressional Republicans , but these same Republicans are the people holding up passage of the bill .
If McCain is so unpopular , and such a maverick , how is his presence in Washington going to help pass the bill , it really does make McCain look not like a leader , but someone who is trying to duck the debate .
McCain would have credibility if he had a consistent position on the bailout , or even spoke about the economy .
The reality is that McCain was trying to change the subject , but Obama saw through it and avoided the trap .
The Republicans will sell this as leadership , but McCain is a candidate who is floundering .
He can try to change the subject , but McCain is n’t showing leadership , only political desperation .

Superheroes vs. The Evil Marketing Mastermind
Superheroes were always cool .
Even back in the seventies when Batman was synonymous with " camp " , and comics were " for illiterates " - there was a general feeling that being a superhero was THE job .
( post stamps issued by DC Comics )
Since then , pop culture rules have changed a bit , and now superheroes are again considered " ultra cool " .
New darker Batman speaks like he needs a spoonful of cough mixture , CGI - laden Spidey swings on realistic webbing and the lesser heroes find themselves thrust into the movie spotlight - as Marvel and DC fight to the death at the box office , at the toy store or right here on good ol ’ www .
Sometimes the results are less than impressive .
And this is where we come in .
Here ’s an irreverent look at some of those superheroes of legend .
All of them boast movie credentials and with that comes the inevitable glut of products , art and other web goodies .

1. SUPERMAN
The superhero among all superheroes , Clark Kent ’s alter ego was the noblest , most heroic , most ethical , most boring whitebread ever to hit the newsstands .
The story of the logo :
Superman was the first character of the " superhero genre " to sport an emblem on his chest .
The original costume designs did n’t even use the " S " , but with the evolution of the character came the idea to combine some kind of shield and the first letter of his name into a symbol for Superman .
The original shield was based on the shape of a police officer ’s badge , but as the comic became more successful , artist Joe Shuster changed it to the more recognizable " knight ’s shield " .
The followers of Superman ( these guys who really , really want to fly ) could be a strange bunch :

Ranging from the most well - known green , through every color the DC writers could come up with - and landing on pink with Supergirl # 79 ( the pink kryptonite apparently turns Superman stereotypically gay ) .
2 . When Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster first developed Superman he was a bald , telepathic villain who wanted world domination .
Not unlike Superman ’s arch enemy Lex Luthor in fact .

3. Jimmy Olsen has been turned into the following things during his time as the perpetually young cub reporter / photographer .
A gorilla , a hippie , a Viking , a werewolf and a giant turtle boy .
A giant what ?..

2. BATMAN
The story of the logo :
It ’s a bat , right ?
Well , yes but the original costume was very different .
( image via , read more info there )
Bob Kane , credited as Batman ’s creator , had a very different design when the character was just taking shape .
Bill Finger ( well - known among comic fans , but who has never made it big like Lee , Ditko or Kirby ) saw the sketches and decided to make a few changes .
Batman 's first appearance in " Detective Comics # 27 " May , 1939
Kane recounts that Finger told him to make him more like a bat , give him a cowl instead of a small face mask and make slits for eyes instead of eyeballs , take the red out of the costume ( which looked like a union suit ) , color it dark grey to make it more ominous , remove the wings and replace with a cape and to give him gloves .
From what we know Bob Kane did originally draw the bat logo .
But who really created Batman ?
Hmmm ...
Weirdest Toys :
Batman 's Hamster Cage .
Hamsters would make great side - kicks for Batman , oh yes sir , they would .
Worst Artwork :
... is probably this dancing PINK Batman from a French poster :

Good car , though -
3 little - known Batman facts :
1.It was the Batman movie that introduced the Batcave ; the comic only showed a secret tunnel leading from Wayne Manor to a barn and mentioned " secret underground hangars "
2.Batman ’s secret identity is actually now known by eight people :
The three Robins , Alfred the butler , Superheroes Superman and Azrael , Batgirl and a mute inventor who worked with the Penguin , Harold .
Could n’t he have written it down ?
3. Burt Ward as Robin mentioned a “ Holy _____ ” line 352 times in the TV show ’s 120 episode run .
Holy overkill , Batman !

3. SPIDERMAN
Another hero that ’s guilt - ridden and often helpless .
But we all love Spidey and hate spiders .
Go figure .
The story of the logo :
the missing webbing under Spiderman 's armpits
The logo is clearly a spider but do n’t be fooled by artist Steve Ditko ’s apparent crudely drawn spiders on the costume .
Stan Lee instructed the artist to make sure it looked like a costume that a teenager might design .
This element of the costume ’s charm has now been replaced .
As had the original webbing under Spidey ’s armpits which artists slowly shrunk down and eventually phased out .

3 little - known Spiderman facts :
1 . You all know that Peter Parker ’s parents died leaving him with his aunt May and Uncle Ben .
But what 's not that well known is that they died in a plane crash and were government spies .
So here we go .
Good piece of trivia .
2 . Some realistic Spiderman costumes can be had on eBay for $ 1,025 ( link )
But you can get one ( not realistic ) for only £ 43.99 - just do n't look in the mirror .
3 . The webbing in the Spiderman movies is made of a substance called " uhbljknjlkljniuhnhuijk " - According to Wiki answers .

4. DAREDEVIL
As with a lot of Marvel characters DD oozes the righteous path .
Not only is he a hero , he ’s a lawyer ; and just to add to the totally impossible lifestyle , he ’s blind too .
The story of the logo :
The " D " ( and later the " DD " ) on Daredevil 's costume is fairly obvious design , but it involved fairly large amount of people to get it together :
Stan Lee helped create the character , but stopped at the design of the costume .
Bill Everett was appointed as the designer , but both Don Heck and Steve Ditko worked over Jack Kirby 's layouts - so , according to Mark Evanier , another Marvel stalwart , Kirby did help in some capacity to help draw up the costume .
Who put the D on it ?
We may never know .
As for the weird marketing product , here is a pretty abysmal mask , if you ask me :

Weird Fact About Daredevil :
Here is how the idea for the Daredevil cartoon unfolded :
By day , he pals around with his teenaged niece and his seeing - eye - dog .
But when evil strikes , he becomes Daredevil , his dog becomes Lightning , the Super Dog - and the three of them take to the streets in Daredevil ’s specially - equipped van .
Now , stop and think about this for a minute : who ’s driving the van ?
Is it the blind guy , the underage girl , or the seeing - eye dog ?

5. GREEN LANTERN
Always ridiculed and constantly reinvented by the slightly embarrassed DC Comics Company , Green Lantern has an incredible on - line following ; plus with the movie coming soon , it could be that we are heading for a Green Lantern age .
Do n’t bet anything important on that statement .
The story of the logo :
Martin Nodell , the logo 's creator , states that the name came from watching a subway trainman on the tracks with a changing lantern which was going from green to red .
Green was GO ! and so the simplified green lantern was born .
Weirdest art & toys :
From the coolest robots , to the weirdest " mini- me " - there is no shortage for strange Green Lantern incarnations , and with coming movie tie - in products , we should see a lot more marketing " experiments " :
Weird Green Lantern facts :
1. The Green Lantern 's ring is entirely powered by will power .
Surprisingly for a pun-loving company like DC this is not someone called Will Power .
2. There was a Justice League Of America pilot TV show made in 1997 .
Green Lantern was one of the six heroes , along with The Flash , " Ice " , " Fire " , " Atom " and M * A * S* H veteran David Ogden Stiers as the Martian Manhunter .
This may sound like a dream to you , but the YouTube never lies .
Now , with the power of Photoshop , anyone can look like a superhero :

When guillemot chicks are left unattended they are at risk for brutal attacks by neighboring adults of their own kind .
Adult seabirds in Scotland have launched brutal attacks on chicks from nearby nests , sometimes pecking to death the fledglings or just flinging them from cliff ledges .
The ferocious attacks were documented in a study announced today .
" The attacks were brutal and usually involved more than one adult as chicks fled from the initial attacking neighbor , " said lead researcher Kate Ashbrook of the University of Leeds in England .
The newly discovered bird killings are par for the course in the avian world where birds are known to be pretty wild .
Among Nazca boobies on Galápagos Island , murder is rampant .
On a popular web cam , an eagle chick killed its sibling in 2006 .
Long ago , even humans were hunted by birds .
The cause of the recent peck attacks can be traced to food shortages in the area where the common guillemots live , the study scientists suggest .
Common guillemots ( Uria aalge ) are attentive parents , rearing just one chick during the breeding season .
They spend most of their time at sea except during the breeding season when the adults relocate to rocky coastal cliffs or offshore islands .
On land , the white - bellied birds stand upright like penguins and reach a length of about 16 inches ( 43 centimeters ) .
Since chicks are vulnerable to attacks from predatory gulls , guillemot parents rarely leave their single chick unattended , taking turns heading out to find food .
However , a decline in prey in recent years has forced both parents to search for food at the same time .
Ashbrook and her colleagues focused on a large established colony of guillemots that inhabit the Isle of May in Scotland .
They reported almost half of all chicks were unattended at some point during the day .
When unattended , some of the chicks would wander off .
And the researchers observed hundreds of adult guillemots attacking such birds .
The attacks often involved repeated jabs to the head and body , the researchers noted .
" The chicks are at risk of attack if they leave their parent 's breeding site and wander around the breeding ledges , " Ashbrook told LiveScience .
" Generally if an unattended chick wandered into the vicinity of another breeding adult with a chick then it would be attacked . "
And even though food shortages sparked the attacks , the researchers said the guillemots clearly were not attacking the chicks for food , but rather as acts of aggression to prevent breeding adults with their own chick from mistakenly adopting or feeding an unrelated chick , according to Ashbrook .
" More than two thirds of all documented chick deaths in the sample area were caused by attacks from neighboring parents , " Ashbrook said .
" Yet this particular colony has been monitored for almost thirty years , and in that time chick attacks have been very rare occurrences . "
Research team member Sarah Wanless from the Leeds ' Center for Ecology & Hydrology has been monitoring this colony since 1981 .
" This research highlights how fragile the social fabric of a seabird colony is , " Wanless said .
" Having a stressed , hungry neighbor is n't good news if you 're an unattended guillemot chick . "
The findings , published online today in the journal Biology Letters , indicate that social harmony , as can be the case in such long - established colonies , can break down when conditions get tough .
The study also highlights a parental dilemma in the seabirds when starvation looms :
They must choose between both parents foraging for food and possibly finding enough to feed their family or keeping one parental in the nest even if it means less food for the chick , the researchers say .

The parallels between Bush and Hitler are obvious and impossible to deny despite the whining of the right wing lunatic fringe ( Fox News . )
* Hitler engaged in intimidation and fraud to " win " elections
* Hitler 's office had an " open door " policy for any corporate criminal who was willing to support him financially
* Hitler used fabricated evidence to justify attacking and occupying other countries
* Hitler looted the wealth of other countries , German government resources and German citizens to finance his operations .
* Hitler manufactured terrorist threats and used these threats to rationalize the development of a police state including the loss of fundamental citizen rights and the build of a vast interment camps .
And on and on it goes .
There 's a reason these similarities between Bush and Hitler that go far beyond the predictable patterns of human psychopathology ...
The Bush family had a long and deep involvement with the Nazi movement .
Since then , the Bush family has surrounded itself with allies , advisers and agents who emulate Nazi values .
Former CIA third in command and indicted Cunningham bribery scandal co-conspirator Kyle " Dusty " Foggo is threatening to out agents , secret programs and Bush administration skeletons in an attempt to ward of a possible jail sentence on 30 counts of fraud , conspiracy and money laundering .
Prosecutors say Foggo has threatened " to expose the cover of virtually every CIA employee with whom he interacted and to divulge to the world some of our country 's most sensitive programs - even though this information has absolutely nothing to do with the charges he faces . "
Prosecutors also allege his lawyers are seeking to introduce classified evidence to " portray Foggo as a hero engaged in actions necessary to protect the public from terrorist acts " to gain sympathy from jurors .
Foggo 's efforts to disclose classified information are " a thinly disguised attempt to twist this straightforward case into a referendum on the global war on terror , " wrote prosecutors Valerie Chu , Jason Forge and Phillip L.B. Halpern in a court motion filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria .
The government wants U.S. District Judge James Cacheris to hold a closed hearing on whether the information is admissible at trial and if it is relevant to Foggo 's case .
Desperate much ?
It 's amusing to see the Bush administration panic on this one - especially after all their own thinly disguised attempts to make every issue they could think of a " a referendum on the global war on terror " .
" Dusty " knows where the bodies are buried on everything from Negroponte 's South American death squads to Iraq procurement corruption and if he starts singing who knows where it could end .
But what 's truly revealing is the way Foggo only believes in national security up until the point where its his own neck on the line .
How Republican of him .
My first day taking Ada to school .
I survived 6AM , and Ada was very good at briefing me on what daddies do at school .
She taught me a “ Spanish ” song phonetically , although I think she may , Borges - like , be teaching me her own imaginary language .
I comb her hair a bit too much in the morning , because I do n’t want the other kids to think she ’s an odd kid .
I was an odd kid .
My hair was all over the place ( still is , though less of it ) , and I was always distracted by lucky experiences I ’d struggle to explain .
At eight , I remember getting teased at my village school by classmates and my teacher because I claimed that my dad had a computer in his room .
My teacher pointed out that if that was true , there would n’t be much room for my dad in that room : computers were huge , of course .
When I said that he let me program it , they really started teasing .
Back then , I had these elaborate , vivid and private fantasies of what the future of the world would be like .
When I was 11 , a lot of them were based on this article about the Dynabook , re-published in 1980 :
Imagine having you own self - contained knowledge manipulator in a portable package the size and shape of an ordinary notebook .
Suppose it had enough power to outrace your senses of sight and hearing , enough capacity to store for later retrieval thousands of page - equivalents of reference material , poems , letters , recipes , records , drawings , animations , musical scores , waveforms , dynamic simulations , and anything else you would like to remember and change .
Such flights of imagination are what one would expect to find as the basis for a well - written science fiction novel , or perhaps as the musings of a Creative Conmputerist wishing she could carry the school computer system to the park and use the text - editing facilities to write poetry while sitting under a tree .
It is n’t often that such an idea is the basis for a serious research effort by a major company , in this case the Learning Research Group of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) which recently released its latest report on Personal Dynamic Media — the Dynabook .
I remember every image in this article .
I painstakingly transferred that image of a bear onto graph paper , and tried to recreate a SmallTalk “ dynamic page ” in BBC Basic .
It was so close I could taste it .
Sometimes I got angry that I was just a kid , and everything was taking so damn long to arrive .
I was reminded about all of this , because I was doing research about Google Chrome for the Irish Times column , and daydreaming again while reading Scott McCloud ’s beautiful imagery , and thinking : this is what I thought Dynabook pages would look like , only instead of static comics telling a story so well , they would be alive , and dance and be pull - apartable , like a kit car .
And , of course , the recursive truth here is that this booklet includes a description of the element of the modern Dynabook , the Web on a laptop , that could bring those images of really dynamic media alive : Javascript .
To Alan Kay ( and the hypertext pioneers ) , the design of the modern Web page inside out .
When you ’re writing a page for the Web , as I am now , I ’m building it from stringing text together , just as would write a normal book .
I ’m barely leavening it with any programming functionality at all .
In the Dynabook , the aim was to bring the dynamism of the computer to the masses : tools to be able to create pictures as easily as words , and animation as easily as both : but all of them really just subsets of — not programming , but whatever it is that computers provide us as an opportunity .
“ Interaction ” sucks as a term , but I think we may be stuck with it .
The Dynabook — and Alan Kay ’s dream still remains — an educational project .
What was it trying to teach ?
I think what it was trying to teach was what I was lucky to get at eight because of my dad ’s fictional computer , and which I genuinely believe everyone can , and should have .
Unfortunately , the best term for it has already been debased , and is anyway one of those anachronistic portmanteaus like “ horseless carriage ” ( or Dynabook , for that matter ) .
It ’s computer literacy : but let me tell you what that means to me .
As regular readers will already have noted , by professional standards , I ’m not great shakes as a programmer .
It ’s just something I do because I enjoy it , and it ’s useful in my everyday life .
Yet people regularly marvel that I can do it at all , and wish that they could .
I think they can , but the reason they ca n’t is because they were n’t taught it when they were five , as Ada is being taught reading , and writing , and mathematics , and Spanish .
I think that ’s criminal , in the 21st century .
Watching my child learn reading and writing , it ’s perfectly obvious to me that this is an incredibly hard and unnatural feat , that we ’ve somehow managed to consistently teach to > 99 % of the population of the developed world .
We ’ve managed that because we have had hundreds of years of trial - and - error training on how to do it .
I think that if some of us applied the same dedication to teaching programming , we ’d have the same percentage of coding literacy : a future generation who could wield every part of the computing experience as well as they could a pen .
Most of them might be , by the professional standards of today ’s programmers , barely coders at all : but that ’s like elegant scribes of the past sneering at the slate - scrawling graduates of the first public schools .
( Actually , I do n’t think that would be the case : I think a huge minority of modern coders are people who do n’t really feel any affinity to or ability for the job , but have been obliged to learn it because of extenuating circumstances .
Someone trained from kindergarten would knock their abilities into a cocked hat . )
Reading , writing , ‘ rithmetic , and ‘ raction .
Learning your ABCs , your 123s , and your iterations , abstractions , and recursions .
Alan Kay was – and still is – trying to build that platform , and that educational experience , with the Dynabook .
We ’ve now got the infrastructure in the Web , Javascript , and modern technology .
Like in 1980 , trained by accident to see the obvious , it ’s so close I can taste it .
I do n’t know how we got to Gutenberg to universal literacy , but that ’s the path we need to walk down now .
I want true literacy for my daughter .

@ Toshie : Wow !
It 's impossible to post anything here that makes reference to differences in statistical distributions or populations of people without someone getting upset .
Re 1 :
Evidence a : Cup holders ( often inserted in the US model of a car and absence in non -US models ) .
Evidence b :
The fact that in many countries just drinking from a cup while in control of a vehicle is a ticketable office .
In the US it is not .
Evidence c : Drive - throughs .
Re 2 :
Evidence : Having personally taken a driving test in California and the UK .
The test here in Cali is a joke .
Someone can pass the test without being fit to drive .
Included in this is the fact that there is no freeway driving component to the test .
It 's funny how most people here in the US make frequent collective references to people in other countries and yet are offended when observation of national tendencies on their own soil are made .
How this will be received depends greatly on a few key details which are absent right now .
First off , we 're not sure how much one of these " titles " will cost .
It 's just as likely that they would , individually , be less than the default retail price of $ 50 as it is that they would be full - priced .
Additionally , we do n't know how they will be released , or exactly how each release will be different .
I would think , using basic logic , that the Battle .
Net / multiplayer experiences across all the titles would be just about the same , if not exactly so .
Another mystery has to do with when each will be released .
Will they be released all at once ?
Will they be released in succession or with a few months , or perhaps a year , in between ?
If they are released at different times , will each contain updates and upgrades like Brood War and Frozen Throne did before them ?
Honestly , I 'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing , and I wo n't be sure until most of these questions are answered .
I will say this , though : Paying more is never ideal , and no matter what we 're paying for , it wo n't go past without much complaint .
" In some circumstances it appears possible for the 2.6.27 - rc kernels to corrupt the NVRAM used by some Intel network parts to store data such as MAC addresses .
This is limited to the new e1000e driver , and reports have only appeared from users of " 82566 and 82567 based LAN parts ( ich8 and ich9 ) " ( to quote Intel ) .
The reports seem to be isolated to laptops , but it is not clear if this is because desktop / server parts are not vulnerable , or if use cases simply increase the chances of laptop users being hit .
Once this corruption has occurred , recovery may be possible via a BIOS update , but may well require replacement of the hardware .
Use of Intel 's IABUTIL.EXE is strongly discouraged , as it will worsen the problem to the point where the network part will no longer appear on the PCI bus . "
It appears that a bug in a network driver used in the kernel of the latest alpha release of the popular Ubuntu Linux distro is damaging Intel network controllers , sometimes irreparably .
In bug # 263555 on the bugs.launchpad.net website titled , " [ intrepid ] 2.6.27 e1000e driver places Intel ICH8 and ICH9 gigE chipsets at risk " , it is noted that the NVRAM on Intel 82566 and 82567 based LAN controllers is being corrupted , but the bug seems to have affected only notebook users at this point ... A myriad of users / testers have commented on the bug and there is a patch available for another similar networking bug , that unfortunately is not 100 % effective .
There are also instructions in the comments that explain how to save a copy of the data stored in the NIC 's eeprom , should user 's currently unaffected by the bug want to store a backup in the event the bug pops up at a later point .
A common thread among users is that the distro should be pulled down until the bug is fixed .
Although this is an alpha release and bugs are expected , testing an alpha release should n't result in a damaged hardware .
What say you ?
Over at Oxdown , Ari reports that , despite all the Republican ’s crocodile tears about voting , John McCain ’s so - called Clean Elections committee is stacked with Republicans who have been engaged in voter suppression .
Yeah , the people who tried to prevent voters from voting are now going to make sure people get to vote .
Huh ???
The GOP has a different definition of clean elections than most of us .
For them , it means stealing elections with no fingerprints .
But , this time , they ’re being watched — and busted :
Nearly a quarter of John McCain ’s “ Clean Election and Voter Fraud Committee , ” chaired by Warren Rudman and John Danforth , have been involved in GOP voter suppression efforts and unfounded partisan claims of voter fraud .
Of the 21 members of the committee , five have been engaging in these shady efforts .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dZmDHeEcnA]
It ’s no surprise that Republicans engage in voter fraud .
Watch what happened last week when “ Clean Election and Voter Fraud Committee , ” member Tom Davis tells an audience of reporters at the National Press Club last week that Republicans do n’t suppress votes .
The reaction ?
They laughed !
A lot !
It is laughable .
Voter suppression is a hallmark of GOP election strategy .
Not this time .
The big news out of Sarah Palin ’s interview with Charles Gibson ( who , so far , is easing fears that he’d be about as tough on Palin as on his own granddaughter ) is that Palin seemed unsure of how to answer a question on the “ Bush Doctrine ” because she did n’t know what it was .
It ’s hard to tell , though , whether this will matter to voters — is the average voter familiar with the Bush Doctrine ?
In fact , experts today are debating whether there really is a single , clear - cut Bush Doctrine or whether it ’s been used to mean different things at different times .
Even allowing for some leeway , however , many saw in Palin ’s overall performance proof of a foreign - policy novice quickly forced to cram for her first big test .
• Eve Fairbanks thinks Palin “ looked tightly wound and sounded talking - point - programmed . ”
Though she is surely intelligent , “ she sounded like someone who had simply never had to think about many of the things Gibson asked and had just crammed for a test . ” [ Stump / New Republic ]
• Alessandra Stanley says Palin “ did n’t look rattled or lose her cool … but she skittered through with general answers , sticking to talking points that flowed out quickly and spiritedly , a little too much by rote . ”
She sometimes “ looked like a student trying to bend prepared answers to fit unexpected questions . ” [ NYT ]
• Steve Benen thinks Palin appeared “ unprepared , programmed , and generally unaware of current events . ”
She was “ just wrong ” on the origins of the war between Russia and Georgia , did n’t “ have the foggiest idea what the Bush Doctrine is , ” and “ really did n’t want to answer an important question about U.S. strikes in Pakistan . ” [ Political Animal / Washington Monthly ]
• Howard Wolfson thinks Palin “ did n’t say anything disqualifying , but it is unlikely that anyone watching would have come away sanguine about her ability to step in as President on Day One if necessary . ” [ Hack / New Republic ]
• Joan Walsh , acknowledging the risk of sounding sexist , writes that “ Palin sometimes reminded me of poor Miss South Carolina , ” and John McCain should be ashamed “ to have picked someone as ignorant and unready to be president as Sarah Palin . ” [ Salon ]
• Greg Sargent thinks Palin ’s answer on the Bush Doctrine “ could have a serious impact on the race , unless everyone politely agrees to ignore it . ” [ Election Central / Talking Points Memo ]
• Craig Crawford thinks the Bush Doctrine answer revealed “ surprising unsteadiness on a critical military policy question that should have been a no- brainer for the Iraq War supporter . ”
When she finally answered , her “ rambling sounded like she was afraid that it was a trick question . ” [ CQ Politics ]
• Chuck Todd and friends write that while it “ did n’t seem to be a complete and utter disaster , ” Palin probably “ wo n’t be the campaign ’s go - to person for the Sunday shows just yet . ”
The “ biggest question ” is how Saturday Night Live will “ play it ” — will they “ exaggerate her deer - in - the - headlights response to the ‘ Bush Doctrine ’ question , ” or “ will it portray a mean , unfair , and condescending Charlie Gibson ” ?
[ First Read / MSNBC ]
• Marc Ambinder also calls the “ Bush Doctrine ” question Palin ’s “ deer - in - headlights moment . ” [ Atlantic ]
• Richard Kim believes that “ even if Palin looked like a moose in headlights , even if she eventually confused preventive and preemptive war — it might not matter , ” because she “ ultimately hit the right emotional notes . ” [ Notion / Nation ]
• Michael Crowley suggests we cut Palin some slack on the Bush Doctrine “ in part because I hesitated myself about its precise meaning , and even its ( sensible ) Wikipedia definition suggests it can mean different things . ”
The greater concern “ was her refusal to state explicitly her view on unilateral American attacks against terrorists in the tribal areas of Pakistan . ” [ Stump / New Republic ]
• Richard Starr disputes the idea that Palin ’s Bush Doctrine answer was “ revelatory of inexperience ” since , “ as it happens , the doctrine has no universally acknowledged single meaning .
…
Preemptive war ; American unilateralism ; the overthrow of regimes that harbor and abet terrorists — all of these things and more have been described as the ‘ Bush Doctrine . ’ ” [ Blog / Weekly Standard ]
• Ta-Nehisi Coates claims that “ [ y ] ou simply ca n’t be a credible VP nominee and have no idea what the Bush doctrine is . ”
Admittedly , there are possibly different interpretations of what the Bush Doctrine is , but Palin “ seemed to not even have a handle on any of the various definitions .
It was almost as if she ’d never heard the phrase . ” [ Atlantic ]
• Andy McCarthy also contends that it “ was utterly reasonable for Gov. Palin to press Charlie Gibson on what Gibson meant by the Bush Doctrine .
Everyone does not mean the same thing by the term , there is lots of good faith argument about what it means . ” [ Corner / National Review ]
• Carol Platt Liebau notes that Gibson actually did n’t quote Palin directly in his “ task from God ” question , “ and the omission changes its substance markedly . ”
She suspects this is part of the plan “ to make Sarah Palin sound like some kind of religious wacko . ”
[ Town Hall ]
• Kevin Drum say Palin ’s remark that admitting Georgia into NATO may mean going to war with Russia “ is not a gaffe of any kind .
Nor is it something that Palin blurted out due to inexperience . ”
It is , in fact , the position of both John McCain and Barack Obama .
[ Mother Jones ]
• Matt Yglesias agrees that both parties hold this position .
But it was “ a bit shocking ” that Gibson and Palin could “ offhandedly mention that war with Russia could be an Article V treaty obligation and then skip ahead to the next issue without dwelling at all on the fact that U.S. - Russia war could mean a full scale nuclear exchange and the death of billions of people . ”

At work we upgraded to the shiny - new Django 1.0 , and we had to make a lot of small changes in the process .
Most were what you would expect : adapting to the 1.0 way from the older 0.96 code we had been using .
But some of them were undoing ad - hoc patches to Django that we had accreted over the two years we ’d been banging away at it .
Over the course of a week or so , we ’d found dozens of things broken , pointing to work yet to be done to finish the 1.0 upgrade , just as you ’d expect .
We have a large code base , and many things changed between 0.96 and 1.0 .
Yesterday , I could n’t log in on my dev server .
Everyone else had been working just fine for the last few days , so it seemed mysterious .
I asked our main Django guy Dave for help , and together we logged some session information , saw that there was no session being established at all .
He realized what the problem was .
“ Oh , I changed SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN back to a string , we do n’t use the list any more . ”
Turns out it was one of our ad - hoc Django changes that we threw overboard , and my settings file still had the old setting in it .
This is where the software should have diagnosed itself .
If the settings / main .py file had these two lines added to it :
if isinstance ( SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN , list ) :
raise Exception ( " SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN should be just a string now . " )
Then I would have immediately gotten an exception on my server console ( and browser ) pointing to precisely what the problem was .
I could have fixed it , and been running in two minutes , rather than being frustrated for half and hour , and bother Dave for another ten minutes .
Our development team is small ( five ) , and all sit next to each other most days of the week , so the cost of this sort of out of band communication about changes to infrastructure is small .
Also , I seem to have been the only developer who had a list in their settings file .
So perhaps the cost here was a total of about an hour .
Not so much , but adding those two lines in the first place would have cost about five minutes .
And in addition to the five developers , there are probably five other “ development environments ” floating around for other purposes : intern work , demos , backups , evaluation tarballs sent to other groups , etc , and who knows if those will have the same problem .
And besides the simple time spent , there ’s the loss of focus , the distraction of the other developers , the frustration , and so on .
Developer attention is a very valuable resource .
A speed bump like this in the road is like a CPU cache miss : your pipelines are flushed , and you have to re-focus .
The time taken does n’t tell the whole story .
Yesterday was just one of those days , because later , I was entering a zipcode into my dev machine , and was consistently told that there were no facilities near that zipcode , even though I knew there should be .
Turns out that somehow , my database table of zipcodes was empty .
We still do n’t know how that happened , but it would have been great if the software could have helped diagnose this anomalous condition .
I changed this :
try :
z = ZipCode .
objects .
get ( pk = zipcode )
except ZipCode .
DoesNotExist :
raise KeyError
to this :
try :
z = ZipCode .
objects .
get ( pk = zipcode )
except ZipCode .
DoesNotExist :
if settings .
DEBUG :
# Sometimes the problem is n't one bad zipcode , but that there
# are no zipcodes in the db at all !
if ZipCode . objects . all ( ) . count ( ) == 0 :
print "***
You have no zipcodes ! Run bin/load_zipcodes.py "
raise KeyError
It would have been another half - hour saved .
I do n’t know how the zipcodes were deleted , so it ’s hard to guess how often someone will be in this position again , but I know it is worth it to add these sorts of diagnostics .
I ’ll take a guess that the next time the zipcodes are missing will be five minutes before a critical demo , when everyone is panicky and no one will be able to think through the possible causes clearly .
An unambiguous diagnostic will be very welcome .
Take the time to make your software self - diagnosing .
The more you can automate about the job of writing software , the better your software will be .
UPDATE # 2 : Check out our shots of the new Chevy Volt from the live reveal today in Detroit !
UPDATE : The Chevy Volt 's been revealed — a little bit early — in living color and not just merely in the grainy cellphone camera video we 've got in this post !
Here it is kids : our first look at a 2010 Chevy Volt , complete and in-motion on the set of the still - in - production Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .
We got a glimpse at the upper half of the Chevy Volt earlier this evening , but this is the whole enchilada : tail end , blacked - out roof , front end , and even the final Volt badge on the back .
There happen to be other cars doing their thing , like the Corvette Centennial Design Concept , and of course the Chevy Camaro and Optimus Prime , but who cares ?
We finally get to see the skin of revolutionary car we can't get for at least another year and a half for an indeterminate price !
Yay !
Oh , wait ...

The net loss equaled $ 6.58 per share , reflecting a one - time adjustment related to the Seattle - based thrift 's $ 7.2 billion capital issuance in April .
Excluding that change , Washington Mutual said it lost $ 3.34 per share , compared with a profit of $ 830 million , or 92 cents per share , a year earlier .
Washington Mutual set aside $ 5.91 billion for loan losses , and said net charge - offs totaled $ 2.17 billion .
The thrift also said it expects cumulative residential mortgage loan losses to be " toward the upper end " of the $ 12 billion to $ 19 billion range it had forecast in April .
Some analysts had predicted the losses might end up higher .
" In the face of unprecedented housing and mortgage market conditions , we are continuing to execute on a comprehensive plan designed to ensure that we have strong capital and liquidity , an appropriately - sized expense base and a strong , profitable retail franchise , " Chief Executive Kerry Killinger said in a statement .
Washington Mutual also said that Killinger , Chief Operating Officer Steve Rotella and Chief Financial Officer Tom Casey will not receive annual incentive payments under a company bonus plan , in light of the thrift 's performance this year .
Shares of WaMu fell 21 cents to $ 5.61 in after - hours electronic trading .
They closed regular trading up 34 cents at $ 5.82 on the New York Stock Exchange .
The shares lost 52 percent during the quarter to end the period at $ 4.93 .
The stock is down about 56 percent year to date .
WaMu became one of the first retail banks to seek outside cash in the wake of the credit crisis when it agreed to sell equity securities to an investment fund managed by TPG Capital and to other investors this spring .
During the quarter , WaMu also announced plans to exit the wholesale lending business and close all remaining standalone home loan centers .
WaMu said it will instead focus its mortgage - originating efforts in its retail bank branches and Web site , and by expanding its call center operations .

Google Funds Cooperative US - China Clean Energy Study
October 21st , 2008 by Alex Felsinger
Google has given $ 250,000 to the US National Academies to fund their participation in a joint study with the Chinese Academies of Science and Engineering regarding how the two countries can jointly improve wind , solar , geothermal , and biomass energy generation and storage.[ social_buttons ]
The United States and China are the two largest energy consumers and carbon emitters .
The study will focus on ways that the two countries can both commercialize technologies and make them available to the masses .
The research teams will also assess the resources and capacity for various large - scale forms of alternative energy in each country .
The study is slated to begin on November 12th with a report scheduled to be released 18 months later .
This is only the latest of Google ’s investments into alternative energy , electric vehicles , and other technology advancements to fight climate change .

DIGG THIS
George Bush , with the clock ticking down the last months of his presidency , nearly started yet another war that might have escalated in the manner of World War I : a diplomatic failure backed by arms that resulted in a superpower clash .
It is a wonder that the world has survived his “ war on terror , ” which turned out to be a war on American liberty and anyone in the world who got on his nerves .
His confrontation with Russia in defense of a belligerent little client state of the US could have sealed his fate and ours too .
We need to examine Bush ’s actions and see how the US nearly stumbled into a calamity .
For in the last weeks , we have gained a picture of the future with this continued push for a secure American world empire with its endless webs of payments , relationships , jockeying for power and treasure , and a diplomatic corps honeycombed with belligerents and lobbyists for foreign governments .
The peace , such as it is , can be shattered through small screwups that will end in massive death .
Make no mistake about it : the flare - up was caused entirely by US diplomatic failures .
You would n’t know this , however , if all you did was watch television news .
Fox and CNN have portrayed Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili as a benevolent leader of a “ young democracy ” struggling in the shadow of the mighty bear Russia .
In fact , Saakashvili was elected on a “ National Movement ” ticket with a centralizing , revanchist platform of retaking the autonomous provinces in the Caucasus , and he has ruled this country the size of South Carolina with an iron fist under a state of emergency for years .
He had every intention of ruling these non-Georgian peoples who do not want to be ruled by him , as even the CIA admits .
As for his domestic program , it has consisted mostly of cracking down on tax evasion and beefing up state coffers .
After smashing the province Ajaria in 2004 following his rigged election , and then crushing Kodori Gorge in Abhkazia ( which even has a separate language ) in 2006 , he moved on to South Ossetia ( which also has its own language ) this year , where Ossetians and Russians live and Russian peacekeepers patrol .
A young democracy ?
Ossetians never voted for Saakashvili .
But he insisted on ruling them anyway , moving militarily and bombing the capital in the middle of peace talks on the opening day of the Olympics .
Tin -pot , fascist mini-dictators like this are a dollar a dozen , and such territorial disputes will always be with us .
The critical question is : what gave Saakashvili the confidence that he could pull this off ?
He believed that the United States would back him as a quid pro quo for his having sent troops to Iraq .
The US responded to his cooperation in Iraq — sending Georgian citizens to kill and be killed — by sending him military training support and guns and bombs , and wining and dining him in Washington .
In all the confusion of the last days , there is no question , then , that Georgia was the aggressor in South Ossetia .
Russia responded within its sphere of influence both against Georgia but mostly against an incredible show of arrogance by the Bush administration .
According to the New York Times , which interviewed many officials who refused to be named , the Bush administration began backpedalling very quickly , claiming that they never gave permission to Georgia to crush any separatist movement .
But by that time , the politics began .
In a very scary editorial and series of speeches , John McCain all but threatened nuclear war against Russia , failing to mention that his own foreign policy adviser was a paid lobbyist for Georgia .
Had McCain had his way , the US very well might have a hot war going on right now on the Russian border , fighting for the privilege of a dictator to crush the rights of South Ossetians to their own self - determination .
No doubt that had the conflict continued — and it still might — we would have been told that we were fighting for the rights of the poor Georgian people against Russian imperialism .
The American media , even before looking at the facts , had already decided who wore the halo and who wore the horns in this struggle , giving loving interviews to liars of all stripes , so long as they took the US line .
None of which is to say that Russia wears the halo and Georgia the horns .
In war , blood ends up on the hands of everyone involved , and there is no shortage of evidence to prove the case against any and all governments involved .
What we need to fix on here are the first principles .
It ’s an upside - down world , not all that different from the one that existed at the start of World War One , another conflict which was said to be about fighting against aggression and fighting for democracy and self - determination .
As Francis Neilson said in his 1915 classic How Diplomats Make War : “ No country thinks of putting these principles into practice , but somehow they seem to be worth fighting for . ”
If we are to follow Neilson further , we will see that in his lessons of the start of that war , he takes aim at a central pillar of diplomacy then and now , namely the claim that the proliferation of arms guarantees the peace .
He quotes Richard Cobden : “ the greatest evil connected with these rival armaments is that they destroy the strongest motives for peace . ”
So it has been in these diplomatic games played by our rulers .
They believe they are controlling the world , when suddenly they are controlled by events .
Then they rope the rest of us into it , following the usual plan of war : forcing the rest of us to adopt the government ’s view of who is wearing the halos and horns , regardless of the facts :
During a war it is no easy task to prevent your sympathy clouding your reason .
The whole social system seems to be organized against any individual attempt to concentrate the attention dominantly upon the causes of the war .
Governments , churches , theatres , the press , and local authorities , direct their efforts , in the main , warwards ; the whole thought of society and commerce seems to be occupied with war ; and all desire to question the reasons given by statesmen for participating in the war must be suppressed .
It has been ruled already by certain ‘ leaders of thought ’ that it is unwise , unpatriotic , and un-English , to suspect the motives of Governments , or waver for a moment in swearing wholehearted allegiance to the authorities : you must think only of the war .
If you dare ask for the truth , you are helping the enemy ; if you suggest an early peace , you are hindering the militarists who desire no peace until their enemy is utterly crushed .
Insidious , bewildering , and plausible , are the reasons given by statesmen and journalists for inflicting a humiliating defeat ; without it , they tell us we must not hope for disarmament .
No patriot is supposed to ask if disarmament is at all probable .
No one must ask if a single statesman really believes such a blessing will follow if the enemy be annihilated .
Over just a few short days , we saw this whole process beginning to play itself out , in an ominous sign for the future .
But it is a future that can change .
As Neilson wrote , “ Citizens who desire peace can indulge in no greater folly than that which is summed up in the phrase , ‘ the best way to preserve peace is to prepare for war . ’ …
Governments have made the war ; only the peoples can make an unarmed peace . ”

WASHINGTON – Here , little piggies !
Congressional deal - brookers yesterday slopped a mess of pork into the $ 700 billion financial rescue bill passed by the Senate last night – including a tax break for makers of kids ’ wooden arrows – in a bid to lure reluctant lawmakers into voting for the package
Stuffed into the 451 - page bill are more than $ 1.7 billion worth of targeted tax breaks to be doled out for a sty full of eyebrow - raising purposes over the next decade .
MORE : Di$aster Plan B Wins Senate OK
EDITORIAL : Porking Up The Rescue Bill
“ This is how Washington works , ” said Keith Ashdown of Taxpayers for Common Sense , a Washington research group .
“ A big pot of pork is their recipe for final passage . ”
The special provisions include tax breaks for :
* Manufacturers of kids ’ wooden arrows – $ 6 million .
* Puerto Rican and Virgin Is - lands rum producers – $ 192 million .
* Wool research .
* Auto -racing tracks – $ 128 million .
* Corporations operating in American Samoa – $ 33 million .
* Small - to medium - budget film and television productions – $ 10 million .
Another measure inserted into the bill appears to be a bald - faced bid aimed at winning the support of Rep. Don Young ( R - Alaska ) , who voted against the original version when it went down in flames in the House on Monday .
That provision – a $ 223 million package of tax benefits for fishermen and others whose livelihoods suffered as a result of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill – has been the subject of fervent lobbying by Alaska ’s congressional delegation .
Some of the pork - barrel measures buried in the financial rescue package had been contained in a bill that previously passed the Senate , but died in the House .
The Congressional Budget Office said the package of breaks – including obvious pork and some more defensible tax - relief measures – will add about $ 112 billion to budget deficits over the next five years because the bill does n’t contain enough offsetting revenue hikes to keep the budget balanced .
The legislative lard annoyed Tom Schatz , president of the watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste .
“ There ’s always something that goes on at the end where the last dozen members are trying to get something for themselves or for a special interest rather than what might be good for the country , ” Schatz said .
Some of the other measures added to win approval include a $ 3.8 billion health - care provision that forces insurance companies to provide coverage for mental - health treatment equivalent to the coverage they provide for physical illness .
Other add - ons will increase individual tax credits and help shield more than 20 million Americans from the painful alternative minimum tax , and offer breaks for businesses that invest in alternative fuels .
Also , several federal income - tax breaks due to expire will now be extended through 2009 .

In Tight Race , Obama Pulls Ahead in Virginia Battleground A new poll shows Obama pulling ahead of McCain in conservative strongholds .
Sept. 22 , 2008  -- Virginia , a traditionally conservative state , has become a key battleground , with 13 electoral votes at stake in the election .
A Democrat has not carried the state of Virginia since 1964 , and few have seriously competed in Virginia -- until Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill .
Victoria McCullough , regional field director of the Obama campaign , is part of Obama 's small army that seeks to sway undecided voters in local neighborhoods .
" This is a fantastic crowd for a Sunday afternoon , " McCullough said , impressed at the turnout for the recent event in Williamsburg , Va .
" This looks great . "
Working with Obama 's campaign , Emily Pease is her local neighborhood leader .
Through Obama 's campaign
Web site , she maps out neighbors in her area who are still on the fence .
" I see close friends [ on the map ] , but then I see all these people I do n't know , " Pease said .
" It tells me who our neighbors are . "
Neighbors are the key to the Obama campaign 's strategy in Virginia , what they call their " persuasion army . "
Their plan focuses on personal initiatives in the neighborhood , such as backyard barbeques , that they believe may win more voters than a TV ad .
" They see each other at the grocery store .
They see each other at church , " said Mitch Stewart , Obama 's campaign director in Virginia .
" They know and trust each other . "
Obama 's decision to compete in the state of Virginia is a testament to the changing political tides .
A population boom in the more moderate Washington , D.C. , suburbs has shifted the state demographic .
The state has elected two Democratic governors -- former Gov. Mark Warner and Gov. Tim Kaine , who catapulted into the spotlight as a potential vice presidential running mate for Barack Obama , as well as a Democratic senator , Jim Webb , in the last six years .
A new ABC News poll out on Monday finds that Obama is gaining ground across the state , even in once -Republican strongholds ; Obama holds a narrow three - point lead over Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz .
More than demographic changes , Obama 's lead comes from economic concerns about the economy -- an area that 52 percent of voters defined as their most important issue , and an area where Obama holds an advantage over McCain .
In areas traditionally conservative -- such as eastern Virginia , where President Bush won by 15 points in 2004 -- Obama trails by just five points .
In the western part of the state , dominated by coal production , where Bush won by 24 points , McCain leads only by 18 .
In the Democratic base of hi-tech and hi-salaried northern Virginia , Obama is doing seven points better than John Kerry did in 2004 .
But the southeast of the state , above all , is swing country .
Towns like Norfolk and Virginia Beach both have large military communities and a high concentration of African Americans .
In this highly contested area , Bush won by three points in 2004 ; now , Obama leads by five .
But organization only goes so far in a state that Bush won by nine points in 2004 .
" This helps Obama make up a couple of those points , " said Larry Sabato , professor and director of the University of Virginia 's Center for Politics .
" But he 's going to have to make up the remainder based on issues , trends , 2008 . "
Republicans in Virginia Beach say Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has given a boost to their organization in terms of enthusiasm and support .
" We are getting gobs of people who have never worked on a political campaign before , " said Cindy Rhodes , McCain 's volunteer coordinator in the area .
The McCain camp is also using technology , Internet VoIP phones , to their advantage .
" As our volunteers are making the phone calls , they are entering the respondents ' answers , and that data is uploaded in real time , " Rhodes said .
Over the next few weeks , as both campaigns enter the home stretch , volunteers and staffers will be knocking on thousands of doors every weekend , attempting to score each and every undecided voter .
In the previous article in this series , we covered the basic concept of progressive enhancement ; now , we can begin discussing how to use it .
There are many ways to integrate progressive enhancement into your work using Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) , and this article will cover a few of the biggies and get you thinking about other ways to progressively enhance your sites .
Article Continues Below
Style sheet organization #section2
A lot of web designers and developers do n’t think much about how they incorporate stylesheets into their documents , but there is a real art to it .
With the right methods , you can immediately gain many of the benefits of progressive enhancement .
Use multiple style sheets #section3
There are many benefits to getting a little separation in your styles .
Obviously , stylesheets that are 1500 + lines long are a bit hard to maintain and separating them into multiple stylesheets can improve your workflow ( and your sanity ) .
Another benefit not often considered is that this separation can help you obtain greater consistency of presentation across the media types you are targeting .
Consider taking your main.css file , which contains all of the style rules for your site , and breaking it up into individual stylesheets containing typographic , layout , and color information .
Name the files accordingly : type.css , layout.css , color.css .
How a single stylesheet is divided into multiple , contextual stylesheets .
Once you ’ve done that , you can use a little wizardry to automatically provide a “ low - fi ” experience to older browsers ( such as Internet Explorer 5 / Mac ) and many other browsers lacking solid support for CSS layouts .
How ?
Well , it ’s all in how you link to the files .
Let ’s assume we started with a main.css file included via a link element :
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " main.css " />
First , we ’ll break it into separate calls to our three contextual stylesheets :
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " type.css " /> < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " layout.css " /> < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " color.css " />
In the past , many of us used a media value of “ screen , projection ” to put the kibosh on Netscape 4.x getting the layout styles , but there ’s a better way .
Before we look at that solution though , let ’s think about alternate media types .
Working with alternate media types#section4
Since content delivery is the main focus of progressive enhancement and we want to deliver an “ enhanced ” experience to any device that will support it , we should really begin to think beyond the browser ; most importantly , we should be thinking about print and mobile .
Unfortunately , the mobile market is still fragmented and immature ( do n’t get me started on all the handheld browsers that think they should render styles targeted at the “ screen ” media type ) .
Consequently , a discussion of the ins and outs of handling that medium in a progressively - enhanced way would take several articles , if not a whole book .
But do n’t despair : things are beginning to gel a bit in the mobile world , and some very smart people are starting to put together resources to help you .
But in the interest of time , and our collective sanity , we ’ll focus on print .
Now , normally , we would add print styles with another link element :
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text /css " media= " print " href= " print.css " />
Traditionally , this stylesheet would contain all of our print - related rules , including typographic and color rules .
In the case of typography in particular , the rules in our print stylesheet most likely mirror those in our main stylesheet .
In other words , we have a lot of duplication .
This is where the separation of typographic and color styles from layout styles becomes a great asset : we no longer need those rules in our print stylesheet .
On top of that , we can use another little organizational technique to improve the scalability of our site and hide certain layout styles from problematic browsers .
Let ’s start by revisiting our stylesheets .
Consider the following :
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " type.css " /> < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " layout.css " /> < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " color.css " />
Now , since we do n’t have a media type declared , Netscape 4.x will read any styles in these three files , but we can use its very basic understanding of CSS against it and provide further organization for our style rules by moving all of the styles that layout.css contained into a new stylesheet , appropriately named screen.css .
Finally , we update the contents of layout.css to import screen.css and NS4.x and its ilk wo n’t be any the wiser ( as they do n’t understand the @import directive ) .
@import ' screen.css ';
There ’s still a bit of room for improvement though — we should really declare which media that this stylesheet is for , and we ’ll do that by adding a media type to the @import declaration :
@import ' screen.css ' screen ;
The problem is that IE7 and below wo n’t understand this syntax and will ignore the stylesheet , but if you want to provide these styles to those browsers as well ( which you probably will ) , you can do that quite easily using Conditional Comments , which we ’ll cover below .
Those of you with eagle eyes may also have noticed the use of single quotes ( ’) instead of a double quotes ( ” ) around the stylesheet name .
This is a nifty trick for getting IE5 / Mac to ignore a stylesheet .
And since IE5 / Mac ’s CSS layout is pretty sketchy ( especially when it comes to floats and positioning ) , hiding layout rules is a perfectly acceptable way to treat it .
After all , it will still get the color and typography information , which counts for something .
Using the same technique , we can import our print.css file ( which contains , you guessed it , print - layout–specific rules ) .
@import ' screen.css ' screen ; @import ' print.css ' print ;
Not only do we have nicely organized stylesheets now , we also have an effective means of progressively enhancing the design of our site .

The interrelationship of multiple stylesheets and the method by which they are applied to the document .
Now for the $ 10 M question : how do we deal with IE6 ?#section5
-->
To many folks , Internet Explorer 6 is the new Netscape 4 — everyone just wishes it would go away .
We ’ll skip the litany of problems in IE6 ; its issues are well - documented and , honestly , not all that difficult to work around .
Furthermore , the adoption of IE7 has been especially swift ( particularly in the consumer market ) and IE8 is already in beta , meaning that one day , we may actually be able to bid adieu to the aging 6 .
Whether it was intentional or not , Microsoft delivered a great tool for enabling progressive enhancement when it shipped IE5 : conditional comments .
These ingenious little bits of logic ( which degrade to HTML comments in all other browsers ) allow us not only to direct certain bits of markup at IE , but also to direct them at particular versions of IE .
As web standards - aware developers , we should always start by testing our designs in the most standards - compliant browsers available , and then provide fixes for those browsers that just need a little nudge to get them on the right track .
Everyone ’s workflow is different , but I have found it best to start every project with a standard set of files .
My base set includes the following :
type.css
layout.css
screen.css
print.css
color.css
Then , depending on the requirements of the project , I add browser - specific CSS files that contain the “ nudges . ”
In most current projects those are ie7.css and ie6.css , though if the project calls for supporting an IE version earlier than 6 , I will create a corresponding file for that one as well ( ie5.5.css , etc. ) .
With those files in place , I begin adding my style rules to the applicable stylesheet in my base set .
I start all of my CSS testing in Mozilla Firefox because I write the bulk of my CSS using its Edit CSS sidebar .
As soon as I have wrapped a page design in Firefox , I fire up other browsers to take a peek .
Most perform flawlessly , as they grok web standards .
Then it ’s on to IE7 .
In most cases , I do n’t find many issues , but occasionally there ’s a need to invoke hasLayout or fix another minor layout glitch .
Instead of adding those fixes to my base set of stylesheets , I add them to ie7.css and then link that file in the HEAD of the document , inside a conditional comment :
<!--[ if lte IE 7 ] > < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text /css " href= " ie7.css " /> <![ endif ] -->
That conditional comment directs that particular stylesheet to any version of IE less than or equal to ( lte ) 7 .
So , if someone comes to this page in IE7 , they will get the fixes I have applied within , but if they come in a newer version — which may have fixed those rendering issues as IE8 has done by abolishing hasLayout — the stylesheet will be ignored .
On the flip side , if someone comes to this page with IE6 , they will get the fixes from this stylesheet , which is perfect , as any rendering error present in IE7 is likely to be present in IE6 as well .
One such fix would be to cover for IE ’s inability ( in versions 7 and below ) to understand a media - typed @import ( as mentioned above ) by adding an @import for screen.css to the top of ie7.css without declaring a media type , thereby importing the styles that were missed the first time around .
Once I am done adding the fixes for IE7 , I open IE6 and see if it needs a little hand - holding as well .
If it does , I add another conditional comment to the document , linking out to ie6.css .
<!--[ if lte IE 7 ] > < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text /css " href= " ie7.css " /> < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " ie6.css " /> <![ endif ] -->
Then , I simply add the fixes required for IE6 to that stylesheet and they will be ignored by IE7 , but will still trickle down to IE5.5.5 , etc .
Using conditional comments in this way allows you to easily manage the browsers you need to target for your project and keep your CSS files hack free .
Other considerations #section6
Progressive enhancements in CSS are n’t limited to how we associate our stylesheets with our documents : we can also apply the concept to how we write our CSS .
Consider generated content , for instance .
Not all browsers can handle it yet , but it is a great way to add in additional bits of design or text that are not necessary to the usability of the page , but that provide some visual or other enhancement .
For example , take this simple contact form :
The HTML form used in this example ( code is provided below ) .
When coding this , you may be tempted to put those colons ( :) inside the label element .
Why ?
Do they add anything to the label s?
No .
While they do serve a purpose , to provide additional visual cues to a user , they are superfluous to the label and should be left out ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
< form id =" contact - form " method= " post " > < fieldset > < legend > Contact Us < p > Send us a message .
All fields are required .
</ p> < ol > < li > < label for=" contact - name " > Name </ label > < input type =" text " id=" contact - name " name = " name " /> </li > < li > < label for=" contact - email " > Email </ label > < input type =" text " id=" contact - email " name = " email " /> </li > < li >< label for=" contact - message " >
Message </ label > < textarea id=" contact - message " name = " message " rows = " 4 " » cols= " 30 " ></textarea > </li > </ ol > < button type =" submit " > Send It</ button > </ fieldset > </ form >
Generated content is a perfectly appropriate way to add them back into the document :
label : after { content : " : " ; }
Approaching the form in this way gives us the flexibility to remove those decorations from our entire site by simply editing the CSS , rather than having to touch each and every form ( and yes , I ’ve been there ) .
This technique also degrades nicely because the form is not rendered useless without the colons — a perfect example of progressive enhancement .
You may also find that writing rules with more advanced selectors helps you progressively enhance your site by targeting certain styles to more advanced browsers .
One great example is the attribute selector , which is not understood ( and is , therefore , ignored ) by IE6 and others of its generation and earlier .
Egor Kloos played with this concept beautifully in his submission to the CSS Zen Garden titled “ Gemination . ”
A comparison of Egor Kloos ’ CSS Zen Garden entry ( “ Gemination ” ) as viewed in standards aware browsers and IE6 .
How did he do it ?
Well , the following is a slightly modified sampling from his code :
/* <= IE 6 */ body { margin : 0 ; text - align : center ; background : # 600 none ; }/* IE 7 , Mozilla , Safari , Opera */ body [ id=css -zen - garden ] { margin : 100px 0 0 ; padding : 0 ; text - align : center ; background : transparent url( squidback.gif ) ; }
The differences are striking and illustrate beautifully how progressive enhancement can be implemented in your CSS .
In a similar vein , Andy Clarke had a little fun with IE6 on his site .
By tapping into the filters available in IE and employing some conditional comments , he was able to strip all of the color from his website and provide some alternative imagery for a truly “ low - fi ” experience .
A comparison of Andy Clark ’s website in standards - aware browsers and IE6 .
The image - graying technique is accomplished by adding the following declaration block in a stylesheet directed at IE6 ( and under ) by using conditional comments :
/* =img for Internet Explorer < 6 */ img { filter : gray ; }
Though these two examples may include more tricks than you can get away with in your day - to - day work , they certainly serve as excellent proofs - of - concept for the ways in which you can practice progressive enhancement with CSS .
Putting it all together #section7
As we ’ve discussed , there are numerous ways to begin implementing progressive enhancement on your site using CSS .
The easiest , and perhaps best , way to begin is by organizing your stylesheets and making informed decisions about how those stylesheets will be connected to your document .
Handling the idiosyncrasies of IE is a breeze once you understand the power of conditional comments , and you can accomplish more granular tweaking in the CSS itself if you ’re discerning about the selectors you choose and the situations in which you use them .
Armed with this knowledge , you should be well on your way to becoming a progressive enhancement expert .

Android Community has done it again , this time we bring you an exclusive first time user review of T - Mobile ’s G1 .
Forum member kaziko has given us a sneak peak at T - Mobile ’s first device to run Google ’s Android operating system .
He put together a nice Q&A as well as providing us with a pros and cons list .
The more we hear about the G1 the more anticipation builds , as we all wait for the 22nd to get our hands on this gem .
This device is very similar to the SideKick , Kaziko went on to say “ Its a sidekick on massive steroids …
If it had a box on the left side it would feel exactly like a Sidekick ” .
This is good news for a lot of the current Sidekick users who are looking for a long awaited upgrade to a device that sees very little change .
This device has great call quality and a relatively loud speaker in comparison to other HTC devices .
The G1 comes pre-loaded with a smooth running , easy to use instant messaging client that supports Google Talk , AIM , ICQ and MSN out of the box .
With all phones there is a bit of a downside to them , and in Kaiziko ’s words “ [ the ] phone does not run as smoothly as you would think ” .
Some of the applications “ stutter ” as they start up and from time to time the device must be restarted in order to run smoothly .
Thankfully these drawbacks can ultimately be fixed with firmware and software upgrades .
The battery charger makes the bottom of the device very hot and is in an awkward location for text messaging while it is charging .
PRO’s :
The device is fairly quick to startup compared to other HTC devices .
It is very light considering what ’s inside .
The slide out keyboard works well and does n’t have a flimsy feel to it .
The Android Market works just as well as the iPhone ’s App Store .
There are already a lot of useful apps to download from the Android Market , including a free ringtone maker .
The earpiece is fairly clear when making and receiving calls , you hear absolutely no static .
The speaker is relatively loud compared to other HTC devices .
CON’s :
The G1 has a big memory leak somewhere , and has to be restarted in order to get it running smoothly again .
The battery charger makes the bottom of the phone extremely hot .
No virtual QWERTY keyboard included .
The phone does n’t run as smoothly as you would think , programs sometimes stutter trying to start up .
There is no folder system like that found on other HTC devices : finding your files requires you to search around in one of the various programs associated with the file type you ’re trying to view .
Video playback is very limited .
The G1 would not play .mpg or .wmv files which are pretty much the standard when it comes to videos downloaded off the net .
kaziko answered questions that Android Community forum members have about the G1 :
Q . Any word on saving the apps from the market on the microSD card ?
A . Not even sure where the market apps are stored at this point in time .
Q. Does the G1 have vibrate then ring ?
A . The only option I see is vibrate on / vibrate off .
Q. I have a Sidekick 2008 right now , could I use the same microSD card that is in my Sidekick 08 for the G1 ?
A . Yes you can use your microSD card up to 8 GB without having to reformat .
Q . Is there any word about a third party applications using AIM , ICQ , MSN ?
A . There is a program pre-installed that handles all instant messaging ( Google Talk , AIM , ICQ , MSN ) .
Q. How are IM app buddy lists structured ?
Are all buddies ( GTalk , AIM , Y!M , MSN ) on one list , or are they separate screens ?
And are groups utilized on the buddy lists if you are using them in AIM , etc ?
A . They are not structured like they should be for sure .
Each messaging program has its own group and your personal groups are broken down inside the specific clients .
Q . Do the buttons on the chin light up like the UK version ?
A. I ’m not exactly sure what you mean by the buttons by the chin , but the visible buttons do light up .
Q. Can I use my $ 19.95 unlimited family messaging plan with the $ 25 dollar G1 internet feature ?
A . You can actually just use a $ 19.99 Data plan alongside the $ 19.95 messaging to eliminate wasting the $ 5.00 , T - Mobile just does n’t want people to know they can do this .
Q. How is the responsiveness of the touch screen ?
A. Ever played with an iPhone ?
If so , it ’s rather responsive , anybody who ’s owned an HTC device knows how aggravating the touchscreens can be .
HTC pulled a fast one and really made the TS [ on the G1 ] extremely usable with just the slight “ touch ” of a finger .
Q . If you lock the phone , does sliding [ the screen ] up automatically unlock it ?
A . The only form of lock I ’ve used is pressing the power button to blank the screen and that pretty much locks the device , opening the keyboard does not turn the screen back on .
i will try to pattern lock tonight and get back with a better answer on this .
Q. Is there any kind of headphone adapter in the box ?
A . No , the G1 comes in box with a stereo headset with inline volume control and answer / end / command button , a G1 branded microfiber slipper protective case , travel charger , USB cable and a user manual / getting started guide .
This is what was in my G1 , which is a pre-release model and might be different than the one actually released .
Q . Is the screen made of glass ( like the iPhone ) or plastic ?
A. I ’m not sure 100 % about this but I think it ’s glass , plastic screens do n’t seem to have the sensitivity like glass screens do , and this runs perfectly so I ’m assuming glass but I will get clarification on this matter .
I want to thank Android Community member Kaziko for giving us the first user review of the G1 .
He has really gone out of the way to give us an exclusive inside look at the device .
We would be nothing without our members , support from users like him are what make us what we are .

One Thing I Don't Like About Automatic Properties
I glanced at this newsgroup post in my favorite RSS reader , and for some reason that one sentence prompted my brain to rant a bit on automatic properties .
Basically , automatic properties look like this :
public sealed class Properties { public Guid Id { get ; private set ; } }
What C# does behind the scenes for you is create a private field with a mangled name - it looks like this ( copied straight from Reflector ) :
[ CompilerGenerated ] private Guid < Id>k__Backing
Field ; public Guid Id { [ CompilerGenerated ] get { return this .
<Id>k__Backing Field ; } [ CompilerGenerated ] private set { this .
<Id>k__Backing
Field = value ; } }
Basically , the field name is the name of the property surrounded with brackets and appended with the " k__Backing Field " string .
For simple read / write properties , automatic properties do the job .
But the issue I have is that it 's inconsistent .
Namely , if I need to change how the getter or setter works , I can't use automatic properties anymore ; I have to resort to writing the logic myself :
public sealed class Properties { private Guid settable Id ; public Guid Id { get ; private set ; } public Guid Settable
Id { get { return this .
settable
Id ; } set { if ( value == Guid .
Empty ) { throw new ArgumentException ( " The ID cannot be empty . " , " value " ) ; } this .
settable
Id = value ; } } }
Would n't it be way cool if C# would have a keyword that would represent the backing field ?
Then you could do this :
public sealed class Properties { public Guid Id { get ; private set ; } public Guid Settable
Id { get ; set { if ( value == Guid .
Empty ) { throw new ArgumentException ( " The ID cannot be empty . " , " value " ) ; } this .
autofield = value ; } } }
That feels like the best of both worlds .
You can use the standard get / set implementations , but if you want to customize one or the other ( or both ) , then you 're free to do so .
This pretty much eliminates the need for the developer to explicitly define fields that backs a property .
Maybe " autofield " is n't the best syntax , but you get the point - have a keyword that represents the backing field in a simplistic way .
I kind of like this , but it 's a Friday and I have n't had enough coffee to think this through , so there may be gaping holes in my design .
But I do hope automatic properties are updated in a future version of C# .
Where We Left Off Previously

We laid out many of its pros and cons to help readers decide if the pattern would be useful to them .

The New York Post
July 29 , 2008
A rookie cop – the son of a highly respected New York City detective – has been stripped of his badge and gun after being caught on video viciously attacking a bicyclist who was part of a Times Square demonstration . ‘
The startling YouTube video shows Officer Patrick Pogan , 22 , apparently setting his sights on – and then tackling – a bicyclist as he pedaled along Seventh Avenue as part of last Friday ’s controversial Critical Mass ride .
Christopher Long , 29 , was among a throng of riders as he whizzed toward the corner of West 46th Street at 9:30 p.m. and appeared to try and swerve away from the officer .
But the video shows Pogan pick up his pace as he stares down Long before shoving the cyclist , slamming him to the pavement .
To the dismay of stunned pedestrians , Long , who was not wearing a helmet , hurtles several feet through the air as he flips off the bicycle and lands on the curb .
Pogan and a second officer then lunge toward the prone cyclist as the video fades to black .
The footage , filmed by a tourist and posted anonymously on YouTube , sparked imme diate public outcry and prompted the NYPD to place Pogan on desk duty while the Internal Affairs Bureau investigates .
The NYPD declined to comment further .
What the video does n’t show is Pogan arresting Long for attempted assault in the third degree , resisting arrest and disorderly conduct – charges that kept the Bloomfield , NJ , man behind bars for 26 hours before his release late Saturday .
Adding insult to injury , the criminal complaint drafted by Pogan bears little resemblance to what was witnessed by onlookers and recorded on video .
In court papers , Pogan accused Long of purposely swerving his bicycle to block traffic and then using it as a weapon to run down the officer , knocking him off his feet and causing a " laceration " on his forearm .
" You are pawns in the game .
I ’m going to have your job , " Long told Pogan , as he flailed and kicked his arms and legs , according to the complaint .
Pogan has been on the force for just three weeks since graduating from the Police Academy on July 2 and is assigned to Midtown South .
A third - generation cop , Pogan lives at home with his father – Patrick Pogan Sr. , a highly respected detective and biochemical and mass - destruction expert who is retired from the Joint Terrorism Task Force .
" He ’s my son .
I ’m proud of him .
He ’s third - generation that ’s been serving the city , " said Pogan Sr. , who was at home in Massapequa Park , LI , today and said he had not seen the video .
" These people are taking over the streets and impeding the flow of traffic .
Then you gotta do what you gotta do , " said Pogan , 51 .
Long declined comment through his lawyer .
" If it was n’t caught on video people would not have believed it , " said Christopher Ryan , who rides with Critical Mass and is filming the monthly protests for a documentary .
" The video just shows what the cyclists have been saying all along , that the police are still harassing and intimidating them from doing group rides , " said Ryan .
" An officer assaulted a cyclist for no reason .
It ’s just crazy . "

Despite persistent concern from privacy organisations , leading printer companies are still using secret tracking dots that can identify which laser printer printed a document .
The printer companies say the use of the yellow dots - almost invisible to the eye - on each printed page to identify the printer 's serial number is part of a US Government - sponsored effort to deter counterfeiters , but organisations such as privacy watchdog Electronic Frontier Foundation fear sinister uses of the technology .
The Italian government banned the use of several neonicotinoid pesticides that are blamed for the deaths of millions of honeybees .
The Ministero del Lavoro della Salute e delle Politiche Sociali issued an immediate suspension of the seed treatment products clothianidin , imidacloprid , fipronil and thiamethoxam used in rapeseed oil , sunflowers and sweetcorn .
The Italian government will start a monitoring program to further investigate the reasons of recent bee deaths .
Italy followed Germany and Slovenia which banned sales of clothianidin and imidacloprid in May .
In France imidacloprid has been banned on sunflowers already since 1999 .
In 2003 the substance was also banned as a sweetcorn treatment .
BayerÂ´s application for clothianidin was rejected by French authorities .
The two substances are produced by the German company Bayer CropScience and generated * 800 million in 2007 .
Imidacloprid is BayerÂ´s best - selling pesticide .
In August the German Coalition against Bayer Dangers brought a charge against Werner Wenning , chairman of the Bayer Board of Management , for marketing dangerous pesticides and thereby accepting the mass death of bees all over the world .
The charge was introduced in cooperation with German beekeepers who lost thousands of hives after poisoning by the pesticide clothianidin in May this year .
Harro Schultze , attorney of the Coalition against Bayer Dangers said : " The Public Prosecutor needs to clarify which efforts Bayer undertook to prevent a ban of imidacloprid and clothianidin in Germany after sales of both substances were stopped in France .
WeÂ´re suspecting that Bayer submitted flawed studies to play down the risks of pesticide residues in treated plants " .
Neonicotinoid pesticides are systemic chemicals that work their way through the plant and attack the nervous system of any insect it comes into contact with .
The substances also get into the pollen and the nectar and can damage beneficial insects such as bees .

911 crack fighter pilot Original Source Link : ( May no longer be active )

A member of the inquiry team , a US Air Force officer who flew over 100 sorties during the Vietnam war , told the press conference : " Those birds ( commercial airliners ) either had a crack fighter pilot in the left seat , or they were being manoeuvred by remote control . "

FRONT PAGE STORY - 03/08/2002
September 11 - US
Government accused
A Portugal - based investigative journalist has presented THE NEWS with version of the September 11th attacks that has to date failed to attract the attention of the international press .
The report , compiled by an independent inquiry into the September 11th , World Trade Centre attack , warns the American public that the government�s official version of events does not stand up to scrutiny .
A group of military and civilian US pilots , under the chairmanship of Colonel Donn de Grand , after deliberating non-stop for 72 hours , has concluded that the flight crews of the four passenger airliners , involved in the September 11th tragedy , had no control over their aircraft .
In a detailed press communiqu� the inquiry stated : " The so - called terrorist attack was in fact a superbly executed military operation carried out against the USA , requiring the utmost professional military skill in command , communications and control .
It was flawless in timing , in the choice of selected aircraft to be used as guided missiles and in the coordinated delivery of those missiles to their pre-selected targets . "
The report seriously questions whether or not the suspect hijackers , supposedly trained on Cessna light aircraft , could have located a target dead - on 200 miles from take off point .
It further throws into doubt their ability to master the intricacies of the instrument flight rules ( IFR ) in the 45 minutes from take off to the point of impact .
Colonel de Grand said that it would be impossible for novices to have taken control of the four aircraft and orchestrated such a terrible act requiring military precision of the highest order .
A member of the inquiry team , a US Air Force officer who flew over 100 sorties during the Vietnam war , told the press conference : " Those birds ( commercial airliners ) either had a crack fighter pilot in the left seat , or they were being manoeuvred by remote control . "
In evidence given to the enquiry , Captain Kent Hill ( retd. ) of the US Air Force , and friend of Chic Burlingame , the pilot of the plane that crashed into the Pentagon , stated that the US had on several occasions flown an unmanned aircraft , similar in size to a Boeing 737 , across the Pacific from Edwards Air Force base in California to South Australia .
According to Hill it had flown on a pre programmed flight path under the control of a pilot in an outside station .
Hill also quoted Bob Ayling , former British Airways boss , in an interview given to the London Economist on September 20th , 2001 .
Ayling admitted that it was now possible to control an aircraft in flight from either the ground or in the air .
This was confirmed by expert witnesses at the inquiry who testified that airliners could be controlled by electro - magnetic pulse or radio frequency instrumentation from command and control platforms based either in the air or at ground level .
All members of the inquiry team agreed that even if guns were held to their heads none of them would fly a plane into a building .
Their reaction would be to ditch the plane into a river or a field , thereby safeguarding the lives of those on the ground .
A further question raised by the inquiry was why none of the pilots concerned had alerted ground control .
It stated that all pilots are trained to punch a four - digit code into the flight control�s transponder to warn ground control crews of a hijacking - but this did not happen .
During the press conference Captain Hill maintained that the four airliners must have been choreographed by an Airborne Warning and Control System ( AWACS ) .
This system can engage several aircraft simultaneously by knocking out their on - board flight controls .
He said that all the evidence points to the fact that the pilots and their crews had not taken any evasive action to resist the supposed hijackers .
They had not attempted any sudden changes in flight path or nose - dive procedures - which led him to believe that they had no control over their aircraft .
THE NEWS , in an attempt to further substantiate the potential veracity of these findings , spoke to an Algarve - based airline pilot , who has more than 20 years of experience in flying passenger planes , to seek his views .
Captain Colin McHattie , currently flying with Cathay Pacific , agreed with the independent commission�s findings .
However , he explained that while it is possible to fly a plane from the ground , the installation of the necessary equipment is a time - consuming process , and needs extensive planning .
THE NEWS will publish a full interview with Captain McHattie in next week�s edition .
The FBI also came in for criticism for the various pieces of contradictory evidence it has published regarding the suspects .
Questions are now being asked as to how incorrect information was given out regarding the ID cards of the suspects , and the seat numbers they supposedly occupied after boarding the flights .
None of the suspects named by the FBI appeared on any of the official passenger lists .
A further point was how the FBI had managed to retrieve the passport of one of the suspects amid the molten and twisted remains of thousands of tons of steel and rubble brought about by the Twin Towers collapse .
Dr. Paul Roberts , former Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury , and presently Senior Research Fellow at Stamford University , has lent his support to the independent inquiry findings .
He also claims that Osama Bin Laden was not responsible for September 11th .
The doctor has challenged President Bush to make public the so - called " irrefutable evidence " incriminating Bin Laden .
Colonel Donn de Grand said that if President Bush is lying it would not be the first time that the American people had been mislead by its government .
He cited the recently published official government archives describing President Roosevelt�s duplicity in deceiving Americans about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour , which triggered the US entry into WWll .
He also highlighted the role of the country�s government in misleading its citizens in respect of the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba , and the events that brought about the Spanish American war in the late 19th , century .
" Whilst considering who committed this act of war on September 11th , " he said , " albeit Russia , China , an Islamic country or NATO , we must also consider that the enemy may well be within the gates .
" Not for the first time the American public might be being mislead , by those with ulterior motives , into lending its support to a war , this time against Iraq , that has no bearing whatsoever on the interests of the people of the USA . "
So far the mainstream American news media has failed to publish or broadcast any details regarding the independent inquiry .
Similarly , the White House , whilst having received a copy of the report , has remained silent on its findings .

Compared with Mr. Obama , Mr. McCain drew a slightly larger percentage of his big - donor money from the financial industry , about a fifth of his total .
The next biggest amount in large checks for Mr. McCain came from real estate and then donors who identified themselves as retired .
With his emphasis on offshore drilling , Mr. McCain has also enjoyed heavy support from generous benefactors in the oil and gas industry , a group Mr. Obama drew relatively little from .
After the financial arena , Mr. Obama drew the most in checks of $ 25,000 or more from retirees and lawyers 
Mr. McCain collected significantly less in large donations from lawyers  followed by those in real estate .
Mr. Obama also drew a significant amount from big givers in the entertainment industry , who contributed relatively little to Mr. McCain .
In contrast , donations from the private equity and hedge fund industries accounted for a significantly greater amount of the giving from Mr. McCain ’s largest donors , compared with Mr. Obama’s .
Certain companies were especially generous to a particular candidate .
Three top executives of Merrill Lynch , for example , wrote checks of $ 28,500 each to Mr. McCain ; among them was the chief executive , John A . Thain .
A dozen employees at Goldman Sachs wrote checks of $ 25,000 or more to Mr. Obama .
Donations to these joint fund - raising committees have surged this election cycle , taking in nearly $ 300 million this year through September  with Mr. McCain collecting slightly more than Mr. Obama  compared with $ 69 million in 2004 .
Campaign finance watchdogs call it a worrisome trend , saying the heavy emphasis on such arrangements brings candidates one step further into the embrace of major donors .
“ This is subverting the whole notion of candidate contribution limits , ” said Steve Weissman , associate director for policy at the Campaign Finance Institute .
Individuals are normally limited to contributing $ 2,300 to presidential candidates for the primary and another $ 2,300 for the general election .
But the joint fund - raising committees allow donors to enjoy the clout that comes with writing a single large check that can cover the maximum contributions to the candidates , as well as $ 28,500 to the national party .
In Mr. McCain ’s case , that check could also include $ 10,000 apiece for several state parties and $ 2,300 to a legal compliance fund for the general election .
The money directed to the national and state parties can then be used to help the candidates under certain restrictions .

You 're not that attractive .
If I thought you were the type that drank beer , I would say that your beer belly extends over your belt in a pretty gross way .
But since , in my imagination , I picture you as more of a body shot kind of guy , I 'm guessing you have an unhealthy love of pizza and other carbohydrates that will one day lead to severely clogged arteries and possibly an early death .
You are in your late twenties ( I think ) , yet you still have baby fat on your face , and you do n't shave .
You think you are much funnier than you actually are , you use 1337 speak when you lecture , and you have spent multiple semesters in the same classroom without realizing that the same whiteboard markers have been there the whole time and they WILL NEVER work .
Please buy new ones .
Now , I do n't think I 'm the hottest girl to ever walk this earth , but I have my admirers .
I 'm young , I 'm thin , I 've got a nice rack and a cute butt , and I 'd consider myself a solid 7.5 or even an 8 or an 8.5 on a good day .
If you tried to approach me at a bar , my friends would laugh in your face .
If we met anywhere else but in the classroom , I 'd say I 'm out of your league and you should go find some older chubby chick you could eat pizza in front of the television with .
Since we met in class , however , things are different .
See , I have this really twisted tendency to lust after men in positions of authority .
Maybe it 's because I never met my father , or because I like to be dominated in bed , I do n't know .
The point is , Computer Science Professor , that I want you .
Bad .
It 's getting to the point that going to class makes me uncomfortable because I 'm fantasizing about you so much I 'm afraid I 'm making googly eyes at you when you talk .
You know what 's even worse ?
My ex boyfriend is in the class with me .
And I think he knows I want you .
And I do n't think you know that he 's my EX .
But he is .
So , you know , if you ever want to invite me to your office hours , lock the door , clear off your desk , bend me over and fuck me ' til I scream , you 're welcome to , because I 'm unattached .
So , dear computer science professor , if you see this , I just want you to know that I want you in a completely unhealthy way .
I 'm not really the casual sex type ( in fact , I have n't had sex in over a year ) but I think I could waive that rule for you .
It would be pretty cool if we could exchange sex for grades , but that 's up to you .
I 'd settle for the sex .
I do n't do anal , but I give really good head .
If you 're interested , let me know .

Obama : McCain flip - flopped on position he 's held for 26 years David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday September 23 , 2008
Print This Email This
What " drives people crazy " about politics , says Barack Obama , is that people call for things in an election year that they 've opposed their entire career .
Like deregulation .
On ABC's Good Morning America Tuesday , host Matt Lauer declared that he felt Obama was hurting his cause by attacking Sen .
John McCain for opposing a bailout of insurance giant AIG when his own running mate also opposed it .
" It 's the kind of thing that drives people crazy about politics , " Lauer suggested .
" It sounds like you were trying to score some political points against John McCain ... when your own running - mate had used very similar words . "
Lauer pointed out that although Obama has gone after McCain for his initial suggestion that insurer AIG should be allowed to collapse , Obama 's running - mate , Joe Biden , was also saying at the time that the government should not bail out AIG .
" Hold on a second , " Obama replied .
" I think that what drives people crazy about politics is the fact that somebody like John McCain who for 26 years has been an advocate for deregulation ... starts going out there suggesting that somehow he 's a populist who 's been railing against Wall Street . "
Obama told Lauer that his own position on the bailout bill includes " a couple of core principles that I think have to be in place , " because " you have to have some mechanism of oversight .
You can't give one person authority over $ 700 billion without any oversight whatsoever . "
He also emphasized that " it ca n't be simply a bailout for investors , CEOs , shareholders .
They 've got to take a hit for the bad decisions that they made . "
" But how much time do you have to vet this ? "
Lauer asked .
" The talk is this has to get done within the next week or two weeks . "
" This is why we 've got to think about this in two phases , " Obama replied .
" We 've got a short - term crisis that has to be dealt with in a bipartisan fashion , and then we 've got a long - term structural set of problems . "
When asked if the cost of a bailout might force him to scale back his own agenda if he is elected , Obama acknowledged , " Does that mean that I can do everything that I 've called for in this campaign right away ?
Probably not .
We 're going to have to phase it in .
and a lot of it's going to depend on what our tax revenues look like . "
Obama added , " I think what has been clear during this entire past ten days is John McCain has not had clarity and a grasp of the situation . "

Jay Fields responds to on Ola Bini ’s Evil Hook Methods ?
about the common ruby idiom that lets us write :
class Fruit include DataMapper :: Resource property :id , Integer , : serial => true property : name , String property : notes , Text , : lazy => false end
What Ola and Jay do n’t like about that is the way that a single include DataMapper : : Resource actually adds class methods to Fruit because the implementation of DataMapper : : Resource .
included looks like :
module DataMapper :: Resource def included ( module ) module. send :include , InstanceMethods module.send : extend , ClassMethods end end
Which is a perfectly common idiom nowadays , but which breaks include ’s contract in annoying ways .
Jay proposes fixing this by adding a become method to Object which would wrap the include and extend in such away that they ’d be called by the including class .
Huzzah .
And it makes sense … sort of .
But it really does n’t go far enough .
Let ’s take another look at the original code snippet shall we ?
The thing that I notice is the wide scope of that ‘ property ’ method .
It really is n’t needed anywhere except for defining how a Fruit is mapped onto the database .
What happens if we take a leaf out of Perl ’s book :
class Fruit use DataMapper :: Resource { property : id , Integer , : serial => true property : name , String property : notes , Text , : lazy => false } property : foo # => raises an exception end
The block gives our extending module somewhere to play , it can introduce a full on domain specific pidgin for the duration of the block with no fear of polluting the including class with anything but the methods its contracted to provide .
So , how do we implement use .
Something like the following should serve the purpose :
class Module def self.use ( mod , * args , & block ) mod.used_by ( self , * args , & block ) end def self.used_by ( mod , * args , & block ) if instance_behaviours || class_behaviours mod.become( self ) else mod.send ( : include , self ) end end def self.become ( mod ) include mod.instance_behaviours ) if mod.instance_behaviours extend mod.class_behaviours if mod.class_behaviours end def self .
instance_behaviours nil end def self .
class_behaviours nil end end
The key idea here is that , in the default case , use will ignore all its arguments beyond the first and just include that module ( a more robust implementation would probably ensure that an exception was raised if any extra arguments got passed ) .
If the module author had written her module to comply with Jay ’s proposed become , then we simply call become .
The interesting stuff happens when a module wants to do something a little more trick .
So a version of DataMapper might do something like :
class DataMapper :: Resource def self.used_by( mod , &block ) mod.become build_behaviours ( mod , &block ) end end
And build_behaviours would instance_eval the block with an object that would capture the properties and use them to build a set of class and instance methods appropriate to the description .
Another module might simply take a hash to describe how things should be parameterized .
It all depends on the needs of the module being used .
The aim being to avoid polluting the caller ’s namespace any more than necessary .
If I use a DataMapper type package , then all I want to end up with in my client classes are appropriate instance accessor methods , I do n’t need spare class methods like property or storage_names that are only of any use when I ’m describing my class .
I edited one of the code snippets to remove a particularly heinous piece of brace matching .
Thanks to Giles Bowkett for the catch .
Also edited another snippet to make it into real ruby rather than some bastard combination of Ruby and Perl .
Thanks to Yossef for that catch .
Ben Bernanke does n’t really care if you call it a recession or , in his words , “ a very serious slowdown in the economy . ”
Whatever it is , the chairman of the Federal Reserve thinks a new stimulus package is needed to get those terrified Americans dipping into their mattresses and buying things again .
BBC :
“ We are in a very serious slowdown in the economy which has very serious consequences for the public , ” he said .
“ Whether it ’s called a recession or not is of no consequence . ”
[ …]
Any government spending would need to kick in quickly to encourage people and businesses to boost spending and help the economy during the period in which economic activity would be otherwise weak , he said .
The Federal Reserve chairman also said the package should include provisions that would aid the jammed credit markets , which has been a major factor in the economy ’s slowdown .

So you ’ve used the reddit voting system , you got some hits and you love the minimalism of it .
By now you may have even gotten a post on the front page by which point you may have noticed quite a lot of comments , a lot of them inane , while others are long - winded .
Should you care or pay attention if they ’re not commenting on your own blog ?
They ’re talking about your thoughts and opinions are n’t they ?
If you ’re like me , and your main purpose in blogging is to spread your knowledge and replicate your ideas in other minds , comments are your bread and butter .
There ’s nothing else I give more credence to , than receiving comments ( well , receiving trackbacks is also nice ) and apparently the reddit community is more than happy to do just that .
The reason why so many people comment on reddit , instead of your own site is the same reason reddit is attractive in the first place : Ease of Use .
It is much simpler for a logged in redditor to leave a comment on the story link than to leave in the comments of a blog .
This just reinforces my impression that comment usability is important .
Just compare how many comments Vjack ’s latest ( excellent ) post has received , compared to how many are under the reddit story and you will see what I mean .
Another useful feature of reddit is that it makes it easier for people to continue a conversation once someone replies to them .
It is not as good as getting an email as with Intense Debate , but as soon as someone visits reddit , they will be able to see that they have a new message , which is really the direct reply to a previous comment .
This really keeps the conversation flowing , unlike a blog where unless someone subscribes to the comments , they will most likely forget .
If you want people to pay attention to your writing , you have a chance to make them pay attention there 😉
Some may have some reservations about the quality of the comments that one may find in reddit .
I ’m glad to say that from personal experience , the maturity level of the redditors is quite higher than , say , digg .
Not ony do you find great commentary but if you ’re lucky , you can get some instant blogging material as well 😉
As you ’d expect , comments can be voted as well .
This has the effect of making the least liked comments drop to the bottom while having the more insightful ones immediately visible .
Very good for avoiding trolling and finding the interesting stuff to reply to .
“ What about Karma ? ” I hear you ask .
Well , in reddit ’s , it ’s not a case of a silly woo - woo belief in metaphysical retribution but it is a semi-accurate representation of a user ’s activity and success in reddit .
You get rated both on the quality of your comments and your posts .
It ’s not really important but it ’s nice to see increase .
One final thing , relating to the various subreddits .
What I have noticed in the Atheosphere is that generally the same news keep being recycled over and over .
At some point one can always read so much about Crackergate , pedophile priests and whatnot .
Using the various subreddits to subscribe to the things that interest you will not only allow you to increase the various subjects you might write about but it can help you posts your articles in various categories and reach a wider audience .
Sometimes it is worth hearing opinions outside our limited circle of the Godless .

In a standard camera lens , light is focused onto a single point in order to magnify a scene .
In telescopes , on the other hand , lenses work differently , by reflecting light back and forth to achieve greater magnification .
This idea can also be thought of as " folding " light .
Researchers Eric Tremblay and Joseph Ford at the University of California San Diego are currently working on adopting the light - folding concept from telescopes to cell phone cameras and other applications .
The biggest advantage of folding light is that it allows the development of super - thin lenses that provide unprecedented levels of magnification and resolution in small spaces .
Creating these lenses requires modern fabrication techniques where a diamond - tipped lathe is used to cut lenses .
A computer guides the lathe to slice very specific dimensions as determined by a CAD model , so that a light beam traveling through the device reflects across the optical components at the correct angles .
The research is funded by DARPA , with initial military applications in mind , such as tracking and identifying military targets .
For commercial applications , such as cell phone cameras , the technology has already received attention from Samsung and Motorola .
The UCSD researchers hope that in a little more than a year , the lenses will be small enough for a cell phone - about 10 millimeters in diameter .

PERSONAL INJURY SETTLEMENTS AS INCOME  FOR PURPOSES OF CHILD SUPPORT Laura W. Morgan
Family Law Consulting
As a general matter , annuity payments are considered income for purposes of child support .
Thompson v. Merritt , 192 Mich. App. 412 , 481 N.W.2d 735 ( 1991 ) ; Pawlusiak v. Pawlusiak , 264 Neb. 1 , 645 N.W.2d 773 ( 2002 ) ( $ 30,000 annuity payment , received by a father as part of a workers  compensation settlement is income for purposes of the child support guidelines ) .
Cf. Innes v. Innes , 117 N.J. 496 , 569 A.2d 770 ( 1990 ) ( annuity payments purchased with proceeds of equitable distribution award of pension benefits are not income , because they represent a return on capital awarded in the divorce ) .
Thus , the courts have generally held that payments made pursuant to a structured settlement for a personal injury claim , as an annuity , are included in income .

Flickinger , 616 A.2d 315 ( Del. 1992 ) ( periodic payments that resulted from the settlement of a medical malpractice claim were not income for purposes of wage assignment , but may be subject to assignment as other income ) ; Illinois Department of Public
Aid ex rel .

App. 1998 ) ; In re Marriage of Durbin , 251 Mont. 51 , 823 P.2d 243 ( 1991 ) ( structured settlement is income , because it serves in part to replace income lost due to injury ) ; Mehne v.

Super. 312 , 488 A.2d 1141 ( 1985 ) ( fathers tort award , including compensation for pain and suffering , was properly included in determining financial resources available for support of child ) .

In re Feddersen , ___ A.2d ___ , 2003 WL 663076 ( N.H. 2003 ) ( $ 3.4 million tort award to the father was income for 2001 ) .
Some courts have taken the view that a lump - sum personal injury settlement , as opposed to a structured settlement , does not constitute income for purposes of child support because it is an extraordinary , nonrecurring payment .
Brinegar v. Reeves , 289 Ill. App. 3d 405 , 681 N.E.2d 1080 ( 1997 ) ( lump sum payment of personal injury award was not income  because it not a periodic payment and it could not be withheld by Dept of Public Aid to satisfy delinquent child support obligation ) ; Department of Human Services v.

Some other courts , Illinois in particular , have taken the view that only the part of the personal injury settlement that represents lost wages can be considered income for child support .
In re Marriage of Wolfe , 298 Ill .
App. 3d 510 , 699 N.E.2d 190 ( 1998 ) ( personal injury settlement representing pain and suffering , and that portion alloted to wife as her marital property , are not income for child support ) ; Villanueva ( Garcia ) v. OGara , 282 Ill. App. 3d 147 , 668 N.E.2d 589 ( 1996 ) ( recovery in personal injury suit is income only to the extent it compensates for lost wages ; pain and suffering component , however , is not income , as that is a return of capital ) ; Holmes v. McCummings , 21 Fam. L. Rep. ( BNA ) 1506 ( N.Y. Sup. Ct. 8/11/95 ) ; Whitaker v. Colbert , 18 Va. App. 202 , 442 S.E.2d 429 ( 1994 ) ( personal injury settlement could not be considered income because it was not apportioned between income and capital elements ) .
Elements representing pain and suffering must be taken out .

Your roof ( TGW ) - Quiet Revolution , a London based small wind turbine maker , has raised $ 12.5 million in funding for its 6 kilowatt triple helix wind turbine , the ‘ qr5 ’ .
The qr5 uses three S - shaped blades which are designed to work in urban environments where wind speeds are lower and change frequently .
The turbine is just 15 feet high and 9 feet wide .
30 have already been sold and 45 are in the process of being installed .
However , the turbine is n’t cheap at a nice £ 25,000 , plus installation costs of £ 3,000 to £ 6,000 per turbine , turbine controls that cost £ 4,600 , and the cost of the mast , £ 2,950 - £ 5,150
The company is working on a smaller qr2.5 which would be 7.5 feet high and would generate 3000 to 4500 kwh as well as a qr12 would be 36 feet high and would generate 45,000 and 55,000kWh on a decent wind site .
Quiet Revolution is targeting schools and businesses for its products .

International Herald Tribune :
The U.S. Defense Department has extended the combat tour of 2,200 Marines in Afghanistan after insisting for months the unit would come home on time .
The 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit , which is doing combat operations in the volatile southern region , will stay an extra 30 days and come home in early November rather than October , Marine Col .
David Lapan confirmed Thursday .
Military leaders as recently as Wednesday stressed the need for additional troops in Afghanistan .
Adm . Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , has praised the work repeatedly of the 24th MEU in fighting Taliban militants in Helmand Province .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates , however , has said repeatedly he did not intend to extend or replace the U.S. Marines in Afghanistan , calling their deployment there an extraordinary , one - time effort to help tamp down the increasing violence in the south .
Asked about the possibility of an extension in early May , Gates said he would " be loath to do that . "
He added that " no one has suggested even the possibility of extending that rotation . "
Lapan said Thursday that commanders in Afghanistan asked that the Marines stay longer .
Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said the longer tour does not open the door to an extension beyond the 30 days , nor to the possibility of replacing them with other U.S. troops when they come out in November .
" This is a slight addition to this tour and nothing more , " he said .
He added that commanders in Afghanistan " asked for 30 more days to milk the fighting season to the bitter end and cement the gains they have made in the south . "
Sarah Palin is a member of an Assembly of God church .
Guess who just so happened to be a preacher in that denomination ?
Dan Barker , co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation .
Well … before he went public as an atheist .
He sheds some light on the theology of that church :
Pentecostals are “ gifted ” people .
Besides speaking in tongues , they also practice other “ gifts of the spirit ” ( charismata ) described in the New Testament , such as “ interpretation ” of tongues , prophecy , faith healing ( “ The prayer of faith will save the sick , ” James 5:15 ) , miracle working , and discernment of “ evil spirits . ”
I saw some “ casting out of spirits ” ( exorcisms ) in that church .
The Assemblies of God practice a direct worship , often with tears and raised hands , in intimate “ spiritual ” ( emotional ) connection with the creator of the universe .
They are in love with Jesus and think he has a special love for them .
Most pentecostals are fundamentalists , believing that the bible is perfect and true , the only source of truth .
I did not know a single Assembly of God believer who was not a young - earth creationist who believes dinosaurs roamed this planet a few thousand years ago .
They believe in the non-metaphorical existence of demons and Satan ( who , according to the book of Revelation , is a seven - headed dragon ) who are roaming the earth luring vulnerable souls into evil .
They believe in a historical talking snake and donkey , and in the existence of witches , wizards , and evil creatures that can infect not only an unlucky individual but an entire geographical region , which must be purged by prayer . … …
They believe in an approaching Armageddon , a fiery end to the world , which they will escape in the Rapture .
And that is what makes them so dangerous .
They do n’t really care about this world .
They do n’t want peace on earth — they want the violent biblical prophecies to be fulfilled so that they can get to heaven and be rewarded with eternal life .
They want to say , “ We told you so ! ”
One of the pastors at Sarah Palin ’s church announces that “ the storm clouds are gathering . ”
Another of her Assembly of God pastors reports that “ Sarah is a great woman .
A religious woman . ”
When Sarah Palin told her Assembly of God church earlier this year that the war in Iraq is “ a task from God , ” she was not speaking allegorically .
As a pentecostal fundamentalist , she has to believe , as I used to preach , that we are indeed living in the end times .
This is no harmless delusion .
In America there is “ no religious test , ” and anyone can run for high office , as an individual , but that does n’t mean we must not fear religious zealots exercising control .
Although the First Amendment guarantees private citizens the “ freedom of assembly , ” the establishment clause requires that the government should be free from the Assembly of God .
By the way , Dan Barker ’s new book , Godless : How An Evangelical Preacher Became One of America ’s Leading Atheists , is now available !
While we ’re on the subject , I enjoyed this statement about Palin from The Online Gargoyle ‘s Laura Dripps :
… we ’re all supposed to rejoice and support a gun-toting , allegedly corrupt , inexperienced , social conservative , just because she ’s a woman ?!
As a Hillary supporter , I am offended .
As a female , I am embarrassed .
And as a human being , I am disgusted .
Make no mistake about it .
The nomination of Gov. Palin is n’t breaking the glass ceiling ; it ’s just raising it out of our sight .

Introduction
Eyes are the most important features of the human face .
So effective usage of eye movements as a communication technique in user - to - computer interfaces can find place in various application areas .
Eye tracking and the information provided by the eye features have the potential to become an interesting way of communicating with a computer in a human - computer interaction ( HCI ) system .
So with this motivation , designing a real - time eye feature tracking software is the aim of this project .
The purpose of the project is to implement a real - time eye - feature tracker with the following capabilities :
RealTime face tracking with scale and rotation invariance
Tracking the eye areas individually
Tracking eye features
Eye gaze direction finding
Remote controlling using eye movements
Instructions to Run and Rebuild TrackEye
Installation Instructions
Extract TrackEye_Executable.zip file .
Before running TrackEye_636.exe , copy the two files SampleHUE.jpg and SampleEye.jpg to the C:\ folder .
These two files are used for CAMSHIFT and Template - Matching algorithms .
There are no other steps to be followed by the user to run the software .
There are no DLL dependencies as the software was built with the DLLs statically included .

Background
So far there has been a lot of work on eye detection and before the project , the previous methods were carefully studied to determine the implemented method .
We can classify studies related to eye into two main categories as listed below :
Special Equipment Based Approaches
These type of studies use the necessary equipment which will give a signal of some sort which is proportional to the position of the eye in the orbit .
Various methods that are current in use are Electrooculography , Infra-Red Oculography , Scleral search coils .
These methods are completely out of our project .
Image Based Approaches
Image based approaches perform eye detections on the images .
Most of the image based methods try to detect the eyes using the features of the eyes .
Methods used so far are knowledge - based methods , feature - based methods ( color , gradient ) , simple template matching , appearance methods .
Another interesting method is “ Deformable template matching ” which is based on matching a geometrical eye template on an eye image by minimizing the energy of the geometrical model .
Implementation of TrackEye
The implemented project is on three components :
Face detection : Performs scale invariant face detection Eye detection : Both eyes are detected as a result of this step Eye feature extraction : Features of eyes are extracted at the end of this step
Face Detection
Two different methods were implemented in the project .
They are :
Continuously Adaptive Means - Shift Algorithm Haar Face Detection method
Continuously Adaptive Mean- Shift Algorithm
Adaptive Mean
Shift algorithm is used for tracking human faces and is based on robust non-parametric technique for climbing density gradients to find the mode ( peak ) of probability distributions called the mean shift algorithm .
As faces are tracked in video sequences , mean shift algorithm is modified to deal with the problem of dynamically changing color probability distributions .
The block diagram of the algorithm is given below :
Haar - Face Detection Method
The second face detection algorithm is based on a classifier working with Haar - Like features ( namely a cascade of boosted classifiers working with Haar - like features ) .
First of all it is trained with a few hundreds of sample views of a face .
After a classifier is trained , it can be applied to a region of interest in an input image .
The classifier outputs a " 1 " if the region is likely to show face and " 0 " otherwise .
To search for the object in the whole image , one can move the search window across the image and check every location using the classifier .
The classifier is designed so that it can be easily " resized " in order to be able to find the objects of interest at different sizes , which is more efficient than resizing the image itself .
Eye Detection
Two different methods were implemented in the project :
Template - Matching Adaptive EigenEye Method
Template - Matching
Template - Matching is a well - known method for object detection .
In our template matching method , a standard eye pattern is created manually and given an input image , the correlation values with the standard patterns are computed for the eyes .
The existence of an eye is determined based on the correlation values .
This approach has the advantage of being simple to implement .
However , it may sometimes be inadequate for eye detection since it cannot effectively deal with variation in scale , pose and shape .
Adaptive EigenEye Method
Adaptive EigenEye Method is based on the well - known method EigenFaces .
However as the method is used for eye detection we named it as “ Eigen Eye Method ” .
The main idea is to decompose eye images into a small set of characteristics feature images called eigeneyes , which may be thought of as the principal components of the original images .
These eigeneyes function as the orthogonal basis vectors of a subspace called eyespace .
However we know that the eigenface method is not scale invariant .
To provide the scale invariance we can resize the eye - database once with the information gathered by the face detection algorithm ( EyeWidth / FaceWidth ?
0.35 ) , we can provide scale - invariant detection using only one database .
OpenCV Functions for Object Tracking and Detection
OpenCV Library offers a lot of image processing and object tracking & detection libraries .
The main function used in these projects and their usage are given below :
Sample Code for Haar - Face Tracking
void CTrackEyeDlg::HaarFaceDetect ( IplImage * img , CvBox2D * faceBox ) { int scale = 2 ; IplImage * temp = cvCreateImage ( cvSize(img -> width/2,img ->height /2 ) , 8 , 3 ) ; CvPoint pt1 , pt2 ; int i ; cvPyrDown ( img , temp , CV_GAUSSIAN_5x5 ) ; # ifdef WIN32 cvFlip ( temp , temp , 0 ) ; #endif cvClearMemStorage ( storage ) ; if ( hid_cascade ) { CvSeq * faces = cvHaarDetectObjects ( temp , hid_cascade , storage , 1 . 2 , 2 , CV_HAAR_DO_CANNY_PRUNING
) ; NumOfHaarFaces = faces -> total ; if ( NumOfHaarFaces > 0 ) { CvRect * r = ( CvRect*) cvGetSeqElem ( faces , 0 , 0 ) ; pt1.x = r->x*scale ; pt2.x = ( r->x+r -> width ) * scale ; #ifdef WIN32 pt1.y = img -> height - r->y* scale ; pt2.y = img -> height - ( r -> y+r -> height ) * scale ; #else pt1.y = r->y* scale ; pt2.y = ( r - > y+r -> height ) * scale ; #endif faceBox -> center.x = ( float ) ( pt1.x+pt2.x ) /2. 0 ; faceBox -> center.y = ( float ) ( pt1.y+pt2.y ) /2 ; faceBox->size.width = ( float ) ( pt2.x - pt1.x ) ; faceBox->size.height = ( float )( pt1.y - pt2.y ) ; } } cvShowImage ( " Tracking " , img ) ; cvReleaseImage ( &temp ) ; }

As if the British economy did n't already have enough problems ... the London Stock Exchange ( LSE ) went kaput today after a computer glitch forced the exchange to suspend trading .
Nearly six hours after the glitch ocurred , trading is still suspended , and traders are enraged that they are missing out on all the Fannie / Freddie action .
The Times :
Shares in London are still frozen nearly six hours after trading was suspended due to a " connectivity issue " , and the LSE admitted that establishing customer connectivity was taking " longer than expected " .
The LSE suspended connection to the exchange before 9 am today after some customers experienced problems .
The operator admitted it was unsure when trading will restart today , while the cause of the problem is not yet known .
One City insider said that traders will lose " millions and millions and millions " of commission on deals , adding that today 's closedown is " very serious and disastrous " .
It is suspected that the problem has something to do with the LSE's " SETS " trading platform , since the Johannesburg Stock Exchange , which uses the same platform , is also shut down .
No word yet on when things will be up and running again .
A word of encouragement to our cousins across the pond : Do n't worry !
You can make your big commissions the next time there 's a huge rally in financials prompted by the unprecedented nationalization of two of the world 's largest mortgage lenders .
Oh ... wait ...
Pakistani troops have fired shots into the air to stop US troops crossing into the South Waziristan region of Pakistan , local officials say .
Reports say nine US helicopters landed on the Afghan side of the border and US troops then tried to cross the border .
South Waziristan is one of the main areas from which Islamist militants launch attacks into Afghanistan .
The incident comes amid growing anger in Pakistan over increasingly aggressive US attacks along the border .
The latest confrontation began at around midnight , local people say .
They say seven US helicopter gunships and two troop - carrying Chinook helicopters landed in the Afghan province of Paktika near the Zohba mountain range .
US troops from the Chinooks then tried to cross the border .
As they did so , Pakistani paramilitary soldiers at a checkpoint opened fire into the air and the US troops decided not to continue forward , local Pakistani officials say .
Reports say the firing lasted for several hours .
Local people evacuated their homes and tribesmen took up defensive positions in the mountains .
The incident happened close to the town of Angoor Adda , some 30 km ( 20 miles ) from Wana , the main town of South Waziristan .
A Pakistani military spokesman in Islamabad confirmed that there was firing but denied that Pakistani troops were involved .
Diplomatic fury
It emerged last week that US President George W Bush has in recent months authorised military raids against militants inside Pakistan without prior approval from Islamabad .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says there is a growing American conviction that Pakistan is either unwilling or unable to eliminate militant sanctuaries in its border area .
There have been a number of missile attacks aimed at militants in Pakistan territory in recent weeks .
Pakistan reacted with diplomatic fury when US helicopters landed troops in South Waziristan on 3 September .
It was the first ground assault by US troops in Pakistan .
Locals in the Musa Nikeh area said American soldiers attacked a target with gunfire and bombs , and said women and children were among some 20 civilians who died in the attack .
In the latest incident , the tribesmen say they grabbed their guns and took up defensive positions after placing their women and children out of harm 's way .
Pakistan 's army has warned that the aggressive US policy will widen the insurgency by uniting the tribesmen with the Taleban .
Last week the army chief declared that Pakistan would defend the country 's territorial integrity at all cost , although the prime minister has since said this would have to be through diplomatic channels rather than military retaliation .

What are these ?
John McCain roared into Washington yesterday and reportedly broke up an agreement on the bailout deal .
In doing so , he went against not only Democrats but the Republican president , the panicked Republican Treasury Secretary and Fed Chairman , and Republican Congressional leaders .
Instead , he sided with a small band of outraged Republicans grousing about violation of free - market principles .
So was this idiotic McCain self - destruction , as most people are suggesting ?
Or was it a brilliant populist move ?
We think the latter .
Americans hate the Hanke - Panke plan , which they accurately view as a bailout of the financial - services companies and executives that helped get us into this mess .
The plan is now a lot better than it was originally - - mainly because the government will now take equity in the banks it saves -- but this message has n't gotten out there yet .
Some Americans are so angry , in fact , that for now they 'd rather see " this sucker go down " -- as Bush put it yesterday , referring to the U.S. economy -- than support a financial - services bailout .
By aligning himself with a small band of Republicans who are refusing to go along with the Hanke - Panke plan , McCain not only appears to be standing up for this outrage but is reinforcing his desired image as a maverick .
Given the ongoing crisis in the credit markets , a bailout plan will likely be struck today or Monday - - whether McCain plays ball or not .
Assuming this happens , McCain will :
Take credit for brokering a compromise ( assuming the final deal is palatable to Americans )
Crow that he was the candidate who tried to stand up against the bailout of Wall Street fat - cats
Note every five minutes in the next six weeks that the enormous sop to Wall Street has n't saved anything ( if the bailout works , it wo n't work until long after the election is over )
Blast President Bush , who everyone hates anyway , thus reinforcing his " change " message
Say he 's the only guy with the balls and experience necessary to deal with this crisis .
And on the off chance that a deal does n't go through in the next couple of days , McCain can just rail about the outrage of the Democrats ' desire to bail out Wall Street at the expense of Main Street and say he 's the only one standing up for the little guy .
In our opinion , this was a brilliant political play ( and we 're voting for Obama ) .
If only it were likely to lead to a better bailout plan .
( What 's a better bailout plan ?
One that injected equity into the banks -- or , better yet , converted debt to equity -- thus penalizing banks for their stupidity , not taxpayers , and actually accomplishing the desired recapitalization .
The agreement on principles the Congress announced yesterday was closer to this , so McCain 's bet is indeed a risky one ) .

Just as the Coen Brothers followed up their critically - adored breakthrough Fargo with the gleeful stoner - noir bowling comedy The Big Lebowski , they ’ve reached deep into their anarchic toolkit for the follow - up to Best Picture winner No Country For Old Men .
Rightfully ignoring the implications and expectations that accompany Academy nods , the Coens have forged right ahead and made Burn After Reading , a technically perfect , dark - hearted farce that includes a handful of pitch - perfect performances and illustrates what a truly iconoclastic American treasure the so - called “ two - headed director ” really is .
The closest Coen analogue for Burn After Reading is in fact The Big Lebowski , and not only because a divorce lawyer in the new movie echoes some of John Goodman ’s immortal lines from the earlier film .
Both movies are loose re-workings of classic genres — Chandler - style noir in Lebowski ’s case , D.C. - set paranoia thrillers here — that have no discernable “ point ” ; they ’re just shaggy dog stories that use familiar genres as a frame in which to display wacky characters and vignettes .
Burn After Reading ’s motley crew is perhaps a little more “ realistic ” than Lebowski ’s Jesus the bowler or the gang of roving nihilists , but they ’re no less cartoony , and the film feels accordingly meaner .
John Malkovich plays Osborne Cox , a disgraced CIA man who has to consistently assert that he does n’t have a drinking problem .
He ’s unhappily married to pediatrician Katie Cox ( Tilda Swinton ) and decides to write a tell - all government memoir after losing his job .
When that unfinished document purportedly falls into the hands of bumbling fitness center employees Linda Litzke and Chad Feldheimer ( Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt ) , a web of self - importance and unnecessary paranoia ensues that — this is a Coen picture , after all — includes plenty of profanity and the occasional grisly death .
Most of the Brothers ’ films have a lone character in over their head at the center of the action ; Burn After Reading has about five .
The fifth is Harry Pfarrer , a semi-retired bodyguard and serial womanizer played by George Clooney .
It ’s a shame that Clooney ’s GQ - ready looks have gotten him pigeonholed as a serious dramatic leading man , because he does infinitely better work in screwball comedies like this and the other Coen films he ’s done , O Brother , Where Art Thou ? and the underrated Intolerable Cruelty .
In his “ serious ” roles , Clooney always feels a little one - note and stiff ; here , even more than in previous Coen collaborations , he ’s positively unhinged .
Saddled with a recurring verbal tic and mild hypochondria , he talks fast and uses the same cheesy lines to every woman he meets ; he handles kitchen knives and handguns with equal disregard for safety ; and he builds a machine in his basement that ’s too hilariously perverted ( and unexpected ) to give away here .
He ’s nearly matched by Malkovich , who gives one of his characteristically over - the - top performances replete with brow massaging , screaming , and a painful over - enunciation of French words .
There are couple moments and characterizations that can’t help seeming overzealous , however , even within Burn After Reading ’s consistently hysterical tone .
Brad
Pitt is n’t a graceful enough comic actor to pull off a walking cliché like Chad , and he is n’t helped by the ham - handed costuming decisions — did the Coens really need to give him a skunk - toned pompadour , iPod headphones , a rearview mirror on his bike helmet , and a constant Jamba Juice smoothie cup ?
Or give him multiple instances in which to dance buffoonishly to bad techno ?
If anything , the Chad character is too recognizable a type ( the immaculately accessorized gym employee nincompoop ) for the film ’s go - for - broke tone .
The other characters , quintessentially Washingtonian as they may be , exist in their individual self - important vacuums within the Coen universe .
That universe is so stuffed with inventive details and characters ( there are great , emotionally succinct supporting performances in Burn After Reading by Richard Jenkins and J.K. Simmons ) that it ’s no wonder even a “ minor ” movie like this one is made ( and the Coens wrote it , too ) with such verve and artfulness .
Burn After Reading has a narrative economy that ’s lamentably foreign in today ’s cinema ; watch the way entire relationships are believably built on scenes , many featuring Clooney , that last mere seconds and include only one word .
Or watch how even the drab federal architecture and interior decorating of gray Washington are made visually compelling — a feast of sharp angles , rich colors , and sleek gym fluorescence — by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki .
Observe how the humor sneaks in on multiple levels , from slapstick violence and sexual embarrassment right on down to the soundtrack ; frequent Coen collaborator Carter Burwell takes the traditional espionage thriller route and scores the film mainly in pounding , relentless drums that occasionally lapse into “ I Want Candy . ”
Burn After Reading is a celebration of all things Coen , and a reminder , as if one was needed , that they are truly , defiantly American artists .
Their slapstick and satire again recall Preston Sturges ( the title of Oh Brother , Where Art Thou ? was a nod to his Sullivan ’s Travels ) ; their obsession with genre and willingness to indulge personal eccentricities recall Robert Altman ; and their tidy visual sense and narrative economy recall Howard Hawks .
I anticipate that Burn After Reading will be misunderstood as overly cynical or , worse still , as pointless ( David Denby has already initiated the charge ) .
Such a judgment would be a disservice to the Coens ’ place in this legacy of American filmmakers , since one could just as easily ( and ignorantly ) saddle the same adjectives on Bringing Up Baby , Monkey Business , The Lady Eve , A Wedding , or The Long Goodbye .
Rather than merely supplying their characters with eccentricities and mocking them for relative unhipness or inability to succeed ( as is the current Little Miss Sunshine / Garden State / Margot at the Wedding vogue ) , the Coens ’ movies are populated with moments of disarming personal realism : Jeff Lebowski taking language from TV news ; Barton Fink or Ulysses McGill or The Hudsucker Proxy ’s Norville Barnes taking refuge in repetitive catch phrases ; their women ’s routinely unfulfilled desires for children or respect , as in Raising Arizona and Miller 's Crossing .
In Burn After Reading , McDormand ’s Linda explores a man ’s wallet after sleeping with him on their first date , and the objects therein — a 7 - 11 gift card , a note from his wife — reveal depths of both their underhanded D.C. social setting and Linda ’s ability to self - delude in her search for intimacy .
Burn After Reading is the equivalent of that shot within the Coen body of work — it ’s not a technical leap forward like Oh Brother or a self - evidently important moral inquiry like Fargo or No Country For Old Men .
Rather , it ’s another eccentric entry in a career filled with them , and a movie that proves the filmmakers ’ commitment to their ongoing , comprehensive personal vision .
It ’s a great film , and thorough .
Burn After Reading .
Directed by Joel Coen .
Rated R , 96 min. , now playing in major cities .
Legendary movie poster artist Drew Struzan announced his retirement earlier this week .
According to a post at The Raider , Struzan made the announcement this way on September 3 :
" Having been working at not working has produced a guy who could never return to illustration again .
It took a lot to attempt the idea of retiring from my 40 years of effort and sacrifice but now that I have , I am delighting in life as never before .
I had forgotten how to rest , to smell the proverbial roses and to see the future as opportunity .
I am grateful and honored to have had the opportunity to do all the work I did .
I am well pleased to have been able to give a gift of beauty and peace through my artwork to so many throughout the world .
Now I have laid down the burden and have peace and happiness as the reward for my day ’s labor . "
Struzan , of course , is best known for his paintings for George Lucas and Steven Spielberg , notably Raiders of the Lost Ark .
His film credits also include E.T. , Back to the Future , Blade Runner , The Goonies , the Muppet movies , Harry Potter , and Hellboy .
He ’s done countless science fiction and adventure book covers including a rare foray into comics for Action Comics # 800 .
His album art has stretched from Black Sabbath to Alice Cooper , Dean Martin to Roy Orbison .
His contributions to the field are much appreciated and his efforts will be missed .

A federal judge in Boston this morning let expire a temporary gag order against three MIT students who were prevented from presenting a talk on security vulnerabilities in the Boston subway 's fare tickets and cards .
U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole , Jr. , vacated the temporary 10 - day restraining order that another judge had instituted more than a week ago against the students and which was scheduled to expire today .
District Judge O'Toole also threw out a request by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ( MBTA ) to obtain a preliminary injunction against the students to expand the restraining order beyond the original 10 days .
" It 's great news for the free speech rights for these students , " said Rebecca Jesche , a spokeswoman for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which represented the students .
" Although it 's extremely unfortunate that the students were not allowed to give their talk at DefCon . "
The students had planned to give their talk last Sunday at the DefCon hacker conference in Las Vegas .
The talk was based on a research project and paper that they had submitted for a class taught by their MIT professor , noted cryptographer Ron Rivest .
The paper had earned them an " A . "
A week before the scheduled DefCon talk , the students had met with the MBTA to discuss the transit authority 's concerns that the students would teach others how to defraud the system .
The students reassured the transit authority that they would withhold key information from their talk and would not be teaching someone how to defraud the system .
They were under the impression after that meeting that the MBTA was fine with their talk .
They were then surprised to learn , two days before their presentation , that the MBTA had filed a suit and a motion for a restraining order .
When a different federal judge , District Judge Douglas Woodlock , granted the restraining order , the decision was criticized as an unconstitutional prior restraint of speech .
In granting the restraining order , District Judge Woodlock had invoked the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , implying that the students ' speech about how the MBTA system was vulnerable to hacking was equivalent to someone actually hacking the MBTA system – or at least aided that illegal hacking activity .
District Judge O'Toole , however , said that the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act does not apply to speech and that the MBTA had failed to supply sufficient proof to merit other claims with regard to the statute , to merit a restraining order or preliminary injunction .
" It was definitely unfair to use that statute to silence the students , " Jesche said .
" We certainly hope the next time that people are allowed to present their important research instead of being silenced by bogus lawsuits . "
Zack Anderson , one of the students sued in the case ( and the second person from the right in the picture above ) , was elated by the judge 's decision today .
" We 're glad the court actually saw things as they should be , " the 21 - year - old told Threat Level .
" We 're glad the court read the law correctly . "
Although the restraining order has gone away , it does n't mean the students are completely in the clear .
Still standing is a lawsuit the MBTA has filed against them , accusing them of hacking its system and causing damages .
Anderson said the students regret that they were n't allowed to give their presentation last Sunday but have no intention of giving the talk anymore .
" All the material we were going to talk about has been made public ... and more , " he said , referring to the fact that their presentation slides as well as a confidential report describing vulnerabilities with the Boston system were posted online after the judge granted the restraining order .
Anderson maintains that the students never planned to present key information that would have allowed someone to defraud the MBTA system and says they still stand by that .
" Despite what 's happened , and the animosity the MBTA has brought toward us , " he said , " we do n't want people to defraud them . "
When asked if he and the other students ever created bogus MBTA cards and used them to get free rides on Boston 's T subway , Anderson declined to respond .
" I can't really comment on the actual means that we used , " he said .
" It 's probably not a good idea to comment on that .
We certainly did not get free fare .
We had to spend several hundred dollars on buying tickets to look at the data structure .
Far more than we ever would have used . "
The MBTA , in a hearing on the case last week , had asked the court to require the students to hand over the class paper they had submitted to their MIT professor , Ron Rivest , about their research of the MBTA transit system .
The students declined to hand over that paper but they did provide the MBTA with a 30 - page sealed report , which Anderson says " went over the entire universe of our knowledge of the system , even more than the class paper has . "
( See a story on the new project that Anderson is working on to harness energy from shock absorbers . )

Naming types in Haskell
Haskell currently allows you to use the same name for a type and a data constructor , thus
data Age = Age Int
In any context , it is clear which is meant , thus
foo :: Age ->
Int --
Type constructor
Age foo ( Age i ) = i -- Data constructor
Age
However , as we extend Haskell 's type system ( or at least GHC's ) , there are occasions in which the distinction is less clear .
This page summarises the issues , and proposes solutions .
NB : the whole page is purely about syntax .
Please comment on glasgow - haskell - users@ … , or by adding notes to this page .
The issues
There are several distinct ways in which the type / value distinction is becoming blurred .
Type operators .
With - XTypeOperators , GHC already allows this
data a :+ : b = Left a | Right b
However , I really want to allow this too :
data a + b = Left a | Right b
That is , allow operators like (+ ) to be type constructors .
You can find discussion of the merits of this proposal here .
At first it seems fairly straightforward ; for example , it is quite clear that in a type signature
f :: ( a + b ) -> a
the (+ ) must be the type constructor not the value - level multiplication .
But there 's a problem with export lists :
module Foo ( foo , (+ ) , bar ) where ..
Is this export list exporting the type (+ ) or the value (+ ) ?
There is a very similar issue with fixity declarations
infix 5 + , :+:
In these two contexts we need to disambiguate whether we mean the type - level or value - level identifier .
This suggestion seems inconsistent with the value level .
Today ( with - XTypeOperators ) one can write " data T ( -= > ) = C ( Int -=> Bool ) " and " - = > " is a type variable , and this is a very useful feature ( just look at Arrow ) .
Being able to use , e.g. , " + " as a type constructor it's no longer possible to tell syntactically what 's a type variable and what 's a type constructor .
One could use what 's in scope to distinguish them , but that 's not how it works on the value level .
-- Lennart
Proper kinding .
At the moment you see a lot of this kind of nonsense :
data Zero data Succ a data List :: * -> * -> * where Cons :: a ->
List n a ->
List ( Succ n ) a ...etc ...
The indexed data type List is only supposed to get Zero or Succ as its first arugments , the stupid type ( List Int Int ) is , alas , well kinded .
Obviously what we want is to give a proper kind to List .
My current proposal is to allow value - level data constructors to be re-used at the type level , thus :
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat data List :: Nat -> * -> * where Cons :: a ->
List n a ->
List ( Succ n ) a
Again , I do n't want to elaborate all the details here , but the point is that a data constructor ( Succ ) is being used in a type .
If there also happened to be a type constructor Succ , it'd be unclear which you meant , and you really might want either .
Type - level lists and tuples .
Folllowing on from the preceding thought , we can presumably re-use tuples at the type level .
So if we write the type ( T ( Int , Bool ) ) do mean that
T :: * -> * , and we are instantiating it with the type ( Int , Bool ) :: * ?
, and we are instantiating it with the type ?
T :: ( * ,*) -> * , and we are instantiating it with the pair types Int ::* and Bool ::* ?
If you write it prefix , thus ( T ( ( , ) Int , Bool ) ) , we can see that this the same as the Succ question above : in this type do we mean to name the type constructor ( , ) or the data constructor ( , ) .
Exactly same questions can be asked about the special purpose list syntax [ a , b , c ] .
When we write ( T [ ] ) do we mean the type constructor [ ] or the data constructor [ ] ?
But there is a bit more here , because [ a , b , c ] is syntactic sugar .
Proposals
I make two proposals :
Disambiguation in export lists and fixity declarations
Disambiguation in types
Proposal 1 : disambiguation in export lists and fixity declarations
Extend export lists and fixity declarations to permit the disambiguating specifier data , type , and class .
, , and .
The specifier is always permitted , but only required if the situation would otherwise be ambiguous .
The specifier must match the corresponding declaration , except that the specifier data matches a newtype declaration too .
( This " except " is arguable .
The idea is that someone looking at the export list does n't need to know whether the type is declared with data or newtype , whereas for type synonyms they do need to know . )
Thus you can say
module Foo( data T( T1,T2 ) , S , class C ) where data T = T1 | T2 data S = S1 | S2 class C a where ...
In this case the data and class specifiers are both optional .
But they are not always optional ( that is the point ) :
module Foo( data ( % % % ) (... ) ) where infix 4 data ( % % % ) --
The type constructor infix 6 ( % % % ) --
The function data a % % % b = a : % % % b a % % % b = a :% % % b
Looking just at the export lists , you can see this proposal as a baby step towards the export list becoming a proper module signature .
As you might imagine , if we 're going to start tinkering with export lists , I 'd like to push as far as possible in the direction of signatures .
To me , this means ( a ) Let 's not try to make signatures stand independently , but let 's do try to change dramatically the format of the export list ; ( b ) the material in the export list should be completely sufficient to know the types , kinds , sorts , classes , instances , and fixities of the things exported ; ( c ) when complete information is available in the export list , it should not be necessary to duplicate the information in the module body .
For example , it should be possible to migrate a type signature from the body to a " new - style " export list .
--- Norman Ramsey *
I would prefer to use the keyword type to indicate a name from the type namespace ( without any indication of whether it was defined by a type , newtype , or data declaration .
This would , then , be consistent with our proposal for exporting associated types .
-- chak
Proposal 2 : disambiguation in types
Value - level data constructors in types may be disambiguated by a shift operator % .
.
This disambiguation is compulsory only if there is a like - named type constructor in scope .
Suppose the following data types are available
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat data Succ = A | B data List :: Nat -> * where ... data T :: [ Nat ] -> * where ...
Now here are the interpretation of various types
List Zero :: * --
Zero means the data constructor -- ( since there is no type constructor Zero ) List ( Succ Zero ) -- Succ means the type constructor -- hence ill - kinded List ( % Succ Zero ) :: * -- %Succ means the data constructor List ( % Succ % Zero ) :: * --
% Zero is also legal to mean the data constr T [ ] -- [ ] means the list type constructor -- hence ill - kinded T %[ ] :: * -- %[ ] means the data constructor [ ]
T [ Zero ] -- [..] means the list type -- hence ill - kinded T %[ Zero ] :: * -- %[..] means list syntax ( Zero : [ ] ) [ ( Int , Bool ) ] :: * --
The ordinary H98 type [ %( Int , Bool ) ] --
Ill kinded % [ %( Int , Bool ) ] :: [ ( * ,* ) ] ( ) :: * --
The ordinary H98 type %( ) :: ()
The principles are
Just as with Haskell 98 , if the lexical binding is unambiguous , there is no need for a disambiguating shift operator ( although one is always permitted )
Just as with Haskell 98 , disambiguation is purely lexical ; it does not take advantage of kind checking .
Whether " % " is the best notation is n't clear to me , but the notation must be reasonably quiet .
If you want a lifting character I suggest " @ " instead of " % " since the former is unused in types .
-- Lennart
Alternatives to proposal 2
One alternative would be simple but brutal : simply have no " % " escape notation .
In the above examples , saying Succ at the the type level would mean the data type Succ , and there would be no way to get to the data constructor .
You lose .
Another alternative would be to allow the type name to disambiguate .
Thus Nat. Succ would name the data construtor .
( Obvious question : the overlap with the module qualifiers . )
Not every data type type can be lifted to the kind level ; for example , existentials and GADTS !
It seems messy to have this done or not done silently ; perhaps there should be some indication in the data type declaration to say " make this available as a kind too " .
Or perhaps the whole idea of automatic lifting is n't worth the candle , and we should should provide explicit datakind .
It ’s become pathological .
John McCain just claimed on TV that Sarah Palin has never requested an earmark for her state — when actually her state gets more earmarks than any other state in the country .
And this year she asked for $ 197 million worth of them herself .
Even the AP could n’t ignore his lying — even though they phrased it in their own anemic way .
“ When pressed about Palin ’s record of requesting and accepting such money for Alaska , McCain ignored the record and said : “ Not as governor she did n’t . ”
For the record Palin requested $ 197 million this year and $ 256 million last year .
Per capita , that ’s $ 288 this year and $ 376 last year .
To give you some perspective , Palin herself requested at least ten times the dollar value of earmarks as most states get total every year .
MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Toxic chemicals from thousands of idols of Hindu gods immersed in rivers and lakes across India are causing pollution which is killing fish and contaminating food crops , experts and environmentalists said on Monday .

Hindus across India celebrate various religious festivals in September and October , paying homage to deities like Lord Ganesha , the remover of obstacles , and Goddess Durga , the destroyer of evil .
Elaborately painted and decorated idols are worshipped before they are taken during mass processions to rivers , lakes and the sea , where they are immersed in accordance with Hindu faith .
Environmentalists say the idols are often made from non-biodegradable materials such as plastic , cement and plaster of Paris and painted with toxic dyes .
After the statues are immersed , the toxins then contaminate food crops when villagers use the polluted water for irrigation , said Shyam Asolekar , science and engineering head at the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai .
“ Even small traces are extremely toxic as they persist in the body for a long time and accumulate in the human tissues , ” said Asolekar , who has closely studied the effects of Hindu customs .
Paints contain metals like mercury , cadmium and lead , which can pass up the food chain from fish to human beings , he said .
Environmentalists said materials like plaster of Paris do not dissolve easily and reduce the oxygen level in the water , resulting in the deaths of fish and other aquatic organisms .
Statue remains from festivities last year still float in rivers and water tanks in Mumbai , where the annual “ Ganesh Chaturthi ” festival culminate in the immersion of some 160,000 statutes -- some up to 25 feet high -- by millions of devotees .
Traditionally , idols were made from mud and clay and vegetable - based dyes were used to paint them .
But commercialization of festivals such as Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja has meant people want bigger and brighter idols and are no longer happy with the eco-friendly statues .
Authorities say they are taking steps to check pollution .
Mumbai has dug 48 ponds this year for the immersion of idols , but environmental groups say not enough is being done .
“ If we do not respect nature then we are not respecting god , ” said Manisha Gutman of environmental group Eco Exist .
About 80 percent of India ’s 1.1 billion population are Hindus .
In recent years , their religious festivals and customs have come under increasing scrutiny as public awareness of environmental issues grows .
The spring festival of Holi involves the throwing of coloured powder but studies have found that the industrial powders used are often toxic and can cause asthma , temporary blindness and even skin cancer .

If you do n’t have a bag clip , you have a few options when it comes to keeping your chips fresh .
The easiest way to do this is to fold the top of the bag over itself multiple times after forcing the excess air out .
If you do this , store your chips with the folds facing down and place a heavy object over the folds to keep the bag sealed .
Another option is to fold the corners towards the middle of the bag before folding a few layers on top of the corners .
Then , stick your thumbs in the corner folds and turn them over the top of the bag to create an airtight seal .
When developing applications in Django , it may be nice to print emails instead of sending them .
If you send them you have to be careful which addresses you use .
Just being on the safe side and always using @example .{com , org , net} is not enough , you have to use an address you can actually retrieve emails for .
And you have to configure your development environment to actually deliver mails .
And then wait for the whole thing in each code - try iteration .
So , basing myself on the testing code , I ’ve added this to settings.py and mails are now printed :
if DEBUG : from utils import BogusSMTPConnection from django.core import mail mail .
SMTPConnection = BogusSMTPConnection
Of course you ’ll also need the BogusSMTPConnection class , I ’ve defined it as following :
from textwrap import wrap class BogusSMTPConnection ( object ) : " " " Instead of sending emails , print them to the console . " " " def __init__( *args , ** kwargs ) : print ( " Initialized bogus SMTP connection " ) def open ( self ) : print ( " Open bogus SMTP connection " ) def close ( self ) : print ( " Close bogus SMTP connection " ) def send_messages ( self , messages ) : print ( " Sending through bogus SMTP connection : " ) for message in messages : print ( " tFrom : %s " % message.from_email ) print ( " tTo : %s " % " , " .join(message.to ) ) print ( " tSubject : %s " % message.subject ) print ( " t %s " % " nt " .join( wrap(message.body ) ) ) print ( messages ) return len( messages )
And that ’s it .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - After years of dodging questions , former “ American Idol ” singer Clay Aiken will acknowledge he is a gay man in an interview with People magazine set to run on its Web site Wednesday , according to media reports .
Celebrity site Perezhilton.com on Tuesday published a photo of the cover of People magazine ’s upcoming issue on which Aiken cradles his new son , Parker Foster Aiken , in his arms .
The caption reads “ Yes , I ’m Gay , ” and underneath is a quote from Aiken on his decision to come out of the closet that says : “ I can not raise a child to lie or to hide things . ”
In August this year , Aiken ’s friend , music producer Jaymes Foster , gave birth to the baby fathered by Aiken .
A spokeswoman for People would neither confirm nor deny that Aiken told the magazine he is gay .
But the magazine issued a statement saying , “ We can confirm that Clay Aiken and his son appear on the next cover of People .
For the complete story , visit people.com at 7 a.m. ( EDT Wednesday ) ( 1100 GMT ) morning . ”
Aiken , 29 , gained fame as a contestant on the No. 1 - rated U.S. TV talent show “ American Idol ” in 2003 .
He was the runner - up that season but went on to build a solid singing career on his own .
He currently appears on Broadway in “ Monty Python ’s SPAMALOT . ”
For years , Aiken has dodged questions about whether he is homosexual despite persistent rumors on the subject .
He has said , generally , that his sexuality was nobody ’s business but his own .
In 2006 , ABC television ’s Diane Sawyer asked Aiken and he shot back that it was a “ really rude ” question .
He also dodged it in a previous interview with People magazine saying that readers “ are going to believe what they want . ”
How jittery are investors about airline stocks these days ?
Just ask United .
An erroneous headline that flashed across trading screens Monday , saying United had filed for a second bankruptcy , sent the airline ’s stock plummeting .
United Airlines shares fell to about $ 3 from more than $ 12 in less than an hour before trading was halted , wiping more than $ 1 billion in value .
Its shares closed at $ 10.92 , down 11.2 percent .
By the end of the day , fingers were pointing in many directions to assign blame .
United blamed an old Chicago Tribune article that , it said , was posted on the Web site of The South Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper .
That article was picked up by a research firm , Income Securities Advisors , which then posted a link to it on a page on Bloomberg News , which sent a news alert based on the old article .
But the newspaper ’s editor and the Tribune Company , which owns The Sun-Sentinel , denied that the paper had run the article on its
Web site , saying it could be found only in its archives .
In a two - part series called “ PS3 Fab - to - lab ” on IBM ’s awesome developerWorks website , [ Lewin ] explains how to use the Cell Broadband Engine in a PS3 to create an audio - bandwidth spectrum analyzer and function generator .
The set up consists of Yellow Dog Linux , an NTSC television , and an external USB sound card to provide the inputs of the spectrum analyzer and the outputs of the function generator .
The sound card driver is written to simply capture or send the info in question ( audio range only ) and the NTSC television as the graphical interface .
This hack involves a lot of coding with hardly any example code provided .

( CNN ) --
In his first press conference in nearly six weeks , Sen .
John McCain urged lawmakers Tuesday to adopt five of his proposed improvements to the government 's proposed financial rescue plan .
Sen. Barack Obama says the bailout plan must protect taxpayers .
President Bush has asked Congress to act quickly on the $ 700 billion bailout he proposed following news of failing financial institutions and frozen credit markets .
McCain , speaking in Freeland , Michigan , said the proposed plan has to allow for greater accountability , including a bipartisan board to " provide oversight to the rescue . "
" That oversight is absolutely essential , " McCain said , also arguing against the unprecedented power granted to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in managing the plan .
He said the plan must also help taxpayers recover the $ 700 billion planned for the bailout .
" That money simply can't go into a black hole of bad debt with no means of recovering the funds . "
The Arizona senator also called for complete transparency in regard to crafting and implementation of any legislation .
" This ca n't be cobbled together behind closed doors .
The American people have the right to know which businesses will be helped , and what selection will be based on , and how much that help will cost , " he said .
McCain also called for a cap on executive pay for companies getting federal help .
Senior leaders of any firm bailed out by the federal government " should not be making more than the highest paid government official , " he said .
Finally , McCain said it would be " unacceptable " for Congress to add earmarks and so - called pork barrel legislation to this plan .
The press conference came hours after Sen. Barack Obama criticized President Bush for showing " stubborn inflexibility " on the plan .
" This is not the time for ' my - way - or - the - highway ' intransigence from anyone involved .
It 's not the time for fear or panic .
It 's the time for resolve , responsibility and reasonableness , " Obama said at a news conference in Clearwater , Florida .
Obama said it is " wholly unreasonable to expect that American taxpayers would or should hand this administration or any administration a $ 700 billion blank check with absolutely no oversight or conditions , when a lack of oversight in Washington and on Wall Street is exactly what got us into this mess . "
Obama said taxpayers should be treated like investors if they are being asked to underwrite the bailout .
" Now that the American people are being called upon to finance this solution , the American people have the right to certain protections and assurances from Washington , " he said .
The Democratic presidential candidate also said he thinks middle class tax cuts are " absolutely necessary " in order to strengthen the economy .
Like McCain , Obama expressed concern that the current proposal puts too much power in the hands of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
Asked if he would vote against a plan that does n't contain provisions he wants to help people keep their homes , Obama said , " I 'm not trying to dictate one particular way , for example , to protect tax payers . "
" But I need to be convinced that tax payers are going to get an upside on this thing and can be made whole when the economy recovers , " he said .
McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds responded to Obama 's speech , saying in a release :
" Whether calling for a bipartisan oversight board or prohibitions on golden parachutes , Barack Obama is simply following in John McCain 's footsteps while trying to respond to this financial crisis . "
Obama - Biden spokesman Hari Sevugan said in response :
" Contrary to the lies told by the McCain campaign , it was John McCain who followed Sen .
Obama 's lead in laying out principles that call for strict oversight and accountability , protecting taxpayers and cracking down on CEO pay .
We only wish he had adopted those same principles over the last 26 years rather than cheerleading for the deregulation agenda that helped produce today 's crisis and repeatedly opposing limitations on the obscene compensation given to failed CEOs . "
Earlier Tuesday , McCain charged that Obama had shown a lack of leadership by staying " mum " on the financial crisis -- an accusation the Obama campaign called " laughable . "
McCain 's campaign released a television ad Tuesday that builds on McCain 's argument that Obama is not ready to lead .
" In crisis , experience matters .
McCain and his Congressional allies led , " an announcer says in the 30 - second spot .
" Obama and his liberal allies ?
Mum on the market crisis , " the announcer says .
Words beside a picture of Obama read " no leadership " as the announcer says , " A risk your family can't afford . "
Watch the ad »
In response to the ad , the Obama campaign charged McCain is the candidate who has not shown leadership .
" This ad is laughable .
If you believe John McCain , George Bush and the Republicans in Washington have led on reforming Wall Street and restraining CEO pay , I 've got a bridge in Alaska to sell you , " said Obama - Biden spokesman Bill Burton .
Watch candidate advisers talk about economic plans »
In the past week , Obama has inched up in the national polls .
CNN 's latest average of national polls shows Obama leading McCain by 3 points .
Earlier this month , McCain passed Obama in the national polls for the first time and held onto his lead for six days .
But as the financial crisis unfolded , Obama again took over the lead .
Polls show more people think Obama would do a better job handling an economic crisis than McCain .

It was roughly 13 years ago when the mortgage crisis in the US triggered a worldwide recession .
Most of us were unprepared for the economic turmoil that followed because we had little understanding of what was exactly going on .
But call it a silver lining or fate giving us a break — everyone knows we are currently in a recession .
The on - going pandemic forced states to implement unprecedented social restrictions that shuttered businesses and made way for millions of layoffs and furloughs .
Due to this , the CBO reports that the unemployment rate will hit 16 % in the US this year , which will be considerably worse than the Great Recession of 2008 when the jobless rate peaked at 10 % .
In such uncertain times , money spending becomes an art .
Those who can perfect this craft can not only brave the recession but come out of it more financially stable than ever .
Five Ways to Survive the Incoming Recession
Recessions are n’t rare .
They ’re a regular part of the economic cycle .
Although they can be triggered by different factors , their effects are pretty much the same ; stock market plummets , unemployment soars and inflation recedes .
Usually , some individuals are impacted more by a recession than others .
But there is nothing ‘ usual ’ about the current economic turmoil .
People across all industries have been affected in one way or another .
Although the situation is grim , you can apply the below five strategies to weather the storm .
1. Save Money
It ’s easier said than done but the first thing anyone should do in a bad economy is save each penny .
This means spending around 30 % of your net income ( earnings minus taxes ) on discretionary expenses .
You can make this easier by creating a monthly budget .
Prioritize your rent , groceries and utilities and suspend any expenses that are n’t necessary for survival .
Most people are avoiding eating out anyways which is a good thing .
You can even minimize your expenses further by cooking at home and avoiding takeaways .
For unavoidable expenses , look for deals that might help you save a few bucks .
Coupons in particular are great for reducing household expenses , which is why up to 90 % of consumers use them in one way or another .
They are extremely convenient as well .
If you ’re shopping online , all you have to do is a quick Google search and copy paste a specific code .
So look for deals and discounts even if you ’re ordering grocery items , hand sanitizers and face masks .
2. Seek a Certificate of Deposit
In response to a recession , the Federal Reserve eases interest rates for boosting consumption and makes loans cheaper for different commodities .
This is done to get the economy back on track .
However , this also causes banks to lower the interest rate they offer on deposits .
Anyone that wishes to have a better return on their money should ensure they do n’t have a high balance in their checking account .
A high - yield saving account is a good option in this situation but a more practical approach is a certificate of deposit ( CD ) .
At first , CDs usually have higher yields when compared to saving accounts .
CDs have a fixed rate of return that protects you against the volatile nature of a recession economy .
Online - only banks in particular offer exceptional rates on CDs that beat savings accounts by a fair margin .
But do conduct thorough research as there are several risks involved in this option .
3. Avoid Additional Debt
Although it ’s a matter of common sense , a great number of people still borrow money in a bad economy hoping that they will get back on their feet in no time .
Sadly , this never actually happens with many debtors .
The worst mistake anyone can make during a recession is make guesses of the future rather than dealing with the situation at hand .
Incurring additional debt is a red flag that your budget planning is ineffective and you need to cut some spending or sell some non-essential assets .
Start by cutting off your credit card .
Likewise , forget about exercising your HELOCs .
A few bad decisions during the crisis can trigger a lifetime of financial instability .
4. Pay Off Current Debt
Building on the last point , you would need to pay off existing debt to create some much - needed room in your budget .
Paying down high - cost debt like your credit card balance should be a priority .
Along with credit card debt , mortgages and auto loans could also be detrimental to an individual ’s financial health .
Luckily , student loans have comparatively favorable provisions which mean there is no real urgency in paying off this loan .
The on - going pandemic has made the job market extremely volatile .
With a possibility being unemployment looming over one ’s head , paying off obligation can prove to be an effective method of staying in control .
Bankrate ’s tools for calculating debt - payoff plans and balance - transfer credit cards that have 0 % intro ARPs can help in planning debt payoffs .
Even in an expanding economy , eliminating high - interest rate debt is the right strategy .
The lack of financial obligations allows you to save for emergency scenarios .
5. Invest in Your Career
The job cuts in recession follow the same pattern .
Employees that do not have college education get the axe while those with a bachelor degree or higher are generally safe .
Education is one of the most effective tools for fending off unemployment in a bad economy .
Even if you ’re not financially sound , having particular skills or training that makes you employable can be vital in a recession .
Business tycoon Warren Buffet gave similar advice back in April when the market started to fall .
Instead of following the news and hoping that things will turn out just fine , it ’s better to take charge of your own career .
Conclusion
Businesses are opening up across the US and the stock market looks better than it did a month ago .
However , with no vaccine and thousands of new cases reported on a daily basis — we are nowhere near out of the woods yet .
To stay on the safe side , you would need to get your budget in order .
Take all necessary precautions to be in a stronger financial position .
The current crisis can overwhelm you but there ’s hope for anyone that ’s willing to make necessary adjustments .
If you get it right , any good financial habits you may pick up from a receding economy would prove to be beneficial even when things get better .

Now granted , the video does come off a little too Cable Access , a little too touchy feely ..
a little too middle school recital , a little too self important drama school teacher .
But it is a cute little project .
Let 's take a look at what some of the Fox Viewer comments were .

Ron Adair :
Really , really creepy .
In all my years of voting for president , I have never known anyone like Obama .
Why he does n’t scare the hell out of American voters with his messianic complex , cult worship mentality of the unwashed masses , is amazing to me .
Eric l .
How chilling .
It remins me of the old newsreels and films of the “ Hitler Youth ” .
Those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it .
This is freightening when you consider how poor a grasp on history O’bama has shown .
This is a very dangerous time in the history of the USA .
Think hard before you vote for this Liberal Facist .
ED :
CREEPY !!!
What ’s next , are they all gonna join the OBAMA HEAVEN ’S GATE cult & commit mass suicide if he does n’t win ?
Kind of wish that music teacher would !

WWWWWOOOOOOWWWW , Ididnt think i would see another HITLER in my lifetime , the only difference is this one has a different skin color .
This is exactly how Chavez got elected in Venezuela ..
He had children sing for him , said he would change the country , and said that he would help the middle class ….. People please wake up this is scary !!!
Cane

clearly disturbing ….using children who do n’t have the ability to reason the facts or their future , these adults , organization , obama and all concerned have gone too far ….
but as so far the media has allowed this mania , it ’s no wonder .
Americans … wake up !
History has taught us to BEWARE of this craziness !!!
wake up !
WOW !
That 's a tough room .
It 's truly amazing to me the amount of uneccessary hatred that is spewed on this message board .
Way out of line , we 're dealing with kids here folks !
At a recital !.
The Republican base likes to attack kids at a recital ?
These are same folks who love family values and American Idol and Little League .
AND FOX NEWS GIVES THROWS THEM TO MESSAGE BOARD SHARKS !
But of course , I have some videos of my own to share !

EDIT : For all those tuning into my blog for the first time be sure to check out the Ruby threading bugfix from an earlier post : Ruby Threading Bugfix : Small fix goes a long way
In this blog post I ’m releasing some patches to MRI Ruby 1.8.7p72 that add heap dumping , object reference finder , stack dumping , object allocation / deallocation tracking , and some more goodies to MRI Ruby 1.8.7p72 .
These are some changes to Ruby I ’ve been working on at the startup I am with ( Kickball Labs ! ) , but I think they are generally useful to other people who are looking to try and track down memory problems in Ruby .
Let ’s get started …
Memory leaks ?
In Ruby ?!
Many people working on large Ruby applications have complained about memory consumption and the lack of tools available to dump the object heap and search for which objects hold references to other objects .
In a future blog post , I hope to talk about different methods of garbage collection and dissect some popular languages and their GC algorithms .
Very briefly though , let ’s take a quick look at how Ruby ’s GC works and how leaks can occur .
The garbage collector in MRI Ruby marks objects as in use during the mark phase if a reference to the object is found .
The traversal is started at a set of top level root objects which are marked as in use and recurses on the objects which are referenced from the current object .
In this way all reachable objects are marked as in use .
The sweep phase then hits every object on the heap and marks objects as free if they are not in use .
We all try to write code which is decoupled , clean , and well documented .
Let ’s face it though : we are human and we make mistakes .
Image a pile of objects all holding references to each other .
As long as this pile of objects has no reachable reference from a path originating from a root object , these objects will get garbage collected .
Unfortunately , from time to time we forget to clear out all references to old objects we are no longer using .
In our pile of objects example , all it takes is one reachable reference from a root object to keep the entire pile of objects in memory .
Here at Kickball labs we thought we were encountering such a situation , but we had no easy way to verify and track it down .
I hacked up a heap dumper , stack dumper , reference finder , and some other stuff to help in our quest to take out the trash .
Memtrack APIs
To start I did a bunch of google searching to find if anyone else had gone down this path before .
I stumbled across a company called Software Verify , which released a really cool set of APIs , Ruby Memory Tracking API , for tracking object allocation , deallocation , getting the root heap objects , and getting references to objects .
The API was really clean and allowed me to hook in my own callbacks for each of those events .
One small downside though ; the memtrack APIs were for ruby 1.8.6 and when I created a diff they did not apply cleanly to 1.8.7 .
With a tiny bit of work I was able to get APIs to apply to 1.8.7p72 .
The patch can be found below and applies to MRI Ruby 1.8.7 - p72 .
Heap / Stack dumper overview
I hooked in some callbacks to the Memtrack API and added some additional code for heap_find and stack_dump .
My algorithm for heap_dump and heap_find is pretty simple .
I start by traversing each of the objects on the heap and dumping them each ( for heap_dump ) or checking if the object has a reference to the object passed into heap_find .
I also copied some code from the mark phase of Ruby ’s GC to check the contents of the registers and stack frames .
I did this because Ruby checks this information before marking an object as in use .
You may be wondering how this can possibly work ; could n’t any FIXNUM that gets passed around in the Ruby internals look like a heap pointer ?
Well … not quite .
Ruby FIXNUMs are 31 bits and as a result they can be bit shifted by 1 bit and their LSB can be set to 1 without losing any data .
Doing this ensures that the resulting value cannot look like a pointer to the heap .
HOWTO use the stack / heap dumper
Four functions were added to GC : heap_dump , heap_find , heap_counts , and stack_dump .
After applying the patches below and rebuilding Ruby , you can use these functions .
There are a bunch of environment variables you can set to control how much output you get .
WARNING : There can be a lot of output .
Environment vars and what they do :
RUBY_HEAP_LOG
– setting this environment var will cause heap dumping output to be written to the specified file .
If this is not set data will be written to stderr
RUBY_HEAP_ALLOC
– setting this environment var to anything greather than or equal to 1 will cause output whenever a ruby object is allocated or deallocated this creates a LOT of output .
RUBY_HEAP_SETUP
– setting this environment var to anything greater than or equal to 1 will cause output whenever a ruby object has its klass field set .
Ok – now let ’s take a quick look at the four added functions and what they do when you use them :
GC. heap_dump – this function writes to stderr ( unless RUBY_HEAP_LOG is set ) the contents of the Ruby heap .
It outputs each object that is not marked as free and information about that object and the objects it references .
For strings , for example , the value and length of the string will be output .
For classes , the name of the class ( unless it is an anonymous class ) and the superclass .
GC. heap_find – this function takes one argument and traverses the heap looking for objects which hold a reference to the argument .
Once found , it outputs information about the object holding the reference and also information about the object you passed in .
GC.heap_counts – this function is poorly implemented and can only be called after you have called GC. heap_dump .
This function outputs the number of each type of Ruby object that has been created ( object , node , class , module , string , fixnum , float , etc ) .
GC.stack_dump – this function checks the registers and stack frames for things which look like pointers to the heap .
If the pointer looks like it is pointed at the heap , the address of the pointer is output as well as information about the object it references .
The good stuff : Patches for Ruby 1.8.7p72
Apply the patches below to the MRI Ruby 1.8.7p72 code base and rebuild Ruby .
The code below is a bit ugly as it was written in a rush .
Use with caution and be sure to email me with any bugfixes or cool additions you come up with !
Patch to apply Memtrack API to MRI Ruby 1.8.7-p72 :
memtrack - api-187p72.patch
Patch to apply heap dumper , stack dumper , ref finder , alloc / dealloc tracker , and everything else which is awesome :
heapdumper.patch
Conclusion
Ruby is lacking tools for serious memory analysis .
Using the Memtrack API and some other code , tracking down memory issues can be less painful .
The tools included in the patches above are only a first cut at developing real , useful memory analysis tools for Ruby .
I hope to see more work in creating tools for Ruby .
Thanks for reading !
If you have problems using the patches or you create a cool memory analysis tool send me some mail .

Last week MGM put out a new special anniversary edition ofon DVD , dubbed as “ . ”
While loaded with plenty of new features and extras , there was one thing that was notably absent from the DVD release …
The director of the film , .
For whatever reason , the producers on the DVD decided to exclude him from the disc .
It ’s fairly obvious when you hold up the first film to all of its sequels , that it was the craft of a director like Holland that madethe genre classic that it is .
Had the first film not worked , there would n’t have been a franchise .
So , we felt we should give fans what they deserve - a commentary from the man who directed Chucky 's first outing .
We contacted Tom and asked if he'd be interested in recording acommentary track for ICONS OF FRIGHT .
And sure enough , he was thrilled to ... Moderated by filmmaker and new ICONS staffer , below is a link to thedirector 's commentary , which you can download ... for FREE .
( Right click and select " save target as " ) Tim will guide you at the beginning of the track to queue up your DVD with their audio track .
This is our gift on behalf of Tom Holland , Tim Sullivan and ICONS OF FRIGHT to you , the fans .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Nasdaq said Tuesday afternoon that it has cancelled certain trades made on shares of Google Inc. GOOG , +0.32 % minutes before the closing bell Tuesday .
In a statement , the exchange said it will cancel all trades on the stock at or above $ 425.29 and at or below $ 400.52 that were executed between 3:57 and 4:02 Eastern .
The exchange also said it will be adjusting the Nasdaq Official Closing Cross ( NOCP ) and all trades executed in the cross to $ 400.52 .
The decision came after data late in the trading session seemed to indicate that shares of Google - which were trading up about 8 % for most of the session - fell between 10 - 16 % in the final minutes before the closing bell .
The statement from Nasdaq did not gie a reason for the other trades .
The words market garden are n't normally used to describe Walthamstow , a built - up corner of north - east London better known for the greyhound stadium that closed last week .
But amid the rows of Victorian and Edwardian terraces there 's a thriving home - grown food industry .
Last year a small group of volunteers picked 12 tonnes of fruit , that would otherwise have rotted , from gardens and street trees across the borough .
OrganicLea 's scrumping scheme lets householders keep 25 % of the fruit collected , while the rest is sold at the co-op 's market stall or turned into juice .
Clare Joy of OrganicLea estimates that even in such urban areas , one in four detached or semi- detached houses have fruit trees in their garden , yet much of it simply goes to waste .
" It ranges from street trees and pub gardens to residents who are housebound and unable to pick themselves , and pear - tree owners who are sadly not that keen on pears .
We discovered a beautiful Victorian kitchen garden with orchard and hothouse but lacking the full - time gardener it would once have had . "
Meanwhile , some allotment holders are fighting the credit crunch by swapping their surplus goods for a free pint down the pub .
At The Pigs in Edgefield , near Holt , Norfolk , customers are greeted with a sign that reads : " If you breed , grow , shoot or steal anything you feel may be at home on our menu , ask at the bar .
Let 's do a deal . "
So far , pints have been swapped for potatoes , mackerel and a kilo of fresh fruit .
Pub regular Derek Feast , 64 , exchanges his free - range chicken eggs for a pint .
" I have a job where I earn the national minimum wage , so this little bit of extra money helps me get out , " he told the Daily Telegraph .
Organised food swaps - a sort of urban village fete where you can get good food for free by swapping what you 've brought - are becoming popular across Britain .
The first Great Food Swap was staged by Growing Communities ( growingcommunities.org ) in October 2006 in Stoke Newington , north London .
It was so overwhelmed by visitors that it has now become an annual event .
The summer may have been a washout , but the wet and warm conditions have been perfect for cucumbers , squash , courgettes and marrows .
If you want to sell your bumper crop rather than swap it or give it away , it 's not easy .
Some allotment associations occasionally rent stalls at farmer 's markets , but the cash earned is usually ploughed back into association funds .
There are some weekly stalls at year - round markets where allotment holders can take their surplus for sale .
OrganicLea runs a weekly market stall , primarily supplied by a farmers ' co-op in Norfolk , but it also offers surplus produce from local allotments .
The stall takes 25 % and the allotment holder gets 75 % of whatever is made .
There 's also the option of roadside sales , which are particularly popular with small - scale egg producers .
Just five backyard chickens can easily lay 1,250 or more eggs a year , leaving the average family with a surplus of dozens of eggs every week .
According to allotment.org.uk , so long as your roadside sales are surplus , and production is not at commercial levels , you can rely on a technical exemption called " farm gate sales " .
But take them to market and the Egg Marketing Inspectorate will be watching to make sure that each one is marked with a producer code number .
You are also not allowed to sell to any catering establishments .
The law on selling surplus produce from allotments confuses some smallholders .
Many allotment associations tell members it is against the law to sell their goods , but that 's not entirely correct according to Bryn Pugh , legal consultant to the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners .
" Strictly speaking , produce from allotments cannot be sold , but there should be no objection to the occasional sale of surplus produce .
What is prohibited under the Allotments Acts , 1908 - 1950 ( section 22 , subsection 1 ) is that an allotment cannot be used to support a business . "
But he says that if an allotment holder can prove they have more than they can use themselves , it wo n't be regarded as illegal to sell the surplus .
" There are only so many courgettes you can eat in a week , " he says .
Bend the rules too far , however , and you 'll be the disgrace of the green - fingered community .
In one case in north - west England last year , an allotment holder was found to be growing soft fruit purely for his wife 's jam - making business .
" The tenant was removed .
It is totally against the ethics of allotment gardening , " says Pugh .
The RNC 's cash advantage
DNC spokeswoman Karen Finney says the party raised more than $ 17 million and has $ 17.5 million on hand , having spent more than $ 28 million last month , largely on the Democrats ' ground game .
That cash figure is a fraction of the $ 110 million a Republican official says it has , which includes transfers of money McCain is no longer allowed to spend and money from state fundraising vehicles .
The disparity shows the Republicans ' continued edge with the wealthy donors who can give in five - figure chunks .
The party money , though , is not worth as much as the campaigns ' hard money , because it can't be spent as directly on the campaign , particularly when it comes to media .
That was illustrated last month by RNC - funded ads that included confusing , digressive attacks on random Democratic senators , including Byron Dorgan , to fulfill campaign finance rules .
The GOP money will , however , finance an extensive field effort .

Grassroots Exit Polls for 2006 & 2008 ??
I have an idea that I have n't seen or heard anywhere : Drum roll please .
Conduct exit polls in 2006 and 2008 that will actually attempt to be accurate , like they do in verifiable democracies , e.g. Germany has accurate exit polls .
And next time , let 's not depend on the Corporate Media to fund / run our exit polls !
( well , duh ! )
After the 2004 election there was controversy about the Edison / Mitofsky poll results because they differed substantially from the election results .
Before the election , we heard ( apparently BS ) all about how the exit polls were going to be better than ever , because nobody wanted to repeat Florida 2000 .
Then after the exit poll fiasco , the world 's most prestegious pollsters give us the lame excuse , well , these kind of exit polls are n't really supposed to be accurate predictors of who won the election .
Huh ?
Nevermind that we were daily force fed pre-election polls of 1000 people ( who might vote ) with an accuracy claim of +/- 3 % , whereas an exit poll of 15,000 people who actually voted can be off by 6 % , and the explanation is n't more than " Ooops , my bad .
There 's really no justification for my polling firm 's services " .
In 2006 and 2008 , I predict the " common wisdom " presented by the Corporate Media will go a little something like this : " Americans are sceptical of exit polls after their dismal performance in 2000 , 2002 , and finally , 2004 .
This time around , Americans are wondering whether exit polls are needed at all , given that the country has moved to 100 % electronic voting , the most accurate , secure and reliable voting method ever devised .
This is Karen Ryan reporting in Washington . "
Grassroots Exit Poll effort :
This needs to be our backup plan for US Democracy .
We may not get election reform .
Or , we may THINK we got election reform , when we actually did n't , and then we get shafted yet again .
You can fool me two or three times , but not four times , damnit .
I 've read that university students can conduct very accurate exit polls .
Surly we can do this ?
If not nationally , then at least in the swing states .
In an ideal world , we could depend on elected officials , vote machine companies , and / or the MSM to protect democracy .
It is not an ideal world .
While I will do my part to restore democracy in America , nearly all actions that we can take ultimately have a component that requires involvement of elected officials , vote machine companies , and / or the MSM .
The preparation for and execution of a Grassroots Exit Poll can bypass both elected officials AND the MSM AND the vote machine companies .
As long as the poll methods are sound and well documented , if the poll results were different from the " official " results , we could then make a stink smelt all the way to Ukraine , one that CANNOT be ignored .
You smell what I 'm cookin ?
How many people would it take ?
( whatever that is , TRIPLE it ! )
What kind of training would be required ?
( surly we do n't need to reinvent the wheel here .
Other places do it .
Let 's do what they do . )
How would exit pollsters be deployed to get accurate data ?
How would we have " legitamacy " ?
( Calling Mr. Carter ... )
Reducing costs : all volunteers .
Volunteer # 1 right here !
Transparency is key - everything done must be totally open .
However , no results posted until after polls in that state close .
The goal is for accuracy , not a breakdown of voter issues .
It would be better for an individual pollster to get quick responses of how 200 people voted , rather than 15 filled out , lengthy , detailed questionaires .
What do you think ?

Among many other illegal things , Blackwell violated the Ohio Constitution by ordering Ohio's 88 Boards of Elections to deny anyone access to the pollbooks until after certification .
A pro se lawsuit in this regard was filed in November ; the first hearing on this case is scheduled for April 14 before Judge Peter Kontos of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas in Warren , Ohio .
Anyone wishing to file an amicus brief is welcome and encouraged to do so .

Of course it " went well " for them , they pulled off a great mystery .
How the exit poll data somehow only does not work when Bush is a candidate , but always works otherwise , is a wonderful Blackwell mystery that " went well " .
What made it work so well is that major republican players owned and controlled the companies that built the voting machines , made the voting regulations , and managed the election as they managed the republican campaign .
It went oh so Blackwell .

Bejaminn075 # 4 - I think that 's great idea .
Once Brad and VR get thru the current slate of activities , maybe it's one that can get organized thru VR in time for the 2006 elections .
Yes , you should have back - ups for your back - ups , etc. , to force the outcome to be legitimate and democratic .
Well , the Repubs . are cooking the truth BLATANTLY AND PUBLICLY as usual .
" phoney " hearings , " phoney " elections , " phoney " news , " phoney " intelligence - just a bunch of dangerous phoneys running the government of the U.S.
When will it stop ?

Thanks Peggy # 9 .
I posted the same comment as a diary at DKos , and it rapidly disappeared with little comment .
Actually only one other commenter besides me , a defeatist who told me that it would cost millions of $ and would not be practically possible .
I 'm sure lots of us are actively working for voting reform .
But we may not get it BEFORE the next election .
If the worst - case scenario is true , that the voting machines are rigged , and that some people in power at the top know this is their lifeblood , we 've got a really really REALLY difficult task ahead of us .
They will fight us tenaciously with everything they 've got ( and they 've got a lot ) .
Even if we pass a voting reform law , it may not do much good .
Voting companies already break the law .
When they 've loaded the voting machines with last minute " patches " just before an election and do n't certify the modifications , there are no consequences , even when that information becomes public .
We need to implement some form of vote integrity verification that does n't depend on the actions or inactions of vote machine companies , our elected officials , and the corporate media .
One problem that I just thought of was that I heard that some exit poll workers in 2004 were not allowed near the polling place .
I can't imagine why , but it happened .
We would have to have some determined poll workers .

To Peter # 3
Since when is keeping government off our backs and out of our business a " liberal " value ?
It used to be a " conservative " value .
It 's her husband 's decision by law .
Respect the law .
Respecting the law is traditionally " conservative , " is n't it ?
Terry Schiavo , by the way , has been medically brain dead for 15 years living in a state she stated she 'd never want to be in .
2 American soldiers died yesterday .
Why are n't you out protesting those deaths , which could have been prevented if honesty and integrity mattered in this country 's approach to foreign and domestic policy ?
Before we sent them to Iraq , their brains were completely functional , their full , young lives before them .
And now the justification for this is the same one conservatives excoriated when the communists spouted it : " The ends justifies the means . "
I guess it 's somehow different when you need to use it ?
The means were fictional , and the ends will come back to bite us in the ass .
It also used to be a " stated " conservative value to foster a transparent , small federal government responsive to the people , not special interests , and respectful of states rights ( Now that states - rights thing appears to bear the caveat , " unless we can ignore it to stir up our political base " ) .
The Velvet Revolution 's call to save our voting rights respects the rights of free trade to participate while ensuring our rights to a clean , transparent , verifiable election system .
Who could be against that ?
Is that " liberal " ?
I do n't think so .
I call it " reasonable . "
What do you call it , Pete ?
Are " conservatives " against integrity , transparency , and the law ?
The only reason to avoid this is to preserve the means of corruption .
It appears that Kenneth Blackwell has no respect for the laws of his own state or of the people who vote there .
Does that make him a good conservative , or a bad one , Pete ?
I , for one , think it just makes him a criminal , should the copious charges can be proven .
His actions to date suggest that they will be .
Will there be reasonable justice , or just " conservative " ( and I use that term very loosely ) whitewash ?
Viva la Velvet Revolucion !
Viva reason !

I 'd say that the chances of getting real voting reform in time for 2006 are pretty slim , and unless Blackwell or some other Republican criminals are taken down publicly in such a way as to finally be exposed to the majority of American voters , and cause a massive nationwide uproar , then we are pretty much on our own again with a system that is rigged against us .
The only way that I see us beating a rigged election is to have the votes so overwhelmingly lopsided in our favor that even if they do try to pull another fast one , it would be too apparent to everyone that something went wrong .
You know , I 've been pretty pessimistic the last few days with the latest outrage ( Terri Schiavo ) being crammed down our throats , and temporarily lost my bearings .
Thank you to ??????? for pointing this out to me :0 )
Anyway , maybe the Republicans have overeached , I mean , they definetly have , I think !
All the polls I 've seen regarding Terri Schiavo show an overwhelming majority of people disagree with what the republicans are doing .
Hell , at DailyKos , I even saw one poll that showed a slim majority of evangelicals disagree with them .
With all the scandals and blatant politicking going on , something is going to have to give sooner or later .
What 's still stunning are the lengths to which the RWCM is willing to go in their efforts to control information and opinion in the country .
They just keep pounding away .
Other than rigged voting machines , our biggest problem is clearly the media .
They have to be stopped somehow .

Bejammin # 75 , I just wanted to say that I think we all have accurate exit polls .
The lame excuse that Dems were overrepresented had to have been calculated using some comparison data .
That data would be registration and poll book data --- which we are not allowed to see .
In other words , if Dems were surrepititiosly re-registered as Reps , then it certainly would appear as if the exit polls overrepresented Reps .
The only other way to check is to do an actual recount .
So , let us not forget , next time and among other items , to consider the accuracy of the registration and poll book records as well .

I have to wonder if anything has to actually be PROVED to bring down this government .
What is that old saying that means " not only ( fair , transparent ) , but APPEAR to be ( fair , transparent ) " .
As the long list of APPARENT wrongdoing increases , ( with minimal cover - up by the power clutching ignoramuses over time , like this phoney " hearing " ) , this may be enough to push them out the door .

I heard on " Air America " recently that the Dems . in Colorado have some kind of computerized system to track votes by registered Dems . and Indpds .
The topic was how the system was used in getting out the vote in Colorado in 04 and how it could be used in the 2006 election to monitor election fraud .

What about developing a software package ( open source of course ) that will run on " any " laptop that includes a Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) Editor .
This could allow " Exit polsters " to shown graphical representation of actual " ballot " used on day of election to " voter " that only requires " highlighting " selection they picked in polling booth , you could show a progressive total to " voter " to prove only change made was as they selected .
Software could be secure and made to log any changes made by timestamp etc .
Training would have to be " verified " some how .
Theres lots of available laptops you would think .
Seeing as " time is money " and from what I 've seen people are already giving Millions if not Billions of Dollars ( in time ) looking into Nov 2 2004 , surely somebody would give the hours needed to develope the software as " open source " ( look at LINUX ) and together come up with a reliable program .
Results could be locally compiled and passed up a pre-arranged network of people to a central location by voice over the phone and emailed to confirm .
Something like PGP could be used to safeguard emails enroute .
A BLOGGERS VIRTUAL HEADQUARTERS could release progress results online thru out the day .
Draw up a contract with exit polster stating they are prepared to swear under oath as to the accuracy of the data they gathered and are prepared to sit a polygraph as further proof ( unlike some present SOE )

I attended this hearing .
Blackwell was extraordinarily
arrogant .
At one point he turned his back to Rep. Millender - Mc Donald while she was asking him a question .
When she said she would not speak to his back he motioned that he could still hear her question .
At another point she perhaps facetiously referred to him as an honorable man .
Blackwell went on to add a number of complimentary synonyms to embelish this " compliment " to his character .
His arrogance was not overlooked by Rep. Millender - Mc Donald who wryly added " and humble . " to his list of self praise .
This hearing was videotaped .
I do not know how available the video is .
I recommend Blackwell 's performance .
He had the audacity to brag about how well the election went in Ohio .
He had explanations and excuses for every allegation that generally involved blaming others .
I hope someone investigates his excuses and finds a way to hold him accountable .

I think it is a complete " fabrication and exaggeration " to claim that Blackwell is a competent Secretary of State .
If he had any ethics at all he would have given up one of his two conflict - of - interest official political positions during the last presidential election .
In other words , either he kept his job as Secretary of State and dropped being Bush 's Ohio campaign party hack , or he quit as Secretary so she could run Bush 's campaign .
I just wonder how many more corrupt Blackwell / Katherine Harris clones will spring up from the primordial Republican slop to game our Democratic elections before we turn completely into some type of fascist - run society where elections are rigged all the time .

Exit polling by independents would on the surface seem to be a good idea .
However , how could we be sure that the other party does n't adopt the same idea , and produce fudged results in " their " exit polls ( matching of course their rigged results from the black - box voting machines ) .
After all the Rep party has mucho dinero to spend on doing their own polls , and this could be an effective way of negating any poll done by an independent group .
If the two polls differed , the repugs could claim fraud on the part of the independents .
They could also ensure that their " pollsters " would receive preferential treatment , or even arrange that the indpendent pollsters were kept totally away from polling places .
After all the repugs own the SOSs , such as Blackwell .
Surely phoney exit - polls are not beneath the group that has given us fake reporters , govenment " news " reports , fraudulent WMD reports , etc ?
If the idea of exit - polling is to work , it must be done by a single reputable non-partisan organization that is guaranteed access to all polling places .
And of course the polling results must be on paper .
to minimize the possibility of electronic cooking of results .
League of Women Voters anybody ?

I think the exit polls that predicted Kerry won could have been correct , but it has n't been proven .
Then when the head of the exit poll firm comes out and says that the poll really is n't supposed to be accurate , it kind of torpedos that particular exit poll .
When I read about exit polls in Germany ( I 'm fuzzy here on the details , it was months ago ) , I believe those exit polls ARE supposed to be accurate , but they also have proportionally much more people involved in the polling .
My fuzzy memory recalls that the size of our equivalent US poll would need to be about 8 times larger than our 2004 poll , in order to match the scale of the German exit polls .
Seattledem # 25 : I have n't heard of the vote tracking system you refer to .
MMIIXX # 27 :
That sounds complicated and expensive , but you bring up the good point of integrity of the exit poll .
Perhaps a " buddy system " could help ensure honesty , if we feared " infiltration " by bad elements in the exit poll workers .
As in , make sure that there are at least 2 poll workers at a given precinct .
As far as tallying the exit poll , my preference would be for something low - tech , like a sheet of paper with the tables / lists of candidates .
Photocopy as needed , and check off boxes with a pen .
A laptop would need to be powered all day , and there might not be a nearby plug , or you might have to stand in the rain !
Hardwickdem # 35 :
If this is a ( non-violent , of course ) war to get our right to vote back , there will be many battles fought .
We will definitely lose some battles , no doubt about it .
But there are battles we can win if we chose to fight them .
This is an asymetric war : there are a lot of us , but we 're individually poor and unpowerful .
There are few of them , but they 've got centralized power in key places , money , and the MSM .
If we do this independent exit poll , I do n't think they will try to match us with an exit poll .
The kind of exit poll we need is going to take a lot of people , which is not their style .
I think they would use their strengths of misinformation and abuse of power .
They will cast doubt and suspicion every chance they get on the exit poll , they will tell voters not to participate , and just general bad - mouthing of the effort every chance they get on the MSM .
They will portray us as lazy , hippie , conspiracy theorists doing a half - assed and bungled job of an exit poll .
Then they will use people like Blackwell and Harris to issue directives that poll workers are n't allowed within 1000 feet of a voting booth , and have us arrested for being close to the voting .
You are correct that guaranteed access to polling places is key , and I suspect that 's one of those things we'd have to fight for .

My post # 7 above links to the document which is the official cover - up of the exit poll events .
It is not the full story by any means , and I am sorry if I caused any confusion .
The subject is fully discussed at VR and Black Box voting dot org .
The fact about exit polls is at this link in the document prepared to expose the document in post # 7 .
The latter expose points out : " Exit polling is a well - developed science , informed by half a century of experience and continually improving methodology " ( page 5 , italics added ) .
It goes on to show why the report was wrong and that the evidence is very strong that fraud was the reason for the exit poll descrepancy from the reported results .

Dredd # 37 :
Thanks for the above links .
I had seen some of that exit poll rebuttal floating around on the internets , but not that actual report by US Count Votes .
US Count Votes points out that Edison / Mitofsky claim , with no proof , that Kerry voters responded to the exit poll at higher rates .
Furthermore , they show that the more Republican a precint is , the higher the response rate , which is exactly the opposite of what Edison / Mitofsky would predict !
US Count Votes points out that the exit poll error ( measured as median WPE , which I do n't completely grasp ) is very small for paper ballot areas ( - 0.9 % ) , yet very large for voting machines ( ranges from - 5.5 % to - 10.3 % ) .
The writing style of the lame Edison / Mitofsky report reminds me of the bad papers I wrote in college where I had nothing to say - just repeating and rephrasing the same crap over and over because there 's nothing to say .
Take this long - winded gem , which should just be 1 sentence : " These errors are not necessarily a function of the voting equipment .
They appear to be a function of the equipment�s location and the voters� responses to the exit poll at precincts that use this equipment .
The value of the WPE for the different types of equipment may be more a function of where the equipment is located than of the equipment itself .
The larger urban areas had higher WPEs than the rural / small towns .
The low value of the WPE in paper ballot precincts may be due to the location of those precincts in rural areas , which had a lower WPE than other places . "
What strikes me about the fact that the exit poll error is in the more populated places with unverifiable voting equipment is that it matches with Clint Curtis 's claims that Feeney wanted to target the highly populated South Florida counties with lots of Black voters .
There was a bank robber once , who was asked , " Why do you rob banks ? "
He replied " Because that 's where the money is ! " .
The best place to steal votes is there the votes are : highly populated areas that traditionally vote for your opponent .

Also , the amount of money poured into the state from feds .

I think organized exit polling activities is a great idea .
If it 's well done and accurate , it would stand up in court against a fraudulent vote count .
The Repubs . depend very much on " no opposition " to their methodologies .
They are rich people who need dummies to keep them in power .
But the majority of Americans are not stupid .
Opposition makes the Repubs .
work hard to justify their wrongdoings , which in fact is not necessarily easy , and it does attrack a lot of negative attention .
Keep pointing out the error oF their ways , set up counter activities , such as DV4D , the exit polling idea , VR , Blackbox , etc. , and they will collapse .
Their strategy is built on HOT AIR and CRIME .

I 've got a friend who takes the subway to his job at an ad agency downtown .
At the end of the month , he gets a credit on his paycheck .
I 've also got a friend who bikes to work because she finds it faster and healthier ( and because the last time she rode the subway some drunk puked on her ) .
You know what she gets at the end of the month ?
Nothing .
Corporate America has long provided incentives for employees to take mass transit , from rebates to quarterly bonuses to picking up the tab entirely .
Cyclists typically do n't get squat , and it is n't fair .
It 's also starting to change .
Part of the problem is perception .
People look at guys ( and gals ) on bikes and figure they 're getting a free ride – no gas , free parking and the ability to zip through gridlocked traffic .
What 's the problem ?
Sure , bikers do n't pay for gas , but cycling is hardly free .
They spend plenty on shoes , lights , mirrors , helmets and other equipment .
They 've gotta pay for maintenance and repairs .
You think inner tubes are free ?
How is it fair that people who ride the train get rewarded – as they should – but those pedaling to work get nothing ?
It 's a question more employers are considering as more and more people ditch their cars for bikes .
At long last , bike commuters are getting some love .
The National Institutes of Health provides employees with a " bike buck " for every 100 miles they rack up riding to work .
The scrip can be redeemed at two local bike shops , and the 125 people enrolled in the program earned 1,655 bike bucks during the first half of the year .
One guy at the National Library of Medicine , which also has adopted the program , earns more than 200 bike bucks a year .
That 's almost enough to cover a pair of bike shoes .
Other companies are waking up as well .
Discovery Communications , the corporate parent of Discovery Channel , reimburses employees $ 350 the first time they buy a bike .
A school in Palm Beach Florida pays its bike commuters 20 cents a mile .
And health insurance giant Humana provides bikes so employees can ride around its massive campus .
They 're all following the example set by Google , which started giving away bikes and helmets to its full - time employees last year .
It 's safe to say that we'd see more companies stepping up if Uncle Sam helped them out .
The Renewable Energy and Job Creation
Act of 2008 , which would among other things allow bikers to claim an employer - based reimbursement benefit of up to $ 20 a month , died in the Senate earlier this year .
The government ought to do more to encourage people to bike to work .
Until then , it 's up to employers to do the right thing .

Volcano observatories reduce risk around the globe .
Here 's how we can support them .
When a volcano erupts , there can be global ripples caused by interruptions of air travel , agriculture , and tourism .
One way to keep everyone secure is to ensure that volcano observatories around the world have the expertise and resources to detect and forecast volcanic activity , and can provide useful warnings and messages used by both local and global populations .
Two scientists from the USGS Volcano Disaster Assistance Program ( VDAP is funded largely by USAID ) penned a short overview of ways that different entities such as academia , governments , NGOs , and the global insurance industry can work together to bolster global resilience to volcanic disasters through support of front - line science institutions , like volcano observatories .
The article , Volcano observatories reduce risk around the globe .
Here 's how we can support them , delves into topics such as infrastructure donation , research and operational motives , and training of observatory staff , while maintaining the key goal of supporting the autonomy and authoritative role of the local observatory .
Volcano Observatories Continue Operations Amid COVID-19
The five volcano observatories of the USGS Volcano Hazards Program continue to monitor the volcanoes of the United States and issue forecasts and regular updates of volcanic activity .
Through telework and other adaptations we continue to maintain our monitoring networks and analysis of the incoming data .
Our field crews visit field stations as needed to maintain the quality and functionality of the network .

Read Our Two Weekly Volcano Observatory Science Articles
Scientists within the USGS Volcano Hazards Program operate from within five U.S. volcano observatories .
One of the primary goals of the observatories is to be an authoritative source for enlightening information about our Nation 's volcanoes .
The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory ( HVO ) , the oldest of the five , has a long history of writing regular articles about volcanic activity and scientific research on the Hawaiian volcanoes .
HVO 's weekly article , " Volcano Watch , " entered its 27th year of publication in November 2017 .
The entire catalog of articles can be accessed and searched on their website .
New articles are published every Thursday afternoon .
Taking lead from HVO , the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory ( YVO ) , the newest of the five observatories , began a weekly article on the first day of 2018 .
This new column — the " Yellowstone Caldera Chronicles " — is posted each Monday on the homepage of YVO 's website .
Like HVO 's Volcano Watch series , the YVO Chronicles are peer - reviewed and edited before publication .
If you are interested in learning more about a specific topic related to Yellowstone or Hawaiian volcanism , please contact us .
We will certainly answer , and you may see a longer - winded answer in a future Volcano Watch or Yellowstone Caldera Chronicle article .

Margaret Hays , director of the oceanic affairs office at the US State Department , said the US / Canada mission would explore " places nobody 's gone before " .
She told Reuters the Alaskan continental shelf could lie up to 600 nautical miles from the coastline and that data collected on the mission could provide information to the public about future oil and natural gas sources for the US .
WASHINGTON -- Sen .
John McCain 's presidential campaign is relying on loopholes in campaign finance law to raise and spend money outside of the government 's public funding program .
Sen .
McCain 's campaign appears to be doing everything it legally can to keep up with Democratic candidate Barack Obama , who opted out of the system and has been raising cash at a torrid pace .
" McCain kept his promise to stay in the public financing system , " said spokesman Brian Rogers .
" Obama broke his out of pure political self - interest and went on to raise $ 150 million in one month . "
When he accepted $ 84.1 million in public funding for his campaign , Sen. McCain agreed to not raise or spend any other money .
But the law allows him to create what 's called a " compliance fund " to pay for legal fees associated with complying with campaign finance rules .
Both President George W. Bush and John Kerry created similar funds in 2004 .
But Sen. McCain is using his to an unprecedented degree .
In 2004 , Messrs .
Bush and Kerry each spent about $ 2 million from their funds before Election Day .
Tom Engelhardt was born in the US in 1944 .
He did n’t expect to make it to 2008 .
He expected even less the way that history has worked out for his nation
Let me start this way : if , on the evening of 22 October 1962 , you had told me that in 2008 America ’s most formidable enemy would be Iran , I would have been flabbergasted .
On that October evening , President John F Kennedy went before the nation – I heard him on the radio – to tell us all that Soviet missile sites were just then being prepared on the island of Cuba with “ a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere ” .
When fully operational , those nuclear - tipped weapons would reach “ as far north as Hudson Bay , Canada , and as far south as Lima , Peru ” .
I knew what Hudson Bay , far to the north , meant for me .
“ It shall be the policy of this nation , ” Kennedy added , “ to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack on the United States , requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union . ”
And he ended : “ My fellow citizens : let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out .
No one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred … ”
No one could mistake the threat : global nuclear war .
Few of us listeners had seen the 1960 top - secret SIOP ( Single Integrated Operational Plan ) in which the US military had made its preparations for a massive first strike of 3,200 nuclear weapons against the communist world .
It was supposed to take out at least 130 cities , with estimated casualties approaching 300 million ; but we knew well enough what might be coming .
I had seen versions of it in the movies , even if the power to destroy on a planetary scale was transposed to alien worlds , or imputed to strange alien rays or rampaging radioactive monsters .
Now , here it was in real life , my life , and the special effects were likely to be me , dead .
It was the single moment in my life – which tells you much about the life of an American who did n’t go to war in some distant land – when I truly imagined myself as prospective burnt toast .
I really believed that I might not make it out of the week , and I was then a freshman in college , just 18 and still wondering when life was slated to begin .
Between 1939 and 2008 , across much of the world , few people could claim to have escaped quite so lightly .
Had you whispered in my ear the news about our enemies still distant decades away , the Iranians , the – are you kidding ?
– Iraqis , or a bunch of fanatics in the backlands of Afghanistan and a tribal borderland of Pakistan … Death from Waziristan ?
I do n’t think so .
Truly , if I had been convinced that this was “ my ” future – that I would have a future – I might have dropped to my knees in front of that radio and thanked my lucky stars ; or perhaps I would have laughed out loud at the absurdity of it all .
( “ The absurd ” was then a major category in my life . )
Fanatics from Afghanistan ?
Please …
That we ’re here now , that the world was n’t burnt to a crisp in the long superpower standoff of the Cold War , still seems little short of a miracle to me , a surprise of history that offers hope – of a sort .
The question is why , with this in mind , do n’t I feel better , more hopeful now ?
Our present , if offered as a plot to sci - fi movie directors of that long - gone era , would surely have been judged too improbable for the screen .
Yet that ’s what came about , and the planet is still here .
Consider the fate of the US military base at Guantanamo – an extra-special symbol of that “ special and historical relationship ” mentioned by Kennedy between the small island of Cuba and its giant “ neighbour ” to the northwest .
He announced that he was reinforcing the base , even as he was evacuating dependants from it .
And yet it survived the Cuban missile crisis unscathed .
Some four decades later it was still in such a special and historical relationship with Cuba that the Bush administration was able to use it to publicly establish all its new categories of off - shore injustice – its global mini-gulag of secret prisons , public policies of torture , detention without charges , disappearances .
Back in the 1950s , only Nazis , members of the Japanese imperial army , and KGB agents could publicly relish torture on screen .
An unexpected longevity
Back in 1962 , I could no more have imagined myself living to be 64 than I could have imagined living through “ World War IV ” ( as one set of neocons loved to call President Bush ’s Global War on Terror ) , to be fought mainly against thousands of Islamist fanatics scattered around the planet and an “ axis of evil ” consisting of three relatively weak regional powers .
I expected bigger , far worse things .
When it came to war , the history of most of the last century pointed exponentially in the direction of a cataclysm , with few or no survivors .
I was born , after all , in 1944 , just a year before the US atomically incinerated Hiroshima and then followed up by obliterating the city of Nagasaki , and World War II ended .
Victory arrived , but amid scenes of planetary carnage , genocide , and devastation previously unimaginable .
In these last years , the Bush administration has regularly invoked the glories of the US role in World War II and of the occupations of Germany and Japan that followed .
From the point of view of the US , however , World War II was mainly a “ world ” war in the world that it mobilised , not in the swath of the planet it turned into a charnel house .
The US ( along with the rest of the New World ) was left untouched by both “ world ” wars .
Other than a single attack on the US fleet at Hawaii , thousands of miles from the mainland , on 7 December 1941 , the brief Japanese occupation of a couple of tiny Aleutian islands off Alaska , a U - boat war off its coasts , and small numbers of balloon fire bombs that drifted from Japan over the US west , this continent remained peaceable .
For Americans , I doubt that the real import of that phrase world war – of the way the industrial machinery of complete devastation enveloped much of the planet in the course of the last century – ever quite came home .
War had remained a locally or regionally focused affair for much of history .
And in the decades before World War I , it was largely fought on the global peripheries by European powers testing out the industrial technology of mass slaughter – the machine gun , the airplane , poison gas , the concentration camp – on no one more significant than benighted “ natives ” in Iraq , the Sudan , or German Southwest Africa .
This was hardly worthy of notice until , in 1914 , Europeans began killing other Europeans by similar means and in staggering numbers .
While the American Civil War had offered a preview of war , industrial - style , World War I offered the first full - scale demonstration of what industrial warfare meant in the heartlands of advanced civilisation .
The machine gun , the airplane , and poison gas decimated a generation of European youth , while the tank , wheeled into action in 1916 , signalled rapid arms advances to come .
Nonetheless , that war , even as it touched the Middle East , Africa , and Asia , was n’t quite imagined as a “ world war ” while still ongoing .
At the time , it was known as the Great War .
Though parts of Tsarist Russia were devastated , the signature style of destruction was focused on a strip of land not more than a few miles wide at any moment that stretched from the Swiss border to the Atlantic Ocean , running largely through France .
There , on “ the Western front ” for four years , opposing armies fought – to appropriate an American term from the Vietnam War – a “ meat grinder ” of a war .
“ Fighting ” hardly covered the event .
It was a paroxysm of death and destruction .
That modest expanse of land was bombarded by many millions of shells and everything built on , or growing upon it , was levelled , and millions of young men – many tens of thousands on single days – were slaughtered .
The Great War ended in 1918 with a bitter peace in the West , while , in the East , amid civil war , the Bolsheviks came to power .
The semi-peace that followed turned out to be little more than a two - decade armistice .
We ’re talking here about “ the war to end all wars ” .
If only .
Destruction on a global scale
World War II put that “ I ” on the Great War and turned it into the First World War .
Twenty years later , when “ II ” arrived , the world was industrially and scientifically prepared for new levels of destruction .
WWII might be imagined as the extended paroxysm of violence on that few - mile strip of the Western Front scientifically intensified ( air power had begun to come into its own ) .
The destruction on the Western Front could now be imposed on whole countries ( Japan ) , whole continents ( Europe ) , expanses of space ( all of Russia from Moscow to the Polish border ) .
Where there had once been civilisation , little would be left but bodies , rubble , and human scarecrows striving to survive .
With the Nazi organisation of the Holocaust , even genocide would be industrialised and poison gas put to far more efficient use the second time around .
This was a form of “ globalisation ” though its true nature is seldom much considered when Americans highlight the experiences of the “ greatest generation ” .
And no wonder .
Except for those soldiers fighting and dying abroad , it was n’t experienced by Americans .
It ’s hard to believe now that , in 1945 , the European civilisation that had experienced a proud peace from 1871 - 1914 while dominating two - thirds of the planet lay in ruins .
It was the “ Third World War ” that took up almost the first half - century of my own life , and seemed to be coming to culmination in the Cuban missile crisis .
Had the logic of the previous wars been followed , war ’s destruction would have been exponentially upped once again .
The technology – A - and H - bombs , the air fleets to go with them , and of course nuclear - tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles – was certainly put in place to transform the whole planet into a version of those few miles of the Western Front , 1914 - 18 .
After a nuclear exchange between the superpowers , much of the world could well have been burnt to a crisp , and a global winter induced that might have sent us in the direction of the dinosaurs .
The logic of war ’s developing machinery seemed to be leading inexorably in just that direction .
Otherwise , how do you explain the way the US and the Soviet Union could not stop upgrading and adding to their nuclear arsenals until the US had about 30,000 weapons in the mid-1960s , and the Soviets about 40,000 in the 1980s .
It was as if the two powers were preparing for the destruction of many planets .
This is what World War III , whose name would have had to be given prospectively , might have meant ( and could still mean ) .
It was but a generation from the first flight of the Wright brothers to the 1,000 - bomber raid .
In 1903 , one fragile plane flies 120 feet .
In 1911 , an Italian lieutenant in an only slightly less fragile plane drops a bomb on an oasis in North Africa .
In 1944 and 1945 those 1,000 - plane air armadas take off to devastate German and Japanese cities .
On 6 August 1945 , all the power of those armadas is compacted into the belly of a lone B - 29 , the Enola Gay , which drops its single bomb on Hiroshima , destroying the city and many of its inhabitants .
Paul Tibbets , who piloted the Enola Gay , was born only 12 years after the first rudimentary plane took to the air .
And only seven years after Japan surrendered , the first H - bomb was tested .
The American ( half ) century
It was this world of war from which , in 1945 , the US emerged triumphant .
On a planet many of whose great cities were now rubble , a world of refugee camps and privation , a world destroyed , the US was untouched .
The world war had levelled all its rivals and made the US a powerhouse of economic expansion .
That war and the atomic bomb had ushered in a golden age of abundance and consumerism .
All the deferred dreams and desires of depression and wartime America – the washing machine , the TV set , the toaster , the automobile , the suburban house – were available to significant numbers of Americans .
The US military began to demobilise and the former troops returned not to rubble , but to new tract homes and GI Bill educations .
And yet all of this was shadowed by our own “ victory weapon ” , by the dark train of thought that led quickly to scenarios of our own destruction in newspapers and magazines , on the radio , in movies , and on TV , as well as in novels that took readers beyond the end of the world and into landscapes involving irradiated futures filled with mutants and survivalists .
The young found themselves plunged into a mordant , yet thrilling , world of “ triumphalist despair ” .
At the economic and governmental level , the 24/7 world of sunny consumerism merged with the 24/7 world of dark atomic alerts , of nuclear - armed planes ready to take off to obliterate the Soviets .
The peaceable giants of consumer production now doubled as the militarised giants of weapons production .
A military Keynesianism drove the US economy toward a consumerism in which desire for the ever - larger car and missile , electric range and tank , television console and atomic submarine was wedded in single corporate entities .
The companies – General Electric , General Motors and Westinghouse , among others – producing the icons of the home were also major contractors developing the weapons systems ushering the Pentagon into its own age of abundance .
In the 1950s it seemed natural for Charles Wilson , president of General Motors , to become secretary of defence in the Eisenhower administration , just as retiring generals and admirals found it natural to move into the employ of corporations they had only recently employed on the government ’s behalf .
Washington , headquarters of global abundance , was also transformed into a planetary military headquarters .
By 1957 , 200 generals and admirals as well as 1,300 colonels or naval officers of similar rank , retired or on leave , worked for civilian agencies , and military funding spilled over into a Congress that redirected its largesse to districts nationwide .
Think of all this as the beginning not so much of the American ( half ) Century , but of an American Age of Denial that lasted until 11 September 2001 , the day that “ changed everything . ”
Perhaps not “ everything ” , but it ’s clearer now just what the attacks of that day did change – and of just how terrible , how craven , but unsurprising the response to it was .
The dates 1945 - 2001 mark 56 years in which life was organised to safeguard Americans from an “ atomic Pearl Harbour ” from the thought that two great oceans were no longer protection enough for this continent , that the US was now part of a world capable of being laid low .
In those years , the sun of good fortune shone steadily on the US even as its newspapers began drawing concentric circles of destruction around American cities and imagining their future in ruins .
This is the shadow story of that era , like those memento mori skulls placed amid cornucopias in old Dutch still - life paintings .
In those decades , the “ arms race ” never abated , not even long after both superpowers had a superabundant ability to take each other out .
World - ending weaponry was being constantly “ perfected ” .
Nonetheless , Americans preferred most of the time not to think too much about “ the unthinkable ” and what it meant for them .
As the 1980s began , in a surge of revulsion at decades of denial , a vast anti-nuclear movement briefly arose – in 1982 , three - quarters of a million people marched against such weaponry in New York City – and President Ronald Reagan responded with his lucrative ( for the weapons industry ) fantasy scheme of lofting into space an “ impermeable shield ” against nuclear weapons , his “ Star Wars ” programme .
And then , as startling as it was unexpected , in 1986 , in Reykjavik , Iceland , Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev almost made such a fantasy come true , not in space , but here on Earth .
They came to the brink of a genuine programme to move decisively down the path to the abolition of such weapons .
It was the most hopeful almost - moment of a terrible century , and it failed .
To the amazement , even disbelief , of official Washington , and thanks largely to Gorbachev , who consciously chose a path of non-violence , the USSR soon disappeared , and peaceably at that , after four decades of nuclear standoff in a fully garrisoned MAD ( mutually assured destruction ) world .
You could measure the era of denial up to that moment both by the level of official resistance to recognising this obvious fact and by the audible sigh of relief in this country .
Finally , it was all over .
It was called “ victory ” , though it would prove anything but .
Anti-nuclear movement
And only then did the MADness really begin .
Though there was in the US modest muttering about a “ peace dividend , ” the idea of “ peace ” never caught hold .
The thousands of weapons in the US nuclear arsenal , whose existence should have been an embarrassing reminder of the Age of Denial , were pushed further into the shadows and ignored or forgotten .
Initially assigned no other tasks , they were placed in strategic limbo and went unmentioned for years .
It was clear by the century ’s end that the “ peace dividend ” would go largely to the Pentagon .
At the moment when the US might have accepted its own long - term vulnerability and begun working toward a world in which destruction was less obviously on the agenda , the US government instead embarked , like the greatest of Great Powers , on a series of neocolonial wars on the peripheries .
It began building up a constellation of new military bases in and around the oil heartlands of the planet , while reinforcing a military and technological might meant to brook no future opponents .
Orwell ’s phrase from his novel 1984 , “ war is peace ” , was operative well before the second Bush administration entered office .
With only one superpower left , the American Age of Denial did n’t dissipate .
It only deepened and any serious assessment of the real planet we were all living on was avoided .
In these years , the world was declared to be “ flat ” and , on that “ level playing field ” , it was gloriously globalising .
This official Age of Globalisation was proclaimed another sunny era of wonder and abundance .
Everyone on the planet would now wear Air Jordan sneakers and Mickey Mouse T - shirts , eat under the Golden Arches , and be bombarded with “ information ” .
News was circling the planet almost instantaneously in this self - proclaimed Age of Information .
But with the Soviet Union in the trash bin of history – forget that Russia , about to become a major energy power , still held on to its nuclear forces – and the planet , including the former Soviet territories in eastern Europe and central Asia open to “ globalising ” penetration , few bothered to mention that other nexus of forces which had globalised in the previous century : the forces of planetary destruction .
And Americans ?
Do n’t think that George W Bush was the first to urge us to “ sacrifice ” by spending our money and visiting Disney World .
That was the story of the 1990s and it represented the deepest of all denials .
If the world was flat , then why shouldnwe drive blissfully right off its edge ?
The SUV , the subprime mortgage , the McMansion in the distant suburb , the 100 - mile commute to work .
. . we did it .
We paid the price .
And while we were burning oil and spending money we often did n’t have , “ globalisation ” was slowly making its way to the impoverished backlands of Afghanistan .
This brings us almost to our own moment .
To the neocons , putting on their pith helmets and planning their Project for the New American Century , the only force that really mattered in the world was the US military , which would rule the day , and the Bush administration , initially made up of so many of them , agreed .
This would prove to be one of the great misreadings of the nature of power in our world .
Let me make our own dim and dismal moment short and sweet .
On 11 September 2001 the Age of Denial ended in the vast cloud of ash of the World Trade Centre .
Within 24 hours , the site where the towers had gone down was declared to be Ground Zero , a term previously reserved for an atomic explosion .
No city , continent , or planet had been vaporised , but for Americans , secretly waiting all those decades for their “ victory weapon ” to come home , it briefly looked that way .
The shock of discovering for the first time and in a gut way that the continental US , too , could be at some planetary epicentre of destruction was immense .
In the media , apocalyptic moments – anthrax , plagues , dirty bombs – multiplied and most Americans , still safe in their homes , hunkered down in fear to await doom - laden scenarios that would never happen .
Other encroaching realities , ranging from America ’s “ oil addiction ” to climate change , would continue to be ignored .
In the US this was the real inconvenient truth of these years .
The response to 9/11 was striking and craven in the extreme .
Although the Bush administration ’s Global War on Terror has been pictured many ways , it has never been seen for what it may have been : a desperate and fierce rearguard action to extend the American Age of Denial .
We would show our confidence in the American system by acting as though nothing had happened .
As “ commander - in - chief ” , Bush would wall us in and fight a “ global war ” to stave off the forces threatening us .
That war would be on their soil , not ours , forever and ever , amen .
The motto of the Bush administration might have been : pay any price .
Others , that is , would pay any price – disappearance , torture , false imprisonment , death by air and land – for us to remain in denial .
A disastrous “ war ” on terrorism , along with sub-wars , dubbed “ fronts ” , in Iraq and Afghanistan , would be pursued to impose our continuing Age of Denial by force on the rest of the planet ( and soften the costs of our addiction to oil ) .
This was to be the new Pax Americana , a shock - and - awe “ crusade ” launched in the name of US “ safety ” and “ national security ” .
Almost eight years later , these remain the idols to which American politicians , the media , and many citizens continue to do frightened obeisance .
The message of 9/11 was clear enough .
Here is the future of the US ; you are about to become part of the painful , modern history of this planet .
And the irony was this : the fiercer the response and the more we tried to force the cost of denial of this central reality on others , the faster history seemed to approach .
Mr. McCain ’s once easygoing if irreverent campaign presence  endearing to crowds , though often the kind of undisciplined excursions that landed him in the gaffe doghouse  has been put out to pasture .
He takes far fewer chances , meaning there are fewer risqué jokes , zingers at a familiar face in the crowd , provocative observations on policy or politics , or exercises in self - derogatory humor .
By every appearance , this Mr. McCain is , or at least is struggling to be , disciplined and on message in a way befitting of American politics today , if not quite befitting of the McCain of yesterday .
There may be a price for all this .
After his running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , riveted the overflow crowd for 16 minutes on Tuesday at an airplane hangar here , it was Mr. McCain ’s turn , and people in his audience began murmuring and drifting away midway through a 14 - minute speech that was flat and cheerless .
When Mr. McCain made his first appearance without Ms. Palin , on Monday morning in Jacksonville , Fla. , he faced an arena that was one - quarter full .
Still , it is the course Mr. McCain has chosen and one his aides say he will stay on .
To a certain extent , Mr. McCain , of Arizona , is grappling with the fact that he is now a general election candidate in an environment where , more than ever , the other side ( or reporters who are following him ) is ready to seize on any slip - up , real or imagined .
This is no time for the idle remark , bout of frankness or edgy humor that once stood Mr. McCain apart on the candidate field .
And what voters are seeing in these final weeks of the campaign is a deliberately retooled version of Mr. McCain  what he says , how he says it and how he goes about the day - to - day steps of campaigning .
It came about as part of a fundamental reordering of his campaign that resulted from the ascension of the hard - driving , disciplined Steve Schmidt , a senior campaign adviser and veteran of President Bush ’s 2004 campaign , who popped up on Mr. McCain ’s plane one day this week .
Mr. McCain is by all appearances struggling to stick to his script and avoiding , whenever possible , events that his campaign cannot control .
The flexible barrier functionality that was previously restricted to ForkJoinTasks ( in class forkjoin .
TaskBarrier ) is being redone as class Phaser ( targeted for j.u.c , not j.u.c.forkjoin ) , that can be applied in all kinds of tasks .
The [ java.util.concurrent ]
CyclicBarrier class supports periodic barrier synchronization among a set of threads .
Unlike Phasers , however , CyclicBarriers do not support the dynamic addition or removal of threads ; nor do they support one - way synchronization or split - phase operation .
Performance results obtained from a portable implementation of phasers on three different SMP platforms demonstrate that they can deliver superior performance to existing barrier implementations , in addition to the productivity benefits that result from their generality and safety properties .
Comments and suggestions are very welcome as always .
The API is likely to change a bit as we scope out further uses , and also , hopefully , stumble upon some better method names .
Doug Lea , the spec lead of the JSR 166 concurrency utilities , posted on the 166y concurrency - interest mailing list this week regarding a new feature being introduced into JSR - 166y : Phasers .
The ' Phaser ' concept and name was coined in this whitepaper by a team at Rice University .
The name comes from the construct 's phase - ordering and deadlock - avoidance properties .
The whitepaper explains several details of the phaser concept .
When comparing phasers to existing Java features , it is explained that similar functionality to the CyclicBarrier class is supported ( introduced in Java 5 ) , but phasers are inherently more flexible :
One of the main motivators for exploring additional barrier implementations was not just to have increased flexibility , but also to increase performance and scalability of the barrier synchronization concept :
As mentioned by Doug Lea , the implementation of Phaser for JSR - 166y is being adapted from facilities in the existing fork / join framework implementation .
The fork / join framework is something that InfoQ has covered before on multiple occasions , and is one of the central features in the upcoming 166y JSR - it is also the subject of a whitepaper by Doug Lea that describes the purpose and usage of the framework .
The TaskBarrier class mentioned above was used by the fork / join framework to manage the boundaries between the various tasks , and merge their results ; in other words : to join the tasks .
draft Javadoc for the Phaser class in JSR - 166y is available .
Lea made it clear in his email to the interest list that this was still a draft :
It is currently expected that JSR - 166y will be included as part of Java 7 .
Of all the pundits ' and politicos ' stated opinions on Sarah Palin , John McCain 's spectacularly curious choice for running mate , this is perhaps the most stirring and urgent .
Once celebrated , now mourned actress Lindsay Lohan — she of the former cocaine problems and current lesbianism — has posted yet another blog post on her MySpace page , this one exploring the nuances of political life versus private life .
Hands off little Bristol Palin 's baby issues , she implores :
I 've been watching the news all morning , like everyone else - and i keep hearing about the issues related to ' teen pregnancy ' -
It 's all related to Sarah Palin and her 17 year old unmarried pregnant daughter .
Well , I think the real problem comes from the fact that we are taking the focus off of getting to know Sarah Palin and her political views , and what she can do to make our country a less destructive place .
Its distracting from the real issues , the real everyday problems that this country experiences .
I am concerned with the fact that Sarah Palin brought the attention to her daughter 's pregnancy , rather than all world issues and what she believes she could possibly do to change them - if elected .
I get Sarah Palin 's views against abortion , but i would much prefer to hear more about what she can do for our country rather than how her daughter is going to have a child no matter what .
She continues on in vague , rambling fashion , making some kind of argument about parents teaching kids about sex and proficiently spelling not only Joe Biden 's name , but also Barack Obama 's correctly .
Whichever assistant she had type this up sure did study social studies in sixth grade !
And the commenters ( surely the most important voices of approval on this internet ) are supportive :
WOW !
Brilliant .
And thank you for sharing some wonderful insights
You never cease to amaze ...
Standing Ovation Mz. Lohan ! :)

Scoring ist den meisten Deutschen kein Begriff .
Dabei entscheidet der Score - Wert an vielen Stellen darüber , was wir uns leisten können .
Die Zahl , die beim scoring ermittelt wird , soll ausdrücken , mit welcher Wahrscheinlichkeit ein Kunde einen Kredit zurückzahlt - oder seine Handyrechnung begleicht .
Dieter Korczak hat im Auftrag des Bundesverbandes Verbraucherzentrale Scoring - Verfahren getestet .
" Scoring - Verfahren können ja direkte Konsequenzen haben , weil sie zu höheren Preisen für die Betroffenen führen , und in der Regel gilt dann :
The poor pay more , also dieser amerikanische Spruch , dass die Armen mehr bezahlen , und das ist de facto auch so . "
Die meisten Verbraucher wissen nicht , dass sie täglich bei fast jedem Vertragsabschluss - also auch beim simplen Einkaufen - gerastert und in Schubladen gesteckt werden .
Scoring ist ein automatisiertes und mathematisch kompliziertes Verfahren , in das viele Faktoren einfließen - verdeckt , denn transparent wird das keineswegs gemacht .
Rena Tangens , unabhängige Datenschützerin beim Bielefelder Verein FoeBuD :
" In Deutschland existiert von jedem Menschen ein Score - Wert , egal , ob der stimmt oder nicht oder aufgrund welcher Daten der errechnet wurde , und die Folgen für die einzelnen Menschen bestehen darin , dass sie aufgrund dieser Daten beurteilt werden , also es ist so was wie ein automatisiertes Vorurteilssystem .
Sie werden nicht aufgrund von Wahrheit oder aufgrund ihres derzeitigen Verhaltens beurteilt , sondern aufgrund von Daten aus der Vergangenheit wird ein Urteil über sie gefällt . "
Oder aufgrund von Umständen , die nichts mit dem bisherigen Verhalten eines Kunden zu tun haben : Alter , Geschlecht , Familienstand und Adresse .
Denn neben den " harten " Daten : welches Einkommen hat jemand , hat er Schulden - greifen viele Auskunfteien auch auf die zweitbesten Daten zurück :
Auf das so genannte Geo-Scoring , auf Daten , die sich aus der Wohnsituation des Antragstellers ergeben .
Neubau - oder Altbaugegend , wenig oder viele Ausländer , Studenten oder alte Leute als Nachbarn - all das sind " weiche " Merkmale , die den eigenen Score - Wert beeinflussen können .
Datenschützer sagen : Menschen in den neuen Bundesländern haben per se schlechtere Scoring - Karten als Verbraucher im Westen Deutschlands .
Peter Schaar , der Bundesdatenschutz - Beauftragte :
" Ein Arzt beispielsweise , der seine Praxis in Berlin - Neukölln eröffnet , hat dann plötzlich einen schlechteren Score - Wert und bekommt dann keinen Kredit .
Er muss für seinen Handyvertrag mehr zahlen , als wenn er in Berlin - Steglitz wohnen würde oder in Hamburg - Blankenese . "
In letzter Konsequenz , so fürchtet Schaar , könnten ganze Stadtteile abgehängt werden ; denn der Arzt , der in einem problematischen Bezirk eine Praxis eröffnen möchte , wird sich das bei schlechten Kreditkonditionen zweimal überlegen oder dort zumindest nicht wohnen .
Was aber sagt es beispielsweise über die Bonität eines Kreditnehmers aus , wenn er zwei Häuser entfernt wohnt von einem hoch verschuldeten Glücksspieler ?
Oder wenn er eine Automarke fährt , die unter säumigen Schuldnern besonders verbreitet ist ?
Pech gehabt !
Das alles kann den Score - Wert drücken .
Wer schlecht weg kommt bei der Bonitätsprüfung , der dürfte beim Waschmaschinenkauf nur schwer einen Ratenvertrag kriegen , und Versandunternehmen liefern auch nur gegen Vorkasse .
Bevor Rainer Neumann 1977 seinen ersten Kredit für ein Auto bekam , war ein - nach eigenen Angaben - quälend langes Verhandlungsgespräch nötig .
Das Ganze wäre schneller gegangen , hätte der Autohändler über den damals 26 - jährigen Mathematiker eine Schufa - Auskunft eingeholt : Neumann war unbescholten und kreditwürdig .
Heute ist Rainer Neumann selbst Chef der Wiesbadener Schutzvereinigung für allgemeine Kreditsicherung , der bekanntesten Auskunftei Deutschlands - und damit einer der mächtigsten Männer im deutschen Datengeschäft .
" 50 Millionen mal im vergangenen Jahr haben wir eine Auskunft gegeben und mehr als 45 Millionen Mal , vielleicht 47 Millionen Mal , wurde der Verbraucher sofort durchgewunken und bekam einen Kredit , bekam ein Handy , bekam Ware auf Rechnung .
Und da , wo es nicht klappt , da wird man aufmerksam .
Das ist dann der Fall , wenn Negativdaten bei uns vorliegen und der Kreditgeber aufgrund der Daten den Kredit nicht gibt .
Das muss nicht immer so sein .
Also wenn alle Personen , die Negativdaten hätten , kein Handy hätten , dann hätten wir Hunderttausende Handys weniger . "
So versucht der Schufa - Chef die Brisanz seiner eigenen Daten herunterzuspielen .
4500 Unternehmen greifen auf sie zurück : nicht getilgte Kredite , unbezahlte Rechnungen , bei denen alle Mahnungen ins Leere liefen , gerichtliche Daten wie eidesstattliche Versicherungen , früher kurz : Offenbarungseid .
Ob jemand in einer gehobenen Lage oder einem sozial schwächeren Wohnort lebt , fließt nach Angaben Neumanns aber nicht in den Score - Wert ein , den die Schufa als Dienstleister für andere Firmen entwickelt .
Neumanns Unternehmen verwaltet Daten über praktisch jeden Deutschen , der über 18 Jahre alt ist .
Man möge Scoring , also das Herunterbrechen der Kreditwürdigkeit auf eine einzige Zahl , doch auch einmal positiv sehen , argumentiert er. Wenn der Banker nicht einschätzen könne , ob sein Kunde kreditwürdig sei , dann würden die Kredite für alle teurer oder die Bewilligung oder Ablehnung ziehe sich länger hin .
Damit gibt Neumann auch die Argumente des Bundesverbandes der Deutschen Banken wieder .
Dass arbeitslose oder nicht solvente Kunden keinen Kredit bekommen , könnte noch plausibel erscheinen .
Wozu aber eine Fülle von Informationen über jemanden sammeln , die mit seinem Zahlungsverhalten in der Vergangenheit nur lose in Zusammenhang stehen ?
Viele Auskunfteien verkaufen Score - Werte , in die weit mehr Merkmale einfließen als die , die in der Schufa - Auskunft auftauchen .
Verbraucher würden damit potentiell zu Opfern einer erhöhten statistischen Wahrscheinlichkeit , kritisieren Datenschützer .
" Es ist so , dass ein Kreditnehmer , wenn er einen Kredit haben will , in der Regel dreißig bis fünfzig Informationsmerkmale dem Kreditgeber geben muss , und dass der Kreditgeber darüber hinaus aus Quellen , die er noch dazuspielen kann , 150 bis 300 verschiedene Merkmale eines potentiellen Kreditnehmers bei der Kreditentscheidung berücksichtigt .
Und das ist etwas , was für jeden von uns völlig undurchsichtig ist .
Diese einzelnen Merkmale werden auch noch unterschiedlich gewichtet .
Diese Gewichtungsfaktoren sind auch völlig undurchsichtig , werden auch nicht offen gelegt , auch auf Nachfrage nicht offen gelegt , und es wird ein riesiger Aufwand an Data Mining , also an Datenschürfen betrieben , um zu irgend welchen Prozentwerten zu gelangen .
Die aber eigentlich mit der Fragestellung , ob jemand kreditwürdig ist oder nicht , nichts zu tun haben . "
Der Soziologe Dieter Korczak von der GP - Forschungsgruppe für Grundlagen - und Programmforschung in München muss es wissen .
Er hat das Scoring einem Praxistest unterzogen - im Auftrag des Dachverbandes der Verbraucherzentralen .
21 Testpersonen hat er losgeschickt in vier verschiedene Banken : Zahnarzthelferinnen , Ingenieure , Staatsbeamte .
Sie traten überall ähnlich auf , und ihre Kreditanfrage war überall die gleiche .
Das irritierende Ergebnis :
Ein und dieselbe Testperson wurde einmal als großes , ein anderes Mal als kleines Risiko eingestuft und bekam völlig unterschiedliche Angebote .
Seither glaubt Korczak : Statt sich auf Scoring zu verlassen , könnten Banken und Händler auch in die Kristallkugel schauen .
" Das Ergebnis ist eben , dass die Wissenschaftlichkeit oder das wissenschaftliche Zustandekommen dieser Scoring - Werte nicht belegt werden konnte .
Wir halten den Einsatz von Scoring - Verfahren nach wie vor für eine Luftnummer .
Das Einzige , was dort einwandfrei ist , ist die Anwendung von mathematischen Verfahren , das heißt aber noch lange nicht , dass das Scoring wissenschaftlich ist . "
Denn wie die einzelnen Faktoren gewichtet werden , das bleibt bislang das Geheimnis der Firmen , die die Kundenprofile erstellen .
Die Unternehmen kreieren ihren eigenen Mix .
Zu einer Offenlegung sind sie nicht verpflichtet .
Bei den Verbraucher - und Datenschutzstellen beschweren sich Kunden vor allem darüber , dass niemand ihnen nachvollziehbar erklärt , was ihnen eigentlich zur Last gelegt wird .
Korczak : " Es gibt solche Absurditäten und Absonderlichkeiten , dass zum Beispiel ein Staatsbeamter , ein Regierungsrat im Alter von 55 Jahren , der zwei Leasingverträge für Autos laufen hat und die auch von den Leasingraten her regelmäßig bedient hat , also ein völlig einwandfreier solventer Kunde , keinen Kredit bekommt , weil die Scoring - Verfahren und die Banken , die diese nutzen , nur sehen : Dieser Mann hat zwei Kredite und dann sagt natürlich die Bank , bei der er einen neuen Kredit anfragt : Dieser Mann ist schon so belastet mit Kreditrückzahlungen , dem können wir keinen neuen geben . "
In vielen Fällen , beklagt Deutschlands oberster Datenschützer Peter Schaar , entscheidet nicht mehr ein Mensch , wer kreditwürdig ist , sondern ein Computer .
Das deckt sich mit den Erkenntnissen von Dieter Korczak :
" Das Erstaunliche ist , dass selbst wenn Bankkredit - Sachbearbeiter auf diesen Umstand hingewiesen werden , sie nicht in der Lage sind , das computergenerierte Ergebnis zu korrigieren . "
Die Kreditsachbearbeiter wollen den berühmten " Nasen - Faktor ” ausschließen : Wenn mir Deine Nase nicht gefällt , kriegst Du keinen Kredit .
So aber wird der Computer zum deus ex machina , was er berechnet , führt zu einer automatischen Entscheidung , über die sich Kreditsachbearbeiter nur in den wenigsten Fällen hinwegsetzen .
Was vermeintlich objektiv ist , kann nach Ansicht von Datenschützern leicht ins Gegenteil umschlagen , warnt Deutschlands oberster Datenschützer Peter Schaar :
" Die Frage ist doch : Findet über Scoring gegebenenfalls eine bestimmte Form von Diskriminierung statt ?
Diskriminierung von bestimmten Personengruppen , eine Benachteiligung von Bewohnern bestimmter Stadtteile , eine Benachteiligung von Personen , die genau das machen , was auch die Bundesregierung verlangt - nämlich flexibel auf dem Arbeitsmarkt zu sein .
Das kann doch eigentlich nicht damit angestrebt werden . "
Scoring , so kritisieren Datenschützer und Experten , wird dann problematisch , wenn es an Merkmale anknüpft , die der Einzelne nicht oder kaum beeinflussen kann : an seine Herkunft , sein Geschlecht , seinen Wohnort .
Plausibel mag erscheinen , dass ein gut verdienender Manager zunächst einmal kreditwürdiger eingestuft wird als ein Fliesenleger .
Nicht einsehbar ist , dass ein Ausländer einen negativeren Score - Wert bekommt als ein Deutscher , nur deswegen , weil viele Ausländer hierzulande weniger verdienen als der Durchschnittsdeutsche .
Korczak : " Der Einsatz von Scoring - Verfahren dient letztlich nur dazu , dass höhere Preise erzielt werden können .
Wir haben das bei unserem Banken - Test festgestellt und ich denke , das gilt für alle anderen , wenn man tiefer drüber nachdenkt , genau so : Dass unabhängig von der tatsächlichen Leistungsfähigkeit eines Kreditnehmers oder eines potenziellen Kreditnehmers in unserem Fall ganz unterschiedliche Angebote von den Banken an diesen Kreditnehmer gerichtet worden sind , und die Abweichungen betrugen teilweise fünf Prozent . "
Fünf Prozent Zinsen mehr für einen Kredit - weil ein Kunde anhand von Daten , die er nicht kontrollieren kann , als Risiko eingestuft wird .
Warum reichen nicht ein Einkommensnachweis und sein Schufa - Eintrag ?
Die Unternehmen gehen ohnehin nur ein begrenztes Risiko ein .
Wer einen Kredit zwei Monate lang nicht tilgt , dem kann die Bank seinen Kredit unmittelbar aufkündigen .
Wer eine Wohnung mietet , muss eine Kaution hinterlegen , Banken nehmen den Kfz - Brief als Sicherheit für einen Autokredit .
Hausbesitzern droht die Zwangsversteigerung , wenn sie zweimal ihre Hypothekenrate nicht bezahlen .
Datenschützer erregen sich besonders darüber , dass Scoring mittlerweile in nahezu jedem Wirtschaftsbereich Einzug gehalten hat .
Der Kunde wird gläsern - nur er selbst merkt zunächst nichts davon .
Die anderen wissen viel besser Bescheid über ihn als er ahnt .
Korczak : " Ich finde , Kunden sollten nicht durchleuchtet werden .
Warum sollte ein Kunde durchleuchtet werden ?
Es geht um Vertragsbeziehungen .
Ein Kunde , ganz egal wohin er geht , ob er jetzt in den Supermarkt geht oder in ein Kaufhaus oder ob er eine Wohnung anmieten will oder einen Kredit haben will oder einen Handyvertrag abschließen will , dieser Kunde geht hin und will dieses Produkt oder diese Dienstleistung haben .
Und das einzige , was er nachweisen muss , ist , dass er die Zahlungsverpflichtungen , die er mit dem Vertragsabschluss eingeht , auch leisten kann . "
Dass die Kunden - Durchleuchtung den Datenschutz empfindlich beeinträchtigt , hat auch die Regierung erkannt .
Schon vor der Sommerpause hat das Kabinett einen Gesetzentwurf gebilligt , der das Scoring transparenter machen soll .
Verbraucher sollen demnach ab 2010 das Recht bekommen , zu erfahren , nach welchen Kriterien sie beurteilt wurden - warum sie also einen Kredit oder einen Vertrag bekommen haben oder nicht .
Schufa - Vorsitzender Rainer Neumann :
" Das Gesetz hat jetzt eine Idee der Banken aufgegriffen , dass man dem Verbraucher , wenn er möchte , erklärt , warum er einen Kredit nicht bekommt .
Und ich denke , aus unserer Sicht ist das ausreichend , wenn man dem Verbraucher häufig sehr schnell erklären kann , dass aufgrund seiner Einkommenssituation der Kredit nicht möglich ist . "
Dass sein Gehalt nicht reicht , wird sich ein Kunde im Zweifelsfall noch selbst ausrechnen können .
Was aber , wenn es komplizierter wird ?
Vorgaben , welche Daten gesammelt werden dürfen , macht das Gesetz nicht .
Wohndaten dürfen demnach weiterhin verwendet werden .
Und kein Kunde kann damit rechnen , Details und völlig transparente Begründungen zu erfahren .
Schufa - Chef Neumann gibt sich diplomatisch : Ja , jeder Bürger solle seine eigenen Daten einsehen , kommentieren und verändern können , aber bitte nur die Eckdaten , nicht die Feinheiten .
Das sei weltweit unüblich , argumentiert er. Ein völlig transparenter Score verliere an Wert , behauptet Neumann :
" Diese Dinge waren noch nie transparent und sind sinnvollerweise auch nicht transparent , weil Verträge schließen zwei Parteien und wir haben im Grundgesetz garantiert , dass man dem anderen nicht erklären muss , warum man bereit ist , einen Vertrag zu schließen oder nicht zu schließen . "
Doch diese Unzufriedenheit gibt es schon jetzt , und sie ist der Grund , warum Datenschützer sich mehr von der Datenschutzgesetz - Novelle erhofft haben .
Das Grundproblem bleibt auch nach der Gesetzesänderung voraussichtlich ungelöst : Das umstrittene Verfahren darf weiter auf breiter Front angewendet werden , das Recht auf einen wirksamen Einspruch ist nicht vorgesehen .
Der Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragte :
" Wo ich mir eine Nachbesserung wünschen würde , wäre auch noch mal die Frage , wo darf überhaupt eine Auskunftei eingeschaltet werden .
Da lässt das Gesetz die Interpretation zu , dass das eigentlich bei allen Gelegenheiten geschehen kann , wo irgend eine Art von vertraglichem Risiko da ist .
Da würde ich mir wünschen , dass das auf ein kreditorisches oder vergleichbares Risiko begrenzt wird . "
Und : Warum Scoring - Verfahren nicht endlich auf ihre Stichhaltigkeit prüfen ?
Schaar : " Ganz wichtig ist mir , dass es eine wissenschaftliche Verifikation eines solchen Scoring - Verfahrens gibt , das heißt dass mit wissenschaftlichen Methoden nachgewiesen werden kann , dass hier eine Relevanz für die entsprechende Entscheidung besteht und dass nicht irgendwelche Alchemisten irgendwelche Daten zusammenmischen mit der Behauptung , es würde dann die goldene Information entstehen .
Bekanntlich hat das ja bei den Alchemisten mit dem Gold - Machen auch nicht so gut geklappt . "
Dieter Korczak empfiehlt Testuntersuchungen wie bei Arzneimittelprüfungen :
Wie die Pharmaindustrie Medikamente testen muss , bevor sie sie einsetzen darf , sollten auch Scoring - Anbieter nachweisen müssen , dass ihre Datenkombinationen wirklich etwas über die Kreditwürdigkeit aussagen .
Welche Kreditnehmer haben ihre Kredite tatsächlich nicht zurückgezahlt , und welche Scoring - Verfahren haben das am besten vorhergesagt ?
Scoring - Verfahren , die nicht in 95 Prozent aller Fälle das Richtige vorhersagen , sollten vom Markt genommen werden .
Doch er hat Zweifel , ob es hier wirklich verlässliche Aussagen geben kann :
" Wir wissen aus anderen Untersuchungen , dass die Gründe , warum Haushalte oder Einzelpersonen ihre Kredite nicht zurückzahlen können , in der Regel außerhalb von Prognosefähigkeit liegen , denn es sind zwei Gründe , die überwiegen .
Der eine Grund ist das Eintreten von Arbeitslosigkeit , der andere ist das Eintreten einer Trennung oder Scheidung . "
So lange also Scoring aus Sicht vieler Experten diskriminierend sein kann und allzu oft dem Blick der Wahrsagerin in die Kristallkugel gleicht , bleibt nur eines : sparsam umzugehen mit den eigenen Daten .
Tangens : " Wenn Sie tatsächlich an einem Preisausschreiben teilnehmen , was sie nicht tun sollten , denn die sind explizit zum Adressensammeln da : mal angenommen , Sie füllen so etwas aus , dann füllen Sie bitte nicht das Geburtsdatum aus .
Denn was hat das Geburtsdatum mit Ihrem Wunsch , eine Reise in die Karibik zu gewinnen , zu tun ? "
Schaar : " So , wie man auch ansonsten nicht irgendwelchen Fremden , denen man auf der Straße begegnet , alles Mögliche gegenüber ausbreiten sollte , sollte man auch am Telefon oder im Internet etwas diskreter sein . "
As of Nov 15th , 2012 , I have decided to shut down MyBikelane .
This has always been a side project , and unfortunately I do not have time to properly maintain the site or the service .
It has been amazing to see the army of cyclists worldwide fill this site every day , and I have been blown away by how much this service took off .
When I started this project out of frustration as an urban cyclist , I never thought I would see so many people contribute .
Thank you all .
Bike safe !
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran plans to send a manned rocket into space in the next 10 years , state television reported on Thursday , just days after the Islamic Republic announced it had put a dummy satellite into orbit .
An artist 's concept depicts the distant dwarf planet known as Eris on June 14 , 2007 .
REUTERS / NASA -JPL / Caltech / Handout
Embroiled in a standoff with the West over its nuclear ambitions , Iran said on Sunday it had put a dummy satellite into orbit on a home - grown rocket for the first time .
U.S. security officials said Tehran ’s attempted satellite launch was a failure that fell short of claimed successes , but an analyst said the test marked a technical advance for Iran .
The long - range ballistic technology used to put satellites into space can also be used for launching weapons .
Iran says it has no such intention .
The West accuses Iran of seeking to build a nuclear warhead , a charge Tehran denies , insisting its nuclear ambitions are aimed at generating electricity so it that it can export more of its massive oil and gas reserves .
“ One of the aims of Iran ’s 10 - year space program is to send a manned rocket into space , ” state television quoted Reza Taghipour , the head of Iran ’s aerospace organization , as saying .
“ Within in the next six months to one year , the exact date of this mission will be determined , ” he added .
Taghipour said Iran would cooperate with Islamic countries in building a satellite that television said would be called , Besharat , meaning ‘ good news ’ .
He also said Iran was working with Russia and other Asian states to launch another satellite .
U.S. officials said the vehicle which Iran said on Sunday had delivered a dummy satellite into space failed shortly after lift off and did not reach its intended position .
But Charles Vick , a senior analyst for GlobalSecurity.org research group , said Iran appeared to have succeeded in igniting the second stage of its booster rocket and gained data that will help it perfect its launch system .
When asked about climate change at the vice - presidential debate , Gov. Sarah Palin said , “ I do n’t want to argue about the causes .
What I want to argue about is , how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts ? ”
Generally speaking , if we do n’t know what the cause of a given problem is , but we know there is indeed a problem , how do we devise a strategy capable of adequately addressing it ?
Or , in the words of Gov. Palin , “ … how are we going to get there to positively affect the impact ” ( whatever that means ) .
In Thursday night ’s much - ballyhooed vice - presidential debate , the issue of climate change received a bit of attention , but neither candidate was really pushed to develop their statements much beyond their original answers ( Biden on his recent comment in a rope - line that the Obama - Biden ticket did n’t support clean coal and Palin on her waffling position on the causes of climate change ) .
But the format did n’t really allow for deeper exploration either .
>> More on the vice - presidential debate at RG&B
What troubles me about Gov. Palin ’s thoughts about climate change is that she often says something along the lines of , “ I ’m not one for believing that man ’s actions are entirely responsible for global warming . ”
But even if the governor does n’t give much credence to the anthropogenic causes of global warming , she still has n’t offered any solutions to mitigating it ( i.e Bjorn Lomborg - type solutions ) .
I have two immediate reactions Governor Palin ’s position on climate change :
Most climate scientists do not argue that human activity is entirely responsible for a changing climate .
Where does Gov. Palin get her science that allows her to make such internally - derived claims ?
Obama , McCain and Biden have supported legislation to limit climate - warming carbon emissions , and on Thursday , Palin said she too favored this , although her admission came at the very end of then answer to moderator Ifill ’s question about carbon caps .
Somehow , Gov. Palin also linked increased domestic oil production to the fight against global warming .
In fact , she ’s already warned that we ’d be in a “ world of hurt ” if we do n’t step up domestic drilling .
“ As we rely more and more on other countries that do n’t care as much about the climate as we do , we ’re allowing them to produce and to emit and even pollute more than America would ever stand for , ” she said , when talking about reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
Since Governor Palin reads all of the newspapers , or at least the ones that are put in front of her , and since she spread her academic adventure across six institutions in the American West , I suppose I am simply to believe she has got it all figured out .
Or not .
What do you all think ?
How important is it that we know the causes of climate change , or the degree to which they are anthropogenic ?

Britain ’s top diplomat in Kabul thinks Afghanistan is crumbling so fast , said Mark Hosenball and Michael Isikoff in Newsweek , that it might take an “ acceptable dictator ” to keep it out of the hands of extremists .
The assessment , revealed in a leaked diplomatic cable published in a French newspaper , “ cast doubt on the conventional wisdom in Washington ” that more U.S. and NATO troops can put down “ the alarming Taliban resurgence . ”
An “ Iraq - like surge ” might not “ be enough to end the war , ” said Greg Bruno in the Council on Foreign Relations ’
Web site , and it might not “ win over an increasly frustrated Afghan public . ”
But “ more boots on the ground could help restore order , at least temporarily , ” so it ’s worth a shot .
It ’s hard to see how we ’d pay for another Iraq - like surge , said Trudy Rubin in the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette .
And even if the U.S. can muster enough troops to make a difference , the financial crisis will make it hard for us to scrape together reconstruction funds that will be “ as important as military action in stabilizing Afghanistan and Pakistan . ”
Maybe we need to set our goals lower , said Matthew Yglesias in Think Progress .
If it has become unrealistic to expect that we can leave behind a stable central government there , maybe we should be satisfied with just making sure that we can keep portions of the country from being used for terrorist operations against the United States .
Get your electoral crack here .
Nate Silver comments :
There are three states in which early voting has already exceeded its totals from 2004 .
These are Georgia , where early voting is already at 180 percent of its 2004 total , Louisiana ( 169 percent ) , and North Carolina ( 129 percent ) .
Hmm ... can anybody think of something that those three states have in common ?
Remember when we were all surprised when the 2004 vote totals came in above the exit polls ?
Rove found a cache of new voters who swamped the model .
Could this be happening in reverse ?

Here ’s an interesting way to attract players to your game ’s open beta .
Publisher GamesCampus has introduced The Guaranteed Fun Promotion for their upcoming fantasy MMORPG Asda Story .
This program states that if players trir the open beta that starts tomorrow and are n't “ satisfied with their Asda Story game experience , ” that they can then request a $ 30 PayPal payment .
" We are just asking you to invest your time in playing our game , and if after playing for 30 days you do n't feel it has been the great game experience we feel it to be , we want to hear your feedback and we 'll give you $ 30.00 .
It is as simple as that , ” stated vice president of marketing and business development David Chang while nervously clutching his checkbook .
It is n’t quite as simple as just downloading the client and playing it for five minutes , of course .
Players will need to have reached level 40 by September 4 , and then complete a survey about what they did n’t like between September 5 and September 7 .
There ’s also a maximum of 1,500 players that can claim the cash , so GamesCampus will be out $ 45,000 at the most .
Will this promotion entice you to give Asda Story a try , or are there just too many hoops to jump through to reach that sweet , sweet money ?
San Jose , Calif . ( August 4 , 2008 ) - San Jose - based online game publisher , Gamescampus.com ( www.gamescampus.com, run by OnNet USA ) , announced today it will begin the open beta test for its newest game , Asda Story , tomorrow , August 5th , 2008 at 9:00 PM Pacific Standard Time .
With the start of the open beta test the company has also announced a special new program for players of the game - The Guaranteed Fun Promotion .
The company is certain that players will be satisfied with their Asda Story game experience , so much so , that they are staking money on it .
Any player who signs up for and plays the game ( for
free ) for 30 days and is n't satisfied with their experience can ask the company to pay them $ 30 USD .
For the full details visit http://asdastory.gamescampus.com/event/fun.html.
The open beta session will commence on August 5 , 2008 at 9:00 PM PST and will run through late August at which point the game will officially launch .
Gamers are invited to join the open beta by going to the official website at www.asdastory.gamescampus.com where they can create an account and sign up to participate .
" We chose to bring this game to the west because we believe in its potential .
The Guaranteed Fun Promotion is our way of showing our belief in the game and is even better than a money - back guarantee because you do n't have to spend a penny to play Asda Story , " said David Chang , Executive Vice President of Marketing and Business Development for Gamescampus.com .
" We are just asking you to invest your time in playing our game , and if after playing for 30 days you do n't feel it has been the great game experience we feel it to be , we want to hear your feedback and we 'll give you $ 30.00 .
It is as simple as that . "
In order to ensure players have spent enough time with the game , players must reach level Level 40 by September 4th , 2008 to qualify for the program .
Again full details for the program can be found here http://asdastory.gamescampus.com/event/fun.html.
The open beta for Asda Story will also be celebrated with many other in - game events that are detailed on the Asda Story site .
With the Guaranteed Fun Promotion and in - game events players will have a lot of exciting reasons to be one of the first players to try the game .
Based on a colorful , bright and cheerful world , Asda Story is a free to play exciting fantasy - style anime 3D MMORPG game that features a unique ' Soul Mate System . '
The unique party system offers two players the ability to align to become ' soul mates ' and allows them to wear unique costumes and use special skills .
Another key feature of the game is the ' Real Costume System , ' which gives players some of the most extensive personalization and design options ever seen in an MMORPG .
Both unique systems ( ' Soul Mate System ' and ' Real Costume System ' ) were credited for helping to generate a high female user ratio for Asda Story ( more than 20 % of the total players are female ) when launched in Korea and Japan .
With these systems , players are able to personalize the design of their items and make the look of their characters stand out .
Gamescampus.com is expecting to see similar ratios with females for the launch of Asda Story in the United States .

I did some further research , after posting a previous article on cellphones , and it appears that there is a legal caveat to automatically dialing cellphones .
This caveat comes in the form of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 which in section ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ( iii ) states that it is unlawful to make a call using an autodialer or prerecorded voice to any telephone number assigned to a cellular telephone service .
Sounds hopeless , but in ( b ) ( 2 ) ( C ) an exemption is detailed :
( C ) may , by rule or order , exempt from the requirements of paragraph ( 1 ) ( A ) ( iii ) of this subsection calls to a telephone number assigned to a cellular telephone service that are not charged to the called party , subject to such conditions as the Commission may prescribe as necessary in the interest of the privacy rights this section is intended to protect ;
This exemption clearly shows that it is not illegal to include cellphones in a random sample so long as the service provider of the randomized number is known .
A quick google search reveals that such a thing is possible .
ReverseGenie runs a service that allows a user to enter a phone number , and returns the service provider along with a boat load of other information ; the service is $ 40 a year and allows for an unlimited number lookups .
Using this service , or a similar technology would clearly allow a pollster to sift out the numbers they cannot legally dial from a randomized set .
Whether pollsters do this once they have a randomized set is unknown ( SurveyUSA uses a phone number provider that does include cellphones ) , but if they take the time to ensure they are not autodialing a hospital ( which is illegal and must be done ) they likely also have the ability to check the service provider .
I called Rasmussen Reports and asked : " Are cell phones included in your random samples ? "
The response : " No . "
I next called Quinnipiac University and asked the same question .
Their response : " The numbers are randomly generated and through that course cell phones are occasionally called .
When this happens , the respondent 's number is removed from the pool of available numbers . "
This was a very curious response because Quinnipiac University does not use an autodialer and could therefore legally talk to the respondent , but ultimately they seek to only include landlines in their polling samples .
I 'm still in the process of contacting other pollsters to determine whether cell phones are included in their samples .
Franken pulls ahead in new Minn. poll
A new Star Tribune Minnesota poll released yesterday shows a 13 - point jump in support in the last month for Democratic comedian - turned - politician Al Franken , who 's now taken his first clear lead , 43 percent to 34 percent , in the much - watched race against Minnesota incumbent Republican Sen. Norm Coleman .
The Star Tribune poll also shows support for the relatively low - profile campaign of Independence Party candidate Dean Barkley at a high watermark of 18 percent , with most of his support drawn from Coleman , in what may be an indication of local unhappiness with Washington in general and Republicans in particular .
Franken continues to lead Coleman , though , in a hypothetical two - candidate matchup .

Two trends seem to be contributing to Franken 's lead in the Star Tribune poll , which also showed Coleman 's job - approval rating at a new low of 38 percent .
In what 's been a fiercely contested campaign , Coleman has taken heat for the tenor of his advertising , with 56 percent of respondents seeing ads aimed at Franken as “ mostly unfair personal attacks , ” while just 42 percent said the same about those aimed at Coleman .
The poll also found Democrats have opened a substantial lead in party identification , with 42 percent of likely voters self - identifying as Democrats , compared with just 26 percent self - identifying as Republicans .
The poll 's results contrast starkly with the SurveyUSA poll conducted for local station KSTP - TV last week , which shows Coleman up 43 percent to 33 percent , a 10 - point improvement for the Republican since their last poll three weeks ago .
A separate new SurveyUSA poll shows McCain with a 1 - point edge in Minnesota , while the RealClearPolitics polling average shows Obama with a 5 - point advantage .

So a little while back , John McCain made an ill - advised crack about planetaria ( that 's the plural of planetarium ) , calling them " foolishness " .
It was ill advised because it raised the hackles of lots of science - loving folks , including those who want to -- gasp , horror ! -- educate kids about astronomy and science .
At the time I suspected it was just a wedge in which to attack Barack Obama , but his use of the word foolishness really caught my attention .
I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt , but does he really dislike such things ?
Well , last night removed any doubt , when McCain -- twice -- used Obama 's requested earmark of three million dollars for Adler planetarium as a bludgeon , trying to pin Obama as another pork - barrel politician .
He disdainfully said the money was for an " overhead projector " .
Those are his exact words .
Here 's what he said :
While we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks he [ Senator Obama , or " that one " ] voted for nearly $ 1 billion in pork barrel earmark projects .
Including $ 3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago , Illinois .
My friends , do we need to spend that kind of money ?
Well , shock of shocks -- it turns out McCain 's characterization of this was all wrong .
In fact , I would call it a lie .
He knows it was n't for an overhead projector , a piece of classroom equipment that costs a couple of hundred dollars .
That money was for Adler 's Zeiss Mark VI star projector : a venerable piece of precision fabricated equipment that projects the stars , constellations , and other objects inside the planetarium dome .
Adler 's Zeiss is 40 years old , and desperately needs replacing .
These machines are pricey , and replacing them difficult .
Adler needed money to do this .
They asked local politicians , and eventually were able to get a request in a budget submitted by Obama .
However , Obama never even voted on that budget , and Adler never got that money -- thus making , again , McCain a liar .
Needless to say , Adler was n't thrilled with this characterization of their beloved Zeiss .
They issued a statement to that effect .
You can also get opinions all over the place : Universe Today , SpaceWriter , Davin Flateau , Discovery Space , Wonkette , the Chicago Tribune , even NPR .
I have posted about this before ( just last night , in fact ) .
The comments on my statements have been all over the place , from support to some fairly ridiculous complaints .
My favorites have involved something along the line of , " Where in the Constitution does it say the federal government has to send money to planetaria ? "
Good question .
But where does it say the government will repair roads , provide clean water , create public schools , fund the space program ?
Look : there are some things the government does for the greater good .
This is where libertarians and I part company .
Government is n't always bad .
In many cases , it takes the money it gets in taxes and does fantastic things with it , like sending probes to Mercury and funding autism research .
It makes the roads drivable , and makes sure companies do n't pollute our air ( well , it used to do that ) .
You can complain all you want that earmarks get abused -- and they certainly do -- but they also get used to fund projects that are starved for cash , and that richly deserve to have life breathed into them .
I disagree with McCain here as well .
He wants no earmarks at all .
I think that 's ridiculous .
It would be far better to have regulation of them , instead of the laissez - faire attitude the government has now .
Or , if not overt regulation , some sort of throttle on them , instead of them being free passes to bridges to nowhere .
And finally , I want to reiterate what I said in my first post on this topic : I love planetaria .
Love love love .
They educate kids .
That is among the finest and most honorable goals anyone can have .
People who work at planetaria across the country and the world do it because they love it .
They do n't get rich doing it , they do n't get fame doing it , they hardly even get accolades doing it .
But we owe so much to them !
Kids learn in planetaria -- and not just about the stars over their heads on a given night ; planetaria are evolving into the digital age , bringing incredible programs to the public ( I know what I 'm talking about here ) .
And it 's not even just astronomy .
The projectors can give all kinds of lessons : biology , history , local lore ... anything you can create digitally can be projected in a planetarium , and kids can learn .
For McCain to use this as a political zinger is insulting , and for him to call it foolishness is beyond the pale .
The honorable thing for him to do now is to admit he was wrong , admit he mischaracterized both the planetarium and Obama 's stance , and then issue a public apology to planetarians and science - lovers across the country .
The next debate is in one week .
I bet a lot more pro-science folks will be watching , too .
Closely .
PIPERSVILLE , Pennsylvania ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain got a new campaign plane on Monday with one apparently unexpected surprise : his name is on the side .
The Arizona senator , who has wrapped up his party ’s White House nomination , dubbed his new in - air home the “ Straight Talk Express ” after his campaign bus of the same name , so - called for the senator ’s tendency to speak his mind .
The bus , where the candidate dishes with reporters over policy and politics , is a key part of the 71 - year - old ’s political brand .
So is his name , of course , but McCain expressed surprise when reporters riding with him mentioned it being emblazoned across the Boeing 737-400 .
“ Really ?
Is it ? ” McCain said after the flight .
“ I thought it just says Straight Talk Express . ”

Assured that his name also adorned the plane , McCain described how it felt : “ Whoops !
I feel wonderful , ” he said .
“ Maybe it ’s a little added free publicity , I do n’t know , at various airports . ”
Presidential nominees usually get a plane with their names and campaign slogans before the general election .
McCain had previously flown on a charter aircraft operated by JetBlue .
The new plane features two phones , a fax machine , and power outlets for electricity - hungry laptops .
So what ’s missing ?
Television screens .
“ I like it fine , ” McCain said of the plane .
“ ( But ) in the interest of full disclosure , you know we used to have television sets on JetBlue , and I miss out on my fix , particularly when we ’re on these long flights . ”
WASHINGTON --
As the biggest market intervention in U.S. history made its way through Congress , Neel Kashkari , the Treasury official named this week to run the program , offered assurances to 800 financial - industry players .
Attempts by Congress to make beneficiaries pay for their mistakes , such as placing caps on executive pay , were " quite reasonable " and " a pretty modest hindrance to you , " he told them , according to a recording of the Sept. 28 conference call made public on video - sharing Web site YouTube .
The exchange is a rare inside look at conversations between government officials and industry representatives who help shape government policy .
To win approval for the rescue package , Treasury had to agree to a number of conditions imposed by lawmakers , such as the pay caps and moves to help homeowners .
But to succeed , Treasury must also win the support of institutions healthy enough to revive faltering capital markets .
The balancing act suggested by the conference call shows how Mr. Kashkari , a 35 year - old former engineer and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker , could find himself in a political minefield as he tackles his biggest government job , should he appear to favor the financial sector he hails from at the expense of taxpayers .
" No one doubts that Neel is smart .
But he 's got to strike a balance here and understand that Democrats on the Hill are going to want to make sure that this program reaches down and helps average Americans , " said James F.M. Williams , former Democratic staff director for the Senate Banking Committee 's subcommittee on economic policy .
Mr. Williams is now a senior vice president at lobbying firm Ogilvy Government Relations .
As one of the more experienced C# coders in his group , Yakir is often asked programming questions .
Recently , his colleague James asked him the best way to store hundreds of thousands of items in memory , to which Yakir replied " It depends on how you want to access your data .
If you want to access your data by index , you should store it in an ArrayList .
If its easier to store things as a key - value pair , then you should use a Hashtable . "
James ' particular application called for a Hashtable , so he decided to implement that .
A few hours later , however , he ran into some trouble .
" This Hashtable is n't really working , " James explained , " do you know if there 's something more efficient ? "
" Errr , " Yakir questioned , " there is n't really anything more efficient than a Hashtable .
What exactly is the problem ? "
" It 's just too slow , " James replied , " once I have real data in there , it takes almost five seconds to add , remove , or find , an item . "
Yakir knew something was definitely wrong and sat with James to look at his code .
Here 's what he saw ...
class HashTable { public object [ ] keys ; public object [ ] values ; public HashTable ( ) { keys = new object [ 0 ] ; values = new object [ 0 ] ; } public void Add ( object key , object value ) { Array .
Resize ( ref keys , keys .
Length + 1 ) ; Array .
Resize ( ref values , values .
Length + 1 ) ; keys [ keys .
Length - 1 ] = key ; values [ values .
Length - 1 ] = value ; } public void Remove ( object key ) { object [ ] tempKeys = new object [ 0 ] ; object [ ] tempValues = new object [ 0 ] ; for ( int i = 0 ; i <= keys .
Length - 1 ; i++) { if ( ! keys [ i ] .
Equals ( key ) ) { Array .
Resize ( ref tempKeys , tempKeys .
Length + 1 ) ; Array .
Resize ( ref tempValues , tempValues .
Length + 1 ) ; tempKeys[tempKeys .
Length - 1 ] = keys[i ] ; tempValues[tempValues .
Length - 1 ] = values [ i ] ; } } keys = tempKeys ; values = tempValues ; } public object GetItem ( object key ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i <= keys .
Length - 1 ; i++) { if ( keys [ i ] .
Equals ( key ) ) { return values [ i ] ; } } return null ; } public int NumberOfItems { get { return keys .
Length ; } } }
" Uhhh , " Yakir said , baffled .
" Why did n't you use the built - in Hashtable class from System .
Collections that I showed you ? "
" I checked it out , " James explained , " but it had too many functions , which means it 's slow .
My class only has 3 functions , so it 's much more efficient . "
The market has rejoiced at the " collapse " of oil prices to $ 120 a barrel .
This enthusiasm is misplaced .
$ 120 oil is still astonishingly expensive .
$ 120 oil may mute some of the damage that a sustained $ 150 oil price may have inflicted , but $ 120 oil will still choke the economy .
Even if oil fell to $ 70 tomorrow , moreover , the economy wo n't turn on a dime -- especially with the housing and debt markets still cratering .
If oil stays where it is , meanwhile , or drops to $ 100 , the demand will still likely be curtailed .
And besides , the reason oil is falling is negative : global economic collapse generally is n't good for stocks .
At some point , the market will likely wake up and realize this .

Check out the cool video from Siggraph 2008 showing unrendered versions of Clover romping around in the city .
GANSU  Returning the fueling nozzle to the pump , Zhang Li jumped into the driver ’s seat of his gas - guzzling Land Rover .
“ Such a long line , ” said the 45 - year - old tour guide , shaking his head .
“ What ’s the world coming to ?
My stocks are worth air , and now I have to wait an hour for overpriced gas , too . ”
Mr. Zhang ’s lament elegantly captured the twin dilemmas that led China ’s leaders to unexpectedly raise gas prices here by double - digit percentages Thursday .
While much has been said about China ’s hesitance to raise domestic prices for fear of inflation , Beijing was facing an equally vexing problem : artificially low gas and diesel prices were indirectly depressing China ’s stock markets by hurting the performance of the energy giants Sinopec and PetroChina .
Price controls have saved Chinese consumers and businesses billions  and prevented the kind of protests that led to rioting , and even a murder at the pump , the last time prices rose .
But controls have also squeezed Sinopec and PetroChina , China ’s top oil refiner and producer , respectively .
They still had to pay near - record oil prices on world markets even if they were not allowed to charge market prices to consumers .
The companies lost money on every gallon of gas they sold in China .
Pelosi slams Boehner on energy , economy and Rangel
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) lashed back at House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) on Friday , calling GOP attacks on the Democratic energy proposal and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charlie Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) an " act of desperation . "
Boehner and other GOP leaders had written to Pelosi on Tuesday , calling for Rangel to be removed from his chairmanship while the House ethics committee investigates unpaid taxes on his vacation home in the Dominican Republican , the use of several rent - controlled apartments in Harlem , and his fundraising efforts on behalf of the " Rangel Center " in New York City .
Boehner also criticized Pelosi for not calling the House back into session during August while Republicans staged a floor protest on high energy prices .
Pelosi , however , hit back hard .
In her letter to Boehner , Pelosi said House GOP leaders " are in denial about the failure of the Bush - Republican Congress to grow the American economy , " and said the Bush administration had the worst economic record of any presidency since Herbert Hoover .
Pelosi also said Republicans " consistently side with Big Oil companies against the U.S. taxpayers and consumers both on the House floor and during the recent recess .
The California Democrat noted that Rangel had voluntarily asked for an ethics committee probes , and , without mentioning any names , pointed out that a " number of Republican Members whose ethical behavior has been under serious question and on which you have remained silent . "
Pelosi ended the letter with a call for bipartisan cooperation on energy and economic stimulus legislation .
Here 's the full text of Pelosi 's letter to Boeher :
" September 12 , 2008
Dear Leader Boehner :
It is with great curiosity and concern that I read your letter of September 9 , 2008 for the following reasons :
It is cause for concern that you and your colleagues in the Republican House Leadership are in denial about the failure of the Bush - Republican Congress to grow the American economy .
The record is very clear that , with your complicity , the George W. Bush Administration now shares with the Administration of George H.W. Bush the worst record on job creation since Herbert Hoover in the 1930s .
It is curious that you would consistently side with the Big Oil companies against the U.S. taxpayers and consumers both on the House floor and during the recent recess .
It is also curious that you characterize the August District Work Period as a paid vacation .
Perhaps you are projecting your own use of it as a vacation onto others who spent their time meeting with constituents to hear their views and , I would hope , to spend time with their families . "
Your unfair and intemperate attack on one of the most distinguished and beloved Members of the House , Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel , is curious in light in light of the number of Republican Members whose ethical behavior has been under serious question and on which you have remained silent .
Surely you are aware that Chairman Rangel immediately requested a review of all allegations by the bipartisan Committee on Standards of Official Conduct , and has pledged his full cooperation .
Clearly your letter is an act of desperation that is inconsistent with the facts concerning the state of the economy .
Since the Bush Administration took office in January 2001 , with a Republican Congress , nearly 3.5 million Americans have lost their jobs , and the unemployment rate has increased from 4.2 % to more than 6 % .
Hundreds of thousands of men and women have exhausted their unemployment insurance .
Median household income has decreased , and real wages have remained almost flat .
More than 5.5 million more Americans are living in poverty than at the end of the Clinton Administration .
That is the record of the Bush economic policies that your Party pledges to continue .
Americans instead want us to go in a New Direction in response to the harm the Bush Administration ’s policies have caused in the economy , energy , national security , housing and historic growth in the deficit .
The American people expect , deserve and need us to work together to grow the economy and create good paying jobs .
We accomplished that with enactment of the economic recovery legislation earlier this year , which provided urgent Recovery Rebates to 130 million American families , and is credited with having a beneficial impact on the economy at a critical time .
In the days and weeks ahead , I hope we can again agree on another economic recovery initiative that includes :
· Investing in the American infrastructure to create good - paying jobs here at home ;
· Assisting Americans in paying for the rising cost of essential energy through LIHEAP ;
· Aiding the states to help meet the health care need of millions of Americans ;
· Extending unemployment benefits for those who are losing their benefits because of the long - term downturn in the economy ;
· Increasing investments in nutrition programs like food stamps to feed the hungry in our country , many of them seniors .
As you know , all of these provisions were proposed earlier this year for the first stimulus package .
The need for this second phase of the stimulus is even greater now , and I hope that we can again find bipartisan consensus on these initiatives to serve the needs of the American people while promoting economic growth .
We have demonstrated that we can pass legislation to assist the American people .
The strong bipartisan support that won passage of the stimulus bill was also demonstrated in the historic energy law that raised efficiency standards for the first time in three decades and promoted home - grown alternative fuels ; the largest increase in college student assistance since the GI bill , and the largest increase in veterans programs in over seven decades .
These and other achievements have won strong support from many in your Republican Conference over the past year and a half , if not from the Republican leadership .
I look forward to working with Members of the Republican Conference in support of legislation to serve the American people , and hope that the next weeks of the session will be marked by cooperation and bipartisan efforts rather than by partisanship . "

With these tips , you can have a full - time job and still cook up a delicious dinner meal for your family to enjoy .
You wo n’t break up a sweat making it , either .
Stock Up on Supplies
The first useful cooking tip is to always stock up on supplies .
One way to make sure you always have enough supplies in the kitchen is to do grocery shopping once a month .
Doing grocery shopping once a month not only saves money , it saves time too .
This way , the pantry and kitchen will be well - stocked , and preparing for meals ahead of time will be easier to do .
When doing grocery shopping , think of every meal you ’ll be making for the whole month .
Buy all the necessary ingredients you need to make these meals .
You ’ll save time thinking about what to cook .
Plus , you ’ll also save time going out to buy ingredients you need , but may not have in the house .
Make sure to have staple ingredients , like pasta , rice , and canned food .
You should also have frozen fruits and vegetables .
Pasta , rice , and canned food can last for a couple of weeks in the pantry .
Although , make sure to properly store frozen fruits and vegetables in the refrigerator .
Do n’t forget to stock up on handy spices too !
Salt and ground black pepper are basic must - haves .
But versatile spices like cayenne and paprika should be in the kitchen too .
Keep Meals Simple
Cook simple , easy - to - make meals !
Pasta , fried rice , and soups are all delicious dinner meals that can be cooked with little to no effort .
The trick is to choose main ingredients that cook easily and wo n’t take long to prepare .
Sometimes , 1 - ingredient recipes , 2 - ingredient recipes , or even 3 - ingredient recipes are enough to save dinner every once and a while .
As long as it ’s delicious , kids rarely complain about the food you give them .
Who knows , your emergency grilled sandwiches might even be their favorite comfort food .
Make Food Ahead of Time
Thinking ahead of time is one of the secret ingredients to easy dinner meals .
Make the most with the time you have by preparing dishes early .
If you already know the meals you ’ll be cooking for this week , you can then start prepping for tomorrow ’s dinner while today ’s meal cooks .
For example : if you ’re making a delicious pasta meal , you can always cook the noodles ahead of time .
This way , you ’ll only need to toss the cooked pasta noodles into the sauce and dinner ’s set !
Just store your pre-cooked meals in the fridge so they do n’t spoil .
Also , do n’t forget to label the containers to avoid any confusion .
Set Up a Routine
Setting up a routine makes everything easier !
If Fridays are fried rice days , then everyone already knows what they need to do .
You can get your kids ’ help when preparing for some of the ingredients .
The older ones can help by washing the rice .
Meanwhile , the younger ones can help by taking out the carrots and peas from the fridge .
Who says dinners are only a parent ’s job ?
Always Cook Extra
Cooking extra is like cheating your way through the hassles of dinner - making .
Let ’s say that you ’ll be making a ground - beef dish for tonight ’s dinner .
You can cook extra ground beef , and make this the main ingredient for tomorrow ’s meal .
You can also cook double the normal amount .
So , the extra goes to the fridge , and when tomorrow comes , all you have to do is heat it up again .
Now you know all the handy cooking tips that can help you make dinner easier .
This time , let ’s look at our list of 10 kid- friendly , easy - to - make dinner recipes !

You can buy pumpkin in grocery stores and store them properly in the fridge .

If you have n’t already heard of Julius von Bismarck ’s Image Fulgurator , then welcome to the internet .
According to his website , it ’s a “ device for physically manipulating photographs ” .
But what does it do ?
How does it manipulate ?
And what the hell is a Fulgurator ?
Well , it comes from the Latin word for ‘ lightning ’ – fulgur .
Fulguration means the act or process of flashing like lightning .
And the name fits .
It ’s essentially a projector that senses the flash of a camera , then quickly projects an image onto the object being photographed for a split second .
The whole action is invisible to the naked eye , and results in a photograph with some image or text added .
It ’s an ingenious device with endless possibilities .
So it ’s only a matter of time before this technology starts getting integrated into mainstream advertising .
Von Bismark has a patent on the device , but this is fairly simple technology ; a projector + a flash detector ; there will be ways around it I ’m sure .
Or he may just sell the rights to his invention outright when the absurdly large offers start coming in .
Either way , it ca n’t be a bad thing .
Every blog entry and article on the Internet talking about this device is worried about the inevitable advertising use , hoping it does n’t “ fall into the wrong hands ” .
But really , let ’s look at the big picture .
We live in a world now where photography is under fire ; there are signs up all over the UK asking citizens to “ fight terrorism by reporting suspicious photographers ” .
I was recently hassled while walking around taking random pictures in Center City Philadelphia .
You could get arrested and put on a no fly list for taking pictures in an airport .
The masses of authority freaks are obviously skittish about picture takers ; and the best way to reverse that trend is to get business to embrace photography ; and the best way to do that is to make it profitable .
Imagine a world where businesses specifically try to create the most photogenic environment and encourage photography , simply because there are advertisements waiting to flicker their way onto your camera .
And what about museums , who are usually at least partially hostile to photographers , if they do n’t ban them outright ?
This could offer them an incentive to allow photography without any restrictions and give them an alternative source of income .
More money for museums is a good thing .
Really , the positive aspects of this device are there , if only you can open your mind past the generic idea of “ Advertising bad ” .
But let ’s hear what you think .
Good , bad , ugly ?
How do you feel about the Image Fulgurator falling into the hands of the advertising world ?
Washington D.C. , September 10 , 2008 - On the eve of the thirty - fifth anniversary of the military coup in Chile , the National Security Archive today published for the first time formerly secret transcripts of Henry Kissinger ’s telephone conversations that set in motion a massive U.S. effort to overthrow the newly - elected socialist government of Salvador Allende .
“ We will not let Chile go down the drain , ” Kissinger told CIA director Richard Helms in one phone call .
“ I am with you , ” the September 12 , 1970 transcript records Helms responding .
The telephone call transcripts — known as ‘ telcons ’ — include previously - unreported conversations between Kissinger and President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State William Rogers .
Just eight days after Allende 's election , Kissinger informed the president that the State Department had recommended an approach to “ see what we can work out [ with Allende ] . ”
Nixon responded by instructing Kissinger : “ Do n’t let them do it . ”
After Nixon spoke directly to Rogers , Kissinger recorded a conversation in which the Secretary of State agreed that “ we ought , as you say , to cold - bloodedly decide what to do and then do it , ” but warned it should be done “ discreetly so that it does n’t backfire . ”
Secretary Rogers predicted that “ after all we have said about elections , if the first time a Communist wins the U.S. tries to prevent the constitutional process from coming into play we will look very bad . ”
The telcons also reveal that just nine weeks before the Chilean military , led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet and supported by the CIA , overthrew the Allende government on September 11 , 1973 , Nixon called Kissinger on July 4 to say “ I think that Chilean guy might have some problems . ”
“ Yes , I think he ’s definitely in difficulties , ” Kissinger responded .
Nixon then blamed CIA director Helms and former U.S. Ambassador Edward Korry for failing to block Allende ’s inauguration three years earlier .
“ They screwed it up , ” the President declared .
Although Kissinger never intended the public to know about these conversations , observed Peter Kornbluh , who directs the National Security Archive ’s Chile Documentation Project , he “ bestowed on history a gift that keeps on giving by secretly taping and transcribing his phone calls . ”
The transcripts , Kornbluh noted , provide historians with the ability to “ eavesdrop on the most candid conversations of the highest and most powerful U.S. officials as they plotted covert intervention against a democratically - elected government . ”
Kissinger began secretly taping all his incoming and outgoing phone conversations when he became national security advisor in 1969 ; his secretaries transcribed the calls from audio tapes that were later destroyed .
When Kissinger left office in January 1977 , he took more than 30,000 pages of the transcripts , claiming they were “ personal papers , ” and used them , selectively , to write his memoirs .
In 1999 , the National Security Archive initiated legal proceedings to force Kissinger to return these records to the U.S. government so they could be subject to the freedom of information act and declassification .
At the request of Archive senior analyst William Burr , telcons on foreign policy crises from the early 1970s , including these four previously - unknown conversations on Chile , were recently declassified by the Nixon Presidential library .
On November 30 , 2008 the National Security Archive will publish a comprehensive collection of Kissinger telcons in the Digital National Security Archive ( DNSA ) .
Comprising 15,502 telcons , this collection documents Kissinger ’s conversations with top officials in the Nixon and Ford administrations , including President Richard Nixon ; Defense Secretaries Melvin Laird , Elliot Richardson , and James Schlesinger ; Secretary of State William P. Rogers ; Ambassador to the U.N. George H.W. Bush ; and White House Counselor Donald Rumsfeld ; along with noted journalists , ambassadors , and business leaders with close White House ties .
Wide - ranging topics discussed in the telcons include détente with Moscow , military actions during the Vietnam War and the negotiations that led to its end , Middle East peace talks , the 1970 crisis in Jordan , U.S. relations with Europe , Japan , and Chile , rapprochement with China , the Cyprus crisis ( 1974 - ) , and the unfolding Watergate affair .
When combined with the Archive ’s previous electronic publication of Kissinger ’s memoranda of conversation -- The Kissinger Transcripts : A Verbatim Record of U.S. Diplomacy , 1969 - 1977 -- users of the DNSA will have access to comprehensive records of Kissinger ’s talks with myriad U.S. officials and world leaders .
Like the Archive ’s earlier publication , the Kissinger telcons will be comprehensively and expertly indexed , providing users with have easy access to the information they seek .
The collection also includes 158 White House tapes , some of which dovetail with transcripts of Kissinger ’s telephone conversations with Nixon and others .
Users of the set will thus be able to read the “ telcon ” and listen to the tape simultaneously .
READ THE DOCUMENTS l. Helms / Kissinger , September 12 , 1970 , 12:00 noon .
Eight days after Salvador Allende ’s narrow election , Kissinger tells CIA director Richard Helms that he is calling a meeting of the 40 committee — the committee that determines covert operations abroad .
“ We will not let Chile go down the drain , ” Kissinger declares .
Helms reports he has sent a CIA emissary to Chile to obtain a first - hand assessment of the situation .
2 . President / Kissinger , September 12 , 1970 , 12:32 p.m .
In the middle of a Kissinger report to Nixon on the status of a terrorist hostage crisis in Amman , Jordan , he tells the president that “ the big problem today is Chile . ”
Former CIA director and ITT board member John McCone has called to press for action against Allende ; Nixon ’s friend Pepsi CEO Donald Kendall has brought Chilean media mogul Augustine Edwards to Washington .
Nixon blasts a State Department proposal to “ see what we can work out [ with Allende ] , and orders Kissinger “ do n’t let them do that . ”
The president demands to see all State Department cable traffic on Chile and to get an appraisal of “ what the options are . ”
3 . Secretary Rogers , September 14 , 1970 , 12:15 pm ( page 2 ) After Nixon speaks to Secretary of State William Rogers about Chile , Kissinger speaks to him on September 14 .
Rogers reluctantly agrees that the CIA should “ encourage a different result ” in Chile , but warns it should be done discreetly lest U.S. intervention against a democratically - elected government be exposed .
Kissinger firmly tells Secretary Rogers that “ the president ’s view is to do the maximum possible to prevent an Allende takeover , but through Chilean sources and with a low posture . ”
4 ) President / Kissinger , July 4 , 1973 , 11:00 a.m. Vacationing in San Clemente , Nixon calls Kissinger and discusses the deteriorating situation in Chile .
Two weeks earlier , a coup attempt against Allende failed , but Nixon and Kissinger predict further turmoil .
“ I think that Chilean guy may have some problems , ” Nixon states .
“ Oh , he has massive problems .
He has massive problems …he ’s definitely in difficulties , ” Kissinger responds .
The two share recollections of three years earlier when they had covertly attempted to block Allende ’s inauguration .
Nixon blames CIA director Richard Helms and former U.S. ambassador Edward Korry for failing to stop Allende ; “ they screwed it up , ” he states .
The conversation then turns to Kissinger ’s evaluation of the Los Angeles premiere of the play “ Gigi . ”
5 ) President / Kissinger , September 16 , 1973 , 11:50 a.m. ( previously posted May 26 , 2004 )
In their first substantive conversation following the military coup in Chile , Kissinger and Nixon discuss the U.S. role in the overthrow of Allende , and the adverse reaction in the new media .
When Nixon asks if the U.S. “ hand ” will show in the coup , Kissinger admits “ we helped them ” and that “ [ deleted reference ] created conditions as great as possible . ”
The two commiserate over what Kissinger calls the “ bleating ” liberal press .
In the Eisenhower period , he states , “ we would be heroes . ”
Nixon assures him that the people will appreciate what they did : “ let me say they are n’t going to buy this crap from the liberals on this one . ”
The American Institute of Mathematics announces that Soundararajan and Roman Holowinsky have proven a significant version of the quantum unique ergodicity conjecture .
Their work , based in the pure mathematics area of number theory , illuminates deep connections between classical and quantum physics in what is being hailed as one of the best theorems of the year .
In a seminar co-organized by Stanford University and the American Institute of Mathematics , Soundararajan announced that he and Roman Holowinsky have proven a significant version of the quantum unique ergodicity ( QUE ) conjecture .
" This is one of the best theorems of the year , " said Peter Sarnak , a mathematician from Princeton who along with Zeev Rudnick from the University of Tel Aviv formulated the conjecture fifteen years ago in an effort to understand the connections between classical and quantum physics .
" I was aware that Soundarajan and Holowinsky were both attacking QUE using different techniques and was astounded to find that their methods miraculously combined to completely solve the problem , " said Sarnak .
Both approaches come from number theory , an area of pure mathematics which recently has been found to have surprising connections to physics .
The motivation behind the problem is to understand how waves are influenced by the geometry of their enclosure .
Imagine sound waves in a concert hall .
In a well - designed concert hall you can hear every note from every seat .
The sound waves spread out uniformly and evenly .
At the opposite extreme are " whispering galleries " where sound concentrates in a small area .
The mathematical world is populated by all kinds of shapes , some of which are easy to picture , like spheres and donuts , and others which are constructed from abstract mathematics .
All of these shapes have waves associated with them .
Soundararajan and Holowinsky showed that for certain shapes that come from number theory , the waves always spread out evenly .
For these shapes there are no " whispering galleries . "
Quantum chaos
The quantum unique ergodicity conjecture ( QUE ) comes from the area of physics known as " quantum chaos . "
The goal of quantum chaos is to understand the relationship between classical physics -- the rules that govern the motion of macroscopic objects like people and planets when their motion is chaotic , with quantum physics -- the rules that govern the microscopic world .
" The work of Holowinsky and Soundararajan is brilliant , " said physicist Jens Marklof of Bristol University , " and tells us about the behaviour of a particle trapped on the modular surface in a strong magnetic field . "
The problems of quantum chaos can be understood in terms of billiards .
On a standard rectangular billiard table the motion of the balls is predictable and easy to describe .
Things get more interesting if the table has curved edges , known as a " stadium . "
Then it turns out most paths are chaotic and over time fill out the billiard table , a result proven by the mathematical physicist Leonid Bunimovich .
In the quantum or microscopic setting one investigates the waves that are associated to the billiard table .
The waves often spread out uniformly .
Sometimes , however , waves concentrate along an unstable periodic path .
Physicists call this " scarring . "
For the stadium system yet another interesting thing can happen , known as a " bouncing ball mode . "
Bouncing ball modes were observed experimentally and only recently proven to exist by Andrew Hassell .
In their QUE conjecture , Rudnick and Sarnak hypothesized that for a large class of systems , unlike the stadium there are no scars or bouncing ball states and in fact all states become evenly distributed .
Holowinsky and Soundararajan 's work shows that the conjecture is true in the number theoretic setting .
Highly excited states
The conjecture of Rudnick and Sarnak deals with certain kinds of shapes called manifolds , or more technically , manifolds of negative curvature , some of which come from problems in higher arithmetic .
The corresponding waves are analogous to highly excited states in quantum mechanics .
Soundararajan and Holowinsky each developed new techniques to solve a particular case of QUE .
The " waves " in this setting are known as Hecke eigenforms .
The approaches of both researchers work individually most of the time and miraculously when combined they completely solve the problem .
" Their work is a lovely blend of the ideas of physics and abstract mathematics , " said Brian Conrey , Director of the American Institute of Mathematics .
According to Lev Kaplan , a physicist at Tulane University , " This is a good example of mathematical work inspired by an interesting physical problem , and it has relevance to our understanding of quantum behavior in classically chaotic dynamical systems . "

He told Times Higher Education magazine : " Why should fewer academics believe in God than the general population ?
I believe it is simply a matter of the IQ .

Several Gallup poll studies of the general population have shown that those with higher IQs tend not to believe in God . "
There was a time when Dick Cheney could turn back a Republican revolt on Capitol Hill .
Not anymore .
House GOP rises up against Cheney
There was a time when Dick Cheney could turn back a Republican revolt on Capitol Hill .
That time is gone .

The vice president traveled to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to silence a chorus of GOP complaints about Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s $ 700 billion plan .
But House Republicans who walked into a closed - door meeting with Cheney steaming over the plan walked out just as angry , and they described what happened in between as both “ a bloodbath ” and “ an unmitigated disaster . ”
Texas Rep. Joe Barton took the unusual step of telling reporters gathered outside the Cannon Caucus Room that he had confronted Cheney “ respectfully ” about his concerns — a level of dissent Republicans once considered heresy under the Bush administration .
Another lawmaker present — who spoke on the condition of anonymity — said that Cheney , White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten and economic policy adviser Keith Hennessey “ were in worse shape when they left than when they came in . ”
Cheney ’s inability to turn around members of his own party said plenty about how congressional Republicans view the Bush White House these days — but maybe even more about their discomfort with a bailout plan many of them see as an attack on their free market principles .
“ It ’s a sad fact , but Americans can no longer trust the economic information they are getting from this administration , ” South Carolina Sen .
Jim DeMint said in a comment posted on Politico ’s Arena forum .
“ There is tremendous unease over the federal government assuming the assets that these financial institutions cannot price or manage , ” said Alabama Rep.
Spencer Bachus , the ranking Republican on the committee drafting the legislation .
It was n’t clear Tuesday whether Republicans were willing to take responsibility for killing the Paulson plan — but neither were they eager to take responsibility for passing it , either .
Republican leaders are now hoping Democrats load the legislation with unrelated measures that would give them the political cover to oppose it , members and aides said .
At the same time , party leaders are using back channels in the business community to gauge member support for a “ clean ” bill .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R - Ga. ) warned his former colleagues that they would pay a price in November for backing the bailout now — and that John McCain could ride to victory over Barack Obama by persuading voters that the bailout is really the “ Obama - Bush plan . ”
While McCain seemed to move in the other direction Tuesday , Gingrich called the Paulson plan “ stupid , ” “ a really bad idea ” and “ the kind of corrupt scheme that could have been designed by [ Russian Prime Minister ] Vladimir Putin . ”
Despite the anxieties — and outright anger — expressed during the Republicans ’ nearly two - hour exchange with Cheney and the other White House officials , lawmakers remained respectful enough to give the vice president two standing ovations .
Still , a lawmaker present said that Cheney and his team “ were the wrong guys ” to send to the Hill : “ The problem is that they ’ve used up a lot of goodwill . ”
Hennessey and Bolten — who shares a Goldman Sachs pedigree with Paulson — faced a number of tough questions about why the bailout was necessary , how it would actually work and why this particular plan was the best response to the current crisis , according to notes circulated from the meeting .
Cheney and the others made policy arguments for the proposal instead of political arguments that would help lawmakers explain a vote for the plan to constituents .
The meeting was almost an hour old when the vice president told the anxious Republicans , in response to a question , that failure to pass this would result in more foreclosures and cause grave hardship for their constituents .
“ No one sold it , ” one member present said .
“ Nobody has figured out how to sell it when you ’re knocking on voters ’ doors . ”
Conservatives present also grilled the assembled White House officials about what alternatives the administration considered before coming up with this plan .
Hill Republicans have circulated their own alternatives .
Most deal with long - term issues — tax reform , regulatory overhauls or comprehensive energy proposals — that lack the immediate impact Treasury seeks .
But GOP lawmakers are getting more specific .
Conservatives on the Republican Study Committee offered an alternative package Tuesday afternoon .
Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee , which includes plenty of conservatives , were expected to offer their own alternative package later in the day .
Ironically , Democrats are addressing many of the GOP concerns by adding more government oversight of the program and limiting the pay of top executives whose companies seek an infusion of federal funds .
“ That ’s one thing we ’re in total agreement on , ” Bachus said of the compensation limits .
GOP leaders are still on the fence publicly .
House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) told his rank - and - file colleagues Tuesday morning that the need to act was very real , imploring them to do something .
But Boehner is caught in a tough spot .
He sees the need to act , but his members hate the plan .
Other elected leaders could pull the rug out from underneath him by coming out against the administration proposal .
A rumor circulated among his rank and file this week that Boehner and other leaders have already agreed to support the plan in principle , but Boehner ’s staff shot down any suggestion that he embraces drafts circulating on Capitol Hill .
The pragmatic Republican assured colleagues that he “ hates ” the proposal and remains angry that Wall Street brought the economy to this point , members present said .
He also promised to vote against the eventual bill if he does n’t agree with it .
Addressing reporters afterward , Boehner , who invited Cheney to the Hill on Tuesday , reiterated his desire to see Congress pass bailout legislation , even as he acknowledged other Republicans ’ concerns .
“ It ’s the size of the solution that causes great concern and trying to gauge the risk - to - reward ratio , ” Boehner told reporters .
“ How serious is the problem , and how imminent is the crisis ?
I believe that the risk to our economy is severe and Congress must act . ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A panel of federal appeals court judges pushed a U.S. government lawyer on Wednesday to answer why FBI letters sent out to Internet service providers seeking information should remain secret .
A panel of three judges from the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments on whether a provision of the Patriot Act , which requires people who are formally contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for information to keep it a secret , is constitutional .
The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit in 2004 on behalf of an undisclosed Internet service provider against the U.S. government challenging the so - called National Security Letters ( NSL ) as well as gag orders placed on the recipients .
The appeals courts on Wednesday questioned a lawyer representing the U.S. government on whether the FBI violated free speech rights in placing the gag orders .
The government argues they are in place for national security concerns , such as keeping terrorists from learning what they are investigating .
“ You ca n’t tell me that any terrorist is going to make anything out of the fact you issued NSLs to AT&T and Verizon , ” said Circuit Judge Sonia Sotomayor , using a hypothetical example .
U.S. Assistant Attorney General Gregory Katsas said the FBI “ assesses the need for secrecy in each particular case . ”
Between 2003 and 2006 nearly 200,000 national security letters were sent out .
Of those about 97 percent received gag orders .
ACLU lawyer Jameel Jaffer said the gag order had prevented the small Internet service provider the ACLU was representing from speaking out “ against an FBI investigation that he believes is illegitimate . ”
The government is appealing a lower court ruling that said the gag order violated the First Amendment guarantee of free speech and was unconstitutional .
The judges will rule on the issue in the coming months .
Ezra , commenting on Brooks , neatly sums up the demographic challenges facing Republicans :
As for the educated class , that 's an interesting question .
Much like with the conservative wing 's mistrust of Hispanics , it 's a policy that might have seemed electorally wise a couple years ago but is growing more questionable with every passing election .
At some point , the demographic trends predicted by The Emerging Democratic Majority 's will reach sufficient maturity and the GOP 's decades - long effort to drive away the educated and young and the different is going to leave them making ever more exclusionary appeals to an ever smaller slice of the electorate .
What Rove never realized is that many of us fought hard for intellectual and moral respect for conservatism in college and grad school , only to have our efforts turned into a joke by the crassness of the Party Of Rove .

Even by the normal standards of Roubini ’s tendency to hyperventilate state his case forcefully , the good professor rises to levels of choler heretofore unseen .
Roubini focuses on many of the issues we have discussed in our earlier posts ( most notably this one ) but he teases out some of the issues in more detail .
And he really hates it , whoops , I think we covered that already .
His big bones of contention are , like ours :

From RGE Monitor :
Whenever there is a systemic banking crisis there is a need to recapitalize the banking / financial system to avoid an excessive and destructive credit contraction .
But purchasing toxic / illiquid assets of the financial system is not the most effective and efficient way to recapitalize the banking system …..
In the Scandinavian banking crises ( Sweden , Norway , Finland ) that are a model of how a banking crisis should be resolved there was not government purchase of bad assets ; most of the recapitalization occurred through various injections of public capital in the banking system .
Purchase of toxic assets instead – in most cases in which it was used – made the fiscal cost of the crisis much higher and expensive ( as in Japan and Mexico ) .
Thus the claim by the Fed and Treasury that spending $ 700 billion of public money is the best way to recapitalize banks has absolutely no factual basis or justification .
This way of recapitalizing financial institutions is a total rip - off that will mostly benefit – at a huge expense for the US taxpayer – the common and preferred shareholders and even unsecured creditors of the banks .
Even the late addition of some warrants that the government will get in exchange of this massive injection of public money is only a cosmetic fig leaf of dubious value as the form and size of such warrants is totally vague and fuzzy .
So this rescue plan is a huge and massive bailout of the shareholders and the unsecured creditors of the financial firms ( not just banks but also other non bank financial institutions ) ; with $ 700 billion of taxpayer money the pockets of reckless bankers and investors have been made fatter under the fake argument that bailing out Wall Street was necessary to rescue Main Street from a severe recession .
Instead , the restoration of the financial health of distressed financial firms could have been achieved with a cheaper and better use of public money …
….via public injections of preferred shares into these firms ; via required matching injections of Tier 1 capital by current shareholders to make sure that such shareholders take first tier loss in the presence of public recapitalization ; via suspension of dividends payments ; via a conversion of some of the unsecured debt into equity ( a debt for equity swap ) .
All these actions would have implied a much lower fiscal costs for the government as they would have forced the shareholders and creditors of the banks to contribute to the recapitalization of the banks ….. For example if the private sector had done its fair matching share only $ 350 billion of public money could have been used ; and of this $ 350 billion half could have taken the form of purchase of bad assets and the other half should have taken the form of injection of public capital in these financial institutions .
So instead of purchasing – most likely at an excessive price – $ 700 billion of toxic assets the government could have achieved the same result – or a better result of recapitalizing the banks – by spending only $ 175 billion in the direct purchase of toxic assets .
And even after the government will waste $ 700 billion buying toxic assets many banks that have not yet provisioned for such losses / writedowns will be even more undercapitalized than before .
So this plan does not even achieve the basic objective of recapitalizing undercapitalized banks … .
Thus , the Treasury plan is a disgrace : a bailout of reckless bankers , lenders and investors that provides little direct debt relief to borrowers and financially stressed households and that will come at a very high cost to the US taxpayer .
And the plan does nothing to resolve the severe stress in money markets and interbank markets that are now close to a systemic meltdown .
It is pathetic that Congress did not consult any of the many professional economists that have presented – many on the RGE Monitor Finance blog forum – alternative plans that were more fair and efficient and less costly ways to resolve this crisis .
This is again a case of privatizing the gains and socializing the losses ; a bailout and socialism for the rich , the well - connected and Wall Street .
And it is a scandal that even Congressional Democrats have fallen for this Treasury scam that does little to resolve the debt burden of millions of distressed home owners .

Hey there ,
This may be the first time I 've run a series of posts where the topic was different every step of the way .
That 's a good thing , because I get just as bored as anyone else reading about the same thing over and over ;)
So , following in the footsteps of our posts on Number Pools And Guaranteed Combinations Within Fixed Lists and Perl List Permutations , we 'll move straight ahead to the next logical step , which is almost an entirely different subject altogether .
I will however , reiterate ( repeat again ... sorry , one of my idiosyncrasies ;) our Objective in this whole exercise ( Skip to the next paragraph if you feel I 've done this sentence to death ;) : Given a Number Pool of " x through y , " create the maximum possible Fixed List Length variations of our Fixed List that contain some variation of our Guaranteed Combination , without any duplication ( i.e. 1 , 2 , 3 is equal to 2 , 3 , 1 and would only count as one match ) , and return the results .
Of course , to revisit the definitions of our key components , please refer back to our previous post on Number Pools
Today , we 're going to look a Perl list sorting .
In this context , you can actually consider our lists as arrays if you prefer .
I 'm going to keep calling them lists because , in the end , it will most closely approximate what we will want to manipulate ; a fixed list of numbers .
From yesterday 's posts on list permutations you can basically understand , even if you did n't run the code , how very many different combinations of 6 numbers there can be , when duplication is not a factor ( i.e. 1 , 2 , 3 is different than 3 , 2 , 1 ) .
In our case , given our Objective , we would want those number lists , in parentheses above , to be considered equal .
So how do we go about that ?
There are actually quite a number of ways you can go about doing this .
They run the gamut from human - readable and computer - intensive to nearly - hieroglyphic and incredibly efficient .
Some folks like to dump all their values into hashes and sort it out that way , since the Perl hash function is built to sort keys and values .
I 'm not against that at all , but feel like it might stray us farther off the path and I want to keep this series of posts somewhat accessible .
My answer is actually a fairly commonly used one , as well .
I do n't consider myself a Perl expert ( or really even a Unix or Linux expert .
Like in Eastern philosophy : Even the teacher is ever the student ) .
If I ever do convince myself that I know it all , I 'll probably have a fatal seizure from lack - of - interest within moments of my revelation ;)
I like to sort all of my permutations ( in this case numerically ) first , and then check for duplicates .
This makes sense to me , for some reason , and ( especially in this case ) it can greatly reduce the pressure you feel when dealing with large numbers of numbers .
For instance , our 720 permutations are all of the same 6 numbers , so , once they 've all been sorted numerically , we 're going to have 720 identical lists .
We do n't even need a computer to tell us what our Objective obliquely defines as a " unique list " in this situation .
It 's " 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . "
All of our actions are predicated on the output of the " public domain " code we put out yesterday , which has been revised slightly to suit our purposes ( the original just printed out the answers and did n't do any variable assignation or a return ) and , yes , I do use my lists as arrays from time to time ( we all need time to relax and unshift ;)
The " permute " subroutine is called with an array , or list , ( @number_seeds ) as its only argument ( which contains " 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 " ) , like :
@s_perms = permute ( [ @number_seeds ] , [ ] ) ;
Modified code below :
sub permute {
my @items = @ { $ _ [ 0 ] } ;
my @perms = @ { $ _ [ 1 ] } ;
unless ( @items ) {
# LIMITED TO ONE CONTIGUOUS PERMUTATION CHAIN
@sortperms = join ( " " , @perms ) ;
unshift ( @s_perms , " @sortperms " ) ;
} else {
my(@newitems , @newperms , $i ) ;
foreach $ i ( 0 .. $ #items ) {
@newitems = @items ;
@newperms = @perms ;
unshift ( @newperms , splice ( @newitems , $ i , 1 ) ) ;
permute ( [ @newitems ] , [ @newperms ] ) ;
}
}
return @s_perms ;
}
And that 's the lesson for today .
I 've attached code to the end of the post to illustrate the steps of sorting each list in our list of lists and checking for ( and removing ) duplicate lists from the pool .
Note that we do n't take into account multiple variable lists , as this wo n't be germane later ( and adds some heft to the scriplet :)
I tried to make this as easy to read as possible , so various steps , which could be combined , have been spelled out .
If it has the opposite effect and makes things more confusing , I apologize profusely .
And let me know !
If there 's interest , I 'd be happy to write about this stuff at a much more granular level :)
Here 's the mock output , to save you a screenshot :

Programming in D for C Programmers
Et tu , D ?
Then fall , C ! -- William Nerdspeare
Every experienced C programmer accumulates a series of idioms and techniques which become second nature .
Sometimes , when learning a new language , those idioms can be so comfortable it's hard to see how to do the equivalent in the new language .
So here 's a collection of common C techniques , and how to do the corresponding task in D .
Since C does not have object - oriented features , there 's a separate section for object - oriented issues Programming in D for C++ Programmers .
The C preprocessor is covered in The C Preprocessor vs D .
The C Way
sizeof ( int ) sizeof ( char *) sizeof ( double ) sizeof ( struct Foo )
The D Way
Use the size property :
int .sizeof ( char *) .sizeof double .sizeof Foo.sizeof
The C Way
#include < limits.h> # include < math.h >
CHAR_MAX CHAR_MIN ULONG_MAX DBL_MIN
The D Way
char .max char .min ulong .max double .min
C to D types
bool => bit char => char signed char => byte unsigned char => ubyte short => short unsigned short => ushort wchar_t => wchar int => int unsigned => uint long => int unsigned long => uint long long => long unsigned long long => ulong float => float double => double long double => real _ Imaginary long double => ireal _ Complex long double => creal
Although char is an unsigned 8 bit type , and wchar is an unsigned 16 bit type , they have their own separate types in order to aid overloading and type safety .
Ints and unsigneds in C are of varying size ; not so in D .
The C Way
#include < fp.h >
NAN INFINITY #include < float.h >
DBL_DIG DBL_EPSILON DBL_MANT_DIG
DBL_MAX_10_EXP
DBL_MAX_EXP DBL_MIN_10_EXP
DBL_MIN_EXP
The D Way
double .nan double .infinity double .dig double .epsilon double .mant_dig double .max_10_exp double .max_exp double .min_10_exp double .min_exp
The C Way
#include < math.h > float f = fmodf ( x , y ) ; double d = fmod ( x , y ) ; long double r = fmodl( x , y ) ;
The D Way
float f = x % y ; double d = x % y ; real r = x % y ;
The C Way
#include < math.h > if ( isnan ( x ) || isnan(y ) ) result = FALSE ; else result = ( x < y ) ;
The D Way
result = ( x < y ) ;
The C Way
D supports the remainder ( ' %' ) operator on floating point operands : C does n't define what happens if an operand to a compare is NAN , and few C compilers check for it ( the Digital Mars C compiler is an exception , DM 's compilers do check for NAN operands ) .
D offers a full complement of comparisons and operators that work with NAN arguments .
C does n't directly support assert , but does support __FILE__ and __LINE__ from which an assert macro can be built .
In fact , there appears to be practically no other use for __FILE__ and __LINE__ .
#include < assert.h> assert(e == 0 ) ;
The D Way
assert ( e == 0 ) ;
The C Way
# define ARRAY_LENGTH 17 int array [ ARRAY_LENGTH ] ; for ( i = 0 ; i < ARRAY_LENGTH ; i++) array [ i ] = value ;
The D Way
int array [ 17 ] ; array [ ] = value ;
The C Way
D simply builds assert into the language :
The array length is defined separately , or a clumsy sizeof ( ) expression is used to get the length .
# define ARRAY_LENGTH 17 int array [ ARRAY_LENGTH ] ; for ( i = 0 ; i < ARRAY_LENGTH ; i++) func( array [ i ] ) ;
int array [ 17 ] ; for ( i = 0 ; i < sizeof ( array ) / sizeof ( array [ 0 ] ) ; i++) func( array [ i ] ) ;
The D Way
int array [ 17 ] ; for ( i = 0 ; i < array.length ; i++) func( array [ i ] ) ;
int array [ 17 ] ; foreach ( int value ; array ) func( value ) ;
The C Way
#include < stdlib.h > int array_length ; int * array ; int * newarray ; newarray = ( int *) realloc ( array , ( array_length + 1 ) * sizeof ( int ) ) ; if ( ! newarray ) error ( " out of memory " ) ; array = newarray ; array [ array_length ++ ] = x ;
The D Way
int [ ] array ; array.
length = array.length + 1 ; array[array.length - 1 ] = x ;
The C Way
#include < string.h > char * s1 ; char * s2 ; char *s ; // Concatenate s1 and s2 , and put result in s free(s ) ; s = ( char *) malloc ( ( s1 ? strlen ( s1 ) : 0 ) + ( s2 ? strlen ( s2 ) : 0 ) + 1 ) ; if ( !s ) error ( " out of memory " ) ; if ( s1 ) strcpy (s , s1 ) ; else *s = 0 ; if ( s2 ) strcpy (s + strlen (s ) , s2 ) ; // Append " hello " to s char hello [ ] = " hello " ; char * news ; size_t lens = s ? strlen(s ) : 0 ; news = ( char *) realloc(s , ( lens + sizeof ( hello ) + 1 ) * sizeof ( char ) ) ; if ( ! news ) error ( " out of memory " ) ; s = news ; memcpy (s + lens , hello , sizeof ( hello ) ) ;
The D Way
char [ ] s 1 ; char [ ] s 2 ; char [ ] s ; s = s1 ~ s2 ; s ~= " hello " ;
The C Way
#include < stdio.h > printf ( " Calling all cars %d times !

The D Way
printf ( " Calling all cars %d times !
" , ntimes ) ;
import std.stdio ; writefln ( " Calling all cars %s times ! " , ntimes ) ;

The D Way
or :
The length of an array is accessible through the property " length " .
or even better : C cannot do this with arrays .
It is necessary to create a separate variable for the length , and then explicitly manage the size of the array : D supports dynamic arrays , which can be easily resized .
D supports all the requisite memory management .
There are several difficulties to be resolved , like when can storage be freed , dealing with null pointers , finding the length of the strings , and memory allocation : D overloads the operators ~ and ~= for char and wchar arrays to mean concatenate and append , respectively : printf ( ) is the general purpose formatted print routine :
What can we say ?
printf ( ) rules : writefln ( ) improves on printf ( ) by being type - aware and type - safe : Functions cannot be forward referenced .
Hence , to call a function not yet encountered in the source file , it is necessary to insert a function declaration lexically preceding the call .
The program is looked at as a whole , and so not only is it not necessary to code forward declarations , it is not even allowed !
D avoids the tedium and errors associated with writing forward referenced function declarations twice .
Functions can be defined in any order .
D is a strongly typed language , so there is no need to explicitly say a function takes no arguments , just do n't declare it has having arguments .
Break and continue statements only apply to the innermost nested loop or switch , so a multilevel break must use a goto : Break and continue statements can be followed by a label .
The label is the label for an enclosing loop or switch , and the break applies to that loop .
The much maligned goto statement is a staple for professional C coders .
It 's necessary to make up for sometimes inadequate control flow statements .
Many C - way goto statements can be eliminated with the D feature of labeled break and continue statements .
But D is a practical language for practical programmers who know when the rules need to be broken .
So of course D supports goto statements .
It 's annoying to have to put the struct keyword every time a type is specified , so a common idiom is to use : Struct tag names are not in a separate name space , they are in the same name space as ordinary names .
Hence : Given a string , compare the string against a list of possible values and take action based on which one it is .
A typical use for this might be command line argument processing .
The problem with this is trying to maintain 3 parallel data structures , the enum , the table , and the switch cases .
If there are a lot of values , the connection between the 3 may not be so obvious when doing maintenance , and so the situation is ripe for bugs .
Additionally , if the number of values becomes large , a binary or hash lookup will yield a considerable performance increase over a simple linear search .
But coding these can be time consuming , and they need to be debugged .
It 's typical that such just never gets done .
D extends the concept of switch statements to be able to handle strings as well as numbers .
Then , the way to code the string lookup becomes straightforward : Adding new cases becomes easy .
The compiler can be relied on to generate a fast lookup scheme for it , eliminating the bugs and time required in hand - coding one .
It 's done through a command line switch which affects the entire program , and woe results if any modules or libraries did n't get recompiled .
To address this , s are used : Buts are nonportable both in theory and in practice from compiler to compiler .
D has a syntax for setting the alignment that is common to all D compilers .
The actual alignment done is compatible with the companion C compiler 's alignment , for ABI compatibility .
To match a particular layout across architectures , use align ( 1 ) and manually specify it .
struct ABC { int z ; align ( 1 ) int x ; align ( 4 ) { ... } align ( 2 ) : int y ; }
The C Way
struct
Foo { int i ; union Bar { struct Abc { int x ; long y ; } _abc ; char * p ; } _bar ; } ; # define x _bar._abc.x # define y _bar._abc.y # define p _bar . p struct Foo f ; f.i ; f.x ; f.y ; f.p ;
The D Way
struct
Foo { int i ; union { struct { int x ; long y ; } char * p ; } } Foo f ; f.i ; f.x ; f.y ; f.p ;
The C Way
Sometimes , it 's nice to control the layout of a struct with nested structs and unions .
C does n't allow anonymous structs or unions , which means that dummy tag names and dummy members are necessary :
Not only is it clumsy , but using macros means a symbolic debugger wo n't understand what is being done , and the macros have global scope instead of struct scope .
Anonymous structs and unions are used to control the layout in a more natural manner :
Is to do it in one statement ending with a semicolon :
struct
Foo { int x ; int y ; } foo ;
Or to separate the two :
struct
Foo { int x ; int y ; } ; // note terminating ; struct Foo foo ;
The D Way
Struct definitions and declarations can't be done in the same statement :
struct
Foo { int x ; int y ; } Foo foo ;
which means that the terminating ; can be dispensed with , eliminating the confusing difference between struct {} and function block {} in how semicolons are used .
The C Way
#include < stddef > struct
Foo { int x ; int y ; } ; off = offsetof ( Foo , y ) ;
The D Way
struct
Foo { int x ; int y ; } off = Foo.y.offsetof ;
The C Way
union U { int a ; long b ; } ; union U x = { 5 } ; // initialize member ' a ' to 5
The D Way
union U { int a ; long b ; } U x = { a : 5 } ;
The C Way
struct S { int a ; int b ; } ; struct S x = { 5 , 3 } ;
The D Way
struct S { int a ; int b ; } S x = { b:3 , a:5 } ;
The C Way
int a [ 3 ] = { 3,2,2 } ;
int b [ 3 ] [ 2 ] = { 2,3 , { 6,5} , 3,4 } ;
The D Way
int [ 3 ] a = [ 3 , 2 , 0 ] ; int [ 3 ] a = [ 3 , 2 ] ; int [ 3 ] a = [ 2:0 , 0:3 , 1:2 ] ; int [ 3 ] a = [ 2:0 , 0:3 , 2 ] ;
enum color { black , red , green } int [ 3 ] c = [ black : 3 , green : 2 , red:5 ] ;
int [ 2 ] [ 3 ] b = [ [ 2,3 ] , [ 6,5 ] , [ 3,4 ] ] ; int [ 2 ] [ 3 ] b = [ [ 2,6,3 ] , [ 3,5,4 ] ] ;
The C Way
char file [ ] = " c:\\root\\file.c " ;
/ " [ ^\\ ] *( \\. [ ^\\ ] * ) * " /
Naturally , another macro is used :
An offset is just another property : Unions are initialized using the " first member " rule : Adding union members or rearranging them can have disastrous consequences for any initializers .
In D , which member is being initialized is mentioned explicitly : avoiding the confusion and maintenance problems .
Members are initialized by their position within the { }s : This is n't much of a problem with small structs , but when there are numerous members , it becomes tedious to get the initializers carefully lined up with the field declarations .
Then , if members are added or rearranged , all the initializations have to be found and modified appropriately .
This is a minefield for bugs .
Member initialization can be done explicitly :
The meaning is clear , and there no longer is a positional dependence .
C initializes array by positional dependence : Nested arrays may or may not have the { }:D does it by positional dependence too , but an index can be used as well .
The following all produce the same result :
This can be handy if the array will be indexed by an enum , and the order of enums may be changed or added to : Nested array initializations must be explicit : C has problems with the DOS file system because a \ is an escape in a string .
To specifiy file c:\root\file .c:
This gets even more unpleasant with regular expressions .
Consider the escape sequence to match a quoted string :
In C , this horror is expressed as :
char quoteString [ ] = " \ " [ ^\\\\ ] *( \\\\ . [ ^\\\\ ] * ) * \ " " ;
The D Way
char [ ] file = `c:\root\file.c` ; char [ ] quoteString = \ " r " [ ^\\ ] *( \\. [ ^\\ ] * ) * " \ " ;
char [ ] hello = " hello world "
;
Within strings , it is WYSIWYG ( what you see is what you get ) .
Escapes are in separate strings .
So : The famous hello world string becomes :
Modern programming requires that wchar strings be supported in an easy way , for internationalization of the programs .
The C Way
#include < wchar.h > char foo_ascii [ ] = " hello " ; wchar_t foo_wchar [ ] = L" hello " ;
#include < tchar.h > tchar string [ ] = TEXT ( " hello " ) ;
The D Way
char [ ] foo_ascii = " hello " ; wchar [ ] foo_wchar = " hello " ;
The C Way
enum COLORS { red , blue , green , max } ; char * cstring [ max ] = { " red " , " blue " , " green " } ;
The D Way
enum COLORS { red , blue , green } char [ ] [ COLORS.max + 1 ] cstring = [ COLORS.red : " red " , COLORS.blue : " blue " , COLORS.green : " green " , ] ;
The C Way
typedef void * Handle ; void foo ( void *) ; void bar ( Handle ) ; Handle h ; foo(h ) ; // coding bug not caught bar(h ) ; // ok
struct Handle__ { void * value ; } typedef struct Handle__ * Handle ; void foo ( void *) ; void bar ( Handle ) ; Handle h ; foo(h ) ; // syntax error bar(h ) ; // ok
# define HANDLE_INIT ( ( Handle ) - 1 ) Handle h = HANDLE_INIT ; h = func ( ) ; if ( h != HANDLE_INIT ) ...
struct Handle__ HANDLE_INIT ; void init_handle ( ) // call this function upon startup {
HANDLE_INIT.value = ( void *) - 1 ; } Handle h = HANDLE_INIT ; h = func ( ) ; if ( memcmp ( &h , &HANDLE_INIT , sizeof ( Handle ) ) !=
0 ) ...
Handle , HANDLE_INIT , struct Handle__ , value
The D Way
typedef void * Handle ; void foo( void *) ; void bar ( Handle ) ; Handle h ; foo(h ) ; bar(h ) ;
.init
typedef void * Handle = cast ( void *) ( - 1 ) ; Handle h ; h = func ( ) ; if ( h != Handle.init ) ...
Handle
The C Way
struct A x , y ; ... x = y ;
#include < string.h > struct A x , y ; ... if ( memcmp ( &x , &y , sizeof ( struct A ) ) == 0 ) ...
C uses the wchar_t and the L prefix on strings : Things get worse if code is written to be both ascii and wchar compatible .
A macro is used to switch strings from ascii to wchar :
The type of a string is determined by semantic analysis , so there is no need to wrap strings in a macro call : Consider :
This is fairly easy to get right because the number of entries is small .
But suppose it gets to be fairly large .
Then it can get difficult to maintain correctly when new entries are added .
Not perfect , but better .
Typedefs in C are weak , that is , they really do not introduce a new type .
The compiler does n't distinguish between a typedef and its underlying type .
The C solution is to create a dummy struct whose sole purpose is to get type checking and overloading on the new type .
Having a default value for the type involves defining a macro , a naming convention , and then pedantically following that convention :
For the struct solution , things get even more complex :
There are 4 names to remember :
No need for idiomatic constructions like the above .
Just write :
To handle a default value , add an initializer to the typedef , and refer to it with theproperty :
There 's only one name to remember :
While C defines struct assignment in a simple , convenient manner : it does not for struct comparisons .
Hence , to compare two struct instances for equality : Note the obtuseness of this , coupled with the lack of any kind of help from the language with type checking .
There 's a nasty bug lurking in the memcmp ( ) .
The layout of a struct , due to alignment , can have ' holes ' in it .
C does not guarantee those holes are assigned any values , and so two different struct instances can have the same value for each member , but compare different because the holes contain different garbage .
The D Way
A x , y ; ... if ( x == y ) ...
The C Way
char string [ ] = " hello " ; if ( strcmp ( string , " betty " ) == 0 ) // do strings match ? ...
The D Way
char [ ] string = " hello " ; if ( string == " betty " ) ...
D does it the obvious , straightforward way : The library function strcmp( ) is used : C uses 0 terminated strings , so the C way has an inherent inefficiency in constantly scanning for the terminating 0 .
Why not use the == operator ?
D strings have the length stored separately from the string .
Thus , the implementation of string compares can be much faster than in C ( the difference being equivalent to the difference in speed between the C memcmp ( ) and strcmp ( ) ) .
D supports comparison operators on strings , too :
char [ ] string = " hello " ; if ( string < " betty " ) ...
The C Way
int compare ( const void * p1 , const void * p2 ) { type * t1 = ( type *) p1 ; type * t2 = ( type *) p2 ; return * t1 - * t2 ; } type array [ 10 ] ; ... qsort ( array , sizeof ( array ) / sizeof ( array [ 0 ] ) , sizeof ( array [ 0 ] ) , compare ) ;
The D Way
type [ ] array ; ... array.sort ;
The C Way
volatile int *p = address ; i = *p ;
The D Way
int * p = address ; volatile { i = * p ; }
The C Way
" This text spans
\ multiple
\ lines
"
The D Way
" This text spans multiple lines "
The C Way
which is useful for sorting / searching .
Although many C programmers tend to reimplmement bubble sorts over and over , the right way to sort in C is to use qsort ( ) : A compare ( ) must be written for each type , and much careful typo - prone code needs to be written to make it work .
Sorting could n't be easier :
To access volatile memory , such as shared memory or memory mapped I/O , a pointer to volatile is created : D has volatile as a statement type , not as a type modifier : String literals in C cannot span multiple lines , so to have a block of text it is necessary to use \ line splicing :
If there is a lot of text , this can wind up being tedious .
String literals can span multiple lines , as in : So blocks of text can just be cut and pasted into the D source .
Consider a function to traverse a recursive data structure .
In this example , there 's a simple symbol table of strings .
The data structure is an array of binary trees .
The code needs to do an exhaustive search of it to find a particular string in it , and determine if it is a unique instance .
To make this work , a helper function membersearchx is needed to recursively walk the trees .
The helper function needs to read and write some context outside of the trees , so a custom struct Paramblock is created and a pointer to it is used to maximize efficiency .
struct Symbol { char * id ; struct Symbol * left ; struct Symbol * right ; } ; struct Paramblock { char * id ; struct Symbol * sm ; } ; static void membersearchx ( struct Paramblock * p , struct Symbol * s ) { while ( s ) { if ( strcmp ( p -> id , s ->id ) == 0 ) { if ( p - > sm ) error ( " ambiguous member %s
" , p->id ) ; p->sm = s ; } if ( s -> left ) membersearchx ( p , s -> left ) ; s = s-> right ; } } struct Symbol * symbol_membersearch ( Symbol * table [ ] , int tablemax , char * id ) { struct Paramblock pb ; int i ; pb.id = id ; pb.sm = NULL ; for ( i = 0 ; i < tablemax ; i++) { membersearchx ( pb , table [ i ] ) ; } return pb.sm ; }
The D Way
This is the same algorithm in D , and it shrinks dramatically .
Since nested functions have access to the lexically enclosing function 's variables , there 's no need for a Paramblock or to deal with its bookkeeping details .
The nested helper function is contained wholly within the function that needs it , improving locality and maintainability .
The performance of the two versions is indistinguishable .
class Symbol { char [ ] id ; Symbol left ; Symbol right ; } Symbol symbol_membersearch( Symbol[ ] table , char [ ] id ) { Symbol sm ; void membersearchx ( Symbol s ) { while ( s ) { if ( id == s.id ) { if ( sm ) error ( " ambiguous member %s
" , id ) ; sm = s ; } if ( s.left ) membersearchx ( s.left ) ; s = s.right ; } } for ( int i = 0 ; i < table .
length ; i++) { membersearchx ( table [ i ] ) ; } return sm ; }
The C Way
int i , j ; ... j = ( unsigned ) i >>
3 ;
i
int
i
myint i , j ; ... j = ( unsigned ) i >>
3 ;
myint
long int
The D Way
myint i , j ; ... j = i >>>
3 ;
The C Way
The right shift operators >> and >>= are signed shifts if the left operand is a signed integral type , and are unsigned right shifts if the left operand is an unsigned integral type .
To produce an unsigned right shift on an int , a cast is necessary : Ifis an , this works fine .
But ifis of a type created with typedef , andhappens to be a , then the cast to unsigned will silently throw away the most significant bits , corrupting the answer .
D has the right shift operators >> and >>= which behave as they do in C .
But D also has explicitly unsigned right shift operators >>> and >>>= which will do an unsigned right shift regardless of the sign of the left operand .
Hence , avoids the unsafe cast and will work as expected with any integral type .
Consider a reusable container type .
In order to be reusable , it must support a way to apply arbitrary code to each element of the container .
This is done by creating anfunction that accepts a function pointer to which is passed each element of the container contents .
A generic context pointer is also needed , represented here by void *p .
The example here is of a trivial container class that holds an array of ints , and a user of that container that computes the maximum of those ints .
void apply ( void * p , int * array , int dim , void ( * fp ) ( void * , int ) ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < dim ; i++ ) fp( p , array [ i ] ) ; } struct Collection { int array [ 10 ] ; } ; void comp_max ( void * p , int i ) { int * pmax = ( int *) p ; if ( i > * pmax ) * pmax = i ; } void func ( struct Collection * c ) { int max = INT_MIN ; apply ( &max , c->array , sizeof ( c-> array ) / sizeof ( c-> array [ 0 ] ) , comp_max ) ; }
While this works , it is n't very flexible .
The D Way
class Collection { int [ 10 ] array ; void apply ( void delegate ( int ) fp ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < array.length ; i++) fp( array [ i ] ) ; } } void func( Collection c ) { int max = int .min ; void comp_max ( int i ) { if ( i > max ) max = i ; } c.apply ( comp_max ) ; }

The D version makes use ofto transmit context information for thefunction , andboth to capture context information and to improve locality .
Pointers are eliminated , as well as casting and generic pointers .
The D version is fully type safe .
An alternate method in D makes use ofeliminating the need to create irrelevant function names .
The task is to write a function that takes a varying number of arguments , such as a function that sums its arguments .
There are two problems with this .
The first is that thefunction needs to know how many arguments were supplied .
It has to be explicitly written , and it can get out of sync with respect to the actual number of arguments written .
The second is that there 's no way to check that the types of the arguments provided really were ints , and not doubles , strings , structs , etc .
The ... following an array parameter declaration means that the trailing arguments are collected together to form an array .
The arguments are type checked against the array type , and the number of arguments becomes a property of the array :

If we had told you eight years ago , when 802.11 b was really taking off , that one day in the future you would be able to pick up at least ten different wireless networks on any given block of a major metropolitan city , you might have believed us .
But if we had also told you that many of these would be either unsecured , or secured using methods that were widely known to be flawed and easily crackable ( i.e. WEP and MAC address filtering ) ... well , given the average user 's well - known apathy toward all things security - related , you still might have believed us .
But what if I had told you that , in eight years , all the major methods available for securing your wireless network would be known to have major flaws , and that there was pretty much no way to keep a truly determined attacker off of your WAN ?
That claim might have raised a few eyebrows , but unfortunately it would 've been true .
Nonetheless , if you take the attitude that when it comes to wireless security , " something is better than nothing , " then all is not lost .
In this installment of Classic .
Ars , we go back into the archives to present you with two of our investigations into the whys and hows of wireless security .
Theory and practice
The first article , the Wireless Security Blackpaper , was published in 2002 as an in - depth look at the theory and practice of wireless security .
Surprisingly , many of the technologies that it covers are still in widespread use , which is probably why the article remains a relatively popular one six years after its initial publication .
Our second , more recent article , focuses on the practical aspects of wireless security .
The ABC's of Securing Your Wireless Network offers a crash course in securing your wireless router , with basic instructions on which options to select , and which methods work with which types of devices .
If you 're looking for a link to pass on to the wireless newbie in your family who 's hounding you for help with their new Linksys , this is it .
Ultimately , no wireless network is truly bulletproof , but the two guides linked above will keep over 90 percent of miscreants and would - be leechers off of your WAN .
And in the end , the security that you use is infinitely better than the security that you do n't use .
How do you respond when things look a little crazy on the stock market ?
Should you sell your stocks and go to cash during volatile markets , or should you stay the course , and keep your money invested for the long haul ?
One of the most common responses is to get worried and sell , deciding to go to cash .
According to T. Rowe Price , that can be costly in the long run .
While it might be hard to hang in there when you see your portfolio drop in value , for many long - term investors , it ’s best to turn off your emotions and stick with your investing strategy .
When you see several days of steep losses in a short period of time , it can be tempting to switch into panic mode , following the crowd and dumping your stocks .
However , panic selling can cause you bigger problems in the long run .
Consider that one of the biggest factors in your success as an investor , as well as in other areas of life , is your mindset .
Are you letting fear cloud your financial judgment ?
If so , you could miss out on some of the opportunities provided by a down market .
DON ’T PANIC – How to Handle Volatile Markets
One of the worst things you can do during times of market volatility is panic .
Decisions based on a knee - jerk reaction are usually bad decisions — especially if it means dumping a fundamentally sound stock and locking in your losses .
Before you sell due to a market drop , imagine the words “ do n’t panic ” in large friendly letters 😉
Step back and think about why you want to sell .
If you want to sell because everyone else is selling , it might be time to adjust your mindset and start looking for opportunities .
Fear - Driven Finances and Loss
The stock market is an oft - cited example of what can go wrong when you let fear rule your financial decisions .
During the financial crisis of 2008 , and in the aftermath , a number of people , afraid of the stock market ’s poor performance , sold .
The problem when you sell at a time like that , of course , is that you end up locking in your losses .
I was a little bit afraid for some of my investments , but I ignored my panic reaction and kept with my dollar cost averaging plan .
Now , I ’m seeing better returns .
Of course , there are other ways to let fear rule your finances .
Some of these fears include :
Fear of missing out :
Many people are driven to scams because they are worried about “ missing ” a big opportunity .
Pressure to get in , or you will miss out , can work on a different type of fear that pushes you into poor decisions .
: Many people are driven to scams because they are worried about “ missing ” a big opportunity .

Fear of falling behind :
Do you look at your friends and family and worry that you are falling behind ?
This type of fear can prompt you to spend beyond your means .
Your fear of how you look in front of others might result in debt that can get out of hand .

Your fear of how you look in front of others might result in debt that can get out of hand .
Fear of risk :
While you do n’t want to take irresponsible risks , you should n’t shun risk altogether .
Some risks are smarter than others .
You need to add a little risk in order to be successful , whether it ’s investing in a carefully considered ETF or starting your own business .
Here is more on risk tolerance and investing .
Do n’t Let Fear Rule You
You do n’t want to let fear rule your financial decisions .
That means that you need to take steps to protect yourself from yourself .
In many cases , you can stop fear from taking control by refusing to make quick decisions .
Rather than selling everything all at once , ask yourself what ’s changed .
If the fundamentals of an investment are the same , there is a good chance that it will recover with the rest of the market .
Realize , too , that great “ insider ” opportunities are meant to use fear to push you into making an irrational decision .
Think it over carefully .
Most legitimate opportunities do n’t expire immediately .
Stepping back can also help you avoid making other financial mistakes .
Ask yourself why you are doing something .
Honestly answer why you want to buy a new car , new shoes or a bigger TV .
Learn to be comfortable with your own expenditures and lifestyle , and do your best to stop worrying about other people have .
If you focus on what you are grateful to have , you will feel less fear about keeping up with your neighbors .
It can be hard to overcome your fears , even the fear of money .
However , if you study your own emotions , and refuse to make financial decisions when fear is the dominating stimulus , you can reduce the number of poor choices you make .
Education can help , too .
Learn about yourself , and about how money makes .
You will feel better about your decisions when they come from knowledge , rather than from fear .
Stick to Your Long Term Plan
Now is not the time to abandon your long - term plan .
If you have made an investing plan , stick with it — especially if you have a couple decades left before its fruition .
When you have a solid investment plan , it is likely to bear you out over the long term .
Short term , things can look pretty jagged and volatile .
However , if you look at market movements over a period of decades , things tend to smooth out .
Long - term , there is a great deal less volatility .
This is good news for your long term investing plan .
Do n’t let today ’s fear keep you from reaching your ultimate investing and financial goals .
While this might be a good time to re-evaluate where you stand and to diagnose some weaknesses in your portfolio or asset allocation , it ’s not the time to change everything up just because you ’re afraid .
Take a measured approach when tweaking your plan , but do n’t scrap it completely .
Deciding to Go To Cash When Markets Drop Can Cost You
The biggest problem with selling when you get worried is the fact that you are essentially “ locking in ” your losses .
Until you actually liquidate your stocks , your losses are pretty much just on paper .
They do n’t become “ real ” until you sell .
Essentially , when you sell during a market downturn , you are selling low after you have bought at a higher price .
You will also see other costs when you go to cash during a downturn .
Not only do you lock in current losses , but you also run the risk of losing out on bigger future gains .
I use a dollar - cost averaging strategy with my long - term investing .
I invest the same amount of money each month , no matter what ’s happening with the market .
This means that when the market is lower , I essentially end up buying my investments “ on sale . ”
During a market recovery , that means that my portfolio grows at a faster rate than someone who has been growing a cash account , and finally decides to get back in after prices have begun rising again .
The T. Rowe Price article includes an illustration of two investors who set aside $ 2,000 each quarter from the beginning of 2001 through the end of 2015 .
One investor sells and goes to cash when the market drops by 10 % or more in a quarter , and then does n’t get back in until there are four quarters in a row of positive returns .
The other investor just plugs away , putting that money into stocks , no matter what is going on .
By the end of the exercise , the investor that goes to cash has less than half the account balance as the investor that was able to take advantage of low prices and bigger returns .
This illustrates how deciding to go to cash can cause problems , especially if you do so after the big market drop .
While some of this can be mitigated if you sell and switch to cash before a market drop , the reality is that few of us are good at timing the market in this way .
Using Asset Allocation to Improve Your Peace of Mind
This does n’t mean that there is no place for cash in your investment portfolio .
The danger comes in making big changes to your portfolio during times of market turmoil .
Instead , it can make sense to use asset allocation to your advantage over the long haul .
You can create a portfolio that includes cash and bonds ( and maybe other assets , depending on your goals and risk profile ) in addition to stocks .
It might help you sleep better at night knowing that your portfolio is 70 % stocks , 20 % bonds , and 10 % cash .
In some cases , you might even tweak those numbers , depending on where you stand with your financial goals and risk tolerance .
The idea is that you can consistently invest in those set proportions , occasionally rebalancing as you see a drift in your asset allocation .
With this method , you can use index funds or ETFs to help you manage your investments , rather than worrying about stock picking .
It ’s one way to reduce some of the risk and increase the chances that you will come out ahead in the long run .
Carefully consider your situation and what makes sense for you .
However , be aware that most ordinary investors do n’t do well with stock picking .
Also keep in mind that , often , the very worst time to sell your stocks and go to cash is when everyone else is panicking and doing the same thing .
Look for Opportunities
Now might be time to look for opportunities .
Cheap stocks abound during times of stock market volatility and times of economic recession .
You could pad your retirement account , or enhance your income portfolio .
Even beginning investors can benefit by investing in index investments that have a little less risk than some other individual investments .
If you are a little more advanced as an investor , you can look for other opportunities .
It might be a good time to buy precious metals before they skyrocket higher .
( Some think that now might be a good time for silver , especially if gold is to rich for your blood right now . )
You might also find interesting opportunities in currencies or other investments .
Times when the real estate market is doing poorly might produce opportunities for you to buy cheap property to hold on to for a time .
During the last economic recession , freelancers were able to find a number of opportunities as companies looking for skilled workers with lower overhead .
Instead of dwelling on how horrible everything is , you can be on the lookout for opportunities in times of market and economic uncertainty .
Increasing Investments During Market Pullbacks
Might be an Opportunity
It is always better to buy low and sell high .
If you ’re in it for the long run , you have a long time for your shares to gain value .
Several years ago , the effects of the Great Recession decimated stock prices .
At the time , Warren Buffet wrote an op - ed piece for the NY Times , Buy American .
I Am .
If you missed it , I highly recommend reading it .
Warren Buffet is one of the world ’s most successful investors , and when he talks , people listen .
One of his most famous investment quotes is this :
Be fearful when others are greedy , and be greedy when others are fearful .
Take advantage of buying opportunities
Do n’t worry about market timing .
I could stress over the daily fluctuations and fractional changes of each share but I wo n’t .
It is impossible to guess when the market will truly bottom out .
And trying to do so is bad for the body , mind , and soul .
But it is easy to recognize that almost the entire market is substantially discounted right now .
Value averaging is the investment strategy of investing more money when stocks drop in price , and this may be the textbook example of when to do that .
These opportunities are few and far between and I plan on taking advantage of this one .
Want Warren ’s advice on this one ?
Let me be clear on one point : I ca n’t predict the short - term movements of the stock market .
I have n’t the faintest idea as to whether stocks will be higher or lower a month — or a year — from now .
What is likely , however , is that the market will move higher , perhaps substantially so , well before either sentiment or the economy turns up .
So if you wait for the robins , spring will be over .
Invest with a plan .
Do n’t blindly throw money at a stock you know was priced higher a few months ago .
Instead , buy based upon your investment goals and maintain a balanced asset allocation .
Otherwise , you are asking for disaster .
How to take advantage of Market Pullbacks
Increase your 401 ( k ) contributions .
Adding even as little as 1 % can make a difference in the long run , and you probably wo n’t even notice it in the short term .
If you can squeeze more out of your budget , go ahead and try .
If it gets tight you can always bring down your contributions later .
Max out your IRA .
Your IRA is another great place to stash the extra cash .
You can invest up to a combined $ 6,000 in a Roth or Traditional IRA in 2019 .
If you have n’t opened an IRA yet , there are several places you can do that , including with your bank or in a brokerage account .
Check out more information on our post about where to open a Roth IRA account .
Invest in taxable accounts .
If you have already maxed out your retirement accounts , or you think you will need the money before retirement , then consider investing in taxable accounts .
I personally have accounts with Vanguard and Ally Invest and recommend both of them .
The European Union wants to add 45 years to the current 50 - year copyright on musical recordings , arguing that aging performers can't afford to be cut off from sources of income just when they need them the most .
In defense of this plan , Commissioner Charlie McCreevy 's proposal said that no external expertise on the matter was required and , furthermore , that the ( music - industry - provided ) data he already had said the plan was a good one .
Now , a prominent European academic is furious that his work — which the European Commission requested and paid for —has been totally ignored by the very Commission that signed off on the piece and published it .
Professor P. Bernt Hugenholtz , Ph.D , heads the Institute for Information Law ( known as IViR ) at the University of Amsterdam .
IViR was commissioned to produce two major studies on EU copyright issues back in 2005 , and the reports duly appeared in 2006 and 2007 .
Hugenholtz and his team of experts concluded , among other things , that a copyright term extension would be a bad idea with costs for consumers , competitors , and society as a whole .
( The team turned some of this work into an academic paper [ PDF ] that appeared this year . )
Despite the work , which was signed off on by the European Commission and duly published on the website of the Internal Market and Services directorate , Commissioner McCreevey 's term - extension proposal ( PDF ) did not mention it .
The proposal collected responses for the idea from the usual sources ( music publishers , performers , collecting societies ) and responses against the idea , also from the usual sources ( libraries , consumers , public domain companies , telecoms ) .
How to weigh them all ?
Not through the use of expert opinion , apparently .
Under the bullet point " Collection and use of expertise , " the proposal simply noted that " there was no need for external expertise . "
Hugenholtz does n't mince his words in an open letter ( PDF ) to Commissioners ( noted by UK legal site OUT - LAW ) .
Although he recognizes that academic experts wo n't see their words translated directly into policy , he still does expect that the ideas the Commission itself approved would " be given the appropriate consideration by the Commission and be duly referenced in its policy documents , in particular wherever the Commission 's policy choices depart from our studies ' main recommendations . "
In fact , Hugenholtz goes on to say , the whole process " seems to reveal an intention to mislead the council and the Parliament , as well as the citizens of the European Union .
In doing so the Commission reinforces the suspicion , already widely held by the public at large , that its policies are less the product of a rational decision - making process than of lobbying by stakeholders . "
Hugenholtz can perhaps take cold comfort from the fact that the proposal does n't just ignore academics , but major government - backed panels like the Andrew Gowers - led commission in the UK that also concluded that term extension was a bad idea .
While Hugenholtz 's open letter looks unlikely to derail the term - extension idea , it will no doubt play into the same Euro - skepticism that he writes about , especially in already skeptical countries like the UK .
When Brussels appears more sympathetic to the data supplied by special interests than to academic reporting or major government - backed consultations , and then drenches the entire proposal in a pathos for old and starving musicians , at least a bit of skepticism seems warranted .
Hugenholtz has certainly done his part to sound the alarm on the proposal .
In addition to authoring the earlier reports on copyright and the new letter to various EU Commissioners , Hugenholtz was a signatory to a letter published in the Times last month that called the idea good only for " record companies , aging rock stars or , increasingly , artists ' estates .
It does nothing for innovation and creativity . "

As the story goes , G.W. Bush won the presidency in 2000 because enough people wanted to “ have a beer with him . ”
Bush was a reformed alcoholic , so the idea was metaphorical .
What people meant was that they felt that they could relate to G.W. Bush .
Of course few of us really could .
Was your daddy a president ?
Did you go to Yale and Harvard ?
Have you ever had dinner at the bin Laden house ?
No .
None of the people who spouted the beer rationale could actually relate to Bush .
The trick was that he did n’t talk about his father or Yale or what it ’s like to roll around in oil money .
Karl Rove presented a mostly blank canvas and prompted people to project themselves , and their desires , onto his candidate .
That is the pinnacle of identity politics .
Attempting to project an identity does n’t work , and John Kerry ’s attempt at looking like hunter / man of the people exemplifies why it does n’t .
People did n’t feel like they could relate to either Gore or Kerry .
And this is why John McCain wo n’t win .
We can admire the fact that he survived five and a half years as a POW , but only a handful of people can actually relate to it .
People are apt to admire the fact that he ’s a “ maverick , ” but very few people are mavericks and , frankly , most are probably a little frightened by them .
Men might wish that they had married a younger , loaded wife , but they ca n’t relate to the actual experience .
John McCain has run on his identity .
Unlike Bush , people can’t make it up for him in their own minds .
Or , they have to decide whether they actually like / trust him .
He might have pulled it out , but he brought Steve Schmidt on board .
Schmidt is a protégé of Rove and not equal to his master .
What Rove did slyly , Schmidt does brazenly .
And what Rove did for Bush will not necessarily work for McCain anyhow because much of it forces McCain to take on an identity other than the one he ’s cultivated for 25 years .
Even when they swing for the fences , as with the Palin pick , it backfires .
Rather than offering the outline of a character for the voters to flesh out for themselves , they present a caricature .
You either can or cannot relate to Sarah Palin ; there is no middle ground of imagination .
Moreover , many of us who can want her nowhere near national power … because we can relate to her .
Barack Obama , on the other hand , has the G.W. Bush quality of projection .
Few of us can actually relate to Barack Obama either but we feel like we can .
When he ’s pictured looking dorky on a mountain bike , people see themselves .
He ’s the guy from school who was smarter than you but did n’t show off and still managed to be friends with the cool kids .
He ’s the coworker who will pass you by on his way up the ladder and you wo n’t even resent him for it .
And he stands for “ change you can believe in . ”
Note that his motto allows you to do the believing ; you are free to project your idea of change onto the candidate .
It ’s that old Reagan magic , and it probably means that John McCain will retire as a foot soldier rather than a field marshal .
Alexi Koltowicz is an autodidact and unrepentant underachiever who ’s forsaken his education for the allure of ditch digging and prefers the company of plants to people , because he finds them substantially more intelligent .

Investor 's Business Daily
Disney stock is trying to rebound after coronavirus closures took a toll .
Here 's what fundamental and technical analysis says about buying Disney now .
Frank " Lefty " Rosenthal , who has died of a heart attack aged 79 , was a Las Vegas legend , a pioneer who brought sports bookmaking into US casinos as a legitimate business , at least by Vegas standards , who introduced female blackjack dealers and immediately doubled business at the tables , and who was the inspiration for the " Ace Rothstein " character played by Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese 's 1995 film Casino .
But his greatest achievement may have been simply surviving into old age .
Rosenthal owed that good fortune partly to his instincts and partly to a design flaw in the 1981 Cadillac Eldorado .
On October 4 1982 , a bomb exploded in his car as Rosenthal left Tony Roma 's Las Vegas steakhouse with a bag of spare ribs for his children .
Only a metal plate placed under the driver 's seat to correct the car 's imbalance saved his life .
He soon took his children and left Las Vegas , first for California and then to Florida , where he managed his nephew 's bar and grill and , later , ran a profitable internet betting site .
Rosenthal was born in Chicago , the spiritual home of US gangsters and sports fixers .
As a teenager he was already setting odds for bookmakers , whose illegal business was controlled by the mob .
He studied the business like any other , but had an innate talent for setting odds that both attracted bets and protected bookies .
He was also actively involved in fixing the outcomes of sporting events , and established a reputation for ruthlessly protecting his , and his employers ' , interests .
In 1961 , called to testify before a congressional committee , he invoked his fifth amendment protection against self - incrimination 38 times - including when asked if he was left - handed , thus earning his nickname .
The following year he was convicted in North Carolina of trying to bribe college basketball players to " shave " points , and win by less than the bookie 's published spread .
He moved to Las Vegas in 1968 , after being implicated in bombings during the infamous Miami " bookie wars " .
He soon married a topless showgirl , Geri McGee ( later played by Sharon Stone in Casino ) , and brought his childhood friend Anthony " Tony the Ant " Spilotro to Vegas , as his enforcer .
The city 's murder rate allegedly went up 70 % after Spilotro 's arrival .
His nickname referred to his stature , which is why Joe Pesci was cast in his role , renamed " Nicky Santoro " , in the Casino film .
In 1974 , reportedly as a result of his wife 's nagging , Rosenthal took a job as floor manager at the Stardust hotel , and soon had an executive position with the company , reputedly a mob front , that owned that casino and three others .
He presented a television talk show sponsored by the Stardust ; his first guest was , perhaps not surprisingly , Frank Sinatra .
In reality he was running all four casinos , but without a licence , and in 1976 the Nevada state gaming commission deemed him unsuitable .
Although he won an appeal to a friendly judge , the battle continued until finally , in 1988 , he was placed in the " black book " which bars gamblers from casinos .
Meanwhile , he fell out with Spilotro , who had begun an affair with McGee , and whose role in skimming large amounts of untraceable casino cash from the mob 's own skim had been revealed .
Spilotro was also engineering jewellery heists from casino hotels , further irritating the city 's powers - that - be .
The question of who tried to blow up Rosenthal remains unanswered .
Rosenthal claimed it was due to his association with Spilotro - " once they discovered we were childhood friends there was no way to overcome it " - but his own role in the skim might be a better reason .
Or Spilotro himself might have felt his former pal had sold him out .
A month later , McGee was found dead in a Los Angeles motel , of an overdose of alcohol and drugs .
Soon afterwards , Rosenthal left Las Vegas for good .
When Casino appeared , Rosenthal was quoted as saying , " I 'm not Bob [ De Niro ] and he 's not Frank , " but in a 2007 interview he conceded that the film was " almost totally accurate ... I raped the strip 's casinos . "
Nicholas Pileggi , who wrote the film and its book , said , " When Lefty went , the new Las Vegas emerged , the corporate Vegas . "
Indeed , in today 's Las Vegas , the mayor , Oscar Goodman , was once Rosenthal 's attorney .
" I do n't believe he ever spent a day in jail when I represented him , " he said .
" Law enforcement ... probably did n't care for him but he treated me well and paid his bills on time . "
Goodman may have understated the case .
One former federal prosecutor told a Las Vegas paper that " you should never speak ill of the dead , but Lefty Rosenthal is one of the exceptions .
He was an awful human being . "
He is survived by Steven and Stephanie , the children of his marriage to McGee .
• Frank Lawrence ' Lefty ' Rosenthal , gambler and gangster , born June 12 1929 ; died October 13 2008
· This article was amended on Saturday October 25 2008 .
When Frank " Lefty " Rosenthal said : " I 'm not Bob and he 's not Frank , " he was talking about himself and Robert De Niro , who played him in the film Casino .
He was not , as we suggested in the article above , referring to Frank Sinatra .
This has been corrected .
LAS VEGAS --
The middleman who set up and taped O.J. Simpson 's meeting with two memorabilia dealers testified Monday he was paid $ 210,000 by media outlets before he gave police his recordings from the alleged armed robbery in a Las Vegas hotel room .
In cross-examination of Thomas Riccio , Simpson 's lawyer , Yale Galanter , laid out Simpson 's defense that the former football star did not intend to profit when he and a group of men confronted the two dealers over memorabilia but just wanted to retrieve personal mementos he said had been stolen from him .
" Did he ever say he wanted to sell it ? " asked Galanter .
" No , " said Riccio , who added that Simpson wanted the items as " heirlooms " to give to his children .
Riccio , who also deals in memorabilia , said he arranged the Sept. 13 , 2007 , meeting and wanted to make as much money as he could before giving police the recorder he had hidden in the hotel room .
That delay caused problems in authenticating the recordings , and FBI experts said they can't be sure they were n't altered .
Riccio said he was paid $ 150,000 by the gossip site TMZ , $ 25,000 by " Entertainment Tonight " $ 20,000 by a sponsor of Howard Stern 's radio show and $ 15,000 by ABC under the guise of buying a photo of
Riccio and Simpson .
It was the first time Riccio revealed how much he was paid and he did it reluctantly , saying he had contracts not to discuss it .
Clark County District Judge Jackie Glass ordered him to disclose the figures .
Riccio , who was given immunity from prosecution , said he also wrote a book after the event but did not say how much he made from that .
Galanter started his cross-examination , asking Riccio , " Has O.J. Simpson ever asked you to lie about the events that occurred at the Palace Station Hotel ? "
" No , " said Riccio .
He said Simpson never mentioned weapons in advance and told him repeatedly he had not seen a gun in the room .
" There is a chance he did n't , " said Riccio .
" I would n't bet my life either way . "
Riccio said he arranged the meeting that led to armed robbery and kidnap charges against Simpson and co-defendant Clarence " C.J. " Stewart .
He said he had heard from one of the dealers , Alfred Beardsley , that Beardsley had family photographs and other Simpson items .
Riccio said he first went to authorities and told them that Beardsley was peddling stolen property but two police departments and the FBI in Los Angeles wanted no part of it .
" This guy admitted he had stolen property and no one cares , " Riccio said .
He said he considered doing a " sting " on Beardsley in which TV cameras would come along .
Riccio suggested a sting be conducted in Los Angeles but Simpson refused , saying his lawyers objected .
The prosecution has suggested that was because the items might be seized by Fred Goldman , father of Ronald Goldman who was slain along with Simpson 's ex-wife , Nicole , in 1994 .
Although Simpson was acquitted of murder , Goldman won a judgment against Simpson in civil court which he has been unable to collect .
Obama has led McCain by significant margin for last six days
Gallup Daily : Obama Leads McCain by 5 Points Obama has led McCain by significant margin for last six days
PRINCETON , NJ -- Registered voters currently prefer Barack Obama ( 48 % ) to John McCain ( 43 % ) for president , according to the latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking update .
These results , based on Sept. 29 - Oct.1 interviewing , mark the sixth consecutive day that Obama has enjoyed a statistically significant lead over McCain .
He has generally been ahead of McCain since the financial crisis intensified two weeks ago , and for much of the campaign since June , apart from the week after the Republican National Convention in early September .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
The two presidential candidates will cede the spotlight tonight as their vice presidential running mates , Sen. Joe Biden and Gov. Sarah Palin , debate in St. Louis .
This is arguably one of the more anticipated vice presidential debates since these became a regular part of presidential campaigns , given the interest in seeing how Palin will perform .

For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Sept. 29 - Oct. 1 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,747 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

After the nth person telling me to try Moose , I finally gave in .
The first thing I wanted to know was how to handle private variables , hash table properties , and object type properties .
The Moose Quick - Ref Card lists the built - in Data Type constraints .
I think Randal L. Schwartz has written the definitive introduction , though .
( His follow up goes into more detail about custom types … . )
We can see below that the read - only field on the Example object needed to have a writer defined for it .
Even though the method is named private_set_x , it can still be called from the outside world .
Also , we can set the “ read only ” member via the constructor hash !
Hash and object property types seem to work just fine .
The only real trick there was to use an in - line sub to initialize them .
#!/usr /bin/perl package Example ; use Moose ; has ' x ' => ( isa => ' Int ' , is => ' ro ' , writer => ' private_set_x ' , default => 21 ) ; sub test { my $ self = shift ; my $x = $ self - > x ( ) ; print " My x is currently a $x
" ; } sub setit { my $ self = shift ; $ self ->private_set_x ( 42 ) ; } package Another ; use Moose ; extends ' Example ' ; has ' hashtest ' => ( isa => ' HashRef ' , is => ' rw ' , default => sub { my % hash ; return \ %hash ; } ) ; has ' exampletest ' => ( isa => ' Example ' , is => ' rw ' , default => sub { Example -> new ( ) ; } ) ; after ' setit ' => sub { my $ self = shift ; print " The after method is getting called now .
" ; } ; my $ thing = Example - > new ( ) ; $ thing ->test ( ) ;
# My x is currently a 21 $ thing -> setit ( ) ; $ thing ->test ( ) ;
# My x is currently a 42 $ thing ->private_set_x ( 84 ) ; $ thing ->test ( ) ;
# My x is currently a 84 my $ otherthing = Example -> new ( x => 168 ) ; $ otherthing -> test ( ) ; #
My x is currently a 168 my $ another = Another - > new ( ) ; $ another -> setit ( ) ; #
The after method is getting called now .
my $h = $ another - > hashtest ( ) ; $ h -> { " One "} = " Hello " ; my $v = $ another - > hashtest ( ) ->{

Drug dealers turn Wash .
vineyards into pot farms The Associated Press
Published : Monday August 11 , 2008
Print This Email This By SHANNON DININNY WAPATO , Wash .
 Across central Washington 's fruit bowl , farmers are buying vineyards , hoping to establish roots in the area and capitalize on the booming wine industry .
Authorities believe some of the buyers are living in Mexico and their vineyards are producing tens of thousands of illegal marijuana plants  a crop that could easily surpass grapes in value this year .
Law enforcement officials in the Yakima Valley already have converged on seven vineyards that had been converted to marijuana operations this summer .
At least five had been recently purchased  the buyers are still being tracked  and one had been leased to pot growers by an unknowing owner .
Pot growers are n't just hiding their crops in national forests and random cornfields any more , said Washington State Patrol Sgt. Richard A. Beghtol .
" They are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation , " Beghtol said .
" It 's their big moneymaker . "
The valley , home to acres of fruit orchards and hop fields , has long been recognized as an important pipeline in the drug trade with easy interstate access to Seattle , Portland and points east .
Crackdowns at the Canadian and Mexican borders have made it more difficult to ship marijuana into the United States , prompting dealers to establish U.S. growing operations .
A bust of more than 60,000 plants on the Yakama Indian Reservation in 2004 , one of the biggest nationwide at the time , was traced to organized crime in Mexico and valued at more than $ 35 million .
By 2006 , authorities were seizing more than 144,000 marijuana plants across Washington state .
That number more than doubled the following year to 296,611 plants , reflecting a rise in both drug activity and enforcement efforts , said Rene Rivera , the Drug Enforcement Agency 's agent in charge in Yakima .
" This year , we 're probably going to surpass 2007 easily , just given the way we 're starting , " Rivera said .
Water use is often a vital clue .
Beghtol has noted that grape vines require much less water than marijuana , which needs daily irrigation .
Drug enforcement teams have confiscated approximately 110,000 marijuana plants valued at more than $ 100 million this spring and summer in the Yakima Valley alone , and they have n't even begun their annual aerial surveillance .
In 2006 , grapes ranked No. 11 among Washington state crops with a value of $ 144.2 million .
Vineyards cover about 31,000 acres .
Finding farmers willing to sell their property is n't difficult .
Fewer farmers have children who want to take over the family business , and rising costs have driven many farmers off the land despite increasing prices for their crops .
But dealers are n't just limiting their property buys to older sellers , Beghtol said .
In one case , drug operatives approached a farmer who did n't have his farm listed for sale .
He resisted until , asked to name a price .
He threw out a figure : $ 263,000 for 27 acres and no building .
The buyer showed up a few days later and bought the property in cash , Beghtol said .
The seller had no idea the farm would become a marijuana operation .
" The Yakima Valley is a huge player .
These are big operations that are difficult to track down , " Beghtol said .
" They use fictitious names , they put property in daughters ' , wives ' names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture . "
There have been 22 arrests this year .
Authorities expect that number to rise as aerial surveillance begins later this summer .
As arrests mount , vineyard purchases by marijuana growers will likely decline , predicts Vicky Scharlau , executive director of the Washington Association of Wine Grape Growers .
" I suspect after you 've had numerous busts , somebody 's future plan for growing pot in vineyards is going to be thwarted , " she said .
China , now more than ever , wishes to become technology independent .
Following the nation ’s impressive show to the world at the summer Olympics in Beijing , China hopes to continue its rise .
Already producing its own automobiles , China is looking to the next industrial area for growth – technology .
In particular , there is a specific reason that China is looking to make its own CPUs , and that ’s because current U.S. laws prohibit the export of state - of - the - art microprocessors into certain nations .
China is now looking to design its own chips so that it will not have to use generations - old hardware .
" Twenty years ago in China , we did n’t support R&D for microprocessors , " said Zhiwei Xu , deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ’ Institute of Computing Technology ( ICT ) , according to Technology Review .
" The decision makers and [ Chinese ] IT community have come to realize that CPUs [ central processing units ] are important . "
The Chinese Academy of Sciences ’ Institute of Computing Technology started design of China ’s first general - purpose CPU in 2001 , with the single - core chip named Godson - 1 emerging the year after .
The Godson - 2 lived throughout 2003 to 2006 , with each iteration faster than the last .
While the Godson chips are Chinese designed , they are actually manufactured by ST Microelectronics and can be bought under the commercial name of Loongson .
Like the rest of the CPU world , the next step is in multiple cores .
Xu revealed during a presentation at last week ’s Hot Chips conference in Palo Alto that the Godson - 3 will contain four cores and is slated for completion sometime in 2009 .
An eight core version is also in the works , with the design currently planned for a 65 nm process .
The Godson - 3 is to be scalable , with more cores easily added without significant changes in design , and contain power - saving features .
Perhaps the biggest upgrade for the Godson - 3 is the 200 addition instructions that will allow the Chinese chip to run x86 code .
The upcoming chip hopes to dodge any license fees for Intel , as the Godson - 3 will only simulate the x86 architecture .
Because of this setup , Intel patent attorney Erik Metzger believes that the Godsend - 3 will only perform at 80 percent of the speed of a native x86 chip .
Understandably , Intel is keeping a close eye on its x86 patents and the work of the ICT .
The Government has decided to introduce next year 's Budget six weeks early .
Budget day will now be 14 October in response to the economic challenges facing the State 's finances .
Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan said he would use the early Budget to set out the steps he proposes to stabilise and restore balance to the public finances .
He said this would include prioritising current and capital spending to reflect ' the changed realities ' .
The Minister for Justice later denied that the Government has been panicked into announcing an early Budget .
Dermot Ahern said the CSO figures released yesterday indicated a rapid turnaround which he said had to be dealt with .
The Minister stressed the Government had a job to do and must react to all situations .
He also expressed his hope that the Opposition would react to the development in a positive and constructive way .
No Govt plan for crisis : Opposition
The Government says the move would indicate changes to spending plans in the light of expected tax revenues , and would give ' clarity and confidence to investors and taxpayers alike ' .
Capital spending will be prioritised within the National Development Plan ' to boost confidence in the underlying strength of the economy , to protect the environment and to build sustainable competitiveness in the economy as a whole . '
Opposition parties have said the Government 's decision showed that it realises the extent of the crisis , but it claimed there was no indication that there was a coherent plan to deal with it .
Fine Gael Finance Spokesman Richard Bruton said the announcement is about filling a publicity cycle and is not based on a clear strategy .
Mr Bruton said that without such a strategy the public are likely to face emergency tax measures in October .
The Labour Party 's Joan Burton said the Dáil must be recalled next week for an on - the - record debate on the nation 's finances .
Ms Burton called for a National Recovery Programme to set out a road map for recovery , including commitments to essential long - term investment in infrastructure .
Arthur Morgan of Sinn Féin claimed the Government is out of their depth and said cutbacks in public spending which undermine frontline services will not be tolerated .

The boss , writing , says , " I 'll shorten that to ' team player ' ? "
Is this it ?
Is this the very first image of a planet orbiting a star like the Sun ?
The image come from the monster 8 meter Gemini North telescope in Hawaii .
The star is 1RSX J160929.1-210524 ( for those taking notes at home ) -- it 's a K7 dwarf , a bit cooler and smaller than the Sun -- and the planet is the blip circled at the upper left .
It has no real name as yet -- it has n't been confirmed yet ; more on that in a sec -- but if it 's a planet orbiting the star , it has a mass of about 8 times that of Jupiter .
The image is in near - infrared , just outside the human range of vision .
This is a good place to hunt for young planets , because for millions of years after they are formed , planets are hot and glow in the infrared , while stars like the Sun are faint in the IR .
Well , relatively faint ; they still pour out energy , but it 's a lot less than in the visible part of the spectrum .
So using IR detectors means you 're looking where young planets put out most of their light , and stars put out the least .
The planet seen by Gemini appears to be about 5 million years old -- the parent star is part of a cluster of stars whose age is known .
They lie about 500 light years from Earth .
Spectra of the star and planet .
Click to embiggen .
The reason astronomers think this is a planet is because they took spectra : they broke the light up into a rainbow , if you will , and when you carefully examine the spectrum you can determine all sorts of things about the object emitting the light : how hot it is , what chemical composition it has , how old it is , even if it 's spinning !
The spectrum of the object matches that of an old , very low mass star .
That might make you think it 's a star , but wait !
The planet is young , and still hot .
The light it gives off depends on its temperature , so a young low mass object , like a planet , can look just like a more massive object like a star .
Since we know this object is young , we know it has a lower mass than its spectrum naively suggests .
When models of how planets cool are used , we get a pretty good match for one with 8 times Jupiter 's mass if it 's the age of the star cluster , 5 million years .
But this is not confirmed !
For example , it could be a low mass star that happens to be near the other star along our line - of - sight -- in other words , it 's in the background .
The best way to see if that 's true is to wait a year or two and take more images .
If the object moves against the background stars along with the brighter star , then it must be physically associated with the star , and therefore it 's a planet .
This is how we confirmed the first image of an exoplanet back in 2005 -- but that was orbiting a brown dwarf , a star very different than the Sun .
If confirmed , this one is pretty important , because the parent star is much like our own Sun .
The most interesting thing about this is the distance of the purported planet from the star : 50 billion kilometers !
That 's 11 times the distance Neptune is from the Sun .
And that 's a lower limit ; it might be farther .
That makes me very suspicious : we do n't know of any way to form planets that far from their parent stars .
Stars and planets form from rotating disks of gas and dust .
The stuff collects in the middle to form the star , and the stuff farther out forms the planets -- we have seen many examples of this in the sky .
The disks we see around new stars are big , sure , but by the time you get 50 billion km out they are very thin , and there 's just not enough material out there to form a planet , let alone one with 8 times the mass of Jupiter .
In this case , the most likely explanations for this image are that 1 ) this is n't a planet , but a background star , or 2 ) it formed closer in and was ejected by an encounter with another planet , moving it way the heck out from the star .
( 1 ) is a bummer , and is unlikely just due to statistics ; it 's is n't high odds to see an object like this by coincidence so near another star .
( 2 ) seems unlikely to me as well ; it 's hard to toss around a planet that mass unless an even more massive planet was involved .
I hope this star is a target for searches for more planets , just to get more information on this scenario .
To their credit , the astronomers involved are also clear about this in their paper announcing the discovery .
This is a carefully done observations , and they are appropriately careful in their announcement .
But if it 's true ...
WOW .
This would be the second planet ever seen directly in an image , and the first to orbit a star like the Sun .
The implications would profound .
It would be direct evidence of planets orbiting other stars at great distances .
It would mean there could be another planet in our own solar system ( unlikely , but I 've written about that before ) .
And it would mean that it 's possible to use this method of near - infrared mapping to actually get pictures of more planets !
Seeing one might be a fluke , seeing two means there are more to find .
The next clear night , do yourself a favor : go outside .
Look up .
See all those stars ?
Whether or not this particular planet pans out , we still know that a large fraction of those stars -- 10 % ? 20 ? -- may have planets .
And some fraction of those may have planets like Earth orbiting them .
We really were n't sure about this even 15 years ago , and now we 're able to not only start plugging numbers into the equations , but we can actually take pictures of some of these objects .
My oh my .
How I do love science .

' It seemed to be a body from WWII '
A team of Australian investigators is preparing an expedition to the arduous Kokoda Trail in Papua New Guinea , after a hiker spotted what is believed to be the body of a World War II airman hanging from a tree .
The BBC's Becky Branford found out more .
History is alive on the densely forested slopes north of Port Moresby , the Papua New Guinea capital .
What appear to be the " feet " are visible in the canopy ( image courtesy of Lisa Fabre )
In pictures
The hillsides around what is known as the Kokoda Trail are littered with rusting guns , grenades and mortars - reminders of the strategically crucial battles that raged there in 1942 and 1943 .
Hundreds of Australians lost their lives fighting off an invading Japanese force that probably planned to use Port Moresby as a bridgehead for an assault on the Australian mainland .
Japanese losses were several times heavier .
David Collins , who leads treks along the Kokoda Trail , is used to imagining how the stench of death , sickness and starvation once hung heavy in the air in what is now a verdant and peaceful landscape .
But he little imagined that he would one day be confronted with what is probably the corpse of one of the many fighters who lost their lives .
' The wind caught it '
Mr Collins was leading an expedition of 19 assorted off - duty police officers , businessmen and photographers along the Trail - thought to be some of the most rugged hiking terrain in the world .
If it had been me , I would never have discovered the body , but when it started swinging back and forth , you could see the shape of it
David Collins
Expedition leader
The discovery was made on 28 August , by one of the members of the expedition - a man who has requested to be referred to only as John .
He had stopped to take a photo of flowers in the canopy , Mr Collins told the BBC .
" If you knew the trek , you do n't often look up , because you 're watching your footfall the whole time - it 's very slippery and muddy , and can be quite dangerous , " Mr Collins said .
" John stopped to take a photo of the canopy , and saw something that did n't seem quite right through his viewfinder .
He watched it for a little bit longer and the wind blew , and caught it , sending it spinning , and it seemed to be a body . "
There was an immediate sense that an exciting discovery had been made , Mr Collins said , and other members of the expedition team were called back to take a look for themselves .
That it was a body was not immediately apparent , Mr Collins said .
" I 'll be honest , I could n't even see it at first , because it was quite high up in the canopy , about 12 - 15 metres [ 40 - 50 feet ] up , " he said .
" But once again the wind blew , and it started spinning and dangling .
That was when you could make out the shape of a body .
But it was covered in moss , and if it had been me , I would never have discovered it , even looking straight at it , but when it started swinging back and forth , you could see the shape of it .
" And when it swung backwards it had around it what looked like a sort of aluminium frame or harness , and it appeared to be caught in a cable in the tree . "
The assumption at this point , said Mr Collins , is that the body - if it is a body - is that of an airman who was wearing some kind of parachute harness at the time of his death .
One expedition member even thought he could make out a moss - covered pair of flying goggles around the corpse 's neck .
Mysteries
If the find is confirmed , one key question will be how the body survived decades hanging in the tree .
The extreme elevation of the forest in which the body was found - about 2,200 m ( 7,220 feet ) above sea could have helped to preserve the body .
Moss would then have grown over it , preserving its shape .
Another mystery is the nationality of the airman - whether he was from Japan , Australia or the United States , which also had forces in the area .
Fighters from all sides remain unaccounted for .
The Australian Defence Department is sending a team to the isolated spot , along with a group of Papua New Guinean expedition porters , to try to recover the apparent remains in the coming days .
For Australians , the area is hallowed ground , Mr Collins said .
During World War II , the region was part of territory governed by Australia - it is believed the only time that Australians have had to fight on their own soil .
Their ultimately successful campaign in the area also proved a turning point in the struggle for the Pacific .
This discovery serves as a poignant reminder of the horror wrought by war , some 65 years on .

It sounds like every thrift store shopper ’s dream .
Teri Horton , a 75 - year - old former long - haul trucker , bought a painting for a friend as a gag in a California thrift store , only to learn that it could be a lost masterpiece by Jackson Pollock worth more than $ 50,000,000 .
The original price tag : $ 5 .
“ I saw it at the shop and I asked how much they wanted for it .
They told me eight dollars , ” says Horton .
“ I told them , ‘ I love my friend , but I do n’t love her that much .
I ’ll give you five . ’ ”
When the painting would n’t fit into her friend ’s mobile home , Horton brought it back to hers and eventually tried to sell it at a yard sale .
When a local art teacher remarked that the painting could be a Pollock , Horton responded with what would later become the title of a documentary about her find : “ Who the Fuck is Jackson Pollock ? ”
The Phoenix Art Museum will be showing
Who the # $& % is Jackson Pollock on Tuesday as part of its Contemporary Forum Summer Film Festival ( as reported by Lilia Menconi in her piece " Art Breaker " ) .
Horton will be in attendance to present the movie and offer insights into her struggle to promote her painting as a legitimate Pollock despite biting opposition from the established art world .
Horton ’s painting lacks a signature and any proof of provenance .
None of this has slowed down Horton , who enlisted the help of forensic scientist Peter Paul Biro to try and identify the painting ’s origin .
On the back of the piece , Biro discovered a nearly complete fingerprint left in paint .
Since Pollock never served in the army or went to prison , there are no records of his finger prints .
Biro headed to Pollock ’s New York studio , where he found a fingerprint on a can of blue paint , which he says is a perfect match to the one found on the back of Horton ’s painting .
Biro also reported that he matched paint samples from the painting to paint found on the floor of Pollock ’s studio , which has been preserved as a museum .
Such strong forensic evidence would seem to confirm that the painting is an authentic work , but the art community as a whole remains skeptical .
Thomas Hoving , a former director and curator of New York ’s Metropolitan Museum , had the opportunity to examine the painting and came away unconvinced .
“ It has no Pollock heart or soul … I do n’t believe it ’s a Jackson Pollock , ” Hoving told the filmmakers in the documentary .
Many others in the art community agree with his skepticism , and some experts have challenged the forensic evidence found by Biro .
But Horton says their rejection of the painting has less to do with the work and more to do with her .
“ Here I am , a former truck driver .
I ’m 75 with an eighth grade education , ” Horton says .
“ I do n’t fit into the elite New York art world .
If a lady of name had found this painting , it would have been sold a long time ago .
But they do n’t want to listen to me . ”
While the painting remains unsold , its story has attracted a lot of attention over the years .
In addition to appearances on programs like The Montel Williams Show , Late Night with David Letterman and The Late Show with Jay Leno , Horton has discussed her painting with The New York Times and 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper .
This publicity has resulted in a few offers for the painting , including a recent bid of $ 9 million , but Horton says she ’s not going to accept less then the painting ’s real worth .
A recent sale of Jackson Pollock ’s No. 5,1948 sold for $ 140,000,000 dollars according to the New York Times .
This sale , which has not been officially confirmed , would be the highest known price ever paid for a single painting .
“ The reason I did n’t sell the painting for the money I was offered was because of the principle .
I thought if you ’re fair with me , then I ’ll be fair with you .
I ’ve heard from people around the world who have Picassos and Turners and they ca n’t get them into the art houses , and it ’s only because of who they are , ” says Horton .
Despite the setbacks , Horton keeps a positive attitude about the tribulations she has endured over that $ 5 purchase .
She maintains that someday people will have no alternative other then to listen to what she has to say , and that day will make the fight worthwhile .
“ The day will come when you wo n’t be able to sell a painting without the forensic evidence to back it up , no matter who you are , ” says Horton . “ I just hope that day comes while I ’m still around . ”
INDIANAPOLIS --
A gloomy economic outlook is providing a ray of sunshine for Barack Obama in the Republican stronghold of Indiana , pinching rival John McCain 's efforts to hold onto once - reliable electoral votes .
Less than a month before Election Day -- a time when candidates usually focus their travel on traditional battlegrounds -- the 2008 Democratic presidential nominee came Wednesday to a state that has n't voted for one since 1964 .
Sen .
Obama 's visit here was his sixth since winning the nomination in early June .
Speaking ...
She said : " He came out from behind a screen and told me that he would not be allowing me to buy the pill from him because he had a right to refuse to sell it on the basis of his personal beliefs .
A Long Beach police officer on Wednesday shot and wounded an off - duty Los Angeles police officer who allegedly brandished a shotgun and ignored officers ’ orders to drop the weapon .
Jason Geggie , 26 , an LAPD officer for 1 1/ 2 years and the son of an LAPD lieutenant , was shot in the arm and torso after he tried to flee Long Beach officers and then refused to surrender , Long Beach police officials said .
The shootings of officers by officers can be delicate matters for the agencies involved , and this one is especially so because of Geggie ’s father , who is said to have close relationships with members of the LAPD ’s senior command staff .
Word of the shooting spread quickly through the LAPD ’s upper ranks , and several senior department officials went to the scene of the shooting .
“ It is a very unfortunate set of circumstances .
It is one of ours , ” said one high - ranking LAPD official who requested anonymity , citing the Long Beach department ’s investigation .
“ We are desperately trying to unravel what happened . ”

Los Angeles Police Commissioner Alan Skobin called the shooting a tragedy “ for everybody involved . ”
Few details were released Wednesday as both Long Beach and Los Angeles police started investigations .
As Long Beach detectives continued their probe -- which included obtaining a search warrant for Geggie ’s home -- investigators from the LAPD ’s internal affairs group launched a personnel inquiry into Geggie .
The Los Angeles County district attorney ’s office also dispatched staff to conduct an independent investigation , which is common in cases involving police shootings .
Long Beach police said they responded about 12:30 a.m. to a 911 call reporting a man brandishing a firearm and walking in the street near Termino Avenue and 4th Street , close to the city ’s tony Belmont Heights area .
Officers found Geggie , who matched the description provided by the caller , in the 200 block of Mira Mar Avenue and confronted him , said Long Beach police spokeswoman Sgt. Dina Zapalski .
Geggie tried to flee , Zapalski said , but the officers quickly caught up to him and ordered him to drop the shotgun he was holding .

“ He refused and that is when the officer - involved shooting occurred , ” she said .
Geggie was taken to a local hospital , where he remained in stable condition Wednesday evening with “ non-life threatening injuries , ” Zapalski said .
The officer , a Long Beach resident , has been charged with “ exhibiting a firearm in the presence of a police officer in a threatening manner ” and threatening a civilian with a firearm .
The shotgun was recovered at the scene , according to Long Beach police .
Geggie ’s father , who works in the LAPD ’s risk assessment department , and other immediate relatives could not be reached for comment .
A person close to Geggie spoke on the condition that his name not be used because Geggie ’s family asked that no comments be made ; he said he knew of no major personal or professional problems Geggie was facing that could have left him distressed .
“ He is just one of the most easygoing people I know , ” he said .
Geggie was recently assigned to the LAPD ’s Central Traffic Division .
