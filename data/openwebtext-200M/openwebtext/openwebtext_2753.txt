WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama signed an executive order granting some benefits to same - sex partners of federal employees Wednesday , calling it " a historic step " but promising more action to come .
President Obama has been criticized by gay rights activists for not doing more since taking office .
" We 've got more work to do to ensure that government treats all its citizens equally , to fight injustice and intolerance in all its forms and to bring about that more perfect union , " Obama said .
The signing followed sharp criticism of the president over a Justice Department motion filed last week in support of the Defense of Marriage Act -- which effectively bars the federal government from recognizing same - sex unions .
Obama said he still wants to repeal the act .
" I believe it 's discriminatory .
I think it interferes with state 's rights , and we will work with Congress to overturn it , " he said .
The memorandum he signed Wednesday means same - sex partners of civil service employees can be added to the long - term care program , employees can use their sick leave to take care of domestic partners and children and same - sex partners of Foreign Service employees will be included in medical evacuations and housing allocations , according to the White House .
But it does not grant full health - care coverage , which would require an act of Congress , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
As details of the impending memorandum began to filter out Wednesday , the reaction of some gay rights activists was not enthusiastic .
" I have to say , as a federal employee , I 'm really disappointed , " Lisa Polyak , 48 , of Baltimore , Maryland , said of Obama 's expected memorandum .
Polyak , who has worked for the federal government for more than two decades , is with the Army Medical Department .
She was among the two dozen authors of the Dallas Principles , a set of eight statements that seek to guide the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community toward " full civil equality , " according to the document 's preamble .

" The benefits that the president might be announcing are already available , " said Polyak , who has a partner and two children .
" This is n't new .
This is n't different . "
She said federal employees are able to take sick leave for " anyone that was the close approximation of family " and said the long - term - care option has been available for people under the same category .
Polyak said not having health insurance from the federal government for her partner of 27 years costs her family $ 4,000 to $ 5,000 a year , not including co-pays or deductibles .
Asked in a conference call with reporters whether these benefits were already available to same - sex partners of federal employees , Berry said such benefits are " subject to the whim of a supervisor . "
" If you have an enlightened supervisor , yes , that is a possibility ( that they have been available ) , " he said .
" What the president is doing today is making this no longer optional .
He is making it mandatory .
And he 's making it clear that this is now the policy of the federal government . "
Polyak disagreed , saying , " The idea that this was a fly - by - night [ is ] ... not true .
I used it routinely . "
She added , " It was guidance that everyone took advantage of and continues to take advantage at this moment . "
Gay and lesbian advocates have also faulted the Obama administration for not moving to repeal the military 's " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " policy that bars officials from asking about a service member 's sexual orientation but also bars the service member from revealing it , and allows the dismissal of a service member if a same - sax orientation is discovered .
" There 's so little we can say until we know what it is , " said Carisa Cunningham , a spokeswoman for Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders , a legal advocacy group that is challenging Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act in federal court in Massachusetts .
Section 3 prevents the federal government from giving Social Security and other protections to same - sex married couples .
" Laws have to change ... and in particular , the Defense of Marriage Act needs to change , so whatever the few benefits that the president as an employer can grant , there wo n't be a lot of them , " Cunningham said .
President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law in 1996 .
Obama rankled gay advocates in January when he selected mega-church pastor Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration .
Warren , in an interview with Beliefnet , likened homosexuality to bestiality and incest .
He also supported California 's Proposition 8 , which banned same - sex marriage in that state .
During the Warren controversy , Obama -- who frequently spoke out in favor of gay and lesbian rights during the campaign but has said he opposes same - sex marriage -- declared himself " a fierce advocate for gay and lesbian Americans . "

About the authors
The health care industry has spent $ 134 million on lobbying this year to keep its profits high and public health in the shadows .
In 2003 , a young Illinois state senator named Barack Obama told a local AFL - CIO meeting , " I am a proponent of a single - payer universal health care program .
" Single payer .
Universal .
That 's health coverage , like Medicare , but for everyone who wants it .
Single payer eliminates insurance companies as pricey middlemen .
The government pays care providers directly .
It 's a system that polls consistently have shown the American people favoring by as much as two - to - one .
There was only one thing standing in the way , Obama said six years ago : " All of you know we might not get there immediately because first we have to take back the White House , we have to take back the Senate and we have to take back the House .
" Fast forward six years .
President Obama has everything he said was needed - Democrats in control of the executive branch and both chambers of Congress .
So what 's happened to single payer ?
A woman at his town hall meeting in New Mexico last week asked him exactly that .
" If I were starting a system from scratch , then I think that the idea of moving towards a single - payer system could very well make sense , " the President replied .
" That 's the kind of system that you have in most industrialized countries around the world .
" The only problem is that we 're not starting from scratch .
We have historically a tradition of employer - based health care .
And although there are a lot of people who are not satisfied with their health care , the truth is , is that the vast majority of people currently get health care from their employers and you 've got this system that 's already in place .
We do n't want a huge disruption as we go into health care reform where suddenly we 're trying to completely reinvent one - sixth of the economy .
" So the banks were too big to fail and now , apparently , health care is too big to fix , at least the way a majority of people indicate they would like it to be fixed , with a single payer option .
President Obama favors a public health plan competing with the medical cartel that he hopes will create a real market that would bring down costs .
But single payer has vanished from his radar .
Nor is single payer getting much coverage in the mainstream media .
Barely a mention was given to the hundreds of doctors , nurses and other health care professionals who came to Washington last week to protest the absence of official debate over single payer .
Is it the proverbial tree falling in the forest , making a noise that journalists can't or wo n't hear ?
Could the indifference of the press be because both the President of the United States and Congress have been avoiding single payer like , well , like the plague ?
As we see so often , government officials set the agenda by what they do and do n't talk about .
Instead , President Obama is looking for consensus , seeking peace among all the parties involved .
Except for single payer advocates .
At that big White House powwow in Washington last week , the President asked representatives of the health care business to reason together with him .
" What 's brought us all together today is a recognition that we can't continue down the same dangerous road we 've been traveling for so many years , " he said , " that costs are out of control ; and that reform is not a luxury that can be postponed , but a necessity that cannot wait .
"
They came , listened , made nice for the photo op and while they failed to participate in a hearty chorus of " Kumbaya , " they did promise to cut health care costs voluntarily over the next ten years .
The press ate it up - and Mr. Obama was a happy man .
Meanwhile , some of us looking on - those of us who 've been around a long time - were scratching our heads .
Had n't we heard this before ?
Way , way back in the 1970's Americans were riled up over the rising costs of health care .
As a presidential candidate , Jimmy Carter started talking about the government clamping down .
When he got to the White House , drug makers , insurance companies , hospitals and doctors - the very people who only a decade earlier had done everything they could to strangle Medicare in the cradle - seemed uncharacteristically humble and cooperative .
" You do n't have to make us cut costs , " they promised .
" We 'll do it voluntarily .
" So Uncle Sam backed down , and you guessed it .
Pretty soon medical costs were soaring higher than ever .
By the early '90s , the public was once again hurting in the pocketbook .
Feeling our pain , Bill and Hillary Clinton tried again , coming up with a plan only slightly more complicated than the schematics for an F - 18 fighter jet .
This time the health industry acted more like Tony Soprano than Mother Teresa .
It bludgeoned the Clinton reforms with one of the most expensive and deceitful public relations and advertising campaigns ever conceived - paid for , of course , from the industry 's swollen profits .
As the drug and insurance companies , hospitals and doctors dumped the mangled carcass of reform into the Potomac , securely encased in concrete , once again they said do n't worry ; they would cut costs voluntarily .
If you believed that , we 've got a toll - free bridge to the Mayo Clinic we 'd like to sell you .
So anyone with any memory left could be excused for raising their eyebrows at the health care industry 's latest promises .
As if on cue , hardly had their pledge of volunteerism rung out across the land than Jay Gellert , chief executive of Health Net Inc. and chair of the lobbying group America 's Health Insurance Plans , assured his pals not to worry abut the voluntary reductions .
" We believe that we can do it without undermining the viability of companies , " he said , " and in effect enhancing the payment to physicians and hospitals . "
In other words , their so - called voluntary " reforms " will in no way interfere with maximizing profits .
Also last week , John Lechleiter , the chief executive of drug giant Eli Lilly , blasted universal health care in a speech before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce : " I do not believe that policymakers have yet arrived at a full and complete diagnosis of what 's wrong and what 's right with U.S. health care , " he declared .
" And I am very concerned that some of the proposed policies - the treatments , to continue my metaphor - will have unintended side - effects that make our situation worse .
" So why bother with the charm offensive on Pennsylvania Avenue ?
Could it be , as some critics suggest , a Trojan horse , getting the health industry a place at the table so they can leap up at the right moment and again knife to death any real reform ?
Wheelers and dealers from the health sector are n't waiting for that moment .
According to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics , they 've spent more than $ 134 million on lobbying in the first quarter of 2009 alone .
And some already are shelling out big bucks for a publicity blitz and ads attacking any health care reform that threatens to reduce the profits from sickness and disease .
The Washington Post 's health care reform blog reported Tuesday that Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina has hired an outside PR firm to put together a video campaign assaulting Obama 's public plan .
And this month alone , the group Conservatives for Patients '
Rights is spending more than a million dollars for attack ads .
They 've hired a public relations firm called CRC - Creative Response Concepts .
You remember them - the same high - minded folks who brought you the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , the gang who savaged John Kerry 's service record in Vietnam .
The ads feature the chairman of Conservatives for Patients ' Rights , Rick Scott .
Who 's he ?
As a former deputy inspector general from the Department of Health and Human Services told The New York Times , " He hopes people do n't Google his name .
" Scott 's not a doctor ; he just acts like one on TV .
He 's an entrepreneur who took two hospitals in Texas and built them into the largest health care chain in the world , Columbia / HCA .
In 1997 , he was fired by the board of directors after Columbia / HCA was caught in a scheme that ripped off the Feds and state governments for hundreds of millions of dollars in bogus Medicare and Medicaid payments , the largest such fraud in history .
The company had to cough up $ 1.7 billion dollars to get out of the mess .
Rick Scott got off , you should excuse the expression , scot - free .
Better than , in fact .
According to published reports , he waltzed away with a $ 10 million severance deal and $ 300 million worth of stock .
So much for voluntarily lowering overhead .
With medical costs rising six percent per year , that 's who 's offering himself as a spokesman for the health care industry .
Speaking up for single payer is Geri Jenkins , a president of the California Nurses Association and National Nurses Organizing Committee - a registered nurse with literal hands - on experience .
"
We 're there around the clock , " she told our colleague Jessica Wang .
" So we feel a real sense of obligation to advocate for the best interests of our patients and the public .
Now , you can talk about policy but when you 're staring at a human face it 's a whole different story .

Saturday night , 6th of December 2008 , in the Exarhia area of Athens : a countercultural and libertarian stronghold .
A group of young people have a verbal altercation with two members of the police special forces .
The policemen leave the scene only to return after several minutes .
Suddenly , one of the officers , Epameinondas Korkoneas , removes his gun and fires into the group .
The bullet strikes and fatally wounds 15 year - old Alexis Grigoropoulos , who falls to the ground dead .
It was the incident that triggered more than 20 days of rioting and unrest that would shock the country .
They were “ the days and nights of Alexis ” as the participants have called them , in memory of the murdered boy .
Within hours of the shooting , the news spread via the Internet and mobile phones , and the first spontaneous protests took place in Athens and in other Greek cities .
People who had been enjoying their Saturday night drink in the centre of Athens took to the streets in anger .
Schools and universities were occupied by students .
Occupations took place as well in public buildings , such as town halls and the trade union confederation ’s headquarters .
There were interruptions in many theatrical plays , where students intervened and asked for solidarity in their uprising .
In a remarkable activist movement , protesters interrupted the news by entering the studio of the Greek public television station .
While presenting a statement by the Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis , regular programming was interrupted and viewers saw the occupiers inside the studio holding banners declaring : “ Stop watching television and get to the streets ! ” and “ Freedom to the prisoners of the revolt ” .
A giant banner was hung over the Parthenon displaying the word “ resistance ” in several languages .
Even the giant Christmas tree in the central square of Athens was set aflame .
As the rebels declared , “ Christmas is postponed …. we are in revolt ! ”
The international impact of the events in Greece was also remarkable .
Demonstrations of solidarity took place in countless cities around the world .
From the mountains of Mexico , Subcommandante Marcos , the leader of the Zapatistas , was so impressed by the events in Greece that he made a statement in Greek , expressing his solidarity with the revolt : “ Women and men comrades , revolted Greece …we , the smallest , from this corner of the world , salute you .
Accept our respect and our admiration for what you think and do .
From far away , we learn from you .
We thank you ” ( translated from Greek by the author ) .
Closer to Greece , in France , President Sarkozy postponed his scheduled reform of the educational system , fearing that the Greek phenomenon might extend to France where the memories of the 2005 ghetto riots and the 2006 anti-CPE unrest were still fresh .
“ Libération ” , the historic newspaper of France , took a clear stand in favor of the Greek rebellion , with a significant article entitled “ We are all Greeks ” .
However , despite good intentions the protests and the uprising in Greece lacked not only in organization , but also in specific demands and political targets as well .
Being unorganized , it was doomed to run out of steam and fail .
In the meantime , Greek society has polarized to an extent unprecedented in past decades .
The riots created a huge backlash .
There were occasions in some large cities like Patra , where furious citizens ( accompanied by extreme right wingers ) clashed with and beat the demonstrators .
According to some conservative commentators , a by - product of the December events is the appearance of a new wave of terrorism in Greece .
The urban guerilla groups of “ Revolutionary Struggle ” and “ Revolutionaries ’ Sect ” made a number of attacks in the following months against police officers , banks and television stations .
On the 16th of June 2009 , Revolutionaries ’
Sect executed a police officer with 24 bullets .
These brutal and unjustified actions alienated an even larger section of the population from the spirit of December ’s uprising , which now seems to have ceased to exist .
Evaluating December ’s Uprising
The first thing that needs to be asked , then , is what exactly happened in Greece ?
Some riots , merely ?
A revolt ?
No definitive answer can be given .
By calling them riots , we underestimate the events .
Riots are more about the reactionary expression of rage by a desperate minority , without any specific target .
The events in Brixton in 1981 and in Los Angeles in 1992 are typical examples of riots .
But in Greece , something more had occurred .
As the American scholar and activist Mike Davis pointed out in an interview in a Greek newspaper , the events were qualitatively more significant even than the Paris ghettos 2005 uprising , because in Greece there was a broad coalition in the streets , including students , wage earners , workers ( though few in number , admittedly ) , anarchists , lefts , leftists and immigrants .
In addition , the events were not just about smashing shops and clashing with the police .
The rebels took initiatives , tried to come closer to the society with a series of inspired and imaginative actions and tried to express an embryonic anti-systemic objective .
Davis , being perhaps too optimistic , compared the situation and the clashes in Greece with the uneasy days in Barcelona in the early 30s , preceding the Spanish revolution of 1936 - 1939 .
Is it therefore possible to speak about a Greek revolt ?
In the strict sense of the word , this is likely to be an exaggeration , as the uprising lacked organization and , most importantly , did not clearly forward any political question or any alternative social vision that was to be sought .
However , a number of characteristics of the events add credence to the argument that what happened in Greece came close to being a social revolt .
It is interesting to note that in an opinion poll carried out during the events , 60 % of the people , irrespective of whether they agreed with the rebellious youth or not , considered what was happening as a “ social revolt ” .
Indeed , people were on the streets not only to express their anger over the killing of an innocent 15 year - old boy .
This was the obvious trigger , but the reasons lie deeper .
Young people , the “ generation of 700 Euros ” as it is called ( a reference to their unacceptably low wages ) , were expressing their despair at the decidedly bleak prospects for the future that lay before them .
With the percentage of youth unemployment in Greece at 25 % , the highest in the European Union , young people are painfully aware that they can expect little from the existing political and economic system .
In addition , the fact that one in four families in Greece live below the poverty threshold shows that the conditions were fruitful for a social uprising .
People expressed their disgust for the corrupt political system and the arbitrariness of the police , which has a considerable record of violating essential human rights of citizens .
In addition , a large percentage of the protesters showed through their actions that they rejected the existing society with all its footholds : the police ( numerous attacks on police stations ) , the capital ( many banks were set ablaze ) and the modern opium of the people , that is , the society of the spectacle and the commodities ( attacks and attempted occupations of shopping malls and television and radio stations ) .
What went wrong ?
Alain Touraine has commented with regard to the May 1968 revolt in Paris : “ The May movement was creative only in what prevented it from succeeding , its spontaneity ” .
The same could be argued concerning the Greek movement : it has shown the limits and the dead ends of spontaneous and unorganized action .
An uprising is like a bicycle — at the point where it stops revolving and expanding , it tips over .
When the protesters or the would - be rebels do not concentrate and coordinate their actions towards some specific ends , the propulsive force of the movement is lost .
In the first three days , the escalation of the action was indeed satisfactory .
Rage motivated the first protesters to get out into the streets , and they were soon accompanied by wider parts of the population who also declared that they had enough with an unpromising and miserable life .
The principal rage expressed with barricades , vandalism and destruction gave way to more oriented actions such as university occupations and some attempts at coordination .
But these attempts did not succeed in embracing a large part of the society , nor did they manage to influence the economic life of the country ( as had occurred in France in 1968 , for example ) .
The organizational deficit could be explained by the major role that various anarchist teams had in the uprising and their faith in the power of spontaneity and dislike to any form of vanguard .
But as has happened many times in the past , this form of struggle seems to lead only to de-escalation and unavoidably to defeat .
However , this is not an attempt to blame the anarchists , for that is how they always thought and acted .
It is the movement itself that should have excluded this blind route .
As Lenin stated , “ Anarchism was not infrequently a kind of penalty for the opportunist sins of the working - class movement . ”
This leads us to the main reason for the failure of the movement to become something more threatening to the established power : the absence of a satisfactory intervention of the working class and its vanguard .
There is nothing wrong with young people playing a leading role in an uprising .
As professor Rousis stated in an article soon after the events , the average age of the French revolutionaries in 1789 was below 30 .
The same applied in the Bolshevik and the Cuban revolution , as well as in the May 1968 movement .
However , any movement that aspires to become something more than just an uprising or expression of complaint and despair needs a key player that can lead the society to a major change ; it needs a revolutionary subject .
Young people , because of the characteristics of their age , are in an advanced position to back a struggle .
But they are not a class per se and therefore they cannot be the driving force in a radical transformation of the society .
This key player can only be the working class .
By working class I do not only mean the traditional “ blue collars ” , but the vast majority of the population that is exploited by the existing system and sees even the few concessions that the capitalist state has let it in the past ( welfare state , etc. ) recalled .
Unfortunately , the working class and its vanguard , the Greek Communist Party ( KKE ) – one of the strongest communist parties in Europe , both in size and in theoretical revolutionary orientation – failed to intervene significantly and make the difference in the December ’s uprising .
The reasons vary .
The first and most obvious one is that a huge portion of the working class , overwhelmed and alienated by the system , abstains from any struggle , and even more from a struggle with the advanced anti-systemic characteristics of December .
The more pressing problem , however , concerns why the fighting vanguard of the working class had only a complementary role in the events .
The strong Greek Communist Party played a minor role in December , being extremely critical towards the spontaneity of the movement and the forms of action it took : especially the vandalisms and the burning of cars and shops .
It argued that what was happening was not a revolt , because the key player , i.e. the students and young people , cannot be the main revolutionary subject .
Therefore , the uprising had no chance in becoming more than just rioting , and was doomed to fail from the start .
Following its critical view , the KKE kept its distance .
Although its analysis was correct in its essence , by abstaining from the core of the events , it deprived the movement of any prospect of becoming something more promising .
It is true , the uprising was spontaneous and the working class was missing .
It seemed like what Lenin called “ a petty bourgeois driven to frenzy by the horrors of capitalism ” .
But as the leader of the Bolsheviks pointed out in “ What is to be done ” , spontaneity could represent consciousness in an embryonic form .
In addition , “ The greater the spontaneous upsurge of the masses and the more widespread the movement , the more rapid , incomparably so , the demand for greater consciousness in the theoretical , political and organisational work of Social - Democracy ( as the communists were then called ) ” .
It is true that the forms of action that the movement followed were not all correct and that they disoriented people and produced a social backlash .
This was predictable and understandable , as a large majority of the protesters were quite young with no experience of political or social struggle .
But , again according to Lenin , “ Mistakes are inevitable when the masses are fighting , but the communists remain with the masses , see these mistakes , explain them to the masses , try to get them rectified , and strive perseveringly for the victory of class consciousness over spontaneity . ”
The failure of the intervention by the working class and its vanguard and the failure of the movement to subordinate spontaneity to conscious action lead the uprising to disorientation , lack of strategic direction and , inevitably , deflation .
Elite reaction to the uprising
It is interesting to observe how the system reacts in a social crisis like the December uprising , because it unmasks the democratic guise of the bourgeois state .
As it is known , the state has two tools for keeping people subordinate : persuasion / trickery and bald violence .
When the first fails , there is no hesitation in proceeding to the second .
A combination of trickery and violence was what the ruling system of Greece followed in the December events .
In the beginning , the government and the media put on a show of sympathy for the death of the boy and expressed an understanding of the rage felt by the people in the streets .
The events can be seen to follow a classic blueprint : during the first two days the police did not intervene and let a minority of the protesters proceed in vandalisms , thus spreading an atmosphere of chaos and anarchy .
This created fear in a large part of the population and thereafter , the police had a carte blanche to proceed in a wild repression , without any discrimination , against anyone on the streets .
Arrests , beatings and humiliations in the police stations were the daily provision .
In the city of Larissa , 18 people , including 14 year - old students , were arrested under anti-terrorism laws .
There were documents in the media showing policemen dressed as protesters , with their faces covered and holding clubs .
Many protesters argued that camouflaged policemen damaged some small shops , so as to turn public opinion against the uprising .
Similarly underhanded was the coverage of the events by the mainstream media , which gave disproportionate attention to the vandalisms , while at the same time underestimating or hiding the brutality of police repression .
The masked hooligan was presented as the typical sample of a protester , while the uncertainties and concerns of young people concerning their future , the force that drove them into the streets , was absent from the 8 o’clock news .
The propaganda of the right wing government of Nea Dimokratia and the far right party of LAOS reached unprecedented levels , implying even that the protests were organized by secret agents of a dark force bent on harming Greece !
During the events , the importance of independent information ( blogs , Indymedia and others ) emerged , as they brought to attention news and events that the mainstream media suppressed .
Conclusion
As capitalism ’s contradictions evolve and become clearer , phenomena like the December uprising will occur with increasing frequency and fervor .
Whether they will have a significant impact towards a radical change will depend on the maturity and the consciousness of the masses , enriched by the experience of events like those of December .

In this courtroom sketch Omar Khadr , far left , sits with his defense team during a hearing in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba on Wednesday .
( ( Janet Hamlin , Pool / Associated Press ) )
CSIS ignored human - rights concerns and did not take Omar Khadr 's age into account in deciding to interview him at the U.S. military 's Guantanamo Bay prison , says a report from the independent committee that oversees the spy agency .
The Toronto - born Khadr , now 22 , is being held at the U.S. detention centre in Cuba for allegedly throwing a grenade in Afghanistan when he was 15 , killing an American soldier .
He is the only Western citizen still detained at Guantanamo .
A report from the security intelligence review committee ( SIRC ) , released Wednesday in Ottawa , said documents also show Khadr's U.S. captors threatened him with rape , kept him alone and would not let him sleep .
Canadian Security Intelligence Service officers questioned Khadr at Guantanamo Bay in 2003 and shared the results of their interrogations with the Americans .
However , the report did not find that CSIS was complicit in Khadr 's alleged torture at the hands of U.S. interrogators .
The committee recommended that CSIS take human - rights issues into consideration in future probes and also establish a policy framework to guide its dealings with young people .
" As part of this , the service should ensure that such interactions are guided by the same principles that are entrenched in Canadian and international law , " the SIRC report said .
CSIS reviewing report
CSIS " will give careful consideration to [ the report 's ] findings and recommendations , " the agency said in a statement .
" CSIS has had to adapt to the more recent phenomenon of youth radicalization and will consider SIRC 's findings as it continues to assess how it deals with this threat . "
Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan said , " We are reviewing the report with interest .
As you know , it deals with events that took place under the previous Liberal government . "
Since the Conservatives came to power , they have implemented a new CSIS protocol for dealing with people under age 18 , he added .
Former Manitoba premier Gary Filmon heads SIRC ( CBC )
Former Manitoba premier Gary Filmon heads SIRC , which spent a year reviewing Khadr 's treatment by Canadian officials .
" It 's pretty clear you can't just go in there with the objective of getting as much information as you can , " Filmon said .
" I do n't think anyone at that time paid attention to his age , his circumstances and that his human rights had to be considered . "
Filmon also questioned whether CSIS should have interrogated Khadr in a controversial venue like Guantanamo .
The torture allegations came to light after Khadr 's lawyers released a video of one of the CSIS interrogation sessions .
Khadr , who was 16 at the time , breaks down crying for his mother as an angry CSIS interrogator peppers him with questions .
Khadr lawyers subsequently learned that before the interrogation session began , his American captors tried to soften him up in preparation for an interview with intelligence officials from Canada 's Foreign Affairs Department .
They subjected him to something known as the " frequent flyer program . "
It 's a form of sleep deprivation in which a prisoner is moved to a new location every three hours for several weeks and often exposed to extreme hot and cold temperatures .
Human rights advocates say that fits the legal definition of torture .
Khadr 's lawyer faces removal from case
Meanwhile , another episode in the seemingly endless legal saga of the Canadian terror suspect took place in Guantanamo Wednesday .
After two cancelled trial dates and almost seven years in U.S. custody , infighting among Khadr 's Pentagon - appointed lawyers had threatened to derail his case again .
His Pentagon defence lawyer has been navy Cmdr. Bill Kuebler , but the new boss at the Pentagon 's legal department said he wants to remove Kuebler from the case .
Khadr told Judge Patrick Parrish he wants to hire a U.S. criminal lawyer from a big Washington , D.C. , firm to replace all of his military lawyers , whom he no longer trusts .
While Parrish was receptive to the idea , he was also concerned that Khadr would be in a bind in his complicated case without benefit of immediate legal advice .
Parrish ruled that Kuebler would remain in reserve for the time being until Khadr 's new lawyer got up to speed on the case .
Khadr 's Canadian lawyer , Dennis Edney , said Khadr , who had lost faith in his Pentagon lawyers , was satisfied with the outcome in court .
" Omar is very disappointed at the fighting that is taking place .
He 's very disappointed at the behaviour of Cmdr.
Kuebler at creating a divisive attitude amongst the military . "
Edney said Khadr has suffered one bad break after another .
" I always say that I 've never seen anyone who 's been so abused and so abandoned by so many who should know better . "
Khadr family 's al - Qaeda ties
Khadr road to Guantanamo began at age 15 when his father loaned him out to an al - Qaeda commander in Afghanistan .
That 's how he ended up in a firefight with U.S. soldiers , almost died from his wounds , was charged with murder , interrogated more than 100 times , and according to his lawyers , tortured .
Although President Barack Obama has ordered the prison closed , U.S. military prosecutors are continuing to build cases against 66 Guantanamo inmates , including Khadr .
Edney said as more evidence piles up showing that Khadr 's rights were violated , it puts pressure on the Canadian government to bring him back to Canada .
In April , the Federal Court of Canada ruled the government must ask the United States " as soon as practicable " to return Khadr home .
The government is appealing that decision .
The Khadr family has longstanding ties to al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
A purported financier and extremist with the network , Omar 's father , Ahmed Said Khadr , was killed by Pakistani forces in 2003 .
Omar 's brother Karim suffered wounds that left him a paraplegic in the shootout that killed their father .
Another brother , Abdullah , is accused by U.S. officials of supplying weapons to al - Qaeda .

Health care reform should mean all Americans can get coverage while allowing doctors to heal patients instead of being bureaucrats , President Obama told the American Medical Association on Monday .
The AMA agrees with Obama on the need for health care reform but not how to go about it .
In a speech to the 158th annual meeting of the doctors ' advocacy organization , Obama called an overhaul of the ailing health care system the most important issue for the nation 's long - term economic stability .
He acknowledged the concerns of doctors that reforms could bring a government - heavy system that would dictate how patients get treated and how much physicians get paid .
But he called such thinking wrong .
Obama urged all players -- doctors , patients , insurance companies , drug companies and the government -- to contribute to a workable system that would provide coverage for the 46 million uninsured Americans while reducing costs and increasing efficiency .
" You did not enter this profession to be bean - counters and paper - pushers , " Obama said to a standing ovation at the conference in Chicago , Illinois .
" You entered this profession to be healers , and that 's what our health care system should let you be . "
Obama has made health care reform a top priority of his young administration , and Congress will consider at least three proposals in coming weeks to address an issue that deeply divides Democrats and Republicans .
Watch Sen. John McCain discuss health care reform »
The AMA represents a powerful constituency of U.S. physicians , and its support is considered important in getting a bill through Congress .
Dr. J. James Rohack , president - elect of the AMA , welcomed Obama 's speech for acknowledging the challenges facing doctors , including excessive bureaucracy , the threat of malpractice lawsuits and medical students ' debt burdens .
The president 's 50 - minute speech detailed the problems of the U.S. health care system and presented his plans for confronting them .
He blamed some of the spiraling costs on a reimbursement system that he said pays for the number of tests and services provided , regardless of what is needed .
" It is a model that rewards the quantity of care rather than the quality of care ; that pushes you , the doctor , to see more and more patients even if you can't spend much time with each ; and gives you every incentive to order that extra MRI or EKG , even if it 's not truly necessary , " Obama said .
" It is a model that has taken the pursuit of medicine from a profession -- a calling -- to a business . "
He also cited unnecessary tests and procedures as part of a " defensive " medicine culture created in part by the risk of medical malpractice lawsuits .
To loud applause , he said ending unnecessary procedures could require restrictions on malpractice liability to protect doctors .
" I 'm not advocating caps on malpractice awards , which I personally believe can be unfair to people who 've been wrongfully harmed , but I do think we need to explore a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first , how to let doctors focus on practicing medicine , how to encourage broader use of evidence - based guidelines , " Obama said .

Rohack called for a " safe harbor " for doctors to determine treatment , warning that " unless we have protection in a courtroom for not ordering a test , we 're going to order that additional test . "
Obama 's speech advocated an end to health care insurance providers denying coverage for pre-existing conditions , with an emotional reference to his mother 's battle against cancer amid concerns of whether her treatment would be covered .
" Changing the current approach to pre-existing conditions is the least we can do -- for my mother and every other mother , father , son and daughter who has suffered under this practice , who 've been paying premiums and do n't get care , " he said to another ovation .
Any health care bill must include measures to modernize record - keeping with an electronic system that reduces paperwork and increases efficiency , and to emphasize preventive treatment to reduce overall illness and chronic conditions that sap the health care system , Obama said .
He defended his call for a government - funded health insurance option for people who are uninsured or cannot afford full coverage .
Obama repeated a promise that reforms will not require anyone to change from existing coverage but said an overhaul should include mandates for individuals to obtain coverage or employers to provide it .
A proposal from Sen. Edward Kennedy , D - Massachusetts , a longtime health care reform proponent , includes a public option as one choice for consumers .
Republican leaders adamantly oppose any public option , complaining it would lead to an eventual government takeover of health care similar to the cradle - to - grave coverage in Canada and England .
Kennedy 's health - care bill would cost $ 1 trillion over a decade and reduce the number of uninsured by about 16 million , according to a preliminary analysis released Monday on the the unfinished bill .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , which examined the unfinished bill with the the help of the Joint Committee on Taxation , said that the health - care bill would cost about $ 1 trillion over fiscal years 2010 to 2019 .
The AMA acknowledges the need for reforms but opposes any public option plan that forces physicians to participate , expands the fiscally challenged Medicare program for senior citizens or pays Medicare rates .
Obama outlined a series of steps to lower current costs and raise taxes to pay for an overhaul of the health care system .
His actions would realize almost $ 1 billion over the next 10 years in cost reductions , new revenue and other funding , which is roughly the amount that health care reforms would cost , the president said .
His plan includes reducing tax deductions for high - income Americans .
Another funding idea under consideration is taxing the medical benefits of employer - provided health coverage , which the Obama administration opposes but has not ruled out entirely .
Watch more about who pays for health care »
A national survey released last week by Diageo / Hotline found that 68 percent of those questioned opposed taxing health insurance benefits to provide funding for the enormous cost of expanding health care coverage to all Americans .
Possible alternatives to a public health insurance option include private cooperatives , like electricity cooperatives , owned and paid for by communities that would compete with existing insurance programs .
Supporters say such a program would require initial government support , but eventually would provide the kind of competition Obama seeks without creating a new government bureaucracy .
Watch Rep. Ron Paul weigh in on health care reform »
Obama said Monday that the nation is ready to overhaul the health care system after decades of debate with no substantive action .
" What makes this moment different is that this time -- for the first time -- key stakeholders are aligning not against , but in favor of reform , " he said .
" They are coming together out of a recognition that while reform will take everyone in our health care community doing their part , ultimately , everyone will benefit . "
As Obama spoke to doctors in Chicago , Senate Republican leaders in Washington intensified their attacks on the proposals , with one predicting " momentum will inevitably slow " as Americans learn the details of the complicated overhaul .
Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona , the No. 2 Republican in the Senate , also said it's " fairly unlikely " Republicans will back a Finance Committee bill that has been seen as the most likely measure in Congress to gain bipartisan support .
In speeches and press events on Capitol Hill , Republican leaders highlighted controversial aspects of the proposals that have drawn criticism from key doctor and hospital groups .
" Over the weekend , the administration proposed making cuts to Medicare as a way of deferring costs of a new government plan .
That is exactly the wrong approach , " Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said in speech on the Senate floor .
" America 's seniors expect Congress to stabilize Medicare so it continues to serve their needs , not drain its resources to pay for another even bigger government plan . "
Kyl said Obama 's proposals would lead to higher taxes , rationing of health care and too much government control of a sector that needs vibrant private sector involvement to thrive .
Kyl and McConnell introduced a bill Monday that would prevent the government from using comparative medical analysis to ration health care .
The stepped - up criticism came days before two Senate committees begin the process of formally passing their bills .
While GOP support for the Obama reforms has never been strong , Democrats have been negotiating with Republicans for months in hopes of bringing some on board .
CNN 's Paul Steinhauser and Ted Barrett contributed to this report .

Here is Russian rating for traditional Russian starters that are good with vodka too .
So meet top 15 Russian appetizers .
Famous Russian pickled cucumbers .
It ’s a must on all the Russian tables , goes fine with any dish .
Every Russian know them from the birth .

They put it in the fridge , right in the freezer , it is not cutted but in one big piece , then take it off , slice it thin and eat with Russian bread and garlic .
Fermented or sour cabbage is number three .
It ’s almost as popular as pickled cucumbers , and every old school Russian party has it .
Kids are being told stories that eating this cabbage would let them grow tall and strong .
Many Russians especially like drinking it ’s juice on hangover , together with the pickled cucumbers brine .
Russian meat jelly or aspic .
One of the most favourite cold meat dishes from Russia .
It takes a lot of meat first boiled and then left in cold place to the jelly appear , then is served with some toppings or just in this way .
Almost any Russian would tell you he ate it alot in childhood when family gathered to celebrate some New Year party or something other .
Potatoes .
Almost every Russian family eats potatoes daily , and on parties the potatoes is a must too .
Salami with Russian bread and butter .

Yes when we say caviar , we often keep in mind Russia .
It ’s true Russian people are mad about caviar and eat it very often on the big ocassions too , usually on bread , eating caviar with just a spoon always meant to be the sign of luxury in Russia .
Also because of its usually high price and non-availability in Soviet times it ’s not in the first five .
Pickled tomatoes .

One Rescued Dog Saves Another Dog
Months ago , a dog named Blewett was rescued from a snowy mountain overpass .
Now , he 's returned the favor by helping another lost dog find safety .
Back in March , a young black Labrador retriever was rescued from a snowy overpass in Washington ’s Cascade Mountains .
The dog was stuck on Blewett Pass for over a week , though many people attempted to coax him down .
He was willing to eat food out of their hands , but would n’t allow them to put a leash around his neck and guide him down to safety .
Finally , a Humane Society animal control officer teamed up with several volunteers to safely guide the dog down the mountain pass .
They named him Blewett , after his temporary mountain home , and brought him to a local animal shelter .
It did n’t take long for Blewett to find a happy forever home with a retired couple , Jay and Janie Smith — and now , the rescued dog is passing on the kindness he received .
Recently , the Smiths were taking Bluett for a walk on a trail when the dog began to bark at something he saw on the ground .
“ My wife thought it was a dead bear , ” Jay Smith told Wenatchee World .
The couple went home to pick up a pair of binoculars so that they could investigate the situation .
The animal turned out to be a large black dog — and luckily , it was alive .
While the Smiths got help from a local firefighter and a friend to reach the dog , using ropes to climb down the steep hill , Bluett ran straight down the hill and cuddled up beside the older dog to keep him warm .
The dog was uninjured , and a quick check of his tags revealed that he was named Pepper , and that he belonged to a neighbor ’s daughter .
The family had been searching for their missing dog all weekend , but had n’t had any luck until Blewett ’s remarkable rescue effort .
“ The whole thing is a miracle , ” Carol Hurt , the neighbor , told the Wenatchee World .
“ One big black lost dog found the other big black lost dog .
It ’s pretty heartwarming . ”
The brains of gay men resemble those of straight women , according to research published today that provides more evidence of the role of biology in sexual orientation .
Using brain - scanning equipment , researchers said they discovered similarities in the brain circuits that deal with language , perhaps explaining why homosexual men tend to outperform straight men on verbal skills tests -- as do heterosexual women .
The area of the brain that processes emotions also looked much the same in gay men and straight women -- and both groups have higher rates of depressive disorders than heterosexual men , researchers said .
The study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , however , found that the brain similarities were not as close in the case of gay women and straight men .

Previous studies have found evidence that sexual orientation is influenced by biological factors .
More than a decade ago , neurobiologist Simon LeVay reported that a key area of the hypothalamus , a brain structure linked to sexual behavior , was smaller in homosexual men than in heterosexual men .
The latest study , led by Dr. Ivanka Savic of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , was significant in that it looked at areas of the brain that have nothing to do with sexual behavior , suggesting that there was a basic biological link between sexual orientation and a range of brain functions .
“ The question is , how far does it go ? ” said Dr. Eric Vilain , who studies human sexual development at UCLA and was not involved in the study .
“ In gay men , the brain is feminized .
Is that limited to particular areas , or is the entire brain female - like ? ”
Vilain said his hunch was that the entire brain was not feminized because “ gay men have a number of masculine traits that are not present in women . ”
For example , he said , men regardless of sexual orientation tend to be interested in casual sex and are stimulated by sexually suggestive images .

Savic and her colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain volumes of two groups , each divided evenly between men and women : 50 heterosexuals and 40 homosexuals .
They knew going into the study that in men the right cerebral hemisphere is larger than the left , but in women the hemispheres are of equal size .
The results showed that gay men had symmetrical brains like those of straight women , and homosexual women had slightly asymmetrical brains like those of heterosexual men .
Symmetry is thought to favor verbal skills , the report said .
The differences were pronounced .
For example , the right cerebral hemisphere in heterosexual men was 624 cubic centimeters -- 12 cubic centimeters greater than the left side .
In homosexual men , the right hemisphere was 608 cubic centimeters -- 1 cubic centimeter smaller than the left .
In heterosexual women , there was no volume difference between right and left hemispheres .
But in homosexual women , their right hemisphere was 5 cubic centimeters larger than the left .

Next , researchers used positron emission topography to measure blood flow in the amygdala , a brain area involved in processing emotions .
The circuitry of the amygdala in gay men more closely resembled that of straight women than straight men , researchers said .
The amygdalas of gay women looked more like those of straight men , the report said .
Savic said she thought the brain differences originated in the womb or infancy , probably as a result of genetic or hormonal factors .
She said she could not explain why the differences were more pronounced in homosexual men than in homosexual women .
S. Marc Breedlove , a Michigan State University neuroscientist who studies sexual development , said that in his studies with rats , changes in prenatal levels of testosterone caused the sort of brain alterations that Savic observed .

The following blog post , unless otherwise noted , was written by a member of Gamasutras community .
The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company .
Twiggy Game was published in 1967 .
If you do n't know who Twiggy was , she was a extremely famous model in the 1960s , remarkable for both slenderness and flat - chestedness , representative of the Mod look , and occasional participant in Rowan & Martin 's Laugh - In .
For what godforsaken reason am I discussing Twiggy Game today ?
To make a point : the danger of lack of culture .
What do I mean by " lack of culture ? "
Just this : with novels , cinema , music and every other form of art , we have long - standing traditions of criticism , analysis , reviews , and discussion .
People know something of the history of the forms in which they are interested , something of the process of creation , and over time develop individual aesthetics , ideas by which they judge the merits , or lack thereof , of a particular product .
In the United States in the 1960s , no journal of which I am aware , except perhaps for some obscure fanzines ( like the original Strategy & Tactics ) , ever reviewed games .
With the exception of a handful of passionate game players and designers , like Sid Sackson , no one had anything like an aesthetic of games ; and the publishers thereof believed themselves to be in the packaged goods toy industry .
The idea of launching a novel game that was meritorious because of the nature of its gameplay , was utterly foreign to all game publishers , except perhaps for the short - lived 3M Games line .
Indeed , as the then - head of Milton Bradley , James J. Shea , makes clear in his history of the firm ( It 's All in the Game ) , the notion that gameplay mattered was viewed as a quaint concern that might have made sense in the halcyon days of Milton Bradley himself , or the era of George Parker , but had no role in the modern world of conglomerate business .
If the audience has no aesthetic , no basis on which to judge the intrinsic worth of a work , on what basis do they make purchasing decisions ?
There are only two ways to reach them , in fact .
One is by marketing " old favorites , " games with brand recognition because of their long history and exposure to the market .
The other is by exploiting a licensed brand .
Hence the Twiggy Game .
Hence the Welcome Back , Kotter game .
Hence thousands of other instantly - forgettable pieces of licensed drivel .
The same dynamic continues in today 's mass - market American boardgame market .
Though there are serious game aesthetes , no major media covers boardgames with any consistency , and those who prize and study boardgames are a minor elite with little exposure to a larger audience ; hence , the existence of the hobby boardgame market , that sells ( typically ) in the thousands of units , rather than the hundreds of thousands typical of the mass boardgame market .
This is at least an improvement over the 1960s , but the contrast with Germany , say is stark .
In Germany , there is what you might call a national boardgame culture , with major publications reviewing new games , a highly competitive set of publishers , and designers who are minor celebrities .
Consequently , many , perhaps most , of the best new boardgames are published out of Germany , and the American market is treated to the same old branded crap .
It 's not a phenomenon that is restricted to boardgames , either .
Consider the modern mobile game market .
In most markets , 90 + % of mobile games are sold off of the operator 's deck .
In other words , you find whatever menu on your phone that lets you browse downloadable games , and what you see is a list of games that the operator will provide to you , under contract from the publishers of these games .
In many cases , the only information you have to base a purchase decision on is the title of the game , along with the category in which the operator has put it ( " action " or " puzzle " or whatever ) .
In some cases , you may be able to view a short bit of text , and an image .
While there are a handful of Internet sites that offer reviews of mobile games , probably 99 % of mobile game purchasers are unaware of them .
There is no culture of mobile games , nor any effort by any part of the value chain to foster one .
Consequently , we see the same dynamic play out :
All that matters is branding .
Tetris and Space Invaders sell well here , just as Monopoly and Clue do in the boardgame market .
Games based on media licenses are common .
So are games that tie in to recently - released console games ; Gameloft ( like Ubisoft , controlled by the Guillemot brothers ) has made a business of essentially adapting new Ubisoft games for mobile phones .
Given the limited capabilities of J2ME and BREW , these bear only the most glancing relationship to the console games on which they are supposedly based , but the tie to a heavily promoted " real " game is sufficient to create a market for the mobile version .
Many gamers who have explored mobile games have come away with the opinion that they all suck .
With rare exceptions , this is true .
The market has no aesthetic of gameplay ; branding is all that matters ; why should the publishers of mobile games care ?
You see the same dynamic in slot machines , where old TV licenses are very powerful .
And yes , you see it in videogames as well .
We do , at least , have something of a videogame culture ; major media do pay attention to them , and there are innumerable sites devoted to them .
And gamers passionately debate the merits of the games they play .
And yet , those discussions are curiously uncultured , too ; the average gamer 's ignorance of the history of the form , of the contributions of different creators , of the evolution of genres , is staggering .
Games suck or rock ; no nuance here .
And gamers have been trained to expect and reward spectacle over originality ; the number of commercially viable genres continues to decline over time .
And franchises -- number VI in a series -- along with drivel licensed from other media predominate .
EA likes to portray itself as bravely fighting against the tide by purposefully fostering a handful of " original IP " titles each year -- but of course , these games slot into the same genre categories they know how to sell .
The IP may be original , but the gameplay is not .
And just as consolidation of the American boardgame industry ( which is largely controlled by a single firm -- Hasbro ) has bred a braindead market , in contrast to the more competitive German one , so the continuing consolidation of videogame publishing into a handful of international conglomerates merely hastens the trend away from gameplay aesthetics and toward branding .
The Twiggy Game is a charming cultural object from a bygone era ; it 's also a stark representation of what went wrong with boardgames , and a stark warning for what can go wrong with games as a whole -- at least , if we fail to inculcate , in ourselves and in others who love games , an aesthetic that prizes something beyond the brand .
Die Innenminister von Bund und Ländern haben sich auf ihrem Frühjahrstreffen in Bremerhaven am heutigen Freitag auf ein schärferes Vorgehen gegen " Killerspiele " geeinigt .
In einem heise online vorliegenden Beschluss fordern die Innenpolitiker ein schnellstmögliches Herstellungs - und Verbreitungsverbot für Video - und Computerspiele , " bei denen ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Spielhandlung die virtuelle Ausübung von wirklichkeitsnah dargestellten Tötungshandlungen " ausmacht .
Eingeschlossen sein sollen Games mit " anderen grausamen oder sonst unmenschlichen Gewalttätigkeiten gegen Menschen oder menschenähnliche Wesen " .
Sachsen - Anhalts Innenminister Holger Hövelmann ( SPD ) begründete den Vorstoß damit , dass die bisherigen Schritte zur freiwilligen Selbstkontrolle der Unterhaltungsindustrie nicht ausreichten .
Die Verbotsforderung gehöre daher " wieder auf die politische Tagesordnung " .
Sein niedersächsischer Kollege Uwe Schünemann ( CDU ) ergänzte gegenüber Welt Online , dass durch Killerspiele die Hemmschwelle zur Gewalt sinke .
Amokläufer hätten sich vor ihren Taten immer wieder mit solchen Spielen beschäftigt .
Der Bundestag solle daher noch vor den Neuwahlen im September ein entsprechendes Gesetz verabschieden .
Nach dem Amoklauf von Winnenden hatten sich zunächst vor allem Bayern und Baden - Württemberg dafür ausgesprochen , die Verbreitung von " Killerspielen " einzudämmen .
Auf Bundesebene stießen sie damit aber ebensoweni auf Gegenliebe wie mit Forderungen nach einem Verbot von " Paintball - Spielen " .
Weiter hat die Innenministerkonferenz beschlossen , bis Ende 2012 ein computergestütztes nationales Waffenregister zu errichten .
Das " Programm Innere Sicherheit " hat sie zudem unter anderem um einen Bereich zum besseren Schutz kritischer Infrastrukturen ( Kritis ) sowie zu " Informations - und Kommunikations - Kriminalität " ergänzt .
Für eine effektive Gefahrenabwehr müssten die Sicherheitsbehörden die zu erwartenden technischen Entwicklungen " vorausschauend beurteilen und analysieren " .
Ermittlungs - und Beweissicherungsmethoden seien daher " bedarfsgerecht " unter Berücksichtigung des rechtlichen Instrumentariums anzupassen .

UAW accepts government ban on strikes
15 January 2009
It has come to light that the federal bailout of General Motors and Chrysler approved last month by the Bush administration with the support of the incoming Obama administration includes a stipulation that effectively bans strikes or work stoppages by autoworkers .
The clause , which was revealed in a Security and Exchange Commission filing by GM last week , coincides with government demands that the 139,000 workers at Detroit 's auto companies agree by February 17 to accept mass layoffs , plant closures and sweeping wage and benefit concessions .
According to the SEC filing , the Treasury Department could declare GM and Chrysler in default and revoke $ 17.4 billion in loans , throwing the automakers into bankruptcy , if " any labor union or collective bargaining unit shall engage in a strike or other work stoppage . "
The effect of this provision is to revoke the legal right to strike , an achievement won by the American working class in bitter struggles against " criminal conspiracy " laws used against striking workers in the 19th century .
It was only with the 1935 passage , in the depths of the Great Depression , of the National Labor Relations
Act that federal law recognized the right of workers to strike .
This concession to the working class was not some freely given gift of the Roosevelt administration .
It followed general strikes that erupted in 1934 in Toledo , Minneapolis and San Francisco .
Without the strike weapon , workers are reduced to the status of industrial slaves , legally compelled to accept the most brutal conditions of exploitation without any recourse to collective resistance .
Several commentators have questioned the legality of the anti-strike provision in the auto bailout bill .
Nevertheless , under the terms of the bailout , the strike ban remains in effect as long as the auto companies have outstanding loans from the government , setting the stage for contract negotiations in 2011 in which workers would not have the slightest leverage to reject demands for even more draconian givebacks .
This confirms the warnings by the World Socialist Web Site that the crisis of the US auto industry is being exploited by the American ruling elite to throw the working class back to conditions not seen since before the UAW and the other mass industrial unions were built in the 1930s .
Just as the 1980 Chrysler bailout and the smashing of the PATCO air traffic controllers ' strike in 1981 initiated a wave of wage - cutting and union - busting in the 1980s and 1990s , the current attack on autoworkers is being used to spearhead a fundamental change in class relations in the US and internationally , under conditions of a global breakdown of the capitalist system .
The organization that ostensibly represents GM and Chrysler workers , the United Auto Workers union , campaigned for the government bailout of the Big Three companies , accepting its stipulations for tens of thousands of layoffs and wage and benefit cuts to bring unionized workers down to the level of non-union workers .
It has not uttered a word of protest over the provision banning strikes and work stoppages .
Far from opposing this attack on the democratic rights of autoworkers , the UAW bureaucracy welcomes the ban on strikes as a means of crushing rank - and - file resistance to its collaboration with the auto bosses and the incoming Obama administration .
In a joint appearance at the Detroit auto show with General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner last Thursday , UAW President Ron Gettelfinger told the host of NBC - TV's " Today Show " that the union was committed to making the companies " more competitive " by " modifying " the current union contracts in talks with the Detroit automakers that began this week .
The UAW president boasted that the union had already accepted wage cuts and work rule changes that made UAW workers more competitive than non-union workers at US plants operated by Toyota .
For his part , Wagoner praised the UAW , saying he was " confident that we 'll come together and get the kind of changes that we need . "
In exchange for further concessions , the UAW bureaucracy is reportedly seeking a seat on GM 's board of directors and an increase in the number of GM shares it presently owns .
An organization that accepts a government ban on the most elementary form of workers ' resistance demonstrates thereby its fundamental opposition to the interests of the working class .
The UAW 's complicity in the so - called " bailout " of the auto companies , with its provisions for impoverishing the workers and stripping them of their right to strike , is the inevitable outcome of the entire policy of the UAW and the American trade unions as a whole and the culmination of their trajectory over many decades .
To argue , under these conditions , that the UAW bureaucracy presides over a genuine workers ' organization is to engage in self - delusion or deliberate deception .
For three solid decades the UAW has concentrated its efforts on suppressing the resistance of autoworkers to the destruction of jobs , living standards and working conditions , under the banner of labor - management " partnership " and " Buy American " chauvinism .
It has deliberately sought to extirpate all remnants of class consciousness among its members , in order to facilitate its ever closer integration with corporate management and the government .
In the figure of Gettelfinger — a man who cannot even conceive of an independent role for the working class , and who views the world entirely from the standpoint of a junior partner of the auto bosses — one sees a concentrated expression of the degeneration and transformation of the UAW .
The roots of this degeneration go back to the earliest stages of the UAW , when it rejected the fight for socialism — the perspective that animated many of the left - wing militants who led the mass strikes and plant occupations that established the union in the 1930s .
Walter Reuther and other UAW leaders resisted popular demands for the building of a labor party and tied the newly established unions to the Roosevelt administration and the Democratic Party , blocking the development of an independent political movement of the working class .
The perspective of class collaboration and support for the profit system found its noxious expression in the anti-communist purge of the unions after World War II , which set the stage for the UAW bureaucracy 's subsequent betrayals and the ultimate collapse of the union .
Having tied the fate of autoworkers to the continued domination of US industry in the world market , the UAW had no response to the globalization of production and the decline in the world position of American capitalism and responded to the growing challenge of Asian and European manufacturers by becoming an enforcer of management 's cost - cutting demands .
For years , various factions of the UAW , from " New Directions " to " Soldiers of Solidarity " — and their supporters within the milieu of " left " opportunist organizations — have insisted that autoworkers confine their struggles within the framework of the UAW .
They have drawn no lessons from the disasters inflicted on the autoworkers by the policies of the UAW , and continue to claim that the corporatist and bureaucratized organization can be made , through pressure from below , to fight for the interests of the rank - and - file .
This is a lie .
Any struggle by autoworkers to defend their jobs and living standards will immediately pit them against the UAW and pose the necessity to break with it and build new forms of struggle , including factory and workplace committees .
The revival of the workers ' movement is possible only on the basis of a radical departure in the practice , politics and philosophy of the working class .
Autoworkers should reject the blackmail of the corporations , the government and the UAW and prepare militant resistance , including mass strikes and demonstrations , against layoffs , factory closings and wage and benefit cuts .
This struggle should be broadened to unite every section of the working class in a struggle in defense of jobs and to oppose home foreclosures and the gutting of vital social programs .
The incoming Obama administration , just like its Republican predecessor , will serve the interests of America 's financial elite , which is determined to revive the profitability of the auto industry through a permanent reduction in workers ' living standards .
For working people to advance a solution to the economic crisis that defends their own interests they must break with the Democratic Party and build a mass political party of the working class .
This means building the Socialist Equality Party , which rejects nationalism and fights for the unity of workers in every country on the basis of a socialist program , including the nationalization of the auto industry under the democratic control of working people and the reorganization of the entire economy on the basis of production for human need , not private profit .

A new way of consuming alcohol that offers an immediate hit with no hangover the next day has been introduced in the United Kingdom .
The new method is known as AWOL , an acronym for ' Alcohol With Out Liquid ' , and could become a hit in the global club scene due to the euphoric ' high ' created when alcohol is vaporised , mixed with oxygen and inhaled .
Billed at launch as the ' ultimate party toy ' , AWOL machines serve bar customers via tubes and could be seen as a modern version of the ' Nargile ' or ' Hookah ' water - pipe which originated in India and became an important part of society in Turkey and Middle Eastern countries in the 17th century , eventually becoming the height of fashion at sheik Western society parties during the late 19th and early 20th century .
Like the Hookah , the AWOL machine has a central body and a number of tubes running from it .
The user chooses which spirit will be used and the spirit is loaded into a diffuser capsule in the machine .
The oxygen bubbles are then passed through the capsule , absorbing the alcohol , before being inhaled through a tube .
The resultant cloudy alcohol vapour is then inhaled from the end of the tube via a device akin to an asthma inhaler .
Once inhaled , the alcoholic gas goes straight into the bloodstream to give an instant ' hit ' .
The potent combination of oxygen and alcohol creates a feeling of well - being which intensifies the longer the vapour is inhaled .
This high - tech 21st century ' Hookah ' is the brainchild of 30 year old UK entrepreneur Dominic Simler , and has a patent pending .
" The vapour produces an instant ' high ' with no hangover the next day , ' said Simler , who will market the machines to clubs and bars in the UK to provide ' partygoers and hedonists with a radical new way to consume alcohol . "
The outcry by the British media has been predictably damning of the new device , with an article in the Sunday Times dated 15 February quoting the Chief executive of the UK Alcohol Advisory Service referring to AWOL as ' solvent abuse for adults .
' Professor Oliver James , the head of clinical medical sciences at Newcastle University in the UK was quoted in the article as saying , 'by snorting the alcohol it can go directly into the brain without being filtered by the liver .
What is getting into your brain could be the equivalent of many times more than by drinking it . '
Professor James has since stressed that the comments that he made to the Sunday Times were purely speculative and theoretical , that his statements were made without first seeing or trying AWOL and that he made it clear to the reporter that he has no previous professional experience or clinical evidence of alcohol being consumed via vapour .
Professor James has now agreed to carry out independent tests on AWOL and Simler is hoping that the tests will ' remove any element of doubt regarding the safety of AWOL .
' Until the results of the university tests on AWOL are available the company has advised all customers that the application should only be used to inhale alcohol vapour orally and not via the nose .
Professor James has confirmed that AWOL is safe to be consumed in this manner .
The first venue to offer the AWOL experience is il Bordello , an exclusive members - only club built on a Dutch barge located in Bristol .
Club proprietor Liz Lewitt has been ' overwhelmed ' with bookings for AWOL - the shots are consumed at the rate of approximately one shot per hour ( maximum ) and cost UKP '6 a shot .
I ’m in the happy state of just having finished marking exams for this year .
There is very little of interest to say about the week that was removed from my life : it would be fun to talk about particularly bizarre mistakes , but I ca n’t really do that , especially as the results are not yet known ( or even fully decided ) .
However , one general theme emerged that made no difference to anybody ’s marks .
There seems to be a common misconception amongst many Cambridge undergraduates that I ’d like to discuss here in the hope that I can clear things up for a few people .
( It is an issue that I have discussed already on my web page , but rather than turning that into a blog post I ’m starting again . )
The question where the misconception made itself felt was one about functions , injections , surjections , etc .
I noticed that a lot of people wrote things like , “ If then so is well defined . ”
Now if you fully understand what a function is , then you will find this quite amusing : if then trivially by the very basic principle that you can substitute something for something else if the two things are equal to each other .
( A famous type of counterexample to this from philosophy : two years ago , Michelle Obama was the wife of Barack Obama ; Barack Obama is the president of the United States ; two years ago , Michelle Obama was not the wife of the president of the United States .
Yes yes , there are ways of explaining why this is n’t a real counterexample . )
But it seems only fair , if one is going to laugh at such sentences , to provide examples of functions that are well defined and functions that are n’t , so that the difference can be made clear .
But now we have a problem : any putative example of a function that is not well defined is not a function at all .
So it begins to seem as though all functions are well defined .
But in that case , what are people doing when they check that a function is well defined ?
The real question we are asking is this : when we use the words “ well defined ” , what are we referring to ?
It ca n’t be a function , because a function is a function is a function and that ’s all there is to it .
Is it something like “ an attempted definition of a function ” ?
That seems a bit odd : we define things , not definitions .
If we wanted to say that a definition really did specify a function , then surely we would just say “ This definition is good . ”
So what kinds of objects are there that are sometimes functions ( if they are well defined ) and sometimes not functions ( if they are not well defined ) ?
To answer this , let me give a fairly standard example of a definition that feels as though it might define a function but in fact does n’t .
We ’ll define a “ gunction ” as follows : .
That is , takes two rationals and creates a new rational by adding the numerators and adding the denominators .
For instance , .
Why does n’t this define a function ?
Well , , so it ought to be the case that if we replace by in the calculation just made , then we get the same answer .
But actually we get , which is not the same as .
But does n’t this show that what people were writing in their exam scripts is exactly what they should have been writing ?
I ’ve just shown that is not well defined , and did I not do so by finding an example of rational numbers , and such that but ?
Well , sort of , but in that case what function am I talking about ?
What does even mean ?
Let ’s go back to how the gunction is defined , but with no presuppositions about what a gunction actually is .
Suppose that and are rational numbers .
Then to calculate we choose integers such that and , and output the answer .
As we ’ve observed , there are many ways of choosing and many possible distinct fractions that could result .
So what we have is not a function but a process that takes an element of and gives us several possible answers .
Thus , a gunction is like a function but it can be multivalued .
What is a multivalued function ?
Well , informally it is “ a function that is allowed to take more than one value ” such as the gunction defined by .
For some examples we could also allow gunctions not to be defined everywhere , as would happen here if we extended the domain of to all of .
More formally , a multivalued function from to is a subset of such that for every there is at least one such that .
And a more general gunction is just any subset of ( otherwise known as a relation ) .
Let ’s stick with the informal definition of a gunction from to as being like a function except that it does n’t have to take precisely one value for each .
The next question that arises is this : why bother with gunctions at all ?
Why take the risk of a bad definition ?
Why not just stick to functions so that everything is automatically well defined ?
To answer this , let us go back to the rationals and see how we define the sum of two rationals .
The most convenient definition is the obvious one : .
Let us break that up into a composition of simpler operations .
We start with a pair of rational numbers .
Next , we choose pairs and of integers such that and .
Then we work out the integers and .
Finally , we output the answer .
Now the first stage of this process is a very clear example of a multivalued function , since for each pair there are many ways of choosing the pairs and .
From then on , however , we are dealing with good old - fashioned functions .
So we have just defined a gunction from to by composing a genuinely multivalued function from to with a function from to and then a function from to .
( To be slightly more accurate we should say rather than . )
The resulting object is a good example of a gunction that happens to be a function , but where that fact , rather than being trivial , is something that needs to be checked .
This example points us to the answer to our earlier questions .
It often happens that the most convenient way of defining a function is to define it as a composition , where is a multivalued function and is a function .
For to be a function , or , as we usually say , for to be well defined , we need the following to hold : for every and any two possible values of , .
Why does this situation come up so often ?
Well , often and are not just any old sets but sets of equivalence classes .
For example , an element of can be thought of as an equivalence class of pairs , where if and only if .
( And this is not just some strange abstract definition : it really is what we are doing when we deal with rationals , except that we happen to write instead of . )
If we want to define a function from to , then what do we do ?
Let ’s suppose that is the set of all equivalence classes of some equivalence relation on a set and that is the set of equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on a set .
Then often what we do is this : start with an equivalence class of the relation on ; choose an element of ; apply some function to the element , obtaining an element ; let be the equivalence class of .
We then say that .
There is a natural multifunction from to , namely the multifunction that takes the equivalence class to any element of .
The procedure we have just defined is the composition of that multifunction with a function from to and the quotient map from to .
And what do we need to know about if we want to be a function ?
We must check that whenever , which is actually not all that different from what the candidates were writing in the exam .
However , it is different : the difference between “ is equal to ” and “ is equivalent to ” makes the difference between a triviality and something that actually needs to be checked .
Notice that the multifunction from to was in a sense the inverse of the quotient map from to ( which equals ) .
This is another way of thinking about why gunctions / multifunctions arise naturally : they are , so to speak , inverses of functions that do n’t have inverses .
Or at least , that is a natural way for them to arise .
All this demonstrates that the conventional use of language , with sentences like “ We must check that this function is well defined , ” is extremely unfortunate : if you have been confused by it , then that is much more the terminology ’s fault than it is yours .
But it looks as though the terminology is here to stay , so the best advice I can give is that while you write “ Let us check that this function is well defined , ” you secretly translate it to yourself as “ Let us check that this gunction really is a function ” or , if that ’s a bit too Dr Seuss for your tastes , “ Let us check that this multivalued function is in fact a function . ”
And one last piece of advice , which would have saved a few precious seconds for many candidates on the exam that I ’ve just marked : if you ’ve just defined a function from to by specifiying unambiguously what it does to each element of , or if you ’ve defined it as a composition of two existing functions , then it is automatically well defined and you do n’t need to check anything .
You do n’t even need to say that you do n’t need to check anything : it ’s just a function and that ’s all there is to it .
The things that might fail to be well defined are multifunctions .

WASHINGTON , June 16 ( UPI ) --
The reaction by Iran 's supreme leader indicates he recognizes Iranians are troubled about the presidential election , U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday .
Iran 's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday ordered an investigation into fraud allegations surrounding the country 's election .
The Guardian Council , which oversees elections , said it would recount ballots disputed by moderate candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , who finished second in Friday 's balloting to incumbent hardliner President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .

" I have said before that I have deep concerns about the election .
And I think that the world has deep concerns about the election , " Obama said during a media availability with visiting South Korean President Lee Myung - bak .
" You 've seen in Iran some initial reaction from the supreme leader that indicates he understands the Iranian people have deep concerns about the election . "
Given the history of U.S. - Iran relations , " it 's not productive ... to be seen as meddling ... in Iranian elections , " he said .
Obama repeated concern he voiced Tuesday about " violence directed at peaceful protesters .
...
That is not how governments should interact with their people . "
Opposition protests and rallies have turned fatal , with reports of seven deaths .
How the events play out over next few days and weeks " is something ultimately for the Iranian people to decide , " Obama said , " but I stand strongly with the universal principle that people 's voices should be heard and not suppressed . "
We 're big fans of oxytocin understanding .
It generally makes people nicer and and relationships are difficult .
When you introduce stressful issues into relationships , such as home finances , it can only get worse .
Oxytocin has been found to make relationships a little less difficult because it can take the " edge " off sensitive discussions .
The actual biology of human social relationships is just beginning to emerge as research on social cognition conducted in animals is now informing research in humans .
The latest Biological Psychiatry includes a paper by Swiss researchers that have investigated the effects of oxytocin , the ' love hormone ' , on human couple interactions .
They recruited adult couples who received oxytocin or placebo intranasally before engaging in a conflict discussion in the laboratory .
Oxytocin increased positive communication behavior in relation to negative behavior and reduced salivary cortisol , i.e. , their stress levels , compared to placebo .
" We are just beginning to understand the powerful effects of hormones and chemicals released by the body in the context of important social interactions , " commented John Krystal , M.D. , the editor of Biological Psychiatry .
" As this knowledge grows , the question of how to best use our developing capacities to pharmacologically alter social processes will become an important question to explore .
" Author Beate Ditzen , Ph.D. , noted that this was the first study of its kind and important because it evaluated real - time natural couple behavior in the laboratory .
" [ Oxytocin ] might help us to pronounce the effects of a standard treatment , such as cognitive behavioral therapy , by possibly making the benefits of social interaction more accessible to the individual .
But it probably will not replace these standard treatments .
" They clarify that this study does not show that oxytocin should currently be used as a treatment itself and the effects of repeated administration have not been evaluated in humans .
In addition , important ethical concerns will have to be addressed , such as to what extent it should be used as a " treatment " and whether developed treatments could become drugs of abuse in the form of " social enhancers .

A group that claims to represent the rights of atheists in Ireland has launched a campaign to expel God from the Irish constitution , starting with an attempt to block plans for a new blasphemy law .
Atheist Ireland , which is led by a Bono impersonator and the writer of a hit musical about Roy Keane 's infamous World Cup tantrum , says the proposed legislation combines the oppressive religious thinking of 1950s Catholic Ireland and Islamic fundamentalism .
Co-founder Michael Nugent said they intended to launch a roadshow in the republic to kick - start their campaign .
Nugent is the co-author of I , Keano , a comedy musical about the angry clash between Keane and former Ireland manager Mick McCarthy at the 2002 World Cup , which led to Keane walking out of the tournament .
He has been joined by Paul Wonderful , a former singer with U2 send - up band The Joshua Trio , whose current incarnation - Ding Dong Denny O'Reilly - sings a song about Christ that could be illegal under the new law .
Dermot Ahern , Ireland 's justice minister , has proposed the legislation , which will outlaw anything seen as " grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion , thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion " .
The legislation also includes fines of up to € 100,000 for " blasphemous libel " , a move that Nugent and Atheist Ireland describe as " criminalising free speech " .
" This new law will treat religious beliefs as more valuable than secular beliefs and scientific thinking , " Nugent said .
He said the real solution to dealing with Ireland 's current blasphemy law was to remove all references to religion in the 1937 constitution .
" The bill 's first test of blasphemy is that religious adherents express outrage .
Instead of encouraging outrage , we should be educating people to respond in a more healthy manner when somebody expresses a belief that they find insulting , " Nugent said .
" More worryingly , this law would encourage the type of orchestrated outrage that Islamic fundamentalists directed against Danish cartoonists . "
The Dublin - based writer said many atheists found parts of the Bible insulting , but would not wish it to be banned or discussion about it closed down .
" Parts of the Christian Bible suggest that women must not teach and must learn in silence , or that effeminate people are unrighteous , or that people should worship a god who threatens to make you eat your own children .
But we do not believe the Bible should be banned , and neither should discussion of the Bible in terms that cause Christians to be outraged , " said Nugent .
Under the proposed law , Ding Dong Denny O'Reilly , a spoof Irish republican extremist who sings in a Celtic shirt , could be prosecuted for his song The Ballad of Jaysus Christ , Nugent said .
Atheist Ireland 's campaign against the proposed blasphemy law has been backed by Index on Censorship , the global campaign group for freedom of expression .
Padraig Reidy , Index 's news editor , said : " Ireland 's ethnic and religious make - up has changed dramatically in the last 15 years .
If the country is to thrive , surely the state must create a space where we can talk more , and more vigorously , about our beliefs and ideals , rather than shut down conversation . "
Nugent said blasphemy was not the only anomaly in the constitution .
" You can not become president of Ireland or be appointed a judge in the republic unless you take a religious oath asking God to direct and sustain you in your work .
" What an atheist is offered is an Irish solution - to ignore it , to pretend you believe in God .
But this means , for example , that a new judge who is privately an atheist but swears to God is technically committing perjury .
" We should be amending our constitution to remove these theistic references , not creating new crimes to enforce provisions that were written in the 1930s , " he added .

A bomb threat was called in on an Air France flight from Buenos Aires to Paris just days before Flight 447 disappeared over the Atlantic ocean , it has been revealed .
Ezeiza International Airport officials delayed the flight on the evening of May 27 after the bomb threat was called in .
Federal Police and airport safety officers inspected the plane and it was cleared for take - off , Argentine media reported .
The search lasted about an hour and a half , and passengers were not evacuated from the plane .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The news came as investigators remained baffled over the mystery of what happened to cause Flight 447 to drop out of the sky so quickly that pilots did not even have time to make a Mayday call .
The French government has not yet ruled out terrorism – but with no terrorist groups coming forward to claim responsibility for an attack , that theory is seeming increasingly unlikely .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Investigators found debris from the wreckage of the doomed plane floating in the Atlantic yesterday – including a life jacket and a plane seat .
Now it ’s a race against time for the Brazilian Air Force to reach the crash site before the remaining debris sinks into the ocean – taking any chance of discovering what happened to Flight 447 with it .

The system the Republicans claim that most Americans are satisfied with saw annual private health insurance premiums rise from $ 7,086 in 2001 to $ 12,560 in 2008 .
I had absolutely no control over these price increases and neither did any government agency .
Why does this experience not bring the same fury in Republicans that tax increases do ?
The private marketplace is powerless to control these runaway prices , which , unlike oil , will not fluctuate with supply and demand .
Is it fair to apply the experience of the last seven years , cost wise , to the next seven if nothing is done by the government ?
I think it is .
I will pay about $ 1,800 more for health coverage each year ( but my taxes will not go up ) .
For ease of comparison .
I am going to ignore probable adverse changes in my deductibles and co pays .
Every employer with group health plans would pay for that increase by either reducing or restricting your pay by that amount or by adjusting your deductible and co pays ( or worse , cancel the group plan altogether ) .
Either way , you pay the increase .
Now what happens with a new government plan ?
If you are an employer with an existing group health plan , your future costs are capped at today ’s ’ level .
If you are an employer that does not have a group health plan , you will pay about $ 4000 for each employee that you pay at a median salary , capped in percentage terms for the future .
If you make less than $ 250,000 per year , you will pay no more in income t taxes than you pay today .
If you make between $ 250,000 and $ 750,000 , your taxes will go up less than $ 1800 ( the amount your health premiums would increase next year without the plan ) .
If you make more than $ 1 million your taxes will return to the same rate you paid before 2001 .
Who are the losers in this plan ?
Your first reaction might point to employers without a group plan for their employees ( probably most often small businesses ) but that would not be the case .
Remember that the employer gets something for its money - health insurance for its employees .
The employer can ask or tell its employees that in exchange for the health insurance the employees will have to pay for all or a portion of the insurance .
Wal Mart , of all companies , likes this plan .
Once the finance mechanisms are in place under any government - sponsored plan , the cost drivers in the system can be , well , systemically addressed without regard to the benefit or detriment to the insurance industry ’s profits .
Republican opposition to this kind of new health plan is not consistient with its claims to be protective of the nation 's fianncial health , let alone its physical health .
The Republicans have one last chance to avoid the dustbin of history , or as Jimn DeMint might say , their Waterloo .
Starting July 1st , 2009 all PCs sold in China are to include Internet content filtering and censorship software also known as " Green Dam Youth Escort software . "
The program works by creating log files of all the sites and pages the user tries to access .
Software Flaws Leave Users Vulnerable
Computer experts discovered a series of software flaws , including unencrypted communications between the company 's servers and the software itself .
It 's suggested that the software is susceptible to large - scale disaster , including hackers that could steal private user information or install malicious software on computers in the network .
( Source : bbc.co.uk )
If a hacker used malicious code to control all those PCs , every computer could be used to spam millions or launch attacks on targeted websites .
So far there has been no comment from the Jinhui Computer System Engineering , the company that developed the Green Dam Youth Escort software .
Controversial Program Results in Public Outcry
The controversial program has resulted in a public outcry amongst privacy experts , academics , and some Chinese citizens who think tech - savvy users will be able to get around the limitations of the software .
According to the BBC , one blogger was able to show that the software blocked an attempt to visit an adult site when using Microsoft 's Internet Explorer , but he had no problem accessing the site with Firefox .
Others are reporting that the software only runs on Microsoft Windows , not Linux or Mac. ( Source : bbc.co.uk )
There were also numerous complaints on a bulletin board run by Jinhui Computer System Engineering -- so many that it was reportedly taken down .
It 's believed that at least 3 million computer users are using the software .
Remote Exploit Vulnerabilities
An analysis of the Green Dam Youth Escort software by the University of Michigan found remotely - exploitable vulnerabilities that were reportedly mandated by the Chinese government and any website a user visits can take control of their PC .
The software contains serious security vulnerabilities due to programming errors .

Mexican architects Arquitectura en Proceso have designed the headquarters for Darcons ,
a construction company located in Delicias City , Chihuahua , Mexico .

Darcons Headquarters by Arquitectura en Proceso
The site is located at a suburban lot of a middle size city in northern Mexico .
As one drives towards it and away from the city , the building appears aligned with the road as an arched gate of a medieval town : looking through it one gets the scenery of the rural fields that surround the city .
The building was conceived as a frame that captures part of the landscape and at the same time defines a plane that divides the intercity from the suburbs .
The skin of the building plays a dual role : on one hand it is the transparent material that allows the view through it , and on the other hand , it is the opaque continuous skin that defines the shape of the frame and protects the interior from solar irradiance .
This skin was manipulated in order to differentiate the public space from the internal activities of the company : the main reception and the custumer rooms are outside the envelope raised above the ground as a Piano Nobile and organized as self defined entities .
The operation space is contained within the envelope and flows throughout the building in a three dimensional open plan that honors the hierarchical organization of the company .
In order to solve the continuity of the circulation the mass of the building was divided in various transversal slices , each presenting an intentionally different profile and two of them defining the geometry of the north and south elevations .
The sequential juncture of all the slices creates deviations and convergences between the internal operational route and the external costumer route .
The geometry of the volume is shaped according to a juxtaposition of three rotated orthogonal axis structures .
This was primarily done in an effort to recreate the space complexity produced by a urban grid designed in the style of the 18th century .
The west elevation also benefits from the rotated planes by casting shades onto itself and minimizing direct sun exposure .
The rule was meant to be broken at the main entrance where the opaque skin suddenly sift direction to frame a cantilevered volume that flies above the portico .
This creates a gesture of urban scale to emphasize the hierarchy of the entrance and contain the atrium of the building prior to the stair flight .

“ Umpires are eyewitnesses , ” said Jim Evans , a major league umpire from 1972 to 1999 who now runs a school for umpires in Florida .
“ As the umpire you are the eyewitness and the judge .
You make your decision based on your own reportage . ”
Image THE DECISION Jackie Robinson is safe at home , rules the umpire , Scotty Robb .

Sure , umpires call ’em as they see ’em , and judges learn about everything from interested parties ; they call ’em as they hear ’em .
In a 2007 case , however , Scott v. Harris , the justices played umpire and ruled on the basis of what they saw .
The case involved a motorist , Victor Harris , who was fleeing the police and was rendered quadriplegic after a police car rammed him to put an end to a high - speed chase .
After viewing a videotape of the chase , the court ruled 8 - 1 that Harris was not entitled to sue on the basis of his Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure .
“ No reasonable juror , ” Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority , could fail to see the deadly risk to the public posed by Mr. Harris ’s flight .
And rather than publish a rebuttal of the minority opinion of Justice John Paul Stevens , the court chose instead a unique response ; it posted the videotape on its Web site .
“ We are happy to allow the videotape to speak for itself , ” Justice Scalia wrote .
A subsequent study by Dan M. Kahan , David A. Hoffman and Donald Braman of what 1,350 people saw in the video yielded startling results .
“ Whites and African - Americans , high - wage earners and low - wage earners , Northeasterners and Southerners and Westerners , liberals and conservatives , Republicans and Democrats  varied significantly in their perceptions of the risk that Harris posed , ” they wrote in the Harvard Law Review in January .
So what is the umpire ’s objective judgment here ?
Where is the foul line ?
Another difference between umpires and Supreme Court justices is that umpires can be reversed .
Perhaps the most famous example of this is the pine tar incident of 1983 .
George Brett of the Kansas City Royals hit an apparently decisive ninth - inning home run against the Yankees but was declared out by the umpires for having too much pine tar on his bat .
The umpires were in strict constructionist mode ; the rulebook said that the use of an illegal bat would cause the batter to be declared out and Mr. Brett had pine tar on his bat well beyond the limit of 18 inches above the handle .
But the Royals protested , and the American League president upheld the protest  citing the spirit rather than the letter of the law  and the game resumed .
The rule , which had been implemented in the first place to discourage a different illegality  bat corking  was rewritten to say that a bat with too much pine tar would result not in an out but in the bat ’s being removed from play .
Umpires tend to be politically conservative 
“ Maybe we should have Latina umpires because they have more empathy , right ? ” Mr. Evans suggested  but the pine tar example notwithstanding , they often view their role on the field more progressively .
Of course , it might just be they like exercising their authority , but in many matters  calling balls and strikes , for instance  umpires are loath to yield their personal discretion .
“ It ’s like the Constitution , ” the umpire Gary Cederstrom said to me .
“ The strike zone is a living , breathing document . ”
Last week , the umpire Marty Foster called the Yankees ’ Derek Jeter out on a steal of third , and though it appeared he was never tagged , Mr. Jeter said Mr. Foster explained that he did n’t need to be tagged to be called out because the ball beat him to the bag .
Talk about judicial activism !
An uproar arose over this , but in fact , if that ’s what Mr. Foster said , he was simply  if unwisely  expressing aloud a generally unspoken umpire tenet that allows for some discretion on close plays to keep managers and fans , who can clearly see throws but not tags from the dugout or the stands , from causing a ruckus .

Beppu , located on the Japanese island of Kyūshū , is the second largest producer of geothermal water in the world .
Located in the same area are the “ Nine Hells ” or ponds that each has its own remarkable character and colour thanks to the variety of minerals in the outflows .
These “ Hells ” are a popular tourist attraction in Japan but are little known outside of the country .
Seven of the strange geothermal springs are located in the Kannawa area and are known as : Sea or Ocean Hell ( Umi Jigoku ) , Shaven Head Hell ( Oniishibozu Jigoku ) , Cooking Pot Hell ( Kamado Jigoku ) , Mountain Hell ( Yama Jigoku ) , Devil or Monster Mountain Hell ( Oniyama Jigoku , ) Golden Dragon Hell ( Kinryu Jigoku ) and White Pond Hell ( Shiraike Jigoku ) .
Sadly , as with many incredible natural wonders , the area surrounding it has become over commercialised and “ tacky ” .
Beppu was founded on April 1 , 1924 .
It is famous for its thousands of onsen ( hot springs ) , which are regarded as sacred .
Beppu is Japan 's onsen capital as it has the largest volume of hot water in the world aside from Yellowstone and the largest number of hot spring sources in Japan .
The " sea hell " features a pond of hot , blue water .
It is one of the more beautiful hells .
This hell is named after the mud bubbles , which emerge from boiling mud pools and look like the shaven heads of monks .
According to its name , the " white pond hell " features a pond of hot , milky white water .
The " mountain hell " features small ponds of steaming hot water and a small zoo with small cages .
The " cooking pot hell " features several boiling ponds and a flashy demon statue as cook .
Crocodiles are bred and kept on the grounds of the " monster mountain hell " .
The " golden dragon hell " features a dragon statue and a greenhouse , heated by the hot spring .
The " blood pond hell " features a pond of hot , red water .
It is the most photogenic of the nine hells .
The " spout hell " features a boiling hot geyser , which erupts every 25 - 30 minutes for about five minutes .

MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif. , June 19 ( UPI ) -- Search engine Google , based in California , added Persian to its Google Translate program , saying the language 's addition was important , given events in Iran .
" We feel that launching Persian is particularly important now , given ongoing events in Iran , " Franz Och , principal scientist for Google Translate , said on Google 's Web site .
" Like YouTube and other services , Google Translate is one more tool that Persian speakers can use to communicate directly to the world , and vice versa -- increasing everyone 's access to information . "

Protests have been happening daily since the June 12 election in which President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the landslide winner over his nearest challenger , Mir Hossein Mousavi , prompting cries of ballot fraud .
The Iranian government has cracked down on media coverage of opposition rallies , and installed firewalls to hamper or block access to Internet social networking sites such as Twitter , YouTube , Flickr and Facebook .
The addition of Persian to the free Google Translate " means you can now translate any text from Persian into English and from English into Persian -- whether it's a news story , a Web site , a blog , an e-mail , a tweet or a Facebook message , " the comments posted Thursday said .
Och said Persian - English translations are available and Google is " working hard to improve Persian translation for the additional 40 languages available via Google Translate . "

The Countrywide Civil Suit
On the brighter side , looks like Angelo Mozilo might get what he deserves .
The SEC announced a civil suit against Mozilo yesterday .
The former Countrywide CEO will be slapped with securities fraud and insider trading charges .
Investigators cite private e-mails from Mozilo , in which he called his new brand of mortgages “ poison , ” suggesting that Countrywide was “ flying blind ” — all while publicly talking up his biz as a lender of the highest standard .
We ca n’t really blame him for selling $ 140 million worth of Countrywide stock , but evidently , the SEC also takes issue with the timing and methodology in which he sold it … another nail in his coffin .
Good riddance to Mozilo .
We wish him the very worst .
And if the SEC is declaring open season on corporate misrepresentation , we can think of a few old friends likely renewing their passports this morning : Fuld , Cayne and Thain , to name a few .
The FDIC is attempting a CEO shake - up of its own .
Rumor has it that chairwoman Sheila Bair is pushing for the resignation of Vikram Pandit , Citigroup ’s head honcho .
Bair claims that Pandit is simply unsuited for the job … he ’s got a background in the very investment banking model that got Wall Street into this mess , and Bair supposedly wants someone with consumer lending experience .
Between FDIC - backed debt issuance and cash infusions from the Treasury , the U.S. government has provided Citi with nearly $ 85 billion in assistance .
Evidently , that ’s enough money to buy Uncle Sam a say in who runs the show .
We object to the whole premise of this shake - up — it ’s a slippery slope of the highest order .
But we hate to admit it …
Bair ’s got a point .
Let 's start off with one of the usual bitchy comments :
Another clown in the Senate , what ’s new ...
But at least someone knows what to expect in the thread :
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo !
Call me a Waaaaaambulance !
I 'm not exactly sure what 's up with this comment :
Is there a pool on how long before Franken gets out of control and attacks someone in the senate ?
And of course , there are several comments with much thanks to various GOP figures :
Thank you John McCain .
It sure is nice to see Coleman fight this one as far as possible .
Coleman concedes .
Franken will hold a press conference at 5:15 .
The GOP can KMA for not fighting this .
They were not out of options .
My donations will be funding trips to DC this year .
Not that those spineless bstrds in the Congress would filibuster anything anyway , but WTF do they have to spend money on that would have been better spent than fighting this to the Supremes ?
Anything come to YOUR mind ?
Because I am stunned .
Coleman concedes election was corrupt and stolen .
Another national disgrace .
As long as the leadership of the GOP are all still searching for their gonads , this corruption will continue .
I hope the 15 % who voted for the Independence Party ( formerly Reform Party ) candidate are proud of themselves .
You sure did a heck of a job punishing those evil Republicans for not being conservative enough .
This is why I am a conservative and not a republican .
Not a backbone or ounce of fight to be found in the GOP .
The party symbol should be changed to an elephant bending over with a smile on his face .
You mean like this ?
I love this comment , though :
So now Norm Coleman has the distinction of losing to Jesse Ventura and Al Franken .
I think that ’s a message that he needs to hang it up .
And this being FR , hyperbole is of course not in any shortage :
Honduras is looking pretty good right about now .
And of course , why would you want to win an election if the voters do n't want you anyway ?
Coleman should have done this long ago .
Who in their right mind would want to serve voters who were so weak in their support ?
I 'll post more if I see any more good ones
update - some more from another thread
Ohhh nooo !
( Where is the cartoon of the guy running around with his hair on fire ? )
I do n't know if I have that one but I do have this :
I 'm still shocked this thing that basically started off as a joke is actually happening .
How was it even close ?
Al Franken ?
Are you kidding me ?
I 'm not a Pawlenty fan , but we have to seriously look in to whether or not we want candidates for national office that come from a state unable to elect sane people .
More hyperbole :
US elections = Iranian elections
I think this person does n't realize which party has a PR problem :
Positive spin : adding Franken to Pelosi , Frank , Boxer , and the rest of the cast could help the public realize what a sick joke this administration is .
That ’s the only good I can see coming from this .
We also can't talk about elections without mentioning the bane of the entire universe ...
Look , if the GOP does n’t start to take on ACORN and similar organizations we can kiss free elections goodbye forever .
I have been calling my Senators to get them on the ball to make SURE ACORN is not around for 2010 or 2012 ...
And it would n't be Free Republic without more of those threats of left - wing violence !
Maybe it 's time to march on Minnestota and I 'm not kidding .
These thieves are stealing these elections and we 're allowing them to get away with it .
When do we get our own Honduran coup ?
Here someone is making an electoral prediction :
What has been successfully pulled off in Minnesota will be repeated all over the country so that there will always be a veto proof Democrat majority from now on .
I predict ( bookmark this message ) that the Democrats will gain seats in the midterm elections of 2010 .
Because the only way Democrats could gain seats is via fraud and not because everyone hates the GOP
Nothing for a love for democracy :
This democratic republic has failed .
We allowed too many stupid people to vote and have a say in our lives
What this election has shown us is that our electoral process is broken .
There is no such thing as a clean , free , and open election anymore in America .
Acorn can manufacture any results required to elect a Democrat , and the liberal court system will declare it valid , just like the Mullahs in Iran .
Acorn succeeded in creating their desired results in every election they were involved with last November , and with billions of our tax dollars , they will be even more successful in the future .
However , I can agree with this person 's sentiment :
Something is seriously wrong if it takes eight months to resolve an election .
Finally , can anyone make any sense out of this one ?
A man who lit up a cannabis joint in the public gallery of the debating chamber in Parliament yesterday has been charged with possession of a class C drug .
Parliament security grabbed the man in his 30s shortly after he lit his cannabis cigarette during the second reading of the Resource Management ( Climate Protection ) Amendment Bill , about 5.30 pm .
Security staff handed the unemployed man to police .
There was no indication it was any sort of protest , Parliamentary Service spokesman Warren Inkster said .
Apart from breaking drug laws , the man would have broken parliamentary codes of conduct surrounding behaviour in the chamber , he said .
Parliament 's premises are designated non-smoking .

Subtitle : Wherein I take my personal observations and consider them normative …
Yesterday , I wrote :
> I just realized that the difference between the way men & women choose a parking place for a car has everything to do with public bathrooms .
I have long noticed a difference between myself and my wife when choosing a parking spot in a not - crowded parking lot .
I will leave at least one vacant spot between myself and the next car .
She will park right next to another car even if she does n’t have to .
Yesterday I realized that our friend ( also female ) had done the same thing .
Maybe it was because the parking lot just had the lines re-painted , but suddenly I saw it just like each spot was a urinal .
Every man over the age of reason understands that when choosing a urinal , you choose the one as far away from any other guy as possible .
There was even an email which circulated a few years ago which had ASCII drawings showing how to decide .
But the rules boil down to this :
Unless you are at a sporting event , concert , or other extremely - high bathroom - volume experience , you do not choose to stand next to another guy at the urinal .
Ever .
I mentioned this to The Wife and at first she laughed — but then she added : “ Well , see , we always choose a bathroom stall next to someone in case there is n’t any toilet paper . ”
I rest my case .
Really , what more evidence do you need ?
Coda : when not using the urinal , men might choose a bathroom stall next to another guy .
Most guys will try to get some distance between them and the next guy , but really , our highest priorities for the sit - down are a ) clean seat and b ) no previous unflushed content .
Also , if we look down and there is no toilet paper , there is exactly a 0.000000 % chance that we would ask the guy in the next stall for toilet paper .
Seriously , I would sooner use my underwear as toilet paper than stick my hand under another guy ’s stall asking for toilet paper , because these are your options for what happens next :
1 ) He pees on your hand
2 ) He poops on your hand
3 ) He ignores you
4 ) He puts his penis in your hand because he thinks you gave “ the signal ”
5 ) He comes out of his stall , kicks in the door to your stall , and beats the crap out of you .
6 ) He actually gives you toilet paper .
Now I know that seems like a one - in - six chance , but really , that last option is like 2 % because “ getting your hand peed on ” has about a 75 % probability .

A total of five " explosive events " were recorded at Mount Redoubt , U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told reporters Monday .
The eruptions sent ash columns some 60,000 feet into the air above the snow - covered peak , and several communities west of Anchorage , Alaska , reported falling ash , officials said .
It also raised concern about ash fallout in towns near the volcano .
A " dark and cloudy environment " was noted near Cook Inlet , Salazar said .
Agencies including the Federal Aviation Administration , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey were monitoring the situation .

Concern centers mainly on three areas , Salazar said on a Monday conference call with reporters .
The first is the ash clouds ' effect on air traffic in the vicinity of the volcano .
Aircraft carrying a total of roughly 20,000 passengers fly through the area on any given day , Salazar said .
" I understand a number of commercial flights have been canceled coming in and out of Anchorage International Airport , " USGS geophysicist John Power said earlier Monday .
" We could see disruptions to air travel to south central Alaska , and Alaska as a whole for a period of weeks to months . "
Officials are working with the aviation industry to make sure air traffic in the area is safe , Salazar said .
The second area of concern is for people on the ground near the mountain , he said , but noted that most residents know what precautions to take , as experts have been warning of an eruption for some time .
In Port Alsworth , where about 100 people live year - round , Mark Lang , 56 , said that everyone is staying inside .
" Stay indoors and stay out of it as much as you could , " he advised .
In the event residents have to go outside , he said , they wear masks .
He said the abrasive ash is dangerous to breathe and " not good for your lungs . "
It could pose a problem for the town , he said , if it prevents airplanes from flying into Port Alsworth .
Flying is the only way to get to the town .
In Anchorage , about 100 miles from the volcano , residents were getting ready for ash .
" All the masks and filters were sold out in two days , " said Abi Seaver , 19 , of Anchorage .
Another resident of Anchorage said the city is n't too concerned .
" It 's so far away , " she said .
" And we live in the Ring of Fire , so it 's not an uncommon event . "
The third area of concern regards facilities in the area such as he Drift River Oil Terminal , which Salazar described as a " major terminal " for the storage of crude oil .
But he said measures have been taken in anticipation of an eruption , to prevent environmental damage , and " we believe everything is safe there . "
Experts expect the eruption to follow the same pattern as the last events in 1989 and 1990 .
That eruption continued for months as the mountain 's lava dome grew then collapsed , raising another ash cloud , said Tom Murray , a scientist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory .
The ash cloud was moving north , missing the bulk of the population in south - central Alaska , Murray said .
" We are continuing to watch the volcano very closely , " he said .
" We could have several more phases , such as we 've seen . "
The eruptions started at at 10:38 p.m. Sunday .
Subsequent eruptions occurred at 11:02 p.m. , 12:14 a.m. , 1:39 a.m. and 4:37 a.m .
The USGS estimated the height of the eruption cloud at 50,000 feet and warned that mudflows were possible on the Drift and Crescent rivers , and ashfall was likely near and downwind from the volcano .
Ash from the volcano is expected to blow north and pass west of Anchorage , said Dave Schneider , a geophysicist with the Alaska Volcano Observatory .
He described the ash as a trace -- meaning if some landed on a windshield , the driver could still see through it .
Power said the ash will be about the thickness of a penny or a dime .
He warned residents to take precautions .
" It does pose significant problems for mechanical systems , people with respiratory illnesses and aircraft , " he said , adding that residents should be prepared to stay indoors .
Those in range of the ashfall should seal their windows and doors , the National Weather Service said .
It also advised that residents protect electronics , minimize driving and cover air intakes and open water supplies .
The alert level went to red , the highest level , when the eruptions began , according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory Web page .

New game , new locations , new characters , new weapons , new monsters : John has been to Valve and dragged back the news .
[ Click on images for full size ]
Left 4
Dead who now ?
No one was expecting Valve ’s next game to be a sequel to 2008 ’s awesome co-op zombie shooter , Left 4 Dead .
To answer your immediate question :
Yes , this is a completely new game , with new characters , in a new location , with new zombies , new weapons , new twists , and an improved Director , in five completely new campaigns set in the Southern United States .
This is n’t more maps for the previous game , it ’s a brand new game , and it ’s due this November .
We snuck into Valve HQ ahead of Monday ’s announcement and played a full campaign , and at first glance much appears to have evolved .
It ’s still Left 4 Dead : Valve have more sense than to change anything that made the first game so splendid .
Rather the focus on L4D2 appears to have been the desire by everyone involved in the first game to make something bigger and better .
Coming off the back of the project , we were told by various Valve developers , people we bursting with ideas of where to take the game next .
So they went right there .
Left 4 Dead 2 takes place in the South of the USA , beginning in Savannah , eventually reaching New Orleans .
There ’s four new characters to play , each with back - stories to be hinted at in their conversations .
Coach is a high school football coach from the Savannah area , used to leading the kids , comfortable in his life , and perhaps not enamoured by the arrival of a zombie attack .
There ’s Rochelle , from Cleveland originally , working for a cable news network .
She ’s producing a segment on this strange story occurring in Savannah , and gets caught up in the events .
Ellis is a Southern boy mechanic , an enthusiastic but smart guy with a “ Southern flair ” .
Finally there ’s Nick , a gambler and a conman , unsure of his company and cynical about the events .
The plan for the five new campaigns is to bring them together more coherently , so you can more obviously see how the events of one lead to the beginning of the next .
Nothing that will enormously impact on jumping right in to a game in a particular stage , but giving a stronger narrative logic to the complete game .
And with that , the new cast will also develop their personalities as things progress .
Coach looks set to gain bravery as he gets closer to New Orleans , while Nick ’s attitude to the others may soften .
This will be born out in a more elaborate and involved collection of dialogue barks , once more primarily away from the player ’s control .
Perhaps one of the most endearing aspects of L4D was the characters ’ surprisingly apt and timely remarks about the events , and occasional exchanges .
This is to be expanded upon , with many more back - and - forth moments of chatter appropriate to the events happening around you .
Beyond the new cast , nothing else from L4D is being replaced , but rather added to or expanded upon .
So the Special Infected we ’re already familiar with will appear , joined by a new collection .
Of these only one has been revealed so far , The Charger .
Looking like a crossbreed between a Tank and a Common Infected ( what an unholy union that would be ) the beast has one giant mutated arm , which he uses to shoulder - charge the Survivors .
He knocks you down , but does n’t incapacitate you .
Rather you ’re off balance for a moment .
As happened to us as we played with Valve designers , he ’s capable of taking out many of you in a single charge , sending us flying like bowling pins .
However , should he charge someone on their own , rather than running to hide after , instead he might pick you up with his giant arm and repeatedly smash you face - first into the ground until a teammate comes to rescue you .
While other Specials are n’t yet shown , we have seen some changes to the familiar .
Rather cutely , some of the Common Infected have been changed while in hazmat suits .
This means laying down walls of Molotov cocktail fire wo n’t keep everyone away any more , as the fire - proof baddies can run right through .
The pay - off for this is exploding their heads and seeing the goo splat against the inside of the perspex visor .
But perhaps most exciting is the Wandering Witch .
Another new feature of L4D2 is setting some of the campaigns in the daylight .
The campaign we played was such , and it ’s oddly frightening to see it all happening while the sun shines .
Making our way through the sprawling streets of New Orleans , desperately trying to reach a distant bridge at the other end of which was lay an apparent helicopter rescue , the only time we needed our torches was when making our way through buildings .
And it seems in the daytime , the Witch has a bit more pep .
Rather than sitting crouched , sobbing , singing , now this most terrifying of gaming enemies methodically paces around , wandering where she sees fit , although still apparently zoned out .
She may be on foot , but she ’s no more interested in being disturbed .
This adds in a whole new aspect to Witch evasion .
No longer can you simply take the long way around where she ’s squatted .
Instead , she may well be walking exactly where you ’re headed .
Or worse , walking up behind you , singing her haunting song , suddenly infuriated by you when you swing around in terror .
The Witch ’s capacity to create anecdotes seems only more powerful now .
Sitting down to grab some food with a collection of Valve , stories about their most frightening or plain inconvenient Wandering Witch stories flow freely , each explained in animated terms .
Of the new weapons , perhaps the most exciting reveal are the melee tools .
So far we ’ve seen the axe and the frying pan .
Yes , the frying pan .
Feeling like a sneaky bit of TF2 in the game , it ’s the perfect comedy weapon , that somehow does n’t feel irreverent in a way inappropriate to L4D ’s more sullen world .
Complete with a fantastic KWAPANG noise , it ’s extraordinarily effective to bat your way through crowds , and can even be used to knock a Hunter off a pinned Survivor .
There ’s also a baseball bat , which did n’t appear in the campaign we saw , which we assume will be a little less bonky than TF2’s Scout ’s .
And the chainsaw , which again we have n’t played with , but hell : there ’s going to be a chainsaw .
The axe ca n’t go unexplained either .
It ’s utterly brutal , and shows off the Infected ’s newly regioned vulnerability .
Swing it low and you can slice off a zombie ’s legs , letting them collapse horribly to the ground , bleeding out of their fresh stumps .
Or maybe swipe off either arm .
Or most horrendously of all , remove a face .
This same gore is achievable with all the weapons , with new ragdoll deaths for the throngs , to make their entrail - spilling , armpit - dribbling , face - exploding ways all the more entertaining .
There were many gasps and cries of “ OH GOOD GRIEF ! ” as we played , the strings of guts slopping wildly into the air , or as mentioned above , the faceless leaking mess suddenly bursting like a blood - filled balloon as the Infected fell to the floor .
It ’s awesome .
There ’s a new shotgun , a new semi-automatic , and a brand new sniper rifle .
This last one feels dramatically out of place in a game where you ca n’t stand still , but it seems extremely likely that this will be the weapon that will be used most skilfully .
Obviously powerful , it ’s a very useful tool when you find yourself in one of the new “ gauntlet ” moments .
Gauntlets are one of the new elements that will occur , as one of many moves to attempt to make L4D2 a more consistently thrilling experience .
In the final moments of the campaign , finally reaching the bridge , we had to cross it .
At the other end lay the potential of rescue .
But it was one long , straight , inescapable path down which the Director was able to screw with us as much as ‘ he’ liked .
Standing still was never and option , but trying to stay high , jumping from roof to roof of the vans and cars , very much was .
Someone sniping from the back here proves helpful , while a couple of at the front wielding axes or frying pans was equally effective .
These make for interesting moments , an almost unrelenting onslaught from in front , but the peculiar safety of knowing that nothing you did n’t let get past you would be attacking from behind .
Another very smart change is to prevent sneaky players from trying to sit out the triggered events .
In those moments in L4D where you had to press a button that began a frantic attack until an elevator arrived , or a door opened , it seems too many were crouching in a corner together and waiting for it to all die down .
L4D2 has plans to prevent such treachery .
Now some of the events you start can only be stopped by reaching a further target .
In an extremely tense sequence , we had to make our way through a labyrinth of alarmed cars to reach a distant point that would finally see the attack fade .
Trying desperately to avoid hitting any of the cars , and thus making the situation far worse , while having to make constant forward progress , amped things up significantly .
The Director even has discretion over the layout of certain sections of levels .
In New Orleans we reached a graveyard that is different each time you play .
As Valve explained to us , if the Director gives you a pretty straight route right through it , it ’s an insult to how poorly you ’ve been playing that the omnipotent AI thought it needed to make things a little easier for you .
If you ’ve won his robotic respect , then it ’ll be a far more convoluted journey .
While there ’s no intention to waste players ’ time with dead ends , there is a greater emphasis on rewarding exploration .
You may well learn the correct route through most of a level , but heading off down a longer pathway , or going to check out an out of the way room , is more likely to be beneficial .
The Director is , we ’re told , going to be far smarter this time about placing items , and the selection of these has expanded as well .
Which includes the incendiary ammo .
Oh , what a pleasure it is to find these beauties .
Like an ammo stash , incendiary bullets can be picked up from tables , etc , and will give you a clip of ammo for your current weapon that will set absolutely everything it hits on fire .
Which is spectacular .
Right up until you accidentally set a Charger alight and he comes bounding toward you to share it .
Everything seems bigger and better .
And this includes the number of Infected to kill .
The average number taken down in a campaign in the first game was around 1000 .
In our play through one of the sequel ’s five new chapters we clocked up around 1700 .
Due November 17th this year , it ’s quite remarkable that it ’s so far on already .
And frankly , that of all developers Valve have made something this quickly is almost dizzying .
While there ’s obviously going to be something of a fuss made over people ’s expectations that L4D would be constantly expanded for free , following the TF2 model , it ’s important to stress that while this is obviously still the same L4D core experience , it ’s certainly not a bunch of new maps thrown into the old game .
It ’s a coherent new imagining of the game , this time bigger , smarter , and far more elaborate .
Oh , and gloriously more gory .

Thousands march in support of Irish abuse victims : Click here
Irish Americans shocked and outraged at Irish child abuse report : Click here
Irish victims of abuse in Church - run institutions have inundated abuse helplines with phone calls since the publication of the Ryan Commission report of clerical abuse of children in Ireland .
Under - staffed and under - funded Irish support services are overwhelmed by the record numbers of child abuse victims seeking help , and are requesting emergency government funds to meet the demand .
Maeve Lewis , executive director of the One in Four support group , which helps abuse victims with prosecutions against offenders , told the Irish Examiner : “ It ’s been absolutely relentless .
We thought it would calm down after a couple of weeks , but it has n’t .
" The report has unleashed an absolute avalanche of people [ seeking help ] .
The media coverage has re-triggered a lot of memories . "
Lewis and her advocacy service are seeking a meeting with Ireland ’s Children ’s Minister Barry Andrews in search the aid they say they need to provide abuse victims with the support they need .
The group has been contacted by 300 victims in the past weeks , more than half the calls they typically receive in an entire year .
Meanwhile , the Dublin Rape Crisis Center ’s phones are constantly ringing off the hook with child abuse victims seeking help .
The organization has had to endure the surge in public need while at the same time accepting pay cuts of between 3 and 10 percent .
Chief Executive Ellen O’Malley - Dunlop told the Examiner : " Money is extremely tight .
Services are stretched .
Our lines are just kept going .
We ’ve had a threefold increase in calls for this time of year . "
The revelation of the need for increased funding for abuse support groups came as the Dáil ( Irish Senate ) wrapped up a two - day motion in which they promised to protect all Irish children .
Irish President Mary McAleese plans to meet with 250 abuse victims on June 28 , and Archbishop Diarmuid Martin has said he and other bishops plan to meet survivors to offer them help and support .
Canines and felines do best together if introduced when young .
And they can even learn each other 's body language .
The first once - a - month pill for controlling both fleas and ticks in dogs and cats is showing promise in tests .
Peter Meinke and colleagues at Merck Research Laboratories note the need for better ways of controlling fleas and ticks , driven in part by increases in pet ownership .
Estimates suggest that there were 71 million pet dogs and 81 million pet cats in the United States alone in 2007 — up from 61 million and 70 million in 2001 .
Dogs and cats are the most popular pets , unless you count fish , which are thought to be in fewer homes but in greater quantities .
Although many powders , sprays and other topical agents are on the market , many pet owners prefer the convenience of pills .
Products given orally can reach more parts of an animal 's body , do not wash off in rain or bath water , and do n't transfer from pets to people .
At least one existing pill fights fleas in pets , but does not appear effective for ticks .
In tests on fleas and ticks in dogs and cats , a single dose of the new pill was 100 percent effective in protecting against both fleas and ticks for a month , the scientists report in Journal of the Medicinal Chemistry .
There were no signs of toxic effects on the animals , according to a statement from the American Chemical Society .
Scientists obtained the flea and tick fighter from a substance first found in a fungus that " has the potential to usher in a new era in the treatment of ecoparasitic [ ticks and fleas , for instance ] infestations in companion animals , " the scientists write .

Sure enough , those are two MacBook Pros sitting on his desk .

Yup , those are Macs , too .
That could suggest the advertisements bashing Mac computers and users were themselves created on Macs .
We 're not judging : Since when are ad agencies obligated to use the products they 're helping sell ?
We just love the irony .

CAMDEN'S Christian leaders have united to condemn the Quranic Society , which wants to build an Islamic school in Camden , for espousing views which are " incompatible with the Australian way of life " .
The leaders of the St John 's Anglican , Camden Presbyterian and Camden Baptist churches and the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary signed a letter to Camden Council arguing that the proposal was not in the public interest .
" Camden is increasingly becoming a multicultural community , but when one part of the community seeks to dominate the public space , as we have seen in Auburn , Bankstown , Lakemba and more recently Liverpool , the social impact is unacceptable , " says the letter , which was read at the Quranic Society 's appeal to the Land and Environment Court yesterday .
" Our concern is the Quranic Society inevitably advocates a political ideological position that is incompatible with the Australian way of life .
This includes promoting Quranic law as being superior to national laws and regarding followers of any rival religion as inevitably at enmity with it . "
The school proposal has split the Camden community .
Because I like coming up with nonstandard ( or powerful ) uses for spells , I figured writing about some fun combinations would be amusing .
There are a few ground rules I ’ll be following before getting started though .
These will all be combinations of at least two spells .
Most of these will be spells from different class spell lists , so if you are n’t a mystic theurge , you ’ll have to work with your party to make some of these work .
Not all of these will be completely supported by the rules , or I might not know which rules exactly support them , though they will all be supported by some common sense if not the rules , which means some will work better than others with certain GMs .
As a final note , I ’m sticking with core rules from The Hypertext d20 SRD .
Create Water +
Ice or Lightning spells .
First off , we have create water to make a puddle of water on the floor behind a door , followed by a ray of frost to create a layer of ice on a single five foot square .
Best used as a trap behind a door when you have a few rounds of prep time and nothing else to prep .
I ’d rule this works just like grease , just on a smaller area .
Taking this idea further , if you were to say , use a cone of cold over a large area effected by create water , perhaps any square effected by the cone of cold would freeze over instead .
This would create a much larger area of ice , and would be great to use on a group of enemies if the cleric is n’t sure what to do with his turn on a given round .
Of course , you might also have the problem that you need to get at an enemy you do n’t have line of effect to , but you do n’t want to use an AOE effect because of the collateral damage .
Drop a create water … it will spread around the corner of the building .
Then zap it with a lightning bolt or other appropriately electric spell , and watch everything in the pool of water take electrical damage .
I ’d rule half of the damage roll , unless there ’s a rule that says otherwise .
Mage Armor +
Shield + Alter Self + Cat ’s Grace
Who says mages ca n’t tank ?
Mage armor and shield will get you up to an AC of 18 assuming a dex of ten .
Alter self into a lizardfolk for a + 5 natural armor bonus and some ( likely unhelpful ) natural attacks , and toss on a cat ’s grace for a + 2 dex bonus to AC .
Now , you have AC 25 … probably more than the fighter or cleric at lower levels .
And you can still cast spells effectively too .
Cast shield and cat ’s grace last , as they have the shortest durations , though they should still last through a battle as long as you prepare soon enough before going in .
Then go stand up front with the fighter .
Reverse Gravity + Control Winds
You know the fun thing about high speed winds ?
They always work better on creatures that are flying .
And they work way better on creatures helplessly floating above the ground .
Once you have your enemies suspended helplessly in the air , blow them away .
They ’ll take both falling damage as well as whatever damage they take for being caught in a windstorm , and be quite far away from you to boot .
Makes for a great chance to rebuff .
Prismatic Wall + Control Winds
You ’ve probably figured out I like control winds by now .
Be that as it may , the idea this time is to set up a prismatic wall , then have everyone blown into the wall by the winds from control winds .
After that , everyone blown into the wall has to save vs all seven effects .
Good luck .
And make sure your allies do n’t get caught in this trap .
Simulacrum + Permanent Telepathic Bond
This one is fairly costly , and is generally more fun in the hands of the GM than as a player .
It ’s also fairly high level stuff .
However , the simulacrum provides a clone of you , though only half as powerful .
A clone that unquestioningly obeys all commands .
The telepathic bond made permanent via permanency is so you can issue those commands from anywhere .
As well , the simulacrum can let you know what ’s happening in the area in order to let you make more informed decisions about the orders you want to provide it .
Of course , the fun is in the fact that you get to basically go anywhere you want without leaving the comfort of your home or risking your life , though it ’s a considerably weaker version of you .
Alternatively , you can fight side by side with yourself , and give your simulacrum orders telepathically so your enemies do n’t know what you ’re planning to do , yet you can still coordinate attacks .
Wall of Fire + Forcecage
Trap a creature or creatures in a barred forcecage .
Then cast the circular wall of fire inside .
Concentrate as long as necessary .
At 2d6 + caster level damage a turn , those creatures wo n’t last long .
If you have two casters , prepare to cast the spells together , and do the wall of fire first , followed by the windowless cell version of the forcecage .
Harder to escape , and impossible to attack through .
Illusory Script + Explosive Runes
What ’s worse than finding an awesome new spellbook , only to have it explode upon trying to read it ?
Having it explode upon trying to read and being compelled to do the bidding of who ever created this hateful trap for the next half hour via the suggestion implanted in the illusory script .
I recommend a nature walk through the local marsh , just so they get to be uncomfortable for a bit after being exploded .
Asking the queen to marry them while they ’re in their singed clothing might be fun too .
Of course , there are all sorts of possibilities , so have some fun with it … and keep your real spellbook in a your bag of holding or handy haversack on your person at all times .
So there are some fun combinations to use .
Some are practical , and some are there just because it ’s fun to pull them off in a game once in awhile , even though you ’d likely be better off just doing something else .
Besides which , you never know when something seemingly not useful becomes exactly what you ’re looking for in the game .
US car giant General Motors filed for bankruptcy today in a move that will allow it to restructure as a " stronger and more competitive " company , President Barack Obama said .
The government is to pump billions of dollars into the firm as it takes a majority stake in a " new GM " that will be streamlined as a result of its reorganisation .
Fritz Henderson , chief executive and president of GM , said it was a " defining moment " in the history of the century - old car maker , adding " today is not the end of General Motors , but the start of a new and better chapter " .

President Obama said despite taking a 60 per cent share in the company , the restructured firm would not be run from Washington .
" Our goal is to get GM back on its feet , take a hands off approach , and get out quickly , " he added .

It is said of King Solomon that he had a servant whisper to him repeatedly – when things went well and when things went badly – “ this , too , will pass ” .
Crises do pass , even the most intense ones .
But after the current global economic crisis , there will be no return to the status quo ante .
For the world has looked into an abyss .
The experience of the 1930s led to the process of building a new world order : one that began at Bretton Woods in July 1944 , even before the end of the Second World War .
Today , the manifest failure of market fundamentalism and the need for a rebalancing of the world ’s economy will inevitably be the starting point for a new new world order .
There may be some hardcore faithful who continue to believe that business as usual will resume , but it is already clear that society the world over has demanded remorse from the practitioners of capitalism and action from its politicians .
Banks have been at the epicentre of the storm of public outrage .
The sins of arrogance , greed , untrustworthiness and callousness are hard to forgive .
But what is clear is that there are many lessons to be learned – not just by banks , but also by governments and regulators , rating agencies , investors and borrowers .
All succumbed to the temptations of short - term profit at the expense of the creation of real long - term value .
So , what should it look like , this new new world order ?
Whatever the eventual shape of things , there are four key realities that will have to be taken into account .
First , there is no alternative to capitalism .
At its worst , the market is unjust , abusive , destructive and crisis - prone , as we are all now painfully aware .
Yet , at its best , the market is a highly efficient allocator of capital and has delivered huge advantages to humanity .
The role of capitalism in creating wealth is evident in the way it has revolutionised the Chinese , Indian and other Asian economies after they introduced market - based reforms .
Even if the financial crisis leads to the first fall in world GDP since the Second World War , the past two decades of globalised market capitalism have brought extraordinary gains to hundreds of millions in previously poor societies .
Churchill ’s defence of democracy – “ the worst form of government , except for all those other forms ” – applies equally well to the market as an economic system .
Second , we can not turn the clock back .
We can not go back to the 1970s , to the time before globalised capital markets ; the sorts of controls that were then in place , even in developed countries such as the UK , would no longer be con­sidered compatible with an open society .
Nor can we go back further to some “ golden age ” of simpler , more communitarian , less - connected living ; this is unrealistic in a densely populated , urbanised , communicating world .
There is no alternative to progress and reform .
China , for example , is perhaps halfway through an internal reform process .
It has a rapidly growing economy in which the private sector probably accounts for about half the total output .
But there is a long way to go , and one of the economy ’s major challenges lies in the Chinese domestic capital market , which is as yet embryonic .
There is no evidence that a modern , increasingly complex and sophisticated economy can rely on banks alone to finance development .
Sustained economic progress requires the development of a capital market .
China will certainly want to ensure that it learns from the crisis : but it is also certain that it will not conclude that it can do without a capital market .
And what is true of China is true for all economies , developed or developing .
Lessons need to be learned in order to make the markets work better , not to dismantle them .
Third , government oversight , regulation and , at times , intervention are essential .
Markets can not be relied on to be stable and self - regulating .
Nor are markets alone sufficient for balanced social development .
It is clear that a new global order will need stronger institutions which preserve the dynamism of market forces while taming their excesses .
Central to this , finally , will be an acceptance that the global balance of economic power is shifting from west to east and that the framework of international institutions needs to be redrawn to reflect the new realities of globalisation .
It would be ridiculous to ask Asian societies to play a part in rescuing the world ’s financial system from collapse – to provide funds for the IMF , for example – without expecting to cede voting power to them in recognition of their new strength .
And it is not at all surprising that they should begin to argue , as China has done , that we must move away from the US dollar as the reserve currency of the world .
The debate over how a more tempered capitalism should operate is under way .
Some have pointed to an opportunity to turn relatively unfettered “ Anglo - Saxon ” capitalism towards a Continental - style harnessing of free markets , with tighter rules and provision for generous welfare systems .
Even supporters of the Anglo - Saxon model have argued that shareholder value creation should not be the supreme goal , as it has been in the past 20 years or so .
It should , rather , be the result of business well done .
And business well done means the profitable provision of good - value services to customers .
The Nobel Prize - winning economist Amartya Sen has questioned the standard perception of capitalism as market - driven , profit - motivated and ownership - based , noting that all the affluent countries in the world – those in Europe , as well as the US , Canada , Japan , Singapore , South Korea , Taiwan , Australia and others – depend on transactions that occur largely outside the markets , such as unemployment benefits , public pensions , social security and the public provision of education and health care .
For all their differences , these countries have in common a socio- economic approach which does not and cannot rely solely on the market .
Many others – the premier of China , for example – have argued that the new capitalism should encompass the control of overspeculation , and elevation of values such as mutual trust and confidence .
The sense that these elements are crucial to socio-economic well - being owes much to Adam Smith ’s Theory of Moral Sentiments .
It is clear , in short , that capitalism for the 21st century needs a fundamentally renewed morality to underpin it .
To achieve this we must ask ourselves again what progress really is .
Is it the accumulation of wealth , or does it relate to a broader , more integrated understanding of well - being and quality of life ?
Surveys consistently show that economic progress has not been accompanied by the expected increase in happiness , and that the price paid by many has been in the quality of human relationships .
On average , people do not think of themselves as happier or better off than their parents were – even though their material standard of living is , in so many societies , unquestionably higher .
There has , in particular , been a marked decline in people ’s perception of whom they can trust .
The collapse in perceived trustworthiness is most marked in relation to the banking sector , but applies to the business world more broadly , as trust has declined generally within family life and social relationships .
As such , it is not surprising that , in the public mind , free markets are in the dock .
Trust is central to the workings of the capitalist system and , if we are to restore people ’s confidence in the market , the moral dimension of what has happened has to be recognised .
We have come to accept the idea that the value of what we do in business is completely delineated by the market and that no other test of rightness need apply .
Yet we would not – or should not , at least – live our private lives this way .
We have succumbed to the sin of compartmentalisation .
The truth is that the value of our business is dependent on the values with which we do our business .
Better risk management , enhanced regulation , codification of directors ’ responsibilities in company law – all these things are necessary .
But they are not , nor can they be , sufficient without a culture of moral values .
As individuals , we do not regulate our behaviour simply by what is allowed under the law .
We take responsibility for our actions .
The organs of capitalism – businesses , banks and other financial institutions – have to do the same .
This is the sine qua non for the restoration of public trust in the market .
It is also essential for the overall health of society .

Though often annoying , insects perform a vital function in the world ’s eco-system .
Their small size makes insects innocuous to most , however up close and personal insects may evoke other emotions .
Wasp
Wasps are critically important in natural biocontrol .
Almost every pest insect species has a wasp species that is a predator or parasite upon it .
Parasitic wasps are also increasingly used in agricultural pest control as they have little impact on crops .
Wasps also constitute an important part of the food chain .
Fly
Flies rely heavily on sight for survival .
The compound eyes of flies are composed of thousands of individual lenses and are very sensitive to movement .
Some flies have very accurate 3D vision .
A few , like Ormia ochracea , have very advanced hearing organs .
Caterpillar
Caterpillars have rightly been called eating machines .
They eat leaves voraciously , shed their skins generally four or five times , and eventually pupate into an adult form .
Praying Mantis
Being a carnivorous insect , the mantis feeds primarily on other insects .
However , it is not uncommon for larger mantids to consume small reptiles and even small birds .
To capture their prey , mantids use their camouflage to blend in with the surroundings and wait for the prey to be within striking distance .
They then use their raptorial front legs to quickly snatch the victim and devour it .
The primary predators of the praying mantis are frogs , monkeys , larger birds , spiders and snakes .
Praying mantids will also prey on each other , usually during the nymph stage and during mating , as well as when there is no other prey .
Beetle
Beetles and their larvae have a variety of strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids .
These include camouflage , mimicry , toxicity , and active defense .
Moth
Moths , and particularly their caterpillars , are a major agricultural pest in many parts of the world .
The caterpillar of the gypsy moth ( Lymantria dispar ) causes severe damage to forests in the northeast United States , where it is an invasive species .
The flier posted around the 4 chan message boards , which encourages participation in the Twitter scam .
Another contender has entered Ashton Kutcher and CNN 's race to 1 million Twitter followers .
This one is backed by a legion of swindlers who frequent the underground Internet message board 4 chan .
Members of the notoriously sordid forum have banded together to catapult a new Twitter user called @basementdad to more than 261,000 followers in less than 24 hours .
A 4chan user created a computer program that mass - produces new Twitter accounts , which then automatically subscribe to @basementdad .
The user began disseminating the software to volunteers who agree to run it on their systems to support the cause .
While celebrity actor Kutcher is backed by the promise of a year 's supply of video games from Electronic Arts to the millionth follower , and CNN's Twitter account is backed by the might of one of the largest news outlets in the world , 4 chan is just a bunch of tricksters running very powerful computer scripts .
And it looks as if the Twitter grifters may have a shot .
Since starting the charade early this morning , @basementdad has already broken into the top 100 users .
According to a stat - tracking page one anonymous 4 chan user created to monitor the race , @basementdad is adding 150 to 250 new followers a minute -- compare that to Kutcher or CNN , who are moving at a pace of about five to 25 per minute ( albeit from a much bigger base ) .
That is , until Twitter puts a stop to it .
" Our spam and abuse team is aware of this , " Twitter co-founder Biz Stone wrote in an e-mail .
The 4 chan army is infamous for its gaming of online polls and legendary hacks .
The legion of basement Web influencers is credited with sneaking anti-Scientology and anti-Semitic blurbs onto Google 's search trends list , hacking the personal e-mail inbox of former Republican vice - presidential nominee Sarah Palin and , most recently , pushing the nickname of the 4 chan founder , moot , to the top of Time 's top 100 influencers poll .

Due to some pressing issues here on the homefront , I will be running a few guest posts this week .
This is a post from Peter who writes for Bible Money Matters , a blog about personal finance and faith .
You can subscribe to his RSS feed here or via email here .
I ’ve been writing about personal finance for just over a year now , and in that time I ’ve come to a lot of realizations about our finances , how to do a budget , and how to improve our financial situation .
When I look back , however , I think there was one crucial point that really turned things around for us .
That was when we decided to actually track our monthly spending .
It was truly an eye opener .
Up until that point we had n’t been doing too bad , but there were months where we paid all our bills , and then did n’t have anything left over to save , invest or give .
It was frustrating to be working so hard , yet feel like we were just treading water .
When I started blogging about personal finance , I decided that we should be paying closer attention to our finances .
What was our income , and what were our fixed expenses ?
Figuring out our income side of the equation was easy , but our expenses were a bit more hazy .
Tracking Our Spending
That next month we tracked our monthly spending down to the penny .
We decided to use a budgeting software to track every expenditure , which would also allow us to print out some nice reports so that we could visualize exactly were the money was going .
At that time we used Microsoft Money almost exclusively .
It was easy to use , and allowed us to update our accounts via online connections with our banks .
We did n’t rely on just the online updating , however , we double checked everything so that nothing slipped through the cracks .
When we finally sat down at the end of the month and looked at our spending , we had already broken all of our spending down into categories in Microsoft Money .
There were two kinds of expenses in our budget :
Fixed Expenses :
This includes things like housing , transportation , utilities and insurance ( health / auto / life ) .
These expenses are pretty much the same every month , and have to be paid .
: This includes things like housing , transportation , utilities and insurance ( health / auto / life ) .
These expenses are pretty much the same every month , and have to be paid .
Variable Expenses :
This category was for expenses that varied from month to month .
Things in this category included food expenses ( groceries , dining out , snacks ) , miscellaneous spending money , gifts , leisure expenses .
The fixed expenses were pretty much set , and there was n’t really anything we could do about reducing those bills .
We just have to pay them .
The variable expenses , however , are a bit more flexible .
We found there were a LOT of areas that we could cut .
We were overspending by huge amounts several categories .
Cutting The Fat
After all the number had been crunched , and expenses tallied we found that there were two main categories we were overspending in .
The first category that we had gone overboard in was in the “ dining out ” category .
Neither my wife or I really enjoy cooking very much , and because of that we end up eating out a lot .
Too much in fact .
We found that simply by cutting the number of times we were eating out every week we could cut our monthly expenses by $ 400 - 500 .
That ’s a lot of money !
We also found that we were probably spending too much on gifts for friends and family .
We have pretty large families , and a good amount of friends , and it seems like most months we are buying gifts for someone ’s birthday , anniversary or other occasion .
We decided that we needed to cut down in that area too , and instead of buying expensive gifts , we would buy more inexpensive gifts , and possibly make some of our own gifts to give .
Continuous Tracking
After that first month of tracking our spending , we were able to change our spending habits dramatically , save a ton of money simply by cooking more meals at home .
We ’ve also started being more creative about our gift giving .
The result is that we are saving hundreds of dollars every month .
We have n’t completely stopped going out to eat , or giving gifts , but we ’ve reined it in , and made our spending more in line with our financial plan , and the goals that we ’d like to achieve .
Tracking our spending is n’t something that we did just once .
We continue tracking our spending every month , making sure that we are n’t getting back to our old spending habits .
It happens , trust me .
You start making a bit more money , and things start drifting back to the old ways .
Having that once a month family budget meeting is helping us to keep our financial lives centered , and to keep each other accountable .
Have you tried tracking your monthly spending , and did you find some things that surprised you ?
What process did you use to track your finances ?
Tell us about it in the comments !
The BNP has won its first seat on an English county council with a victory in Lancashire , where Labour 's 20 - year - rule has ended .
The far - right party took the Padiham and Burnley West ward , its principal stronghold in the north - west , where it already has four district councillors .
But the BNP took second place to the Lib Dems in the local toppling of senior Labour figures , who previously held all Burnley 's seats .
Four were knocked out by the Lib Dems , including two council cabinet members .
The BNP 's victory in the ward , with 30 % of the vote , buoyed local activists ' hopes of getting the party 's leader , Nick Griffin , elected as an MEP on Sunday night .
He needs around 8 % of the vote to take a north - west seat , against the 6.4 % he polled in 2004 .
The BNP also polled strongly in another of its target counties , Essex , beating Labour in 11 wards and coming second to the Conservatives in Rochford North and South .
But with 35 of the county 's 75 seats still to be declared , they have not won any seats .
It was the same in Lincolnshire , where , despite a focus on foreign workers in the crop - picking trade , the BNP failed to secure a breakthrough .
The new BNP county councillor in Lancashire is Sharon Wilkinson , who was born and brought up in Padiham and leads the party on Burnley district council .
The rise of the group intensified following street violence between different ethnic groups in 2001 .
She said : " It is absolutely wonderful for the party and gives me the opportunity to represent more people . "
Kitty Ussher , the Labour MP for Burnley , speaking from the count , said : " It is disappointing .
We have lost some really good county councillors who have worked very hard to serve their community .
" I think we were the victims of uncertain economic and political times nationally .
Hazel Blears wore a brooch saying ' Rocking the boat ' .
If you are in choppy waters you do n't change the captain . "
Some 11 % of Burnley 's 65,000 voters are from ethnic minorities , mainly Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities .
The county council voting turnout was around 36 % , compared with the 2005 election figure of 59.54 % .
The BNP fielded a record 459 county council candidates on Thursday , fighting every ward in Essex and a total of 116 in the Eastern region alone .
At the last county council elections in 2005 , there were 39 BNP candidates nationwide .
The BNP picked up a second county seat in Leicestershire , knocking out a Labour councillor in the Coalville ward .
The party 's candidate Graham partner won 1,039 votes , overtaking Conservative , Liberal Democrat and Independent challengers .
The BNP 's chairman called the two gains " fine results " but warned against over - optimism because of what he called " the most staggering anti-BNP campaign ever mounted by the media " .
A spokesman for the anti-fascist group Searchlight said that the BNP had in general only polled significantly – 14 % or more – where it was the only " non-mainstream " alternative to the major parties .
Some such areas , including the party 's target of Cumbria , had seen the vote fail to rise above 10 % .

WASHINGTON – General Electric , the world 's largest industrial company , has quietly become the biggest beneficiary of one of the government 's key rescue programs for banks .
At the same time , GE has avoided many of the restrictions facing other financial giants getting help from the government .
The company did not initially qualify for the program , under which the government sought to unfreeze credit markets by guaranteeing debt sold by banking firms .
But regulators soon loosened the eligibility requirements , in part because of behind - the - scenes appeals from GE .
As a result , GE has joined major banks collectively saving billions of dollars by raising money for their operations at lower interest rates .
Public records show that GE Capital , the company 's massive financing arm , has issued nearly a quarter of the $ 340 billion in debt backed by the program , which is known as the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program , or TLGP .
The government 's actions have been " powerful and helpful " to the company , GE chief executive Jeffrey Immelt acknowledged in December .
GE 's finance arm is not classified as a bank .
Rather , it worked its way into the rescue program by owning two relatively small Utah banking institutions , illustrating how the loopholes in the U.S. regulatory system are manifest in the government 's historic intervention in the financial crisis .
The Obama administration now wants to close such loopholes as it works to overhaul the financial system .
The plan would reaffirm and strengthen the wall between banking and commerce , forcing companies like GE to essentially choose one or the other .
" We 'd like to regulate companies according to what they do , rather than what they call themselves or how they charter themselves , " said Andrew Williams , a Treasury spokesman .
GE 's ability to live in the best of both worlds – capitalizing on the federal safety net while avoiding more rigorous regulation – existed well before last year 's crisis , because of its unusual corporate structure .
Banking companies are regulated by the Federal Reserve and not allowed to engage in commerce , but federal law has allowed a small number of commercial companies to engage in banking under the lighter hand of the Office of Thrift Supervision .
GE falls in the latter group because of its ownership of a Utah savings and loan .
Unlike other major lenders participating in the debt guarantee program , including Bank of America , Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase , GE has never been subject to the Fed 's stress tests or its rules for limiting risk .
Also unlike firms that have received bailout money in the Troubled Assets Relief Program , or TARP , GE is not subject to restrictions such as limits on executive compensation .
The debt guarantee program that GE joined is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which was reluctant to take on the new mission , according to current and former officials who were not authorized to speak publicly .
The FDIC also initially resisted expanding the pool of eligible companies , fearing it would add more risk to the program , the officials said .
Despite those misgivings , there have been no defaults in the loan guarantee program .
It has helped buoy confidence in the credit markets and enabled vital financial firms to raise cash even during the darkest days of the economic crisis .
In addition , the program has raised more than $ 8 billion in fees .
" The TGLP program has been a money maker for us , " FDIC chairman Sheila Bair has said .
" So I think there have been some benefits to the government and the FDIC . "
For its part , GE said that it properly applied for and qualified for the program .
" We were accepted on the merits of our application , " company spokesman Russell Wilkerson said .
The Cash Cow
The current good fortune of General Electric , ranked by Forbes as the world 's largest company , has roots in the Great Depression , when it created a consumer finance arm so that cash - starved families could buy its appliances .
What grew from those beginnings is now a powerful engine of profit , accounting for nearly half of its parent 's net earnings in the past five years .
GE may be better known for light bulbs and home appliances , but GE Capital is one of the world 's largest and most diverse financial operations , lending money for commercial real estate , aircraft leasing and credit cards for stores such as Wal - Mart .
If GE Capital were classified as a banking company , it would be the nation 's seventh largest .
Unlike the banking giants , GE Capital is part of an industrial company .
That allows GE to offer attractive financing to those who buy its products .
At the height of last fall 's financial crisis , GE 's cash cow became a potential liability .
As credit markets froze , analysts feared that GE Capital was vulnerable to losing access to cheap funding – largely commercial paper , or short - term corporate IOUs sold to large investors .
Company officials projected confidence .
" While GE Capital is not immune from the current environment , " Immelt said in October , " we continued to outperform our financial - services peers . "
Behind the scenes , they urgently sought a helping hand for GE Capital .
One key hope was a rescue plan taking shape at the FDIC .
The program emerged during a hectic weekend last October as regulators scrambled to announce a series of rescue efforts before the markets opened .
They found a legal basis for the program in a 1991 law :
If a faltering bank posed " systemic risk , " then the FDIC , the Fed , the Treasury secretary and the president could agree to give the FDIC more authority to rescue a failing institution .
The financial regulators applied the statute broadly , so it would cover the more than 8,000 banks in the FDIC system .
The FDIC hurried to approve the program Oct. 13 .
" This was crisis management on steroids , " said a person familiar with the process .
" A lot was made up on the fly . "
The author of the systemic - risk provision , Richard Carnell , now a law professor at Fordham University , says it was intended to apply to a single institution , and that in their rush to find legal footing for unprecedented new programs , regulators " turned the statute on its head . "
The FDIC launched the program Tuesday , Oct. 14 , the same day Treasury officials announced large capital infusions into nine of the country 's banking giants under TARP .
That day , the FDIC also expanded its deposit guarantees to a broader range of accounts .
Within days , the FDIC held conference calls with bankers to explain the program .
Agency officials explained that not all companies that owned banks were eligible .
" The idea is not to extend this guarantee to commercial firms , " David Barr , an FDIC spokesman , said during one of the calls .
A Broader Program
GE was watching closely .
Though GE Capital owned an FDIC - insured savings and loan and an industrial loan company , they accounted for only 3 percent of GE 's assets .
Company officials concluded that GE could n't meet the program 's eligibility requirements .
So the company requested that the program " be broadened , " GE's Wilkerson said .
GE 's main argument was fairness :
The FDIC was trying to encourage lending , and GE Capital was one of the country 's largest business lenders .
GE deployed a team of executives and outside attorneys , including Rodgin Cohen , a banking expert with the New York firm Sullivan & Cromwell .
" GE was among the parties that discussed this with the FDIC , " along with the Treasury and Fed , according to FDIC spokesman Andrew Gray .
He said the details about eligibility " had not been specifically addressed " in the beginning .
Citigroup , the troubled banking giant , also was pressing for an expansion of the FDIC program .
Though Citigroup was included in the debt guarantee program , its main finance arm , Citigroup Funding , appeared ineligible .
Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn wrote to the FDIC's Bair on Oct. 21 , arguing that debt issued by Citigroup Funding should be covered " as if it were issued directly by Citigroup , Inc . "
Two days later , the FDIC announced a new category of eligible applicants – " affiliates " of an FDIC - insured institution .
Bair explained that " there may be circumstances where the program should be extended " to keep credit markets flowing .
That meant " certain otherwise ineligible holding companies or affiliates that issue debt " could apply , she said .
GE Capital now was eligible .
Raising Billions
GE Capital won approval to enter the FDIC program in mid-November with support from its regulator , the Office of Thrift Supervision .
The company used the government guarantee to raise about $ 35 billion by the end of 2008 .
By the end of the first quarter of 2009 , the total reached $ 74 billion , helping to cover the company 's 2009 funding needs and about $ 8 billion of its projected needs for 2010 .
Despite government support , GE lost its Triple - A rating for the first time in decades this year and was forced to sharply cut its dividend .
But the outlook could have been much worse .
The debt guarantee program has " been of critical importance " to the fiscal health of GE Capital , said Scott Sprinzen , who evaluates GE 's finance arm for the Standard & Poor 's credit - rating company .
He said the FDIC program enabled GE to " avoid an exorbitant price " for its debt late last year .
GE has not disclosed how much the company has saved because of TLGP backing .
Like other companies in the program , GE pays the FDIC fees to use the guarantees – a little more than $ 1 billion so far .
But as Bair explained to bankers last fall , the fees , while " healthy , " are " far below certainly what the cost of credit protection is now in the market . "
Not every finance company has had that peace of mind .
One of GE 's competitors in business lending markets , CIT Group , a smaller company , has had a harder time raising cash .
It has been unable to persuade the FDIC to allow it into the debt - guarantee program , at least in part because of its lower credit ratings .
A recent Standard & Poor 's analysis cited CIT's " inability to access TLGP " as a factor in the company 's declining financial condition .
Two weeks ago , the Obama administration said it would seek to eliminate the Office of Thrift Supervision and force companies like GE to focus on commerce or banking , but not both .
That could require the industrial giant to spin off GE Capital .
Last week , Immelt said GE had no intention of doing that .
" GE is and will remain committed to GE Capital , and we like our strategy , " he said in a memo to staff .
In its proposal to overhaul financial regulation , the Treasury Department pointed out that some firms operating under the existing rules , including collapsed companies such as American International Group , " generally were able to evade effective consolidated supervision and the long - standing policy of separating banking from commerce . "
GE 's Wilkerson said the company generally supports regulatory reform but thinks that it should be permitted to retain its structure .
" Bank reform has historically included grandfathering provisions upon which investors have relied , and there is no reason this settled principle should not be followed here , " he said .
He said the company " did n't have any choice " but to have OTS as its regulator .
The company also objects to the Treasury 's proposal to force firms to separate banking and commerce because that issue " had nothing to do with the financial crisis , " Wilkerson said .
Wilkerson said GE has remained profitable and avoided some of the exotic financial products that contributed to losses at other institutions .
He also said that GE performed an internal stress test this year and found that its capital position was " quite strong by comparison to the banks . "
The FDIC has been working to wean financial institutions off the program .
The TLGP originally was slated to end in June , but at the Treasury 's request the FDIC agreed to extend it until Oct. 31 .
Some participants have stopped using the program , but GE Capital continues to do so for the overwhelming majority of its debt .
Much of the $ 340 billion in debt will come due in 2012 , the year the FDIC guarantees expire .
At that point , known in banking circles as the " cliff , " the agency would have to make good if companies such as GE are unable to honor their obligations .
FDIC officials say they are comfortable that the agency has collected more than enough money to cover potential losses .
Public opinion surveys show that rich and poor share similar viewpoints on how the government should spend its money .
There 's a growing body of research that finds taller people make more money .
The latest study , in Australia , found that being 6 - foot tall brings raises annual income nearly $ 1,000 compared to men two inches shorter .
" Taller people are perceived to be more intelligent and powerful , " according to the study , published recently in the Economic Record .
" Our estimates suggest that if the average man of about 178 centimeters [ 5 feet 10 inches ] gains an additional five centimeters [ 2 inches ] in height , he would be able to earn an extra $ 950 per year - which is approximately equal to the wage gain from one extra year of labor market experience , " said study co-author Andrew Leigh , an economist at the Australian National University .
Other studies in the United States and Britain put the extra earnings at nearly that much per inch .
" The truth is , tall people do make more money .
They make $ 789 more per inch per year , " says Arianne Cohen , author of " The Tall Book " ( Bloomsbury USA , June , 2009 ) .
There 's nothing else physically measurable about tall people that explains the salary boost , however , Cohen explained recently on American Public Media 's radio program Marketplace .
" They 're not nicer .
They 're not prettier .
They 're not anything else .
But they 've sort of gotten a halo in society at this point . "
Serious money over time
As the inches mount , the salary continues to , too .
Cohen 's number is based in part on a 2003 review of four large U.S. and UK studies led by Timothy Judge , a management professor at the University of Florida .
Judge and his colleague concluded that someone who is 7 inches taller — for example , 6 feet versus 5 feet 5 inches — would be expected to earn $ 5,525 more per year .
Height was found to be more important than gender in determining income ( though that claim is debatable , depending on how you analyze the gender salary gap ) and its significance does n't decline with age .
" If you take this over the course of a 30 - year career and compound it , we 're talking about literally hundreds of thousands of dollars of earnings advantage that a tall person enjoys , " Judge said then .
Being tall may boost self - confidence , helping to make a person more successful and also prompting people to ascribe more status and respect to the tall person , Judge said .
Of course all such studies generate averages .
A shorter person can certainly beat the odds , and not every tall person is raking it in .
Cohen , who is 6 foot 3 inches tall , says the pay advantage is conferred partly because taller people tend to exude leadership .
" Tall people tend to act like a leader from a very young age because other children relate to them like a slightly older peer , " she said on the radio program .
" In the workplace , when you 're automatically acting as a leader , that 's really important when it comes time for promotion . "
To some extent , then , the advantage of height may date back to youth .
A 2003 study of 2,000 U.S. men found that their height at age 16 had a big effect on their salary as an adult , regardless of how tall they ended up being .
" We found that two adults of the same age and height , who were different heights at age 16 , were treated differently in the labor market .
The taller teen earned more , " said study team member Nicola Persico of the University of Pennsylvania .
Vertically challenged
All is not rosy on high , however .
In her book , Cohen notes that being tall can cost more , from additional food requirements to costlier clothes and the desire for outsized things like high - ceilinged homes .
( Interestingly , there 's a growing debate about whether obese people should pay for their excess footprint on society and the environment , yet nobody is calling for taxing the tall . )
The average height for American men is about 5 feet 9 inches nearly 5 feet 4 inches for women .
In more than a century , no U.S. president has been below average height ( the last one was William McKinley , at 5 feet 7 inches , and he was ridiculed in the press as a " little boy , " Judge said ) .
Judge figures the advantages of height today are rooted in our evolutionary decision - making regarding who was most powerful .
" When humans evolved as a species and still lived in the jungles or on the plain , they ascribed leader - like qualities to tall people because they thought they would be better able to protect them , " Judge said .
" Although that was thousands of years ago , evolutionary psychologists would argue that some of those old patterns still operate in our perceptions today . "

I might need a bit more space to explain the new features in glibc 2.10 than can reasonably be written down in the release notes .
Therefore I ’ll take some time to describe them here .
POSIX 2008 We (= Austin Group ) have finished work on the 2008 revision of POSIX some time ago .
In glibc 2.10 I ’ve added the necessary feature select macros and more to glibc to support POSIX 2008 .
Most of it , at least .
This was quite easy .
A large part of the work which went into POSIX 2008 was to add functions which have been in glibc to POSIX .
The Unix world catches up with Linux .
I had to implement one new function : psiginfo .
This function is similar to psignal but instead of printing information for a simple signal it prints information for a real - time signal context .
A few things are left to be done .
What I know right now is the implementation of the O_SEARCH and O_EXEC flags .
This needs kernel support .
C++ compliance
The C standard defines functions like strchr in a pretty weak way because C has no function overloading : char * strchr ( const char * , int )
The string parameter and the return value type are as weak as possible .
Non-constant strings can be passed as parameters and the result can be assigned to a constant string variable .
The problem of this is that the const-ness of the parameter is not preserved and reflected in the return value .
This would be the right thing to do since the return value , if not NULL , is pointing somewhere in the parameter string .
C++ with its function overloading can do better .
This is why C++ 1998 actually defines two functions : char * strchr ( char * , int ) const char * strchr ( const char * , int )
These functions do preserve the const-ness .
This is possible because these functions actually have different names after mangling .
Actually , in glibc we use a neat trick of gcc to avoid defining any function with C++ binding but this is irrelevant here .
Anyway , the result of this change is that some incorrect C++ programs , which worked before , will now fail to compile .
const char * in = “ some string ” ; char * i = strchr ( in , ‘ i ’ ) ;
This code will fail because the strchr version selected by the compiler is the second one which returns a constant string pointer .
It is an error ( not only a source of a warning ) in C++ when a const pointer is assigned to a non-const pointer .
As I wrote , this is incorrect C++ code .
But it might trip up some people .
C++ 201x support
There is one interface in the upcoming C++ revision which needs support in the C library , at least to be efficient .
C++ 201x defines yet another set of interface to terminate a process and to register handlers which are run when this happens : int at_quick_exit ( void ( * ) ( void ) ) void quick_exit( int )
The handlers installed with at_quick_exit will only be run when quick_exit is used and not when exit is used .
No global destructors are run either .
That ’s the whole purpose of this new interface .
If the process is in a state where the global destructors cannot be run anymore and the process would crash , quick_exit should be used .
DNS NSS improvement
In glibc 2.9 I already implemented an improvement to the DNS NSS module which optimizes the lookup of IP v4 and IP v6 addresses for the same host .
This can improve the response time of the lookup due to parallelism .
It also fixes a bug in name lookup where the IPv4 and IP v6 addresses could be returned for different hosts .
The problem with this change was that there are broken DNS servers and broken firewall configurations which prevented the two results from being received successfully .
Some broken DNS servers ( especially those in cable modems etc ) only send one reply .
For this reason Fedora had this change disabled in F10 .
For F11
I ’ve added a work - around for broken servers .
The default behavior is the same as described above .
I.e. , we get the improved performance for working DNS servers .
In case the program detects a broken DNS server or firewall because it received only one reply the resolver switches into a mode where the second request is sent only after the first reply has been received .
We still get the benefit of the bug fix described above , though .
The drawback is that a timeout is needed to detect the broken servers or firewalls .
This delay is experienced once per process start and could be noticeable .
But the broken setups of the few people affected must not prevent the far larger group of people with working setups to experience the advantage of the parallel lookup .
There are also ways to avoid the delays , some old , some new : Install a caching name server on this machine or somewhere on the local network .
bind is known to work correctly .
Run nscd on the local machine .
In this case the delay is incurred once per system start ( i.e. , at the first lookup nscd performs ) .
Add “ single - request ” to the options in /etc/resolv.conf .
This selects the compatibility mode from the start .
All of these work - arounds are easy to implement .
Therefore there is no reason to not have the fast mode the default which in any case will work for 99 % of the people .
Use NSS in libcrypt
The NSS I refer to here is the Network Security Services packages .
It provides libraries with implementations of crypto and hash functions , among other things .
In RHEL the NSS package is certified and part of the EAL feature set .
To get compliance for the whole system every implementation of the crypto and hash functions would have to be certified .
This is an expensive and time - consuming process .
The alternative is to use everywhere the same implementation .
This is what a change to libcrypt now allows .
Since NSS is already certified we can just use the implementation of the hash functions from the NSS libraries in the implementation of crypt ( 3 ) in libcrypt .
Bob Relyea implemented a set of new interfaces in the libfreebl3 library to allow the necessary low - level access and freed libfreebl3 from dependencies on NSPR .
By default libcrypt is built as before .
Only with the appropriate configure option is libfreebl3 used .
There are no visible changes ( except the dependency on libfreebl3 ) so users should not have to worry at all .
Combine this with the new password hashing I ’ve developed almost two years ago and we have now fully certified password handling .
printf hooks Certain special interest groups subverted the standardization process ( again ) and pressed through changes to introduce in the C programming language extensions to support decimal floating point computations .
99.99 % of all the people will never use this stuff and still we have to live with it .
I refuse to add support for this to glibc because these extensions are not ( yet ) in the official language standard .
And maybe even after that we ’ll have it separately .
But the DFP extension call for support in printf .
The normal floating - point formats cannot be used .
New modifiers are needed .
The printf in glibc has for the longest time a way to extend it .
One can install handlers for additional format specifiers .
Unfortunately , this extension mechanism is n’t generic enough for the purpose of supporting DFP .
After a couple of versions of a patch from Ryan Arnold I finally finished the work and added a generic framework which allows installing additional modifiers and format specifiers .
int register_printf_specifier ( int , printf_function , printf_arginfo_size_function ) int register_printf_modifier ( wchar_t *) int register_printf_type ( printf_va_arg_function )
With these interfaces DFP printing functions can live outside glibc and still work as if the support were built in .
For an example see my code to print XMM values .
malloc scalability
A change which is rather small in the number of lines it touches went in to make malloc more scalable .
Before , malloc tried to emulate a per-core memory pool .
Every time when contention for all existing memory pools was detected a new pool is created .
Threads stay with the last used pool if possible .
This never worked 100 % because a thread can be descheduled while executing a malloc call .
When some other thread tries to use the memory pool used in the call it would detect contention .
A second problem is that if multiple threads on multiple core / sockets happily use malloc without contention memory from the same pool is used by different cores / on different sockets .
This can lead to false sharing and definitely additional cross traffic because of the meta information updates .
There are more potential problems not worth going into here in detail .
The changes which are in glibc now create per-thread memory pools .
This can eliminate false sharing in most cases .
The meta data is usually accessed only in one thread ( which hopefully does n’t get migrated off its assigned core ) .
To prevent the memory handling from blowing up the address space use too much the number of memory pools is capped .
By default we create up to two memory pools per core on 32 - bit machines and up to eight memory per core on 64 - bit machines .
The code delays testing for the number of cores ( which is not cheap , we have to read / proc / stat ) until there are already two or eight memory pools allocated , respectively .
Using environment variables the implementation can be changed .
If MALLOC_ARENA_TEST_ is set the test for the number of cores is only performed once the number of memory pools in use reaches the value specified by this envvar .
If MALLOC_ARENA_MAX_ is used it sets the maximum number of memory pools used , regardless of the number of cores .
While these changes might increase the number of memory pools which are created ( and thus increase the address space they use ) the number can be controlled .
Because using the old mechanism there could be a new pool being created whenever there are collisions the total number could in theory be higher .
Unlikely but true , so the new mechanism is more predictable .
The important thing to realize , though , is when the old mechanism was developed .
My machine at the time when I added Wolfram ’s dlmalloc to glibc back in 1995 ( I think ) had 64MB of memory .
We ’ve come a long way since then .
Memory use is not that much of a premium anymore and most of the memory pool does n’t actually require memory until it is used , only address space .
We have plenty of that on 64 - bit machines .
32 - bit machines are a different story .
But this is why I limit the number of memory pools on 32 - bit machines so drastically to two per core .
The changes include a second improvement which allow the free function to avoid locking the memory pool in certain situations .
We have done internally some measurements of the effects of the new implementation and they can be quite dramatic .
Information about malloc
There is an obscure SysV interface in glibc called mallinfo .
It allows the caller to get some information about the state of the malloc implementation .
Data like total memory allocated , total address space , etc .
There are multiple problems with this interface , though .
The first problem is that it is completely unsuitable for 64 - bit machines .
The data types required by the SysV spec do n’t allow for values larger 2^31 bytes ( all fields in the structure are int s ) .
The second problem is that the data structure is really specific to the malloc implementation SysV used at that time .
The implementation details of malloc implementations will change over time .
It is therefore a bad idea to codify a specific implementation in the structures which export statistical information .
The new malloc_info function therefore does not export a structure .
Instead it exports the information in a self - describing data structure .
Nowadays the preferred way to do this is via XML .
The format can change over time ( it ’s versioned ) , some fields will stay the same , other will change .
No breakage .
The reader just cannot assume that all the information will forever be available in the same form .
There is no reader in glibc .
This is n’t necessary , it ’s easy enough to write outside glibc using one of the many XML libraries .
Automatic use of optimized function Processor vendors these days spend time fine tuning the instruction sets of their products .
Specialized instructions are introduced which can be used to accelerate the implementation of specific functions .
One problem holding back the adoption of such instructions is that people want their binaries to work everywhere .
One example for such application - specific instructions are the SSE4.2 extensions Intel introduced in their Nehalem core .
This core features special instructions for string handling .
They allow optimized implementations of functions like strlen or strchr etc .
It would of course be possible to start the implementation of these functions with a test for this feature and then use the old or the new implementation .
For functions where the total time a call takes is just a couple of dozen cycles this overhead is noticeable , though .
Therefore I ’ve designed an ELF extension which allows to make the decision about which implementation to use once per process run .
It is implemented using a new ELF symbol type ( STT_GNU_IFUNC ) .
Whenever the a symbol lookup resolves to a symbol with this type the dynamic linker does not immediately return the found value .
Instead it is interpreting the value as a function pointer to a function that takes no argument and returns the real function pointer to use .
The code called can be under control of the implementer and can choose , based on whatever information the implementer wants to use , which of the two or more implementations to use .
This feature is not yet enabled in Fedora 11 .
There is some more binutils work needed and then prelink has to be changed .
My guess is that F11 will go out without glibc taking advantage of this feature itself .
But we will perhaps enable it after the release , once binutils and prelink caught up .
A militant Web site carried unusual praise for President Barack Obama , noting that his quotations from the Quran in his speech Thursday demonstrated respect for Islam and branding him a " wise enemy . "
Obama said in his speech that confronting violent extremism was a key priority , as he called for a " new beginning between the United States and Muslims . "
On the Web , those with militant views largely derided his remarks .
But at least one person posting on an Islamic Web site that usually carries statements from al - Qaida commented on Obama 's respectful gestures to Islam .
Using the screen name Yemen 88 , he wrote that he " admired Hillary Clinton wearing a head scarf at the mosque and she and Obama taking off their shoes . "
He was referring to Obama and the secretary of state 's visit to Cairo 's Sultan Hassan mosque .
" I liked him ( Obama ) saying that girls in American schools are allowed to wear the hijab ... while Tunisia prohibits the hijab , " he wrote .
Obama talked in his speech of his support for a Muslim woman 's right to wear the head scarf in schools and other public places .
The contributor also praised Obama 's quotation of verses from the Quran and said " many of our leaders do n't memorize these verses . "
" Therefore , we have to be fair in assessing this man who might return to Islam , the religion of his father , " he wrote .
Replying to those postings , Bou Shehab wrote , " The man ( Obama ) is manipulating the emotions of the people the same as a lute player does .
...
He is undoubtedly a wise enemy compared with George Bush , the enemy known for his stupidity . "
Bou Shehab said " Obama is more capable of persuading Muslims than others because of his Muslim origin , yet this does not mean he is closer to Muslims or he loves them more than other leaders of infidelity .
...
He is a renegade Muslim . "
The site also carried the more familiar anti-U.S. rhetoric .
" No peace , Obama , you enemy of God , blood for blood , destruction for destruction and the only thing between us is the sword , " one contributor wrote under the pseudonym Nassereldin al - Tamimi .
" What peace are you calling for while your armies are still killing our people in Iraq and Afghanistan and your weapons are still firing on the heads of our people in Palestine and Pakistan ? " he wrote .
One contributor , calling himself Abu Rashed , said he was happy because " the Christian president acknowledged from the heart of Cairo the greatness of Islam , the rule of Islam and the Quran . "
A frequent writer on the Web site , Redha Ahmed Samadi , described the audience at Cairo University as being entranced by Obama 's speech .
" They were in a state of drunkenness while listening to Obama 's satanic revelation , " he said .
Conficker / Downup / Downadup / Kido malware , Symantec writes in the first edition of The Downadup Codex , “ is , to date , one of the most complex worms in the history of malicious code “ .
At first spread through a flaw within the Windows Server service , the threat has grown immensely because of a combination of elements that facilitated its diffusion and drove the IT industry to unite in the attempt to block its further proliferation .
Even if the botnet continues to be silent , with no apparent malicious action ordered by the worms creator , network infrastructures are starting to suffer collateral damages from the infection and , after the already reported episode of the French navy computers , at the beginning of March Sophos revealed that during this month some legit domains would have suffered a sort of unintentional distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) attack caused by the worm ’s remote communication feature .
Sophos made known the presence , within the daily lists of 250 pseudo - random domains generated by Conficker during the month of March , of domain names owned by organizations or companies that have nothing to do with malware writing .
Among these there is the Texan airway Southwest Airlines , which other than domain southwest.com also owns the “ alternative ” resource wnsux.com pointing to the first address .
Unfortunately for the company , such resource just matches one of those remote servers that the millions machines infected by Conficker are trying to contact in these days , waiting for instructions or a possible code update .
The botnet assaulted the domain on March 13 , and if the company had n’t prepared the right countermeasures after having been warned by Sophos it surely would have had to face serious issues for site access and functionality .
Southwest Airlines suitably prevented resolution of an IP address for the blamed domain , now the next deadlines for Conficker DDoS “ attacks ” are scheduled for March 18 ( qhflh.com , Women ’s Net in Qinghai Province ) and March 31 ( praat.org , Praat : doing phonetics by computer ) .
Besides the effects of the domain names generation mechanism , anyway , according to data collected by company Arbor Networks it seems that Conficker proliferation have reached its peak and the number of unique infected IP addresses have halted at about 3 millions per day .
The botnet does not grow anymore , but this state of things does n’t prevent its puppeteers to try to manage zombie - PCs already under their control and , above all , to adequately reply to the “ Conficker Cabal ” , the plot planned by Microsoft and its allies to stop the malware run .
According to Symantec , contrariwise to the previous , alleged new variant Conficker B++ , this time the authors have updated the worm for real and the last detected version , dubbed W32 .
Downadup .C , adds new features to malware code and makes the threat even more dangerous and worrisome than before .
The first analyses on Downadup .
C reveal that the worm continues to rely on the usual mechanisms for its proliferation ( hence the MS08 - 067 flaw , removable drives and network shares ) , but it has also become much more aggressive by targeting processes of security and analysis software removing them from memory if found on the infected machine .
The reply to Conficker Cabal has then become real with improvement of the algorithm for domain names lists creation , that now includes something like 50,000 different daily domains plus one of the 116 existing suffixes .
What are the objectives of the new update ?
“ Authors are now aiming for increasing the longevity of the existing Downadup threat on infected machines – Symantec writes – Instead of trying to infect further systems , they seem to be protecting currently infected Downadup machines from antivirus software and remediation “ .
The number of infections does n’t seem to have grown further , but the appearance of Downadup .
C is particularly important because according to Symantec it represents “ the first real case ” of a successful communication between malware writers and the worm , that in return gets the new binary code to update the infection .
Considering the somewhat scarce number of machines affected by the update , anyway , Symantec is currently unable to decide if it is a restricted test or the first phase of a broader strateg

THE CHINESE national anthem , like for most countries , is militaristic , jingoistic and -- unless one is a fan of marching -- difficult to listen to .
Unlike most others , however , it begins with the line " Arise , all who refuse to be slaves " and calls on the people to " stand up . "
The lyrics were a product of the nationalist revolution of 1949 , in which , following the defeat of the Japanese colonialists four years earlier , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) was victorious in a civil war over the Nationalist Party .
In October 1949 , Mao Zedong , leader of the CCP , addressed tens of thousands in Tiananmen Square , announcing the creation of a " People 's Republic " free from imperialist occupation .
Meaning " Gate of Heavenly Peace , " Tiananmen is the entrance to the Forbidden City , the part of Beijing from which many emperors -- figuratively and physically sealed off from the population -- ruled China .
Four decades later , over the course of several weeks , hundreds of thousands would again " stand up " and occupy Tiananmen , supported by millions of people around the city and the country .
The 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising shook China 's rulers
This was the Tiananmen Square rebellion , and its participants were " standing up " not to colonialism and occupation , but to economic crisis , corruption and autocracy -- against a government that claimed to stand for socialism , but in reality ruled with an iron fist over an exploitative and oppressive system .
This regime eventually struck back against the Tiananmen uprising , crushing a revolt that threatened to shake its rule .
WHAT HAPPENED over the course of those spring weeks in 1989 ?
How did the conflict come to the point where so much blood was shed ?
From the beginning , the system established by Mao's CCP was a state capitalist command economy , not socialism .
The party and state bureaucracy made all the important decisions about society , with the aim of accomplishing national economic development along the lines of the Russian model established under Joseph Stalin 's totalitarian rule .
By the 1970s , the ruling faction of the Chinese government , led by Deng Xiaoping , steered the country toward " socialism with Chinese characteristics . "
This meant unleashing free - market forces in the countryside , where 80 percent of the Chinese population lived , and developing industry in multiple coastal cities through foreign investment and the use of Western technology and management techniques .

Web site for more details .
See you at Socialism !
In order to further this economic strategy , the government had to educate a homegrown army of technicians , engineers and managers by expanding access to education .
As part of this move , it was important to relax the political control of the CCP to some extent .
Greater latitude to think and debate freely , especially within educational institutions , was a necessary precondition to economic reform .
Economic reforms did lead to 10 percent growth for almost every year during the 1980s , but there were still sharp ups and downs as the economy lurched forward .
By 1988 , the country was deep in an economic crisis , with inflation spiraling out of control .
While China 's first efforts were modeled on Stalin 's multiple five - year - plans , and Deng later incorporated free - market forces into his restructuring policies , both strategies had the common denominator of setting priorities based on the need to compete in an international capitalist economy .
This economic competition with the outside world was the whip that drove China to advance its economy at any cost necessary .
Like Stalin's Russia , the rhetoric of socialism was merely a tool to motivate workers to produce more .
By the end of the 1980s , increased political freedom resulted in people feeling they could finally air their discontent .
The ruling class , already divided as a result of internal battles over how to carry out its program , was unable to alleviate the economic crisis .
On the contrary , while workers suffered from price inflation and mass layoffs , officials and businessmen were seen to be living better than ever .
This was the tinder for the revolt .
HU YAOBANG , the former general secretary of the CCP , died on April 15 , 1989 .
Two years prior , he had been driven from his position in the party in disgrace because he was seen as challenging corruption .
In an obvious reference to then - 84 - year - old Deng , posters appeared around Beijing declaring : " The wrong man has died ... Those who should die still live ... Those who should live have died . "
The first protest march on April 17 to Tiananmen Square only numbered in the hundreds , but the chants were indicative of the mood : " Long live Hu Yaobang .
Long live democracy .
Long live freedom .
Down with corruption .
Down with bureaucracy . "
As protests continued , Hu Yaobang became less a focus , and dissatisfaction with the status quo sharpened .
At its heart , the Tiananmen struggle was for bourgeois democratic rights -- like those in a country like the U.S. , where people have the freedom to vote and protest , even though a small minority holds political power in the interest of the rich .
But compared to the CCP dictatorship , such democratic rights would have been a step forward .
The Tiananmen movement was being led by students and intellectuals , and had sympathizers among a small minority of the ruling class .
Its demands found resonance within society at large , especially among the quickly growing urban working class .
As with any struggle , there were a variety of political ideas within the pro-democracy movement .
A significant number of students identified with Western culture and economic systems .
With Deng declaring , " to get rich is glorious , " it is n't surprising that some people would take those words seriously , and want some idealized version of capitalist society .
Because of the temporary classless position of students -- with the potential to become workers , bureaucrats or businessmen - - many saw sense in appealing to a section of China 's rulers to give them some political power , in exchange for their support .
Some sections of the students wanted to keep their struggle pure , separate from the rest of society .
Others were aware that the movement had struck a chord with a significant section of society , giving it a power it never would have had otherwise .
Regardless of whether students were conscious of it , however , the mass character of the struggle -- and the potential it represented -- stirred fear among China 's rulers , who prepared a bloody response .
Hu 's official state funeral was to take place on April 22 , across the street from Tiananmen Square .
The night before , tens of thousands of students from universities and colleges across the city began pouring into the streets .
The march grew to 100,000 and stretched more than two miles .
Nothing like it has been seen in China since the Cultural Revolution in the 1970s .
Every Beijing institution was represented , including students from other cities .
Unperturbed by the presence of police and soldiers , the students refused to clear the square .
As the octogenarians who ran the country were walked , wheeled and carried into Hu's service , chants of " Long live democracy , down with autocracy " could be heard echoing across the square .
From the party 's perspective , this insolence could not go unanswered .
The People 's Daily editorial carried Deng 's line characterizing the demonstrations as " planned conspiracy and turmoil , its essence is once and for all to negate the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system . "
Instead of being intimidated , however , students were enraged .
Meeting on the night of April 26 , the Provisional Beijing Students ' Union called for a mass march the next day .
Thousands gathered on campuses across Beijing , broke through police lines and came together in a procession of 150,000 .
The government 's ultimatum had been met with open defiance .
While hardliners in the CCP wanted to squash the movement through fear , General Secretary Zhao Ziyang sought a different approach , trying to placate the students .
In his speech , he implicitly undercut Deng 's editorial assertion and stated that there was " no great turmoil . "
The old guard , of course , saw such conciliation as weakness .
While the divisions had existed in China 's ruling class previously , they were now clear for all to see .
The debate over how to deal with the protesters fell along similar lines to the argument about how to move forward with China 's economic development .
This was reflected , too , among the students , who held a variety of opinions as to the direction and speed that reforms should take .
The Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev -- who was presiding over his own policies , called perestroika ( restructuring ) and glasnost ( openness ) , to reform state capitalism in the USSR - - was due to arrive in Beijing on May 15 .
This would be the first visit from a Russian head of state since the split between the USSR and China in the early 1960s .
The world lens would be focused on Beijing .
Meanwhile , students had embarked on a hunger strike to revitalize the movement , which had been waning in strength after Zhao 's intervention .
The hunger strike was a success at raising the level of sympathy for the students ' cause .
On its fourth day , when 600 people were taken to the hospital , hundreds of thousands of people poured into the square to show their solidarity .
British journalist Michael Fathers described the scene :
The following day , the students staged their biggest demonstration yet .
At their encouragement , more than a million people took to the streets ... Sympathy demonstrations broke out in at least 24 cities across the country ...
Schoolchildren thrust tiny fists into the air , led by their teachers in chants of " long live democracy , down with corruption . "
Workers arrived from Beijing Brewery , the Capital Iron and Steel Works and the Beijing Jeep Corporation .
" Get up and stand up for your rights , " chanted a group of teenagers , carrying a black - and - white banner bearing the image of Bob Marley ...
Of all the slogans , placards and flags on view in and around Tiananmen Square , the most worrying for the leadership was surely the long red banner carried by short - haired men in uniforms .
" The People 's Liberation Army , " it announced in gold letters .
THIS WAS the apex of the struggle , with demonstrations held in cities across the country .
It was clear to the ruling bureaucracy that it had to act soon if the status quo was going to be maintained .
The army began its invasion of Beijing early on May 20 , but the citizens of Beijing rose up to protect the students .
As Fathers wrote :
The people 's army had been outmaneuvered by the people .
Without orders to open fire , troops sat disconsolately on the back of canvas - covered trucks , cradling their AK - 47 rifles .
Around them swarmed not only students in headbands , but workers , old women , middle - aged cadres , all of them chanting " Go home " and " The people 's army should love the people . "
This outpouring of support materialized because ordinary people supported the students against the government .
While the workers did n't necessarily share all the political positions of the students , they were fed up with the system for their own reasons , and when the government ordered the invasion , they knew whose side they were on .
The Beijing Autonomous Union had been founded only weeks before by workers who wanted to do something around inflation and corruption , and saw their official state - run union as passive at best , and obstructionist at worst .
As one of their posters summarized :
We have calculated carefully , based on Marx 's Capital , the rate of exploitation of workers .
We discovered that the " servants of the people " swallow all the surplus value produced by the people 's blood and sweat ... There are only two classes : the rulers and the ruled ... The political campaigns of the past 40 years amount to a political method for suppressing the people ...
History 's final accounting has yet to be completed .
Many students felt they had a friend in Zhao Ziyang , and that Deng 's overall project of modernizing China was a step in the right direction .
Most workers , on the other hand , were less enthusiastic about Deng 's reforms , because they were the gears upon which China 's economic development turned .
The workers who took part in the struggle wanted independent organizations to defend their class interests .
But on the whole , the working class was unorganized .
Its leadership in the struggle was n't an option , so that role fell to students and intellectuals .
On May 30 , the " Goddess of Democracy , " a 30 - foot plaster version of the Statue of Liberty , was erected in Tiananmen .
But the number of students in the square was diminishing rapidly , and the arrival of the statue did little to bring in more support .
The Army moved in with a final assault on June 4 , using tanks and live ammunition .
The resistance , while heroic in its attempts to stop the advancing army , was ultimately futile .
It 's difficult to say how many died , since the victor wanted to downplay the bloodshed in its version of history .
Needless to say , the brunt of the violence was borne by the common citizens of the city , who had only buses , barricades and their bodies with which to confront the armed soldiers .
Much ink condemning the Chinese government was spilled in the Western media after the fact , and the image of one lone individual stopping the advance of a line of tanks was played and replayed .
But once the blood and broken bodies had been swept from the streets , the Western powers from which the condemnations came were all too eager to get back to business as usual with China .
Sadly , some organizations on the left today -- like the Party for Socialism and Liberation , for example -- continue to this day to make excuses for the CCP 's slaughter at Tiananmen , on the bizarre reasoning that the Chinese government remained a defender of the working class .
This kind of twisted thinking has to be rejected outright if politics for true working class liberation , in China or anywhere else , are going to be put forward .
Socialism is the polar opposite of the barbaric regime that crushed the Tiananmen Square revolt .
Anyone who believes in justice will look forward to the day when the Chinese working class , one of the largest in the world , will lead the struggle not only for its own emancipation , but the freedom of every oppressed group in China .
When they do , they will be following in the tradition of the students and workers who gathered in Tiananmen in the spring of 1989 .
A lot of websites focus on finding ways to save or invest money .
If you are a regular reader of this site , you know saving and frugality are topics I spend a lot of time writing about .
And with good reason – maximizing your savings and investments is one of the most important things you can do for your future .
That is because money saved now is worth more than money earned in the future .
The time value of money , compound interest , taxation , and other factors play a key role in this fact .
But there is more to life than just saving for a rainy day , or investing until your net worth is the size of a small country .
Money is Only Meant for One Thing – Spending
Think about it for a minute – why do people focus so much on saving and investing ?
It ’s so they can have more money later … to spend .
Otherwise there would be no point in saving or investing .
The key is to spend less than you earn , but still enjoy life in the present .
Many people equate saving money to increased security .
And that is a good thing .
It ’s always good to have a financial buffer .
An emergency fund can prevent you from going into debt .
Having that financial security can help you sleep better at night .
These are good things .
But it ’s also good to have a healthy relationship with spending money .
The Benefits of Spending Consciously
There is a lot to be said about being a frugal person .
I try to save money whenever possible – I use coupons , buy quality items , and shop with a plan .
But that does n’t mean I am cheap or afraid to spend money .
I have no problem spending money , so long as I make the conscious decision to spend .
I do n’t like the idea of buying things out of habit .
I try to avoid spending money for the sake of buying the newest gadget or out of boredom .
When I spend money , I want to receive value and pleasure from the action .
Let me give you an example .
Eating out .
Once a week I go out to eat with a coworker or with my wife .
It is a planned event and it certainly is n’t a big splurge for my wallet or my waistline .
I have no problem spending money once a week for a change of pace , to socialize , and to get out of the office .
The rest of the week I prefer to brown bag it .
I enjoy eating leftovers – they often taste better than eating out and are healthier for my waistline and wallet .
I enjoy going out to lunch , but I do n’t think I would enjoy eating out everyday .
Now let ’s look at a different situation .
I have a coworker who eats out for lunch everyday .
Is that a problem ?
Not for him .
I asked him about it one day and he responded , “ I ’m in my fifties .
I do n’t drink , I do n’t smoke , I do n’t fool around with the ladies .
This is my vice . ”
I ’d say on average , my coworker spends $ 10 or more on each lunch ( he never eats fast food ) .
That comes out to well over $ 200 per month , and probably over $ 3,000 per year .
But that is not a problem for him because he budgets for it , he enjoys it , and he does it consciously .
Eating out is one of his spending priorities .
It ’s OK to splurge
JD , from Get Rich Slowly , asked several personal finance bloggers and his readers what they splurge on .
His article contained responses from about 15 personal finance bloggers , and elicited over 150 reader responses .
The items people chose to spend a little extra on , even when it was n’t necessary , shared a common bond : they make life a little brighter and more enjoyable now .
Unconscious Spending Causes Problems
Spending money is not bad – it is designed to be spent .
But unconscious spending can cause big problems .
It would bee a big problem for me if I ate out every day , spent several thousand dollars every year , blew my budget , and did n’t derive any pleasure from it .
But it ’s not a problem for my friend who budgets for it and enjoys it .
So long as you are sticking within your budget and are n’t spending yourself into debt , then you should n’t be afraid to go out to lunch every day , or spending money on another habit .
If it is important to you , then find a way to fit it into your budget .
Just make sure that when you place those items on the counter and reach for your wallet that you are doing so consciously , and not out of habit .
Spend Money on the Important Things in Life
Everyone had at least one item they often splurged on .
The most common items I noticed were food , experiences ( travel , concerts , eating out , etc. ) , quality of life issues ( clothing , appearance , housing , etc. ) , and recreation .
People splurge on things that are important to them .
My answer was experiences ( more on that below ) .
But others prefer to spend extra money to enjoy life every day with a nice meal or a quality glass of wine .
Others prefer to spend more money to decorate their house or buy nice clothing .
Sports , video games , and other recreational items bring others joy .
I Like to Spend Money on Experiences
Last fall my wife and I took our honeymoon – a cruise on the Mediterranean Sea .
We traveled to Spain , Italy , France , Corsica , and Gibraltar .
We did as many excursions as we could , ate wonderful food , and had an exceptional time .
The memories we made during our honeymoon will last our lifetime .
We spent several thousand dollars and came back with nothing but memories , hundreds of photographs , and a few small gifts for family .
And it was worth every cent .
My wife and I also like to travel or go to ball games , concerts , musicals , and plays .
These are experiences you have to pay a lot of money for , and when it is all said and done , there is nothing tangible to show for it ( unless you buy overpriced souvenirs ) .
So what ?
Having the opportunity to see a commemorative showing of The Phantom of the Opera in London was an awe - inspiring event .
Rock concerts ?
I have been to dozens .
I have spent hundreds of dollars on live concert events , but I have seen some amazing bands perform live and it was worth every cent .
Money is for Spending .
Money is for Living .
It ’s easy to get caught up in debt reduction or retirement planning and get stuck in the rut of “ cut back , spend less , save more , repeat . ”
It ’s easy to forget that life is more than just living for tomorrow .
We need to remember to live for today , while we think and prepare for tomorrow .
Let me give you an example :
One of my favorite personal finance blogs is Gather Little By Little , which chronicles the author ’s journey out of debt .
Glblguy shares his experiences , and though he has a ways to go before he is debt free , he and his wife have made great progress .
One of the things I really enjoy about his blog is candor in sharing his financial decisions .
You see , even though he has debt , he still knows it is important to spend money now .
The best example of this is a recent article in which Glblguy shared how he bought his wife an engagement ring on - line to replace her old one which they had to sell because of financial hardship .
I know this was a difficult story to write , but it illustrates how dire their financial situation was , and how much it affected them emotionally .
When they had an unexpected tax return , they decided the money was worth more to them to replace the ring than it was worth to repay debt .
And I agree , 100 % .
This is a must read story to understand why spending money now is just as important as repaying debt or saving money for later .
There is more to life than repaying debt or saving for a rainy day .
Money is for spending .
Money is for living .
After all , life is too short to drink cheap beer .
Even for someone who has been in this business for as long as I have , the concept of “ PHP Community ” is very hard to grasp , perhaps because there are so many ways that it could be defined : if you think of it as the sum of people who write PHP code for a living ?
In that case , you ’re excluding those who do it as a hobby .
If you limit your choice to those people who actively participate in the development of PHP itself , you ’re cutting out a huge number of people who drive the development of PHP merely by virtue of their needs , without ever writing a single line of C code .
On one hand , coming up with a comprehensive definition of PHP community is a bit like making sense of an M.C. Escher art piece : a thoroughly pointless exercise that yields completely different ( and completely incompatible ) results depending on the starting point and methodology used .
On the other hand , php|architect provides me with a number of opportunities to look at one definition of the PHP community : our subscriber and client base , for example , give us important clues on the kind of people who use PHP in a professional environment ( and , of course , who happen to be our clients ) .
A Community Grows Up
Outside the realm of statistical research , the best indicator of how the community changes is simple observation — something I get to do a lot at our conferences , like the recently - held php|tek , which took place last month in Chicago .
There is no doubt in my mind that the average age of the PHP developer is on its way up — at this year ’s conference , there was a bit more white hair , and a larger number of bleary - eyes attendees at the early - morning sessions , which perhaps suggests that the
evening parties were a bit too successful .
There are , however , much subtler clues that speak to the maturity of the community much more than just the age of its members .
Many of the really popular topics at this year ’s conference were topics that used to be deserted : for the first time in the seven years that MTA has been organizing developer events , subjects like best practices , security , code review and developer management were better attended than starter talks designed for beginners .
Incidentally , I was not the only one to notice this ; Matthew Weier O’Phinney , lead developer on Zend Framework , noted in a recent e-mail that
I ’ve presented sessions on PHP “ best practices ” for close to three years now .
Since I first began , I ’d ask how many people were doing a particular practice already .
For the first couple years , there ’d be a handful at every session , no more , no less .
But last year , I noticed a change : while speaking at DPC , I ’d ask the question ,
and literally 80 % of the audience would raise their hands .
For
every question .
Incidents and Accidents
Another piece of evidence that indicates how the community is evolving is in the number of new faces that are slowly making their way to the forefront of many initiatives — both old and new .
As Cal Evans , who runs the Center for PHP Excellence at Ibuildings , PHP developers can be roughly divided in three categories : “ core ” members who support and grow the community ( often on a volunteer basis ) , “ participants ” who follow what happens in the community but do not actively participate in it and an “ outer layer ” of people who could be best termed the “ silent masses ” : they do not blog about PHP , participate in the mailing lists or attend conferences .
Cal puts it best when he says that
[t ] he task before the [ first two categories ] is to get as many of the users involved in the community as possible — not just
standing on the edge but deep into the the community , bringing their knowledge , solutions and view points with them .
As we come together , help each other solve problems , share our knowledge and generally learn how to work with each other , we make it easier for new users to join the outer strata .
Additionally , because we are already a diverse group and we ’ve learned to work with each other , we ’ve made it easier for users to move inward into the community , instead of jealously protecting the boundaries of the core as the turf of a select few .
The effect that Cal describes is best visible in the many initiatives that see more and more developers find a way to directly contribute to the community at large — witness , for example , the impromptu meeting that several project leads organized at php|tek to come up with a set of unified coding standards to improve the interoperability of PHP frameworks .
A number of people with hitherto limited interest in community work found out about the initiative and helped get it off the ground .
Of course , the community is still home to many ideas and , as such , conflicts — like the one that befell the very same standards initiative — are sometimes inevitable ( and , in all fairness , not always dealt with in a reasonable and adult manner ) .
This , however , is a problem that afflicts any project , whether public and open to all or private and open only to some — it ’s only with the former that one gets to appreciate the entire , unadulterated , ugly process of hashing out disagreements .
Then again , from conflict often arise new developments — as hopefully will be the case here .
What do you think ?
Sound off in our comments , or tweet yourideas and PHP stories to @phparch .
Geert Wilders , Holland 's anti-immigrant , Muslim - baiting maverick , appeared to be heading for a triumph in his first European election tonight , with polls and surveys indicating that he could win the ballot in the Netherlands .
The Dutch , as well as the British , kicked off four days of elections to the European parliament across the EU 's 27 countries .
Wilders cast an optimistic vote in The Hague and declared that Turkey could not join the EU " in a million years " .
A detailed poll - tracking survey , predict09.eu , run by political scientists at the London School of Economics and Trinity College Dublin , indicated that Wilder 's Freedom party could take 21 % of the vote and six of the Netherlands ' 25 seats in Brussels and Strasbourg , ahead of the traditionally governing parties , the Christian Democrats and the Labour party , which are currently in coalition .
Some Dutch opinion surveys supported the poll trackers , or put Wilders neck and neck with the Christian democrats of the prime minister , Jan-Peter Balkenende .
A mock election among 15,000 pupils in 140 schools in the Netherlands this week also gave Wilders more than 19 % support , ahead of all other parties .
Wilders wants the European parliament abolished , and Bulgaria and Romania kicked out of the EU .
The virulence of his anti-Islam and anti-immigrant activities saw him barred from entering Britain this year and the Dutch authorities are prosecuting him for discrimination .
The poll trackers predicted six seats for Wilders , compared with a projection of three a month ago .
Opinion poll support for the tall , bleach - haired populist has doubled this year , while his video film Fitna stirred outrage with its graphic depiction of Islam as synonymous with violence and terrorism .
Whether or not he wins , Wilders appeared certain to perform extremely well , highlighting the wave of euroscepticism engulfing the traditionally pro-EU country and union founding member .
Britain and the Netherlands started the 27 - country election yesterday with their votes , and the polls end on Sunday .
The Dutch were expected to bend the rules governing the world 's biggest transnational ballot by releasing reliable partial results and exit polls tonight .
Politicians and senior EU officials meanwhile appealed for people to use their vote amid fears the turnout would fall well below 40 % , to the lowest level of the seven elections in the past 30 years .
Early indications from the Netherlands showed a slightly higher turnout than five years ago , but it was still low , at around 40 % , a level half that seen in the previous general election .
About 375 million people are eligible to vote for 736 seats in the chamber , which alternates between Brussels and Strasbourg .
With unemployment across the EU nudging 10 % – the highest level in 10 years according to figures released this week – the recession , jobs , and worries for the future are the key issues outside Britain .
Voter confusion , apathy , and anger are likely to cause both a low turnout and a wave of anti-incumbent protest voting that will hit the mainstream parties and benefit extremists on the far right and the hard left , according to analysts .
That appeared to be part of the picture in the Netherlands yesterday .
The parliament will still be dominated , however , by the two big groupings of the centre - right and centre - left , with the Christian Democrats of the European People 's party mustering around 260 seats transnationally to the European Socialists ' ( social democrats ) 200 , according to the LSE team .
The new parliament has 49 fewer seats than the outgoing assembly , and outright anti-Europeans and eurosceptics are expected to increase their presence to around 100 seats .
Be wary , and do not dismiss the contrarian viewpoint .
Time
" By [ Ghorbanifar 's ] own account he was a refugee from the revolutionary government of Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini , which confiscated his businesses in Iran , yet he later became a trusted friend and kitchen adviser to Mir Hussein Mousavi , Prime Minister in the Khomeini government .
Some U.S. officials who have dealt with Ghorbanifar praise him highly .
Says Michael Ledeen , adviser to the Pentagon on counterterrorism : " [ Ghorbanifar ] is one of the most honest , educated , honorable men I have ever known . "
Others call him a liar who , as one puts it , could not tell the truth about the clothes he is wearing , " ...
To fulfill his grand geopolitical vision , he demonstrated a willingness to destabilize an entire region and to risk nuclear war :
In 1977 Zbigniew Brzezinski , as President Carter ’s National Security Adviser , forms the Nationalities Working Group ( NWG ) dedicated to the idea of weakening the Soviet Union by inflaming its ethnic tensions .
The Islamic populations are regarded as prime targets .
Richard Pipes , the father of Daniel Pipes , takes over the leadership of the NWG in 1981 .
Pipes predicts that with the right encouragement Soviet Muslims will “ explode into genocidal fury ” against Moscow .
Brzezinski laid the groundwork for our present problems by initiating an alliance with Muslim jihadis in Afghanistan .
In order to topple the closest thing to a functioning modern government that country has ever had , Brzesinski fomented a rebellion of thugs , zealots and terrorists , who later turned on the United States .
Osama Bin Laden first came to prominence in Brzezinski's war .
An interviewer once asked Brzezinski if supporting the Mujahadeen might be a mistake .
Brzezinski's answer :
" What 's a few riled - up Muslims ? "
His obsession with the Soviet Union led to Islamic revolution in Iran : In November 1978 , President Carter appointed George Ball head of a special White House Iran task force under Brzezinski .
Ball recommends the US should drop support for the Shah of Iran and support the radical Islamist opposition of Ayatollah Khomeini .
This idea is based on ideas from British Islamic expert Dr. Bernard Lewis , who advocates the balkanization of the entire Muslim Near East along tribal and religious lines .
The chaos would spread in what he also calls an “ arc of crisis ” and ultimately destabilize the Muslim regions of the Soviet Union .
Few on either the right or the left understand that , until roughly a year - and - a - half before the revolution in Iran , the Socialist Tudeh party and the constitutionalist National Front commanded wide public support in that country and stood an excellent chance of gaining power when the Shah 's tyranny ended .
When the CIA learned of the Shah 's precarious health , Brzezinski had the Agency covertly aid the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini , a Shi'ite theocract .
The goal was twofold : Preventing a Socialist or nationalist government from taking power , and fomenting a jihad against the Soviets .
Brzezinski was ( is ? ) Obama 's mentor .
This is that .
Update :
I 've paid so much attention to the Italian bonds mystery that I 've neglected the uprising that resulted from the controversial election in Iran .
My current take on the matter will irritate a good many of you .
My advice : I'm starting to suspect that this " uprising " is 1953 all over again .
This story gives some of the background for Mir-Hossein Mousavi , the Iranian politician allegedly robbed in the election .
Turns out he has close ties to the old Iran - contra gang -- Manuchar Ghorbinfar , Adnan Khashogghi , and dear old Michael Ledeen .
Long - time readers know my feelings about Mikey .
The following comes frommagazine , January 1987 : Keep in mind that Mousavi ordered the execution of 30,000 political prisoners in 1988 .
This is not a nice guy .
One theory -- and it is really more than a theory -- holds that the 1979 Iran revolution was itself a CIA coup .
During the last years of the Shah 's regime , the Socialist party of Iran stood a good chance of gaining power .
The CIA knew that the Shah could not last .
America could not tolerate the ascent of Socialism in such an oil rich nation .
Moreover , neocon strategic thinkers wanted to see a sharp rise in Islamic fundamentalism on the border of the USSR .
At the time , the Ayatollah Khomeini was an obscure exile .
One Iranian dissident once told me that the CIA arranged for the widespread duplication and distribution of Khomeini 's tapes in Iran .
I do not know the basis for his claim , but I suspect that he was right .
In my view , Khomeini was put into power on the " better a religious kook than a red " theory .
American spooks kept their man Mousavi close to him .
Eventually , Mousavi killed all of the Socialists in Iran .
That was the reason why he was put into that position .
Why do I say that this is more than a theory ?
Because Zbigniew Brzezinski ( Jimmy Carter 's Kissinger ) pretty much let the cat out of the bag .
If I may quote from an older post
It 's important that you understand this history , becauseAt present , Obama is advised by people who share Brzenzinski's worldview and obsessions .
What 's past is present .
And the future ?
Recall Joe Biden 's prediction of a great foreign policy test for Obama which would come early in his presidency .
Nothing in this post should be taken as favoring Iranian theocracy or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
However , I am -- as always -- 100 % against any military attack on Iran by either the United States or Israel .
That has been my position for years .
And right now , I 'm very afraid .
The media manipulation is pretty obvious .
This CNN story is ominously headlined " Ahmadinejad : No guarantee on rival 's safety , " which makes it seem as though we 've wandered into a Martin Scorcese movie .
But when you go on to read the actual words used by Ahmadinejad -- " There is rule of law in this country and all the people are equal before the law " -- you get quite a different impression .
I have a friend who has a Ph.D in bioinformatics .
Over a beer last week , we ended up discussing the H1N1 flu virus , epidemic modeling , and countless other fascinating and somewhat scary things .
She told me that epidemiologists have been experimenting with alternate methods of creating transmission models – specifically , she talked about a group that was using data from the Where ’s George ?
project to build a computer model for tracking and predicting the spread of contagions ( which I read about again in this NYTimes article two days later ) .
This got me thinking about the data that is hidden in various social network information streams – Facebook & Twitter updates in particular .
People share a lot of information in their tweets – some of it shared intentionally , and some of it which could be uncovered with some rudimentary searching .
I wondered if it would be possible to extract travel information from people ’s public Twitter streams by searching for the term ‘ Just landed in …’ .
The idea is simple :
Find tweets that contain this phrase , parse out the location they ’d just landed in , along with the home location they list on their Twitter profile , and use this to map out travel in the Twittersphere ( yes , I just used the phrase ‘ Twittersphere ’ ) .
Twitter ’s search API gives us an easy way to get a list of tweets containing the phrase – I am working in Processing so I used Twitter 4J to acquire the data from Twitter .
The next question was a bit trickier – how would I extract location data from a list of tweets like this ?:
Queen_Btch : just landed in London heading to the pub for a drink then im of to bed … so tired who knew hooking up on an airplane would be so tiring =S
jjvirgin : Just landed in Maui and I feel better already …
Four days here then off to vegas
checrothers : Just landed in Dakar , Senegal …
Another 9 hours n I ’ll be in South Africa two entire days after I left … Doodles
It turned out to be a lot easier than I thought .
MetaCarta offers 2 different APIs that can extract longitude & latitude information from a query .
It can take the tweets above and extract locations :
London , London , United Kingdom – “ Latitude ” : 51.52 , “ Longitude ” : - 0.1
Maui , Hawaii , United States – “ Latitude ” : 20.5819 , “ Longitude ” : -156.375
Dakar , Dakar , Senegal – “ Latitude ” : 14.72 , “ Longitude ” : - 17.48
This seemed perfect , so I signed up for an API key and set to work hooking the APIs up to Processing .
This was a little bit tricky , since the APIs require authentication .
After a bit of back and forth , I managed to track down the right libraries to implement Basic Authorization in Processing .
I ended up writing a set of Classes to talk to MetaCarta – I ’ll share these in a follow - up post later this week .
Now I had a way to take a series of tweets , and extract location data from them .
I did the same thing with the location information from the Twitter user ’s profile page – I could have gotten this via the Twitter API but it would cost one query per user , and Twitter limits requests to 100 / hour , so I went the quick and dirty way and scraped this information from HTML .
This gave me a pair of location points that could be placed on a map .
This was reasonably easy with some assistance from the very informative map projection pages on Wolfram MathWorld .
I ’ll admit it took some time to get the whole thing working the way that I wanted it to , but Processing is a perfect environment for this kind of project – bringing in data , implementing 3D , exporting to video – it ’s all relatively easy .
Here ’s a render from the system , showing about 36 hours of Twitter - harvested travel :
Just Landed – 36 Hours from blprnt on Vimeo .
And another , earlier render showing just 4 hours but running a bit slower ( I like this pace a lot better – but not the files size of the 36 hour video rendered at this speed !! )
Just Landed – Test Render ( 4 hrs ) from blprnt on Vimeo .
Now , I realize this is a far stretch from a working model to predict epidemics .
But , it sure does look cool .
I also I think it will be a good base for some more interesting work .
Of course , as always , I ’d love to hear your feedback and suggestions .

I disagree with you on this .
Every country in this world has its flaws some more than others .
China blocks your access to youtube , twitter ... etc. Why ?
The answer seems very obvious to me that they want to censor and block information to the people .
Why do you think they would go through such lengths to do so ????
Maybe cause they have a lot to hide from the masses .
In the states atleast we have the option to seek the " real truth " through research .
Do you think you will be able to go on a gadget blog and rant about how shitty your country is in China ?
Your statements about America would make you a dissident of the United States but atleast in this country we 're not going to lock you up or try to shut you up .
Human Resources
Pop Quiz :
Which of these workers qualifies as an independent contractor ?
a . A newspaper carrier paid for each copy delivered b.
A knife salesman who works on commission , rents his own office , and pays his own staff c. A consultant who works part time for a marketing firm
If you 're like many employers , you might think the answer is " all of the above . "
And there are many incentives to make that choice .
When a company classifies a worker as a contractor rather than as an employee , it avoids paying unemployment , Social Security , and Medicare taxes .
Contractors are n't entitled to overtime pay and are n't protected under antidiscrimination laws .
A company may even be insulated from liability if , for instance , a delivery truck driver who is a contractor were to injure someone in an accident .
But many companies stretch the definition of a contractor a little too far .
Indeed , each of the workers described in our quiz was labeled as a contractor by the company he or she worked for .
But in the first two examples , courts ruled that the contractor in question was actually an employee .
In the third case , the marketing firm voluntarily reclassified its part timer as an employee after concluding she had been labeled incorrectly .
It can be difficult to determine who is a contractor and who is n't .
But making the wrong call is riskier than ever .
At least eight states , including New York , New Jersey , Florida , and Kansas , have cracked down on companies that misclassify their employees .
Some have deployed task forces to conduct random audits , especially in industries in which misclassification is common -- construction , for example .
New York launched a task force in September 2007 to focus on the issue .
Within three months , the task force identified more than 100 employers it suspected were misclassifying employees , and it assessed more than $ 1.4 million in unpaid taxes and penalties .
Because of a safe harbor provision in the tax code , the IRS forgives many employers that label their employees incorrectly .
But when workers sue over labor issues -- discrimination , for example , or wrongful termination -- companies sometimes find that the contractor designation , which they thought would protect them from liability , does n't hold up in court .
And several government agencies besides the IRS , including state tax departments and even state insurance commissions , can dock employers for getting a worker 's classification wrong .
Even worse , those agencies do n't all have the same definition of a contractor .
" Someone could be classified as an employee under one law and a contractor under another , " says Lawrence McGoldrick , a labor attorney with the Atlanta office of law firm Fisher & Phillips .
That 's exactly what happened to Vector Marketing , an Olean , New York , company that sells Cutco cutlery in the U.S. and Canada .
Vector hires college students as salespeople .
After graduating , some of these students go on to become full - time district managers , responsible for renting their own offices and recruiting their own staff .
The IRS , in two separate audits , ruled that the district managers were independent contractors .
New Hampshire 's state tax department disagreed , however , and demanded that several years of back taxes be paid .
Vector contested the decision , but the state Supreme Court upheld it in March , saying the district managers would have had to work for multiple employers in order to be classified as contractors .
Vector has now paid the taxes , which amounted to " several thousand dollars , " according to the company 's president , John Whelpley .
How can you tell whether someone can be classified as a contractor ?
Start by reading the IRS guidelines , which cover much of the same ground as many state labor laws .
( You can find the IRS publication on the topic at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15a.pdf.)
Contractors are supposed to be business owners with a certain degree of independence , so many of the guidelines revolve around one issue -- control .
" Who controls the assignment of work -- where it 's done , when it 's done ? " asks Joseph Ritok , a partner in the labor and employment group in the Detroit office of law firm Dykema Gossett .
Contractors generally decide whom to hire and what equipment to use .
A carpenter building a roof , for example , is probably a contractor .
But that could change if someone else supplies the tools and tells the carpenter whom to hire .
If you commission someone to complete a project -- say , hiring a designer to create a brochure -- then the contractor label is probably fine .
But if you hire the designer to come in two days a week for an indefinite period , he or she probably will become an employee .
Where the work is done is not a litmus test , however .
Even if your software developer works from home , he or she could be an employee .
Contractors usually are free to seek out other business opportunities .
And they generally have only short - term assignments ; those working for you indefinitely are probably employees .
Courts are often inclined to find that low - wage workers are employees , even if they have some control .
Late last year , the California State Compensation Insurance Fund , which provides workers ' compensation coverage in the state , ordered Palmdale newspaper publisher Antelope Valley Press to buy insurance for its newspaper carriers .
The company appealed , arguing that the deliverers were contractors .
Indeed , the carriers were responsible for their own vehicles and were paid a negotiable rate for each paper delivered .
But a judge decided the carriers were employees under workers ' compensation law .
He noted that there was " an extreme disparity in bargaining position " between the workers and Antelope Valley Press .
The company has appealed to California 's Supreme Court and would not comment for this article .
While most multitouch displays designed to produce sound use a visual mode of interaction , the multitouch interactive Akustisch produces music with not much visual feedback .
A new multitouch interface for production , control and manipulation of digital sound , the Akustisch is like a digital music instrument based on a touch interface .
Developed by Balz Rittmeyer as a bachelor degree project at the University of Art and Design Zurich , the Akustisch hints to the future of musical instruments .
Morphed as a modular synthesizer sans a graphical user interface , the Akustisch is a concept that uses complex hand gestures on a multitouch surface to control and create music .
Allowing all 10 figures to be used for sound manipulation , the multitouch interface interpreting the movements on screen generates musical sounds defined by the particular gestures .

Meanwhile , Mr. Bauer ’s camp appears to have been orchestrating pressure for a resignation .
“ André Bauer is my client ; I ’ve been working this since Monday , ” wrote Chris LaCivita , a political consultant on Mr. Bauer ’s team , in an e-mail message to another Republican political operative that was provided to The New York Times by an opponent of Mr. Bauer .
“ I need to get this guy ( Sanford ) out , ” he wrote , referring to the governor .
But Mr. LaCivita stumbled into the mare ’s nest of South Carolina politics , apparently unaware that he was sending the message to an ally of Mr. McMaster , who has declined to call for the governor ’s resignation and said that any investigation of the governor should be free of political motivations .
“ On this , I ca n’t help you , ” the recipient , Curt Anderson , a national political consultant , responded .
“ Henry McMaster has been a friend of mine for almost 20 years . ”
Mr. LaCivita said he sent the message outside the context of the lieutenant governor ’s official duties .
“ This is me professionally seeking information and sources from people I thought I could trust , ” he said .
“ This is completely outside the realm of what the lieutenant governor is doing , which is fulfilling his constitutional duties  something his opponents should follow his example on . ”
Mr. Bauer played down the prospect of taking over for Mr. Sanford on the Fox News program “ Huckabee ” this weekend , saying , “ Nobody wants to become governor like this . ”
The fight has trickled down to the many local Republican committees at the heart of the party .
Forces loyal to Mr. Bauer have found common cause with those angry at Mr. Sanford , increasing calls for his resignation  hoping to put together a rally later this week  while those loyal to the other players have held their ground .

The Alzheimer ’s Project
The Alzheimer ’s Project is a four - part documentary series produced by HBO Documentary Films in partnership with the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health .
Also associated with the project are the Alzheimer ’s Association , Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund , and Geoffrey Beene Gives Back Alzheimer ’s Initiative .
The series started on the night of Mother ’s Day .
The four parts are :
The Memory Loss Tapes Grandpa , Do You Know Who I Am ? with Maria Shriver Momentum in Science Caregivers
There are several ways you can watch this besides the HBO channel on TV .
You can see the series at http://budurl.com/3j9k.
You can even buy the book at http://budurl.com/8r68.

The figures on Alzheimer ’s are staggering .
The Alzheimer ’s Association reports the following :
As many as 5.3 million people in the United States are living with Alzheimer’s .
in the United States are living with Alzheimer ’s .
Alzheimer ’s and dementia triple healthcare costs for Americans age 65 and older .
for Americans age 65 and older .
Every 70 seconds , someone develops Alzheimer’s .
someone develops Alzheimer’s .
Alzheimer ’s is the sixth - leading cause of death .
.
The direct and indirect costs of Alzheimer ’s and other dementias to Medicare , Medicaid and businesses amount to more than $ 148 billion each year .
One person featured on part one of The Alzheimer ’s Project writes a blog that gives you a real insight into the frustration an Alzheimer ’s patient faces .
http://living-with-alzhiemers.blogspot.com/
I have a personal interest in this — my dad had Alzheimer ’s .
I was not his personal caretaker , my mom and my sister were .
I went to Hawaii to help my mom take care of him when my sister went on a well - deserved vacation .
In his final two summers , I recall the first summer when he was so happy to see me , but he could n’t figure out how I ’d gotten there .
The final summer the smiles were no longer there , and if not living in a state of confusion , he slept a lot .
So my wonderful Mother ’s Day ended on a bittersweet note watching The Memory Loss Tapes .
I empathize with the many families that are caretakers to their loved ones .
My family , especially my mom and my sister , were there , too .
In future posts we will look at what we can do pro-actively to possibly prevent or slow down the onset of Alzheimer ’s .
Many of us are afraid of the devastating toll on the patient and their families .
Let ’s do something about it .
I invite you to comment on The Alzheimer ’s Project .

YOU automatically lose an argument if you call the other person a Nazi , states an adage coined by Mike Godwin , a writer about the internet , in 1990 .
With that in mind , it is wise to proceed with caution when discussing analogies between the Holocaust and anything else .
Yet as Russia 's draft law on criminalising challenges to the Stalinist version of history comes closer to reality , it is worth looking at the successes and failures of other attempts to make certain views of history illegal .
Germany , Austria and more than a dozen other European countries have laws that more or less ban “ denial ” of the Holocaust .
Sometimes these are part of general prohibitions of Nazi activity .
Sometimes they are more generally framed as anti-hatred laws .
AFP
The proud sorrow of victory
How far that is justifiable in theory is debatable .
Every country curbs free speech to some extent ( look at American companies ' use of corporate libel laws , for example ) .
Whether one particular set of sensitivities deserves more protection than another is a matter for public debate : if voters mind enough one way or another , the politicians will pass or repeal the laws concerned .
From that point of view , it is hard to quibble with Russia 's desire to protect and sanctify the memory of its millions of soldiers who fell in the fight against Nazism .
As the western wartime allies wallow in nostalgia , it is worth remembering that more than ten times as many “ Soviet ” ( admittedly a loose term ) soldiers died in combat than British and American troops combined .
But it is also worth noting that Holocaust - denial laws have done little to restrict the pernicious myths peddled by those who think the Jews were the victors , not the victims , in the second world war .
In fact , a bit of legal persecution is just what those advocating fringe history most want .
They can argue that the authorities are trying to suppress the “ truth ” because they have no other answer to it .
What is in reality little more than a bunch of quibbles , anomalies , loose ends and historical puzzles becomes a grand scheme of events , and thus more potent in attracting the gullible or prejudiced .
The best antidote to Holocaust denial is truth , such as the excellent nizkor.org , which provides a painstaking refutation of the mythmongers ' cases , backed up with meticulous documentation .
( An enterprising group of researchers ought to provide a similar dossier to rebut the equally absurd claims of the 9/11 conspiracy theorists ) .
Of course , questioning the Stalinist version of history is not directly comparable to Holocaust denial .
If anything , the label should be on the other side .
When a Russian defence - ministry website can argue straightfacedly that it was Poland that started the second world war , it is hard to accept that the authorities in Moscow are really interested in nailing falsehoods , rather than — as they seem to be — promoting them .
But Poland has not responded by banning the import of modern Russian textbooks , or passing a law making the denial of the Katyn massacre ( which Stalin ordered and then blamed on the Nazis ) into a criminal offence .
Banning a particular version of history is usually a sign of a guilty conscience .
In the case of continental Europe , it is to make amends for collaboration and perpetration during the darkest years of the last century .
In Russia 's case , what should be a source of proud sorrow — the heroism of those who fought and defeated Hitler — is being used to cover up Stalin 's behaviour : both his bungling of the Soviet defences against Hitler 's attack , and before that conspiring with the Nazis to carve up the Baltics , Balkans and central Europe .
flac + itunes
Would you like iTunes to support FLAC ?
So would we !
Due to the design of iTunes , only Apple can add support for FLAC [ 1 ] .
And why would n't they ?
FLAC usage is accelerating , many bands like Pearl Jam , The Beatles , Phish , Dave Matthews Band , Metallica -- the same hip , influential people whose fans Apple courts -- are already distributing music in FLAC format , and users are clamoring for it in the iTunes forums .
Make your voice heard !
Fill out the iTunes feedback form ( politely ! ) and let them know .
Feel free to also direct them to this page .
We at the FLAC project stand ready to help as well .

XiphQT , through tremendous effort by developers , goes as far as possible in allowing some playback capability via QuickTime .
But proper iTunes support -- tag handling , no import delays , etc. -- is not possible without Apple .
Jimmy T. Murakami ’s sci-fi retake on The Seven Samurai / The Magnificent Seven was produced by Roger Corman and Aliens ‘ Gale Ann Hurd , amongst others , and featured emerging 80s sex symbol Sybil Danning as the improbably named ‘ St. Exmin ’ , a roving warrior prone to thrills , suicidal missions and dares .
St. Exmin is featured in two costumes in BBtS ; the strip - ribbed second outfit caused the actress some difficulty in taking a rest break , as she had to be sewn into it at the start of shooting , but it ’s the Nordic fantasy ( pictured above ) we first see St. Exmin wearing that is perhaps the more memorable of the two .
“ I had to be very careful with it , ” Danning told a magazine in the 1980s .
“ The Valkyrie outfit had breast - plates which were supposed to look like metal fingers holding the breasts . ”
These supporting structures were actually made of Styrofoam , and threatened to raise the PG rating of the film several times .
“ What was happening , ” Danning recalled .
“ was that my nipples were coming through the breast piece ! [ the cinematographer ] had the wardrobe girl take me out and she asked if we could do a glue job there because that was the only way to cover the nipples while I was moving .
Once I was glued in , it was no problem .
NBC ran it on TV and they rotoscoped another outfit I wore into battle .
It was called ‘ The Dart ’ because it had little oval darts cut out of the spandex all over it …it was apparently too revealing of my breasts for TV , so they rotoscoped it out . ” .
47 : Femi Taylor – Return Of The Jedi ( 1983 ) Costume designers : Aggie Guerard Rodgers / Nilo Rodis - Jamero .
After Carrie Fisher ’s ‘ Slave Leia ’ costume ( see part 2 ) , slave dancer Oola ’s get - up in Richard Marquand ’s Star Wars entry is arguably the most iconic and copied , and certainly the sexiest .
Oola is of the Twi’lek race , schooled in dance on the planet Ryloth , and the popular and distinctive anatomy design on the head ( the appendages are called ‘ Lekku ’ ) returned again for the all - too - brief appearances of Amy Allen as Aayla Secura , one of the betrayed Jedi in Star Wars Episode III : Revenge of the Sith ( 2005 ) .
When Femi Taylor was asked to shoot additional scenes for the dance in Jabba ’s palace for the special edition of Jedi 14 years later , she was so remarkably unchanged as to be able to not only extend the dance sequence but do some close - up inserts for the sequence where she is confronted with the Rancor .
The wide - holed net costume is barely held together by narrow leather strips , and several ‘ slips ’ occur in Jedi .
Is it a coincidence that the sexiest ever episode of the Star Wars saga coincides with the year George Lucas divorced his first wife ?
He certainly does seem to be under no kind of domestic constriction in this film …

( PhysOrg.com ) --
" In 1981 , a 37 - year - old factory worker named Kenji Urada entered a restricted safety zone at a Kawasaki manufacturing plant to perform some maintenance on a robot .
In his haste , he failed to completely turn it off .
The robot ’s powerful hydraulic arm pushed the engineer into some adjacent machinery , thus making Urada the first recorded victim to die at the hands of a robot . "
In situations like this one , as described in a recent study published in the International Journal of Social Robotics , most people would not consider the accident to be the fault of the robot .
But as robots are beginning to spread from industrial environments to the real world , human safety in the presence of robots has become an important social and technological issue .
Currently , countries like Japan and South Korea are preparing for the “ human - robot coexistence society , ” which is predicted to emerge before 2030 ; South Korea predicts that every home in its country will include a robot by 2020 .
Unlike industrial robots that toil in structured settings performing repetitive tasks , these “ Next Generation Robots ” will have relative autonomy , working in ambiguous human - centered environments , such as nursing homes and offices .
Before hordes of these robots hit the ground running , regulators are trying to figure out how to address the safety and legal issues that are expected to occur when an entity that is definitely not human but more than machine begins to infiltrate our everyday lives .
In their study , authors Yueh - Hsuan Weng , a former staff of Taiwan ’s Conscription Agency , Ministry of the Interior , and currently visiting at Yoshida , Kyoto , Japan , along with Chien - Hsun Chen and Chuen - Tsai Sun , both of the National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu , Taiwan , have proposed a framework for a legal system focused on Next Generation Robot safety issues .
Their goal is to help ensure safer robot design through “ safety intelligence ” and provide a method for dealing with accidents when they do inevitably occur .
The authors have also analyzed Isaac Asimov ’s Three Laws of Robotics , but ( like most robotics specialists today ) they doubt that the laws could provide an adequate foundation for ensuring that robots perform their work safely .
One guiding principle of the proposed framework is categorizing robots as “ third existence ” entities , since Next Generation Robots are considered to be neither living / biological ( first existence ) or non-living / non - biological ( second existence ) .
A third existence entity will resemble living things in appearance and behavior , but will not be self - aware .
While robots are currently legally classified as second existence ( human property ) , the authors believe that a third existence classification would simplify dealing with accidents in terms of responsibility distribution .
One important challenge involved in integrating robots into human society deals with “ open texture risk ” - risk occurring from unpredictable interactions in unstructured environments .
An example of open texture risk is getting robots to understand the nuances of natural ( human ) language .
While every word in natural language has a core definition , the open texture character of language allows for interpretations that vary due to outside factors .
As part of their safety intelligence concept , the authors have proposed a “ legal machine language , ” in which ethics are embedded into robots through code , which is designed to resolve issues associated with open texture risk - something which Asimov ’s Three Laws cannot specifically address .
“ During the past 2,000 years of legal history , we humans have used human legal language to communicate in legal affairs , ” Weng told PhysOrg.com .
“ The rules and codes are made by natural language ( for example , English , Chinese , Japanese , French , etc. ) .
When Asimov invented the notion of the Three Laws of Robotics , it was easy for him to apply the human legal language into his sci - fi plots directly . ”
As Chen added , Asimov ’s Three Laws were originally made for literary purposes , but the ambiguity in the laws makes the responsibilities of robots ’ developers , robots ’ owners , and governments unclear .
“ The legal machine language framework stands on legal and engineering perspectives of safety issues , which we face in the near future , by combining two basic ideas : ‘ Code is Law ’ and ‘ Embedded Ethics , ’ ” Chen said .
“ In this framework , the safety issues are not only based on the autonomous intelligence of robots as it is in Asimov ’s Three Laws .
Rather , the safety issues are divided into different levels with individual properties and approaches , such as the embedded safety intelligence of robots , the manners of operation between robots and humans , and the legal regulations to control the usage and the code of robots .
Therefore , the safety issues of robots could be solved step by step in this framework in the future . ”
Weng also noted that , by preventing robots from understanding human language , legal machine language could help maintain a distance between humans and robots in general .
“ If robots could interpret human legal language exactly someday , should we consider giving them a legal status and rights ? ” he said .
“ Should the human legal system change into a human - robot legal system ?
There might be a robot lawyer , robot judge working with a human lawyer , or a human judge to deal with the lawsuits happening inter - human - robot .
Robots might learn the kindness of humans , but they also might learn deceit , hypocrisy , and greed from humans .
There are too many problems waiting for us ; therefore we must consider if it is a better to let the robots keep a distance from the human legal system and not be too close to humans . ”
In addition to using machine language to keep a distance between humans and robots , the researchers also consider limiting the abilities of robots in general .
Another part of the authors ’ proposal concerns “ human - based intelligence robots , ” which are robots with higher cognitive abilities that allow for abstract thought and for new ways of looking at one ’s environment .
However , since a universally accepted definition of human intelligence does not yet exist , there is little agreement on a definition for human - based intelligence .
Nevertheless , most robotics researchers predict that human - based intelligence will inevitably become a reality following breakthroughs in computational artificial intelligence ( in which robots learn and adapt to their environments in the absence of explicitly programmed rules ) .
However , a growing number of researchers - as well as the authors of the current study - are leaning toward prohibiting human - based intelligence due to the potential problems and lack of need ; after all , the original goal of robotics was to invent useful tools for human use , not to design pseudo - humans .
In their study , the authors also highlight previous attempts to prepare for a human - robot coexistence society .
For example , the European Robotics Research Network ( EURON ) is a private organization whose activities include investigating robot ethics , such as with its Roboethics Roadmap .
The South Korean government has developed a Robot Ethics Charter , which serves as the world ’s first official set of ethical guidelines for robots , including protecting them from human abuse .
Similarly , the Japanese government investigates safety issues with its Robot Policy Committee .
In 2003 , Japan also established the Robot Development Empiricism Area , a “ robot city ” designed to allow researchers to test how robots act in realistic environments .
Despite these investigations into robot safety , regulators still face many challenges , both technical and social .
For instance , on the technical side , should robots be programmed with safety rules , or should they be created with the ability for safety - oriented reasoning ?
Should robot ethics be based on human - centered value systems , or a combination of human - centered value systems with the robot ’s own value system ?
Or , legally , when a robot accident does occur , how should the responsibility be divided ( for example , among the designer , manufacturer , user , or even the robot itself ) ?
Weng also indicated that , as robots become more integrated into human society , the importance of a legal framework for social robotics will become more obvious .
He predicted that determining how to maintain a balance between human - robot interaction ( robot technology development ) and social system design ( a legal regulation framework ) will present the biggest challenges in safety when the human - robot coexistence society emerges .

The Justice Department began an investigation Friday into the shooting death of the Kansas doctor who provided late - term abortions and will seek to determine if more than one person was involved in the crime , department officials said .
The federal investigation into the killing of the doctor , George R. Tiller , who was shot on Sunday in the foyer of his church in Wichita , will also include a review of evidence and an assessment of possible violations of the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
Act , the department said .
After vandalism at the Wichita clinic in May , one of Dr. Tiller ’s lawyers sent a letter to federal authorities requesting an investigation for potential violations of the freedom - of - access act .
“ The Department of Justice will work tirelessly to determine the full involvement of any and all actors in this horrible crime , ” Loretta King , the acting assistant attorney general for the civil rights division , said in a written statement .
MEXICO CITY , Mexico ( CNN ) -- Coordinated attacks in at least eight Mexican cities killed three federal police officers and two soldiers Saturday in what officials are calling an unprecedented onslaught by drug gangs .
Attacks occurred after arrest of Arnoldo Rueda Medina , a high - ranking member of La Familia Michoacana .
Another 18 federal officers were wounded , the state - run Notimex news agency reported , citing federal police official Rodolfo Cruz Lopez .
The attacks were in retribution for the capture early Saturday of Arnoldo Rueda Medina , a high - ranking member of the drug cartel known as La Familia Michoacana ( The Michoacan Family ) , Notimex reported .
Rueda is considered second in command to the group 's two top leaders , Nazario " El Chayo " Moreno González and José " El Chango " de Jesús Méndez Vargas , acting as a " right arm " to Moreno , the secretary of public security said Saturday in a statement .
Among other allegations , he was arrested for his role in designing the hierarchy of the organization , the production of synthetic drugs and movement of marijuana and cocaine to the United States , said Mexico 's secretary of public security .
Rueda was arrested along with a 17 - year - old male who worked for him .
Following his arrest Saturday morning in Morelia , Michoacan , men armed with high - powered rifles and grenades attacked the police station where he was being held , the Secretary of Public Security said .
After failing to win his freedom , members of the group launched attacks in the cities of Morelia , Zitacuaro , Zamora , Lazaro Cardenas , Apatzingan , La Piedad and Huetamo in Michoacan state , Notimex news said , citing federal police .
The three officers were killed in Zitacuaro , police official Eduardo Moran told CNN en Español , while six police officers were reported wounded in Morelia .
Two soldiers were killed in Zamora , shot by men in a passing car as they walked to their headquarters .
The Secretary of Public Security told the newspaper Cambio de Michoacan that 25 spent shells from an R - 15 rifle and 17 from an AK - 47 were found at the scene .
Michoacan is in west - central Mexico , on the Pacific coast .
Another rifle and grenade attack took place near Acapulco in Guerrero state , which borders Michoacan , but no one was injured .
Saturday 's attacks came just days after a drug gang in Tijuana declared they were at war with police , threatening to kill five officers every week until Police Chief Julian Leyzaola resigns .
The threat was made in a note found on the windshield of a slain officer 's car , news reports said .
At least three Tijuana officers have been killed since Monday , reports said .
Leyzaola , a former army colonel , replaced a police chief removed from office in December after receiving numerous threats .
" Leyzaola has become the poster boy for honest police work , which has put the drug gangs on notice , " Vicente Calderon , a reporter for the Tijuana Press news agency , told CNN affiliate KUSI .
" They believe he is serious , that he means business and is trying to re-establish the rule of law that has been affecting the city and whole state for many years since organized crime established themselves in Baja [ California ] . "
Tijuana , the westernmost city in Mexico , is across the border from San Diego , California .
Sixteen police officers have died there in 2009 , and officers are now patrolling the city in groups of six , KUSI reported .
CNN 's Emanuella Grinberg and Monica Trevino contributed to this report .

T- Mobile announced the company 's second Android phone , the MyTouch 3G , on Monday , based on the HTC Magic platform .
Based on the Google Ion/ HTC Magic platform , the MyTouch 3G is a touch - screen , slab - style smart phone with improved multimedia features , Microsoft Exchange support , and some applications that will be exclusive to T - Mobile .
" This is our next Android phone .
It continues our leadership with Android and the partnership that we 've established with Google , " T - Mobile CTO Cole Brodman said .
The MyTouch 3G will come in black , white and red .
It has no physical keyboard , relying instead on the Android 1.5 OS 's virtual keyboard for entering data .
It features a 3.2 " , 320x480 touch screen , 3.2 - megapixal camera , MicroSD memory card slot , and built - in video recording and playback capabilities .
The phone connects to the Internet via T - Mobile 's 2G and 3G networks , foreign 2G or 3G networks or Wi-Fi.
T- Mobile 's pitch for the MyTouch 3G centers around the phone 's customizability , focusing on features like the phone 's wide range of available home screen widgets .
While the phone will have access to the 5,000 applications in the current Android Market app store , Brodman said T - Mobile will offer some exclusive apps as well .
One of them is Sherpa , a local search and recommendation engine that improves its recommendations based on a user 's past history of requests .
T- Mobile 's close relationship with Google also let them put Microsoft Exchange support into the phone while keeping the " with Google " moniker that signifies full Google approval of the device , Brodman said .
The Google Android OS was supposed to appear on a wide range of phones , but so far only one has appeared in the US , the T - Mobile G1 .
Brodman said that T - Mobile will have " multiple Android devices shipping in the second half [ of this year ] . "
The MyTouch 3G wo n't kick the G1 out of T - Mobile 's product line , either .
The two phones will coexist , Brodman said .
Sprint and Verizon have also shown interest in launching Android phones , and AT&T has spoken about releasing highly customized Android phones in the future .
The MyTouch will also be sold with an unusual 2 - year extended warranty , which will be available at T - Mobile stores for what Brodman said is a " nominal " additional fee .
He did n't give exact details , but he made it sound more affordable than the usual phone insurance .
The gadget will also come with a protective case , travel charger , and headphone adapter to let owners use standard 3.5 - mm headphones with the device , Brodman said .
The built - in 4GB MicroSD card will come with six songs from Sony Music on board .
The MyTouch 3G can be pre-ordered by existing T - Mobile customers starting July 8th for $ 199.99 .
Shipments will go out to pre-ordering customers on July 29th , and other folks will be able to get the phone in early August .
If you 're curious about the MyTouch 3G , check out our hands - on with the generic version of the phone , known as the Google Ion .

There 's an easy way to find oil .
Go to some remote and gorgeous natural sanctuary , say Alaska or the Amazon , find some Indians , then drill down under them .
If the indigenous folk complain , well , just shoo - them away .
Shoo-ing methods include : bulldozers , bullets , crooked politicians and fake land sales .
But be aware .
Lately the Natives are shoo-ing back .
Last week , indigenous Peruvians seized an oil pumping station , grabbed the nine policemen guarding it and , say reports , executed them .
This followed the government 's murder of more than a dozen rainforest residents who had protested the seizure of their property for oil drilling .
Again and again I see it in my line of work of investigating fraud .
Here are a few pit -stops on the oily trail of tears :
In the 1980s , Charles Koch was found to have pilfered about $ 3 worth of crude from Stanlee Ann Mattingly 's oil tank in Oklahoma .
Here 's the weird part .
Koch was ( and remains ) the 14th richest man on the planet , worth about $ 14 billion .
Stanlee Ann was a dirt - poor Osage Indian .
Stanlee Ann was n't Koch 's only victim .
According to secret tape recordings of a former top executive of his company , Koch Industries , the billionaire demanded that oil tanker drivers secretly siphon a few bucks worth of oil from every tank attached to a stripper well on the Osage Reservation
where Koch had a contract to retrieve crude .
Koch , according to the tape , would , “ giggle ” with joy over the records of the theft .
Koch 's own younger brother Bill ratted him out , complaining that , in effect , brothers Charles and David cheated him out of his fair share of the looting which totaled over three - quarters of a billion dollars from the Native lands .
The FBI filmed the siphoning with hidden cameras , but criminal charges were quashed after quiet objections from Republican senators .
Then there are the Chugach Natives of Alaska .
The Port of Valdez , Alaska , is arguably one of the most valuable pieces of real estate on Earth , the only earthquake - safe ice - free port in Alaska that could load oil from the giant North Slope field .
In 1969 , Exxon and British Petroleum companies took the land from the Chugach and paid them one dollar .
I kid you not .
Wally Hickel , the former Governor of Alaska , dismissed my suggestion that the Chugach deserved a bit more respect ( and cash ) for their property .
“ Land ownership comes in two ways , Mr. Palast . ” explained the governor and pipeline magnate , “ Purchase or conquest .
The fact that your granddaddy chased a caribou across the land does n't make it yours . ”
The Chugach had lived there for 3,000 years .
No oil company would dream of digging on the Bush family properties in Midland , Texas , without paying a royalty .
Or drilling near Malibu without the latest in environmental protections .
But when Natives are on top of Exxon 's or BP 's glory hole , suddenly , the great defenders of private property rights turn quite Bolshevik : lands can be seized for The Public 's Need for Oil .
Some Natives are “ re-located ” through legal flim - flam , some at gunpoint .
The less lucky are left to wallow , literally , in the gunk left by the drilling process .
Take a look at this photo here , taken in the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador .
It 's from an investigation that I conducted for BBC TV , now in the film “ Palast Investigates . ”
I 'm holding up a stinking , black glop of crude oil residue pulled from an abandoned Chevron - Texaco waste pit .
A pipe runs from the toxic pit right into the water supply of Cofan Indians .
Chief Emergildo Criollo told me how oil company executives helicoptered into his remote village and , speaking in Spanish – which the Cofan did n't understand – “ purchased ” drilling rights with trinkets and cheese .
The Natives had never seen cheese .
( “ The cheese smelled funny , so we threw it in the jungle . ” )
After drilling began , Criollo 's son went swimming in his usual watering hole , came up vomiting blood , and died .
I asked Chevron about the wave of poisonings and deaths .
According to an independent report , 1,401 deaths , mostly of children , mostly from cancers , can be traced to Chevron 's toxic dumping .
Chevron 's lawyer told me , “ And it 's the only case of cancer in the world ?
How many cases of children with cancer do you have in the States ? …
They have to prove that it is our crude , ” which , he noted with glee , “ is absolutely impossible . ”
Big Oil treats indigenous blood like a cheap gasoline additive .
That 's why the Peruvians are up in arms .
The Cofan of Ecuador , more sophisticated , and less violent , than their brothers in Peru , have taken no hostages .
Rather , they have heavily armed themselves with lawyers .
But Chevron and its Big Oil brethren remain dismissive of the law .
This week , Shell Oil , to get rid of a nasty PR problem paid $ 15 million to the Ogoni people and the family of Ken Saro - Wiwa for the oil giant 's alleged role in the killing of Wiwa and his associates , activists who had defended these Niger Delta people against drilling contamination .
Shell pocketed $ 31 billion last year in profits and hopes the payoff will clear the way for a drilling partnership with Nigeria 's government .
Congratulations , Shell .
$ 15 million :
For a license to kill and drill , that 's quite a bargain .

This was our little cottontail bunny Tumbles the night we found him .
His mother had just kicked him out of the nest , presumably because she had too many mouths to feed and he was just too weak .
We discovered him on the street squirming and writhing on his back .
We initially thought that we were just taking him in to give him a warm and comfortable place to pass away , as he was in such distress .
But , from the moment I picked him up and held him to my heart , he showed a fierce desire to survive .
He made it through the first few nights just fine , but we began to notice that he could not move his neck , and he could not stand up or balance himself at all .
Turns out he had Torticollis , or ‘ Head Tilt ’ , likely caused by trauma .
This was pretty scary , because he never blinked his one eye , and we worried it might get damaged as well .
This is what ‘ head tilt looks like in a bun :
So we were initially worried , but as the days went on , our little guy kept getting better , even though he would only be able to hop a step or two before falling down — - hence the name ‘ Tumbles ’ !
But we figured if he ’s happy , that ’s all that matters .
I began massaging Tumbles ’ little neck every morning , just to try to alleviate any pain he might have , and he seemed to love it .
As the next week went by , he started running around the room like mad , playing with the dog , and having a great time .
But the funny thing was , when he tried to run in a straight line , he would always make a circle .
Poor little guy .
But then the miracle began to happen .
After every morning massage over the next few weeks , his head seemed to get a little straighter .
Until , finally one day , our bun was normal !
Extremely tiny , but normal .
He is now almost 8 months old and doing great .
Here ’s the boy in repose :
What a great bun !
And they said he could n’t survive in captivity …
Ha !
Hey , you bitee my buttz !
Although he does have a penchant for poor Emmylou ’s bottom !
As the Consumer Electronics Show kicked off Wednesday , Sony sent out a press release that attempted to set the tone of the console debate .
Apparently this year 's tone will be " crazy ex-girlfriend . "
With PlayStation 3 being the only one of the three consoles to see its sales drop this November versus the same month in 2007 , and a $ 200 entry - level Xbox 360 attracting price - conscious shoppers , Sony is gearing up to take a beating in December , January , and beyond .
So out comes the spin .
First , a Sony exec tells CNET that PlayStation 3 sales were up 130 % following Black Friday , which is somehow supposed to be a sign of health even though sales of every product on Earth jump after Black Friday .
And then , this letter :
Keeping Gaming and Entertainment Simple
The 2008 holiday season was an exciting time for video gaming and the Blu-ray side of the interactive entertainment industry , and 2009 promises to follow suit .
As consumers continue to invest in their entertainment needs this new year , the feature sets of the three multi-functional gaming systems – PLAYSTATION 3 , Xbox 360 and Wii – become that much more important to consider .
PLAYSTATION 3 has always been about streamlining the gaming and entertainment experience by giving consumers the most features and functionality out of the box , there is no immediate need to upgrade anything to get a rich entertainment experience , as the console comes standard with : Built in Blu-ray drive for HD movies and mind - blowing games
Built in Wi-Fi for wireless gaming and Internet access
Huge hard drives for storing games , movies , music photos and more
Free online gaming and entertainment access through PSN
Ten year 's of value with a future - proof system via firmware updates that offer new services and features The Xbox 360 and Wii offer a set of features in their own right .
However , when you take a look at the feature offerings side by side , there is only one true winner in delivering total value and price .
We 've compared the lowest entry points from each manufacturer – PS3 80 GB - $ 399 , Xbox 360 Arcade - $ 199 , Wii - $ 249 .
The PS3 is the perfect example of a product featuring superior technology and a sophisticated design creating an ideal all - in - one entertainment product .
The Xbox 360 requires additional money , multiple upgrades and additional external devices , putting a burden on the wallet and adds clutter to the entertainment center .
And the Wii's lack of enhanced features comes at the expense of a comprehensive entertainment solution .
So as PS3 continues to evolve without the need for additional parts or expenses , expect the competition to continue peddling add - ons in an effort to keep up with the Jones ' .
In other words : * what does she have that I do n't ?!*
What is immediately obvious here – besides the fact that the writer of this release has a deeply ingrained misunderstanding of the possessive form ( year 's , Jones ' ) – is a feeling like Sony has finally been reduced to grasping at straws .
We need n't even delve too deeply into the half - truths ( there are cheaper hard drive solutions for Arcade buyers ; HDMI was available in every Xbox on shelves this holiday ) .
But is this really the whole message ?
Yes – you get more machine for your $ 400 with PlayStation 3 .
But since when has anything but price and killer app games ever decided a console war ?
This holiday season and its aftermath may very well prove that Microsoft was right after all to take the hard drive out of the Xbox 360 and put a bare - bones SKU on shelves .
Yes : I thought it was a phenomenally stupid idea at the time .
Remember " tard pack , " the perjorative nickname for the Core SKU that ended up making the New York Post ?
A $ 200 game console does n't sound so retarded in a recession .

Contraceptives for men may become available in pharmacies in the near future .
Such news was released by Chinese researchers .
The scientists offer men to take monthly injections of synthetic hormone in order to prevent pregnancy .
The hormone is called testosterone undecanoate ; earlier it was used for the treatment of male infertility .
Paradox ?
Absolutely not !
This hormone improves the quality of sperm when injected in small quantities , while in large dosage it inhibits sperm production .
The scientists also added that the effectiveness of the drug depends on ethnicity , since , for instance , it has stronger effect on Asians than on Europeans .
Extensive study , which involved 1045 volunteers , lasted for two and a half years .
Only 9 pregnancies were recorded .
The scientists believe that this is a very high rate of effectiveness .
Condoms , for example , have the same rate ( 99 % ) .
So , why not using the new birth control method ?
However , some incidents occurred as well .
Two participants lost their fertility , as they could not regain ability to produce sperm after the experiment was over .
Thus , here is the problem with male contraception – there is a high probability of losing fertility , as the drug acts on the entire system of sperm production .
Birth control pills for women , on the other hand , act only on one ovary and do no harm to the rest of the eggs .

Allow us , LBers , if you will , to circle back to a case to which we gave rather short shrift last week : the one involving the 32 year - old Minnesota woman , Jammie Thomas - Rasset , who was ordered by a jury last Thursday to cough up $ 1.92 million as a penalty for downloading 24 songs .

When you ’re a world - class director like Michael Bay , attempting the impossible by trying to make a sequel that will satisfy the discerning fans of a Shia LaBeouf–starring actioner inspired by an eighties toy franchise , it ’s imperative that your entire team perform at its maximum potential .
The special - effects crew needs to be at their most explody , and Megan Fox can be nothing less than her absolute chestiest .
Also , marketers must spare no expense to convince audiences that your movie will completely scorch their faces off — and if they do n’t , there ’s a problem .
Over the weekend , TMZ obtained a grammatically horrifying e-mail from Bay to Paramount brass , complaining that the studio ’s promotional push for Transformers Revenge of the Fallen did not meet with his high standards .
On the evening of May 4 , an incensed Bay sat down at what we assume was a powerful supercomputer and dashed off a quick note that makes Quentin Tarantino ’s misspelled Inglourious Basterds script look like the AP Stylebook .
You can read the entire thing ( subject line : Urgent NOTE FROM BAY ) here , but below are the best parts :
• “ I ’m sure the Yahoo downloads of the trailer are far lower than last movie — I would of got something saying how we broke download records like last time . ”
• “ I still run into so many people even this weekend with kids that ask ‘ is that movie coming out this year ? ’ ”
• “ So far our print has been in my opinion and abject failure . ”
• “ Over the years Jerry Bruckheimer mentored me on event movies — he had a mantra — ‘ A studio that does not make it an event , will it into an event , thinks the audience will just show up , will always be bitten in the ass . ’ ”
• “ At this time last movie we had an 30 minute MTV event around the Video Awards , now we have our two leads just announcing an award — they want me to play a small clip .
I consider this so lame .
Clips do n’t blow people away ! ”
• “ On the foreign front , from the terrible amateur cut down trailer I received which had a 23 frame flash cut of Megatron , if someone would of given me just one call , I could of told them the whole point of the trailer was the reintroducton of Megatron . ”
• “ I can not figure if this is a cash issue with your company ?
Is there some clever idea why are we not spending ?
I ’m not sure . ”
On June 6 , Bay sent Paramount another note ( also leaked to TMZ ) thanking Paramount executives for “ busting your butts and bringing your ‘ A game , ’ ” which we guess means they were miraculously able to read his first e-mail .

A light civilian aircraft which failed to arrive at its destination in Kent had been flown to Switzerland .
The missing two - seater plane had set off from Cambridge on Wednesday morning on the 100 - mile trip to Lydd Airport , near Romney Marsh .
A search and rescue operation was launched after the plane last made contact near the mouth of the River Medway at Sheerness at about 1100 BST .
The RAF Rescue Centre in Kinloss said the pilot had turned up safe and well .
Spokesman Michael Mulford said the pilot had been told to communicate with air traffic control when he was back over dry land , but had failed to do so .
' Wild goose chase '
He said : " What he did in fact was take a left turn , to avoid what he said was an incoming weather front , and he flew all the way to Switzerland and he landed there .
" A lot of people spent a lot of time on what at the end of the day proved a wild goose chase . "
The pilot , who is believed to be a European national with a Swiss address , flew more than 400 miles off course .
He had an American licence .
A coastguard helicopter and an RAF Sea King helicopter from Wattisham Airfield , Suffolk , were scrambled on Wednesday to look for the plane , which was said to be a VariEze , fixed wing , homebuilt aircraft .
' Very apologetic ' The Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre ( ARCC ) at RAF Kinloss called off the search operation , which covered the Kent coast , the Isle of Grain and the Isle of Sheppey , after seven hours .
A " straight line " search was also carried out between Sheerness and Lydd Airport .
Mr Mulford added that the pilot was " very apologetic " .
" His interpretation of the rules is that he did not need to inform anyone . "
He said it would be down to other agencies , including the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Aviation Administration , to contemplate taking any action against the pilot .

The document restates a lot of the John McCain campaign promises -- we see the building of nuclear power plants ( p.12 -- those pesky safety barriers are pushed aside ... thank God ) and more tax cuts and capital gains cuts for the wealthy ( p.10 ) , " drill , baby drill " ( pp.12 - 13 ) and promises to cut " waste " ( for example , p.5 ) like the National Endowment for the Arts .
( Note : any plan put forth by Dems or GOPers that alleges a significant cost savings from " cutting waste " is a sad , sad joke .
I have lived 45 years and I have NEVER seen any budget balanced in any significant measure by cutting waste .
It is the equivalent of saying to your wife , " And we will just tighten our belts a little . "
Sounds good , means nothing . )
But how about these little ditties :
Seniors ( at least Warren Buffett and George Soros -- who are mentioned by name ) will pay $ 730 more per year for prescription drug coverage .
So , proposing higher medicine costs for seniors -- good political move there .
Interest rates will be kept artificially high by monitoring inflation figures and making sure those figures do n't go too high ( p.18 ) .
So we want to make sure people do n't get 4 - 5 % fixed rate mortgages , cuz we know how Americans hate that -- good , good ; rolling now !
Medicare will be turned over to the states as " laboratories " to test different plans ( p.8 ) .
Always a good idea -- seniors hate Medicare benefits and want to see it slowly " improved " by the southern governors who care so much about the weak and downtrodden that they reject money for the unemployed .
Small businesses ( unclear if this is the owner or the business itself ) will get a tax break equal to 20 % of the business income ( p.10 ) .
I am not sure exactly what this means .
But if I have a small business of 499 employees ( under 500 qualifies ) that has " income " ( I assume this means gross revenue ???? ) of $ 50,000,000 , does this mean I get a tax deduction of $ 10,000,000 ?
Can it possibly mean that ?
If so , does this mean that if I have a profit margin of less than 20 % that I will NEVER owe any taxes ?
Right ?
Are corporate tax rates going to be zero or negative ?
If " income " means " profit " then do I get to deduct 20 % of my profit ?
So every small business in America gets a 20 % tax break ?
And if I have a loss , can I take another 20 % as a loss carry forward ?
What may be most confusing about the " plan " is the promise to provide universal " access " to health care .
How ?
Well , um , not like Obama does , or like those folks in Britain who are dropping dead left and right ( p.7 ) .
I think they are suggesting the same John McCain " tax deduction " plan that everyone laughed at in October of 2008 .
I think .
So if you make $ 25,000 annually and pay $ 0 in federal income taxes , you can use that $ 25,000 to buy a $ 14,000 family insurance policy ( somehow ) and get a tax break .... on your non-existent federal taxes ..... of some unknown amount .
See !
Instant health care .
I mean ACCESS to health care .
So yeah , worth reading if for no other reason than to say " huh ? " a few more times than normal today .
More employees are ignoring data security policies and engaging in activities that could put a company at risk , according to a survey released by Ponemon Institute on Wednesday .
A large number of employees copy secure data to USB drives or turn off security settings in mobile devices like laptops , which could put a company 's data at risk , according to the survey .
The rate of noncompliant behavior was worse in this most recent survey compared to a similar survey conducted in 2007 , Ponemon Institute said in a press release .
Around 69 percent of the 967 IT professionals surveyed said they copied confidential company data to USB sticks , even though it was against the rules .
Some even lost USB sticks that store confidential corporate data , but did not report it immediately , the survey said .
The survey also took into account new technologies that could bring rogue software to computers , like social networking .
Close to 31 percent of respondents engaged in social - networking practices on the Web from work PCs .
Additionally , around 53 percent said they downloaded personal software on corporate PCs , which could increase the risk of bringing malware to the workplace .
Mobile technologies that let employees do more while on the road are contributing to the issue , said Larry Ponemon , chairman and founder of Ponemon Institute , in a blog entry .
As the use of mobile devices grows , the inability to enforce data security policies could increase the possibility of data breaches .
" I 'm seeing a confluence of conditions that appear to be contributing to this challenge to data integrity , " he said .
Some professionals surveyed blamed companies for poor training or ineffective data security policies .
Close to 57 percent said their company 's data protection policies were ineffective , and 58 percent said they were not provided with enough data - security - related training .
Yes , it 's real .
Now you 'll be able to change a tire ... virtually .
At E3 today , Microsoft finally took the wraps off the that rumored motion controller we 'd been hearing about .
Apparently the small , black device -- codenamed " Natal " -- will allow for an astoundingly wide range of actions by utilizing a group of sensors ( the box itself sits beneath your TV ) , and the accessory will be capable of juggling multiple users during a single session .
The demo Microsoft showed off included a skateboarding game ( replete with a young man " air " ollie-ing ) , and a family playing a racing game ( the dad was changing a tire , the daughter driving ) .
The add - on will offer features such as auto sign - in for players to Xbox Live ( based on complex facial recognition ) , and sports extremely detailed body tracking which will be able to follow the individual movements of separate limbs .
During the press event , the company demoed a painting app , which lets you use your entire body to handle virtual painting supplies , allowing you to do things like throw buckets of paint onto a canvas .
Another title was shown off which featured a woman interacting with a young boy on the screen -- one of the company 's creepier demos in recent memory .
Unfortunately for us , Microsoft says the device wo n't be released during 2009 .
We 're working on snagging some face time ( literally ! ) with a demo unit , so stay tuned ... E3 is off to a wild start !
Video added after the break !
Last week , David noticed a problem with the health care legislation draft from the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions committee ( HELP ) : it was missing the public option .
( That 's the draft , btw , that the CBO scored that is causing such a fuss . )
David wrote then :
This is n't definitive , but in general I think you want to see the things you want in a bill included in the chairman 's mark , not left out for later .
If you recall the way the FISA bill went down , you 'll see the importance .
Yes , you 'll have a vote later on including the language you want , but shoehorning a major shift in policy into an existing draft is always a lot harder , both politically and procedurally , than helping it survive a markup if it's in the original draft .
With FISA , the dynamics were slightly different , to be sure .
There you had two competing versions of a bill from two different committees vying for the right to become the base bill for purposes of floor consideration .
But the similarity is that once it was decided the base bill would be the one with retroactive immunity in it , the fight to replace it with the version that dropped immunity was uphill all the way .
And although including the public option wo n't face anything analogous to the 60 - vote threshold in the HELP committee , the dynamics of inserting major changes versus preserving the status quo still has some application .
We saw the FISA disaster , are we about to live through it again with health care reform and the public option ?
One of my contacts , a health care activist who 's talked to and been briefed by the committee staff sent this note this morning :
" We 're still hearing conflicting things , but there is a very real danger that the HELP committee is considering going ahead without putting a public option in the bill , making it necessary to add the public option in via amendment as opposed to protecting it from being stripped .
This would stack the deck against the public option and make it much more likely we could n't get the votes in committee to add it at all , or would have to weaken the public option to get it passed .
Bottom line , going forward without a public option in the bill is like starting the game down by 10 points . "
We 've seen the Democrats on the HELP committee basically get rolled by Republicans once already today , over the CBO score .
Do n't let them get rolled again over a public option .
It 's far less likely to emerge out of the Senate if it 's not in the HELP draft .
Baucus is already likely to fold under the unrelenting obstructionism of Grassley , so we 've got an even more uphill battle to get it in the Finance committee version .
It 's got to be in this bill , so that the House - - which is insisting that no bill will pass without a public option -- has something to work with .
Call Sen. Dodd , who is Kennedy 's standard - bearer on this one , and tell him a robust public option must be included in the draft that goes to markup : Tel : ( 202 ) 224-2823 | Fax : ( 202 ) 224-1083 .
You can also e-mail the committee : help_comments@help.senate.gov .
While you 're at it , here 's the rest of the Democrats on the committee :
Tom Harkin ( IA ) : ( 202 ) 224-3254
Barbara A. Mikulski ( MD ) : ( 202 ) 224-4654
Jeff Bingaman ( NM ) : ( 202 ) 224-5521
Patty Murray ( WA : ( 202 ) 224-2621
Jack Reed ( RI ) : ( 202 ) 224-4642
Bernard Sanders ( I ) ( VT ) : ( 202 ) 224-5141
Sherrod Brown ( OH ) : ( 202 ) 224-2315
Robert P. Casey , Jr. ( PA ) : ( 202 ) 224-6324
Kay Hagan ( NC ) : ( 202 ) 224-6342
Jeff Merkley ( OR ) : ( 202 ) 224-3753
Help the HELP committee help all of us , but making them hold the line on the public option .
While you 're at it , call the White House at ( 202 ) 456-1414 , or e-mail President Obama .
He has said :
What I am trying to do , and what a public option will help do , is put affordable health care within reach for millions of Americans .
And to help ensure that everyone can afford the cost of a health care option in our exchange , we need to provide assistance to families who need it .
That way there will be no reason at all for anyone to remain uninsured .
Does he mean it ?
Will he make it happen with Democrats in the Senate for health care that will reach millions of Americans , or would he really " rather have 70 votes in the Senate for a bill that gives him 85 percent of what he wants rather than a 100 percent satisfactory bill that passes 52 to 48 . "
Will he really trade real health care reform for " bipartisanship " ?
Call it a Breathalyzer for the hands .
Using sensors capable of detecting drugs in breath , new technology developed at University of Florida monitors health - care workers ' hand hygiene by detecting sanitizer or soap fumes given off from their hands .
By reminding workers to clean their hands to remove disease - causing organisms such as the bacteria MRSA , the system could help reduce hospital - acquired infections and save millions of dollars now spent to treat them .
The trademarked system , called HyGreen , logs , down to the second , the frequency of hand cleaning and contact with patients in a database that clinical supervisors can review immediately .
This is the first system that enables real - time monitoring of hand washing .
" This is n't big brother , this is just another tool , " said Richard J. Melker , M.D. , Ph.D. , a UF College of Medicine anesthesiology professor who developed the technology along with professors Donn Dennis , M.D. , and Nikolaus Gravenstein , M.D. , of the anesthesiology department , and Christopher Batich , Ph.D. , a materials science professor in the College of Engineering .
" A hospital worker never wants to be responsible for someone getting sick or dying from an infection acquired in the hospital . "
HyGreen is now being tested in the Neuro Intensive Care Unit at Shands at UF medical center , and will be presented at the annual meeting of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology June 6 to June 9 in Fort Lauderdale , Fla .
advertisement
Here 's how it works :
The health - care worker squirts sanitizer gel or soap into his or her hand before passing it under a wall - mounted sensor .
A wireless signal from a badge worn by the worker activates a green light on the hand - washing sensor .
When the worker enters a patient room , a monitor near the bed detects the status of the badge , and flashes green if the person has clean hands .
If the person has not washed , or too much time has passed between washing and approaching the patient , the badge will give a gentle " reminder " vibration .
" I do wash my hands more often , " said nurse Carrie McGirr , R.N. , who volunteered to help test the HyGreen system .
" It 's a fairly simple process to learn . "
Close to 2 million hospital - acquired infections occur each year and more than 250 related deaths occur each day in the United States , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
" A substantial number of those are preventable , and also one of the key modes of transmission is via the hands of health - care personnel and patients , " said Dr. Lennox Archibald , a professor of infectious diseases at the UF College of Medicine , and the Shands at UF epidemiologist leading the evaluation of HyGreen .
Six pathogens , including the ones known as MRSA and VRE , account for two - thirds of all hospital - acquired infections and are readily transmitted by hand .

Studies have shown that up to half of all hospital - acquired infections might be prevented if health - care workers washed their hands according to guidelines set forth by the CDC .
It costs at least $ 30 billion a year in additional spending to treat hospital - acquired infections .
The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services last year ruled that it would no longer reimburse hospitals for the expense of treating the infections .
Today , more than 160 years after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweiss was ridiculed for suggesting that hand washing by doctors who moved directly from working with cadavers to delivering babies could reduce fatal cases of birth - related infection , the practice still meets with resistance .
" But it 's not because people do n't want to do it , " Archibald said .
" It 's not inherent in people 's behavior to wash their hands , for some reason . "
Various studies show that health - care workers wash their hands less than half the time after direct contact with patients .
The reasons people give include skin irritation caused by hand hygiene products , a preference for gloves or simply failure to remember .
Previous hand - washing compliance studies have been based on observation of a limited number of people at a time , who likely improve their behavior when they know they are being watched — a phenomenon known as the Hawthorne effect .
" This system is a noninvasive way of measuring — it allows for nonbiased measurement and is unobtrusive , " said Loretta Fauerbach , Shands at UF director of infection control , who helped write the CDC hand - washing guidelines and leads the collaboration with HyGreen to evaluate the system in a hospital setting .
" Nobody has ever taken a systems approach to this problem before , " said Melker , chief technology officer of Xhale Inc. , which is marketing HyGreen .
Developers anticipate that hospitals will readily accept the system because not only can it help reduce infections , it also will pay for itself within a few months .
" Something has to be done about hand washing , " Archibald said .
" Otherwise the bugs are going to win . "
I 've been giving a lot of thought lately to what brings out most geeks ' inner Klingons .
Last week , I came up with a list of what I called the " Top Ten Ways to Provoke a Geek Argument , " and I got lots of good suggestions from geeks everywhere , so I thought there was room for a followup .
In addition to presenting this sequel list , I would also like to announce a new regular weekly post I will be inaugurating shortly .
Each week I will pick a topic that geeks tend to find controversial , and cover the debate from as many sides as it has , ending with a poll to see where GeekDad 's readers stand on the subject .
There are lots of topics that geeks feel passionate about , but where the general opinion is split ; rather than simply list those , I hope to cover them in depth , some seriously and some facetiously ( sneak preview : expect to definitely see Kirk vs.
Picard in the first few weeks and possibly vi vs. Emacs later down the line ) .
The series will be called " Great Geek Debates , " so please check back on GeekDad for it .
I should note that , due to the volume of comments both on the original list itself and on the various pages linking to it , I do n't have the specific names of people who made suggestions .
Be assured that , if you see something on this list that you wrote in about , you have my thanks .
I should also note that most of these are self - explanatory , so I 've only included comments where I felt them necessary .

It would be easy , these days , not to know who Pete Seeger is .
If there is a mainstream of American pop culture , down which our capital and attention tend inexorably to flow — with its flotilla of rappers and actors and superstar politicians —
Seeger is off on a tributary somewhere , paddling a hand - carved canoe .
His prime , in terms of cultural visibility , was almost 60 years ago , when “ Goodnight Irene , ” a song he sang wholesomely with his wholesome band , the Weavers , went to No.
1 . Even then , Seeger was mainly trying to be culturally invisible .
Although he ’s been fluent in music since childhood ( by age 6 he could play the organ , piano , marimba , and squeezebox ) , he has always resisted stardom , preferring to be a conduit , a curator , an organizer , and a collaborator .
It was almost a blessing , then , that on the brink of serious commercial success , Seeger was forced to drop off the map :
He was accused of being a Communist , then blackballed after his politely defiant testimony in front of the House Un- American Activities Committee .
( “ I can only infer from your lack of interest in my songs , ” he said , “ that you are actually scared to know what these songs are like . ” )
He did n’t return to network TV for seventeen years , which guaranteed that his career would play out exactly as he wanted it to : deep in the grassroots , untroubled by the pressures of staying pure or selling out .
( He quit the Weavers after they agreed to do a cigarette ad. )
Over the decades , Seeger has made no effort to cash in on his longevity , to adjust his brand or repackage the old highlights as fresh commodities .
“ I always hated the word career , ” he has said .
“ It implies that fame and fortune are what you ’re trying to get .
I have a life ’s purpose . ”
He turns 90 this week , the same age as women ’s suffrage , the Green Bay Packers , and Grand Canyon National Park .
As he prepares to be fêted at Madison Square Garden by a lineup of musical megastars — Springsteen , Vedder , Matthews , Baez , et al . — Seeger remains arguably America ’s most celebrated anti-celebrity .
I know who Seeger is for two reasons — reasons that , taken together , suggest my life is playing out in some kind of subconscious Oedipal psychodrama with him .
First , my father ( whose name is also Peter ) admires Seeger so deeply he ’s even come to resemble him .
He has the same beard and hairline , the same attitude of cheerful straitlaced lefty idealism , and the same faith in the transformative power of folk music :
He plays his guitar every Sunday at church , agitates musically against global warming , and subscribes to Sing Out ! magazine .
Some of the most memorable nights of my childhood were spent listening to my father harmonize around campfires , on church retreats or at backwoods Oregon hippie festivals amid topless women and clouds of marijuana smoke , playing talking blues or Lutheran hymns or protest songs or ( to me , as I drifted off ) an old German lullaby .
As the son of a Seegerite , I am not myself a full proponent of Seegerism .
Like sons everywhere , I assembled my own taste - set in careful , loving counterpoint to my father ’s .
I practice a kind of inverted Seegerism .
I ’ve held on to all my hair but cannot , for the life of me , grow a decent beard .
I love the acoustic guitar but prefer its wielders to be skilled in the kind of anti-folk postures ( irony , sarcasm , hip indirection ) that ward off , rather than attract , earnest crowds .
I ’ve always favored Dylan over Seeger , since his melodies and rhymes are unexpected and hard to convert into voting platforms .
I even have a deep and guilty aversion to singing with crowds ; when a performer asks me to hum or wave my arms , or to chant “ Ay - yippie yo - yi , yippie yippie yay - yo ” at every third offbeat before the bridge , I tend to just sit there , silently , enduring it like a terrible gas pain .
Seeger , for me , is the hub around which a bunch of difficult existential issues pivot : irony versus earnestness , cleverness versus vulnerable honesty , isolation versus community , keeping quiet versus singing out .
Seeger is , quite literally , a folk hero — in the sense that he collected , wrote , and popularized many of America ’s essential songs : “ Turn , Turn , Turn , ” “ If I Had a Hammer , ” “ This Land Is Your Land , ” “ We Shall Overcome . ”
( It was originally “ We Will Overcome ” ; Seeger thought the vowel in “ shall ” made it sound more dramatic . )
But he is also a folk hero in the sense that Paul Bunyan is a folk hero .
His nine decades seem almost mythic , complete with a perfect origin story , trials , dangers , and big quixotic inspirational victories — all of which are recounted engagingly in Alec Wilkinson ’s new book - length essay , The Protest Singer .
( Wilkinson wrote the book , as Seeger requested , to be read in one sitting ; he calls it “ a factual novella . ” )
It ’s not hard to see where Seeger got his obsessions .
His father was a composer who “ thought the great symphonies would save the human race ” but who later became a political radical obsessed with the power of folk music .
When Pete was a baby , his dad took the family on a disastrous trip down the East Coast , towing a homemade trailer full of instruments in an effort to bring music to good country people .
( The trip was called off when baby Pete almost walked into a fire . )
The son inherited the father ’s impractical sense of mission .
As a young man , he dropped out of Harvard , played with Woody Guthrie , and rode in open boxcars around the country , living off his banjo .
Eventually , he saved enough to buy a patch of forest on a riverside mountain , cleared two acres of it himself , and built his own cabin out of the logs .
In 1949 , after Seeger played a concert with the African - American singer Paul Robeson , his car was ambushed by vandals throwing baseball - size stones from point - blank range .
( Seeger kept two of the stones and built them into his fireplace . )
In the late sixties , a Vietnam veteran , angry about Seeger ’s pacifism , showed up at a concert and told him , “ I think I should tell you , I came here this afternoon to kill you . ”
Instead , the man listened to the concert — apparently hearing Seeger ’s music for the first time — and said afterward that his anger had been “ cleansed . ”
Through it all , Seeger remained the idealist ’s idealist .
After the blackballing let up , he refused a steady TV job because the network asked him to sign a loyalty oath .
Instead , he took his family on a shoestring trip around the world to hear native cultures play their native music .
Back in America , he protested wars and marched to Montgomery , Alabama .
He coordinated the building of a ship called the Clearwater , a replica nineteenth - century sloop that gives educational rides on the Hudson — a campaign that has helped make the formerly poisonous river swimmable for most of its length .
The second reason I know who Pete Seeger is is that a few years ago I ended up moving , totally by accident , all the way across the country from my father to the little town on the Hudson where Seeger has lived for 60 years .
I am writing this article , in fact , in an office at the old high school where Seeger once played a controversial concert at the height of the Vietnam War .
I see him occasionally around town : tall , rail - thin ( he was encouraged to play the banjo because , the musicologist John Lomax said , “ he just looked like a banjo ” ) , wearing his knit cap , picking up trash .
Every June he serves strawberry shortcake at a festival at our riverfront park , which natives tell me was some kind of flaming toxic waste dump before the Clearwater came around .
He ’s visited my daughter ’s preschool class .
I ’ve even overcome my crowd - singing aversion , temporarily , to sing Christmas carols with him on Main Street .
One night last fall , before the election , Seeger was scheduled to sing at a local fund - raiser .
Instead , at the last minute , he went on Late Night With David Letterman .
As a child of the MTV era , I ’ve been conditioned to think of celebrity in cynical terms , and Seeger ’s choice that night made me doubt , momentarily , the order of the universe .
Was the most earnest , community - based man in America really going to blow off a political event with his small - town mates to promote a record on possibly the most ironic show in the history of network television ?
Was the Seeger legend , after all , too good to be true ?
After the fund - raiser , my wife and I sat down and watched Letterman .
As soon as Seeger appeared , with his white hair and his jeans and his button - down shirt , I knew order had been restored .
His presence was a category error .
He went on to give one of the weirdest and most powerful TV performances I ’ve ever seen , whisper - singing a springy , earnest tune about the lessons of Martin Luther King Jr. in the post - 9/11 world .
He asked the crowd to sing along .
They were reluctant .
He did n’t care , and eventually they gave in .
He treated them not like the background setting for his televised conquest of the promotional universe but like what they actually were : a room full of real , individual , aware , responsible , potentially political humans .
He transformed a TV audience into a group of men and women .
Even though he was 60 miles downriver , in midtown Manhattan , he might as well have been in our living room .
That ’s the power of Pete Seeger :
No matter what he ’s doing , no matter what your level of resistance , he always finds a way to make you join in .
Read it and weep , Governor Sanford .
It 's in South Carolina 's Code of Laws , Title 16 -- Crimes and Offenses , Chapter 15 " Offenses Against Morality and Decency "
SECTION 16-15 -60 .
Adultery or fornication .
Any man or woman who shall be guilty of the crime of adultery or fornication shall be liable to indictment and , on conviction , shall be severally punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars or imprisonment for not less than six months nor more than one year or by both fine and imprisonment , at the discretion of the court .
SECTION 16 - 15 - 70 .
" Adultery " defined .
" Adultery " is the living together and carnal intercourse with each other or habitual carnal intercourse with each other without living together of a man and woman when either is lawfully married to some other person .
Well , well , well .
Governor Mark Sanford , a publicly admitted adulterer .
Six months to a year in prison ?
Might be plenty of that " alone time " you seem to need to refresh yourself .
I hope to G-d all the self - righteous religious douchenozzles in South Carolina who laid flowers at Sanford 's feet are now caught trying to talk the state out of prosecuting him for his sins .
UPDATE for all you late comers [ and the humor - deprived ] , this is a diary poking at a fundamentalist Governor and his rabidly fundamentalist state base over what according to SC state law is an illegal act --- something all of them would certainly bring up if a Democratic politician was fingered as an adulterer .
The diary and diarist neither condone said laws nor even believe that they are constitutional .

June 17 , 2009
The purpose of this trip was to join other Carter Center observers during the Lebanese election and to visit leaders involved in the overall peace process in Syria , Israel , and Palestine .
In Lebanon , approximately 60 Carter Center observers from 23 nations were led by David Carroll , and former Yemeni Prime Minister Abdulkarim al Eryani was my co-chairman .
LEBANON ELECTION : 702 candidates competed for 128 parliamentary seats in 26 districts .
In a " confessional " system more than 65 years old , it was prearranged that seats be divided equally between Christians and Muslims , distributed as follows : Maronite Christians 34 ; Greek Orthodox 14 ; Greek Catholic 8 ; Sunni Muslim 27 ; Shi'a Muslim 27 ; Druze 8 ; Armenian 6 ; Alawite 2 ; Protestant 1 ; other Christians 1 .
Two alliances evolved : the March 14 group ( Sunnis and others ) , with Saudi Arabia and U.S. backing , having 70 seats ; and the March 8 group ( Shi'a and others ) , with Iran and Syria backing , having 58 seats .
Hassan Nasrallah ( Hezbollah ) , Speaker Nabih Berri ( Amal - the original Shi'a political party , now aligned with Hezbollah ) , and General Michel Aoun led March 8 and Saad Hariri led March 14 .
The swing districts were Christian , with leaders split between the two coalitions .
General Michel Aoun is allied with the Shi'a , and Samir Geagea , Walid Jumblatt , and Amin Gemayel with the Sunni .
It was obvious that March 8 coalition wanted to make gains but Hezbollah did not seek to increase its 11 seats , and contested no new ones .
Election experts said this could be the first free and fair election since 1972 .
Before the election , we met with the major political leaders ( Hezbollah decided that I should not join our Center 's team that met with them ) , while our observer teams were deployed in the 26 electoral districts .
On Election Day Rosalynn and I visited 28 polling sites .
There were many minor infractions of electoral procedures , but in general it was a good election with the results accepted peacefully by both sides .
The previous parliamentary alignment of 55 percent for March 14 and 45 percent for March 8 remained unchanged .
The major deciding factors were local in nature , but a friendlier attitude toward Obama and America may have helped March 14 .
( Although March 8 fell short of expected gains , it actually increased by one seat over the 2005 election result and received about 100,000 more popular votes . )
There seems to be a consensus that electoral reforms are necessary and will be adopted .
While maintaining the basic division of power in the confessional system , some of the major ones we will recommend are :
a ) A pre-printed uniform ballot instead of those individually prepared by political factions ;
b ) Reduction of the voting age from 21 to 18 ;
c ) Proportional representation within each constituency ;
d ) More women in office ( now 2 of 128 legislators ) ;
e ) Voting by qualified ex-patriots in Lebanese embassies abroad ( instead of massive return to their family homes to vote ) ; and
f ) Stricter enforcement of campaign spending limits .
March 8 candidates prevailed throughout Southern Lebanon , which Amal leader Berri called a victory for " resistance , national unity , and liberation . "
As the new government is formed during the coming weeks , a major decision will be whether the " one - third blocking " formula ( or some alternative ) will be continued .
This was established in the Doha agreement to give March 8 a veto power over important legislation .
( Note : Reached in Qatar between March 8 and March 14 , the Doha agreement permitted the divided parties to resolve differences and finally elect a president .
One major question was permitting Hezbollah to retain their weapons as long as Israel occupies parts of Lebanon . )
After making our post-election report , I had an extended discussion about the Middle East at Lebanese American University with about 25 top business and financial leaders .
They laughed when I asked if any of them had ever visited Israel .
Still technically at war , Lebanon - Israel peace talks are not feasible until Israel withdraws from Syria 's Golan Heights – and from Lebanon 's Shebaa Farms and Ghajjar village .
Before leaving Lebanon I met with Speaker Berri , Prime Minister Siniora , President Suleiman , future PM Hariri , Interior Minister Baroud , Shi'a leader Ayatollah Fadlallah , and Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir .
There is a general consensus that the issue of Hezbollah weapons will not be raised in the new government .
Since this was the primary reason for the " one - third veto , " there should not be major impediments to forming the new government .
President Suleiman 's national dialogue -- a discussion among the major factions to prevent serious disagreements -- involves 14 top political leaders , and will resume meetings when new cabinet members have been selected .
The two sure bets are Saad Hariri for prime minister and Nabih Berri for speaker .
Hezbollah is likely to be satisfied with its existing ministry of labor .
SYRIA AND HAMAS : Leaving Beirut by car and after stopping in resort town Zahle , Lebanon , for lunch with the Chief of Protocol , we went to Damascus and had a long session with Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Mouallem and the next morning with President Bashar al Assad .
They were somewhat peeved at U.S. " intervention " in the Lebanese election , eager to have friendly relations with the U.S. , believe recent diplomatic meetings were wasted opportunities , look forward to Senator George Mitchell 's visit this week , want to help with Iraq border crossing security and the overall Mideast peace process .
After a long walk through the old city tracing the path of St. Paul , we met with Khaled Meshaal and other leaders of Hamas .
Our primary goals were to induce them to comply with the Quartet 's " 3 conditions " ( recognize Israel 's right to exist ; forgo violence ; and accept previous peace agreements ) , help form a unity government with elections next January , and exchange the release of Corporal Shalit for a reasonable number of prisoners held by Israel .
As in previous meetings , my impression was that they were frank and honest with me , listening carefully , quickly accepting or rejecting my suggestions , and being flexible when possible .
I left written proposals for them to consider .
ISRAEL AND WEST BANK :
The next morning Hrair Balian , Rick Jasculca , and I drove through Jordan to East Jerusalem , where we were joined by Human Rights Director Karin Ryan , and I met with Naom Shalit , father of the captive soldier , who gave me a letter for his son .
I then had an extensive interview with Ha'aretz and meetings with U.S. Consul General Walles ( responsible for Palestinian affairs ) , Ambassador Cunningham , and General Dayton – none of whom can visit or deal with Gaza .
We were glad to learn that the primary responsibilities for the entire peace process will be with Senator Mitchell , and that Dayton will work for him .
Saturday morning our first meeting in Ramallah was with Dr. Mustafa Barghouti , a political activist who gave us an insightful overview of the Middle East .
Six of his party members were arrested the previous day by the Palestinian Authority police , who have become aggressive and abusive .
We then participated in a forum of all political parties and election officials preparing for the vote scheduled for 1/25/10 .
They are unanimous in insisting that Hamas must be included .
I then met with Minister of Interior Sayed Abu Ali * and his police commander .
The minister seemed to think he should arrest any activist supporting Hamas , including well known NGOs and financial groups , and could name none of the 600 or more prisoners who had been given a civilian trial or legal council .
Many of the prisoners , such as the associates of Barghouti , are obviously just political opponents of Fatah .
We then met with Prime Minister Salaam Fayad , who promised to investigate police policies and correct abuses .
After lunch with our Palestinian Advisory Group we met with three Hamas members of the Palestine Legislative Council ( an economist graduate of Iowa State University , a graduate of University of Alabama , and a medical doctor trained in Italy . )
They had recently been released from Israeli prisons after serving their 33 - month term because they were elected in January 2006 .
35 elected legislators are still in prison plus 12 men whom Hamas had proposed as ministers in a unity government .
They had a copy of the proposal I had made to Meshaal in Damascus and we discussed its wording .
I then received an award from PalTel Foundation and made a speech to a large audience , including the Prime Minister and several members of his cabinet .
Our last event of the day was a meeting with Christian leaders at the Greek Orthodox patriarchate , who expressed their concern about government policies that were rapidly reducing the number of Christians in Israel and Palestine .
HOUSE DEMOLITION , ISRAELI SETTLEMENT : Sunday , June 14 : We first visited a family in East Jerusalem that was being forced to destroy the second floor of their small house , allegedly built years ago without a proper permit .
They were trying to save the high cost they would have to pay the Israelis for doing the demolition .
The father had gone to court to request an extension of the deadline because the lower wall had cracked and engineering advice was needed .
We learned later that his request was granted , but with a 3 - day limit and a 10,000 shekel ( $ 2,600 ) fine .
We then met with President Shimon Peres , who had read Netanyahu 's speech and took a very hard line on all issues .
At Kerev Foundation , Yossi Beilin explained the status of the Geneva Initiative annexes ( basic proposals unchanged ) , and then we drove to the Gush Etzion settlement south of Jerusalem .
This is one of the settlements that , under the Geneva Initiative , would be within the 2 percent of Palestine to be swapped to Israel .
Mayor Shaul Goldstein and seven other settlers did everything possible to make me feel welcome and at home .
We disagreed on a number of issues , but had a pleasant discussion .
NETANYAHU'S SPEECH : I watched his speech and was appalled by his introduction of numerous obstacles to peace , some of them insurmountable .
He rejected sharing of Jerusalem and a settlement freeze and defined any future Palestinian state as demilitarized , no control over airspace , still including many Israeli settlements , and probably without the Jordan valley – provided they remove Hamas and all other Arabs will accept Israel as a Jewish state ( with 20 percent Arab citizens ) .
I 've been involved with these issues for 30 years , and none of them are acceptable , except perhaps through give - and - take negotiations .
ISRAELI KNESSET : Monday morning was very challenging and exciting .
Although all the government ministers declined to meet with me , I had a delightful visit with Speaker of the Knesset Reuven Rivlin .
He then escorted me to a long session with the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee , perhaps the most important of all .
The chairman , Tzahi Hanegbi , is the son of Geula Cohen , who disrupted the Knesset when Prime Minister Begin was trying to introduce me to speak in March 1979 .
She was removed by force , and now criticizes her son for deviating from her condemnation of the Israel - Egypt peace treaty or any other similar departure from a commitment to an " Eretz ( Greater ) Israel . "
I was grilled for 1 ½ hours with almost universally negative and aggressive questions , with many of them designed for the benefit of their fellow members .
I was able to answer all of them , as they were respectful and listened carefully to my responses .
Afterward many of them crowded around for a photograph .
This was one of the high points of the trip .
During our time in Jerusalem we also met with Civil Society leaders and key players in the peace and human rights movements .
GAZA : Our last day was spent in Gaza , a heartbreaking , infuriating , and embarrassing experience .
After being welcomed in a huge Israeli checkpoint , larger than a football field – designed for thousands and used by dozens - we drove a few yards and passed through a small manually operated gate into the northern end of the completely walled - in community .
The devastation was horrific in what had been an area of small businesses and workshops .
They had been first bombed and then the rubble leveled by huge bulldozers .
All the agricultural areas along the borders with Israel were empty because the Israelis still fired on anyone who entered , assuming that they might launch a missile or mortar round .
Knowing that there was precision guidance on the American - built bombs and missiles launched from F - 16s and Apache helicopters , it was hard to understand why the large American School had been completely destroyed and several hospitals heavily damaged .
The U.N. estimates that , in addition , 50,000 homes were completely wiped out or severely damaged .
We saw the precise destruction of the assembly hall for the Palestinian parliament and other official buildings .
We were not surprised to get a warning from American officials in Jerusalem that I should leave Gaza immediately because my life was in imminent danger .
I then spoke to the parents and 250 graduating students from UNRWA 's school and planted a beautiful tree given to us by Speaker Berri in Lebanon .
We drove to another building where we had extensive meetings with Prime Minister Haniya and other government officials who are pleading for building materials and other supplies to be permitted to enter , either from Egypt or Israel .
They propose that no money be sent and that any rebuilding be completely controlled by U.N. or other agencies not under their control .
So far , after five months , not a sack of cement , a pane of glass , or a board of lumber has been approved by Israel .
This amounts to continuing criminal abuse of 1½ million helpless people , condoned or ignored by the United States , Egypt , and the international community .
They intend to continue preventing any missiles or mortar fire into Israel .
After meeting with groups of wounded orphans and families of Palestinian prisoners , I delivered a letter from Naom Shalit to be given to his son , and made the same arguments as in Damascus for peace and reconciliation .
They will work with the Egyptians to comply .
Before heading home from Tel Aviv , we met with Mr. Shalit , the U.S. ambassador , the Egyptian consul general , and I had my fourth press conference of the day .
All of us were pleased with the entire trip .
* The Interior Minister represents the Palestine Authority government , under Prime Minister Fayad .
It was not elected , but just appointed .
The leaders elected in January 2006 ( Hamas majority and Haniya PM ) rejects its legitimacy but accepts Mahmoud Abbas ( Abu Mazen ) as leader of Palestinians , since he is head of the PLO , the only organization recognized also by Israel .

When President Obama was asked in March whether he thought legalizing marijuana could help solve the nation ’s financial problems , his answer was unequivocal .
“ No , I do n’t think that is a good strategy to grow our economy , ” he said .
But his response is unlikely to quell debate on an issue that polarizes Americans .
Even academic studies that purport to be unbiased arrive at very different conclusions .
Here are three viewpoints on why the country should or should not decriminalize the drug .
--
Last month , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger reignited a heated debate when he called for a civilized discussion on the merits of marijuana legalization .
Indeed , the governor was responding to new public opinion polls showing greater interest in the policy idea -- and with the mounting problems associated with the drug trade in Mexico and here at home , it is hard to blame anyone for suggesting that we at least consider all potential policy solutions .
One major justification for legalization remains tempting : the money .
Unfortunately , however , the financial costs of marijuana legalization would never outweigh its benefits .
Yes , the marijuana market seems like an attractive target for taxation -- Abt Associates , a research firm , estimates that the industry is worth roughly $ 10 billion a year -- and California could certainly use a chunk of that cash to offset its budget woes in the current economic climate .

What is rarely discussed , however , is that the likely increase in marijuana prevalence resulting from legalization would probably increase the already high costs of marijuana use in society .
Accidents would increase , healthcare costs would rise and productivity would suffer .
Legal alcohol serves as a good example :
The $ 8 billion in tax revenue generated from that widely used drug does little to offset the nearly $ 200 billion in social costs attributed to its use .
In fact , both of our two already legal drugs -- alcohol and tobacco -- offer chilling illustrations of how an open market fuels greater harms .
They are cheap and easy to obtain .
Commercialization glamorizes their use and furthers their social acceptance .
High profits make aggressive marketing worthwhile for sellers .
Addiction is simply the price of doing business .
Would marijuana use rise in a legal market for the drug ?
Admittedly , marijuana is not very difficult to obtain currently , but a legal market would make getting the drug that much easier .
Tobacco and alcohol are used regularly by 30 % and 65 % of the population , respectively , while all illegal drugs combined are used by about 6 % of Americans .
In the Netherlands , where marijuana is de facto legalized , lifetime use “ increased consistently and sharply ” after this policy shift triggered commercialization , tripling among young adults , according to data analysis from the Rand Corp .
We might expect a similar or worse result here in America ’s ad - driven culture .
An honest debate on marijuana policy also carefully considers the costs of our current approach .
Arrest rates for marijuana are relatively high , reaching about 800,000 last year .
Though these numbers are technically recorded under the category of “ possession , ” the story that is seldom told is that hardly any of these possession arrests result in jail time ( that is why former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani made headlines when he aggressively arrested public marijuana users and detained them for 12 to 24 hours in the 1990s ) .

One of the most astute minds in the field of drug policy , Carnegie Mellon ’s Jonathan Caulkins , formerly the co-director of Rand ’s drug policy research center , found that more than 85 % of people in prison for all drug - law violations were clearly involved in drug distribution , and that the records of most of the remaining prisoners had at least some suggestion of distribution involvement ( many prisoners plea down from more serious charges to possession in exchange for information about the drug trade ) .
Only about half a percent of the total prison population was there for marijuana possession , he found .
He noted that this figure was consistent with other mainstream estimates but not with estimates from the Marijuana Policy Project ( a legalization interest group ) , which , according to Caulkins , “ naively ... assumes that all inmates convicted of possession were not involved in trafficking . ”
Caulkins concluded that “ an implication of the new figure is that marijuana decriminalization would have almost no impact on prison populations . ”
This is not meant to imply that marijuana arrests do not have costs , but rather , that these concerns have been highly exaggerated .
Finally , legalizing marijuana would in no way ensure that the most vicious drug - related problems -- violence , economic - related crime , street gang activity -- would disappear .
Most of those problems stem from the cocaine , heroin and methamphetamine markets .
Marijuana ’s share of the black market is modest ( the cocaine market is three times larger ) , and the money that is spent on the drug is spread over so many users and distributors that few are working with amounts that motivate or encourage high levels of crime .
Moving beyond the simplistic and unrealistic option of legalization , what can we do to reduce marijuana use and the costly harms it brings ?
Increasing the ferocity of enforcement is n’t the answer , but increasing its potential for effectiveness through deterrent methods might be .
Programs like Project HOPE in Hawaii , which perform regular , random drug testing on probationers and others and implement reliable , swift ( but short ) sanctions for positive screens , have shown remarkable success .
Innovative solutions , grounded in sound research on prevention , treatment and enforcement , present the shortest route out of marijuana - related costs .
But an open market for the stuff ?
That does n’t pass the giggle test .

It has nothing to do with terrorism , nukes or Ahmadinejad .
It ’s wheat fungus .
The L.A. Times reports :
Crop scientists fear the Ug99 fungus could wipe out more than 80 % of worldwide wheat crops as it spreads from eastern Africa .
It has already jumped the Red Sea and traveled as far as Iran .
Experts say it is poised to enter the breadbasket of northern India and Pakistan , and the wind will inevitably carry it to Russia , China and even North America — if it does n’t hitch a ride with people first .
“ It ’s a time bomb , ” said Jim Peterson , a professor of wheat breeding and genetics at Oregon State University in Corvallis .
“ It moves in the air , it can move in clothing on an airplane .
We know it ’s going to be here .
It ’s a matter of how long it ’s going to take . ”
Though most Americans have never heard of it , Ug99 — a type of fungus called stem rust because it produces reddish - brown flakes on plant stalks — is the No. 1 threat to the world ’s most widely grown crop .

Optimize Your User Experience
Most online users know what they want , and they are n’t about to settle for less .
Imagine being in a market with many other competitors .
Leveraging on user experience is not negotiable in such cases .
I will reveal to you one secret to high - ranking search engine results .
This secret is in how well you emphasize your users ’ experience .
A typical online search may take less than a minute .
How well your website can create an impression during this short span is critical .
Focus on user - friendliness when developing your SEO strategy .
You may need to have a careful evaluation of the features on your website and their effectiveness .
Is your website aesthetically pleasing ?
This is among the questions you can use to conduct an assessment of your current search engine optimization prospects .
You may need to spend money and time to ensure that your website is customer - focused .
If you are in doubt about how well your approach aligns to the anticipated user experience , then it ’s time to reconsider .
Google will focus on the overall usability , ease of navigation and ease of access before determining your business ’ SEO rank .
Are you looking to achieve the fastest SEO results ?
Then you need to revisit your website .
Ensure that aspects such as accessibility , social engagement , and usability are in check .
Then watch as your SEO ranking improves over time .
Assess Your Page Loading Speed
Time is of the essence .
The reason most people prefer search engines such as Google is that they are assured of speedy and reliable results .
Now , imagine having to wait for a page to load for more than a few seconds each time you make a random organic search .
Your page loading determines your search engine optimization results .
For this reason , Google will often be keen on recording the average page loading speed for affiliate websites .
You may end up having a negative SEO ranking if your rate is considered slow .
Website visits also often suffer in case your average page loading speed is slower compared to your competitors .
If you ’re keen on fast SEO results for your business , you should consider your page loading capabilities .
Evaluating your page loading speed is easy .
You only need to conduct a simple page abandonment analysis .
According to research , an average visitor to your website will abandon a search if your page takes more than three seconds to load .
What will shock you more is that 80 % of these visitors are unwilling to return to that website after such a delay .
The result is that traffic slows down on your website , and this has an impact on your ranking .
If you are keen on better SEO results for your products and services , your page loading speed is of the essence .
Google uses an algorithm that detects the surge in traffic on your website .
If your page speed and server response time are high , then your business is likely to attract the fastest SEO results .
Content Is King
Everyone appreciates an informative read .
Your business can derive significant benefits by ensuring that your content appeals to the target audience .
You ’ll harness the fastest SEO results for your services and products if your content quality is unmatched .
What kind of content is available on your website ?
Most return clients do so because of the information they derive from your blogs .
The chance that these users will revisit your site depends on what new information you have in store .
As long as your content is easily digestible , you are likely to gain a higher SEO ranking over time .
Ensure that you know your client base and work towards furnishing them with information that promotes your products without advertising .
Using headers and sub headers for your content can be a critical step towards enhancing readability .
You may need to evaluate your current approach to search engine optimization and assess your content ’s usefulness to the users .
Despite the unflattering reality that content is at the core of search engine ranking , most of the material you find in most websites is mundane .
Your primary focus must be on sprucing up the readability and the appeal .
Using essential tips such as the inclusion of images and relevant keyword optimization will certainly send users in droves to your website .
Content is often the critical driver of SEO success .
You need to ensure that your content is not only quality but also regular .
Google , as the leading search engine , often assess rankings based on consistency and relevance .
If your website is experiencing slow traffic , then maybe you need to rethink your content .
Focus on producing high –quality content periodically and watch as your products attract the fastest SEO results .
Focus On Mobile Usability
Gone are the days when people would gather inside cybercafés to gain access to the internet .
Mobile technology continues to provide accessibility to the internet as mobile phones become ever more portable .
Your focus , for now , must be on ensuring mobile - friendliness .
Can users easily access your website through their mobile phones ?
If no , then this may be affecting your ranking factor .
Research indicates that 50 % of all search engine results originate from mobile devices .
Making your website mobile friendly is an essential step towards ensuring that you gain the quickest SEO results for your products .
You need to make your website more mobile - friendly .
But how will you achieve this ?
You may have two options to consider when making this critical step towards greater accessibility .
You can consider responsive web designs and accelerated mobile pages when increasing the overall mobile usability .
By considering these options , you will likely achieve a higher SEO ranking for your products and services due to higher traffic .
Seeking the views of experts on the options that work best for you may be an essential first step towards enhancing mobile usability .

Start Blogging
Any SEO expert will tell you that blogging is an outstanding tool for lead generation .
Attaining the fastest SEO results is not as hard if you have constant blog content .
Most businesses do not realize this , but blogging greatly improves your SEO rankings .
You may have the right content and material to promote your products .
But this is not enough if you lack the platform necessary to act as a medium for such content .
Blogs are a perfect tool when channeling your readers towards reading more .
Your products and services can attract the fastest SEO results across the various search engines if you harness the power of blogs .
All you need to do is to develop supportive readers over time , who in return will help you drive traffic to your site .
Experts say that blogs if well combined with links and keywords have the potential of building your online capability .
As your credibility increases , your business will eventually rank high in search engine rankings .
I Hear , I Forget .
I See I Remember
Imagery will raise your SEO ranking to heights unimagined .
You have certainly clicked on a post because an image or video was of interest to you .
Well , this is a common reaction to visuals by most online users .
If you want to boost your search engine ranking , you need to consider the use of visuals .
What a potential client may have heard about your products may not matter at times .
But if such users come across optimized images online , linking them back to your website is secure .
Encouraging the use of optimized visuals may be a worthwhile SEO strategy for your business .
Most of the companies with the fastest SEO results will often have a diverse use of visual images , which complement their posts .
But there are a few downsides you need to consider .
You need to ensure that your visuals are compressed to reduce load time .
You do not want to end up creating another problem by having big - sized images and videos that affect page loading time .
Your SEO ranking will experience growth due to the visual attraction users have to your posts .
I have visited your website and found what I needed .
What next ?
The next most crucial step , in this case , is to ensure that the client can quickly contact your business for additional information or purchase .
Google knows how much contact info matters to a website and often uses this benchmark to determine your rank .
You are likely to be reported to your search engine provider for appearing to be untrustworthy and lacking in credibility if you lack contact info .
Your search engine optimization ranking faces negative implications in such cases .
This also affects your desire to achieve the fastest SEO results .
You need to consider having current and valid contact information .
This makes your clients build trust and increases the chance of repeat customers on your website .
Your Visibility Online Starts and Ends with SEO
You will not be able to survive the rapid changes in the market without an established SEO strategy .
Having the fastest SEO results for your business does not come easily .
You need to combine several ideas that will eventually boost your SEO ranking .
If your business is rearing to take off in the age of technology , then it ’s time to consult a SEO expert .

The C Street house operates under a code of silence .
C St. : where scandal meets spirituality
Lawmakers flock to 133 C St. SE for cheap rent , weekly dinners , Bible studies and spirituality sessions that serve as a sort of group therapy for some of the country ’s most powerful men .
But now the stately brick house is becoming known for something else :
It ’s ground zero for Republican sex scandals .
In February , Nevada Sen. John Ensign — who lives at the house — was confronted at C Street by colleagues who wanted him to end his affair with a staffer .
Advertisement
Earlier this month , South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford — who lived at C Street when he served in the House — said C Street was where he ’d been asked the “ hard questions ” that were “ very , very important ” in his decision to admit an affair with an Argentine woman .
And last week , the estranged wife of former Rep. Chip Pickering said he carried on a long - term extramarital affair while living at the “ well - known C Street Complex . ”
The trifecta of trysts has made C Street an easy target for charges of “ family values ” hypocrisy — see the New York Times columns by Maureen Dowd and Gail Collins over the weekend .
But Christian lawmakers say Washington prayer and Bible - study groups — and the secrecy that surrounds them — provide crucial counseling for their lives in the nation ’s capital .
“ One thing about having members meet with members is they kind of understand what each other goes through and the stresses and the pressures and those kinds of things , ” Congressional Prayer Caucus Chairman Rep. Randy Forbes ( R - Va. ) , who participates in a small Bible study group on Wednesday mornings .
“ And one member can tell another member , ‘ I do n’t think that ’s the right thing for you to do . ’ ”
In an interview with the evangelical World Magazine , Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) described living at C Street as “ one of the best parts ” of life in Washington .
“ We kind of make that commitment to each other to get together once a week , ” he said .
“ Sometimes it ’s a Bible study ; we always have a spiritual or scriptural thought .
But sometimes we just talk about each others ’ lives , try to get to know each other , remind each other that we are not important , that it ’s just a title . ”
Although titles may not be important , there are plenty of them at C Street .
In addition to DeMint and Ensign , C Street residents include Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) and Reps. Mike Doyle ( D - Pa. ) , Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) and Zach Wamp ( R - Tenn . ) .
Sen. Sam Brownback ( R - Kan . ) lived in the house before moving to his own condo , and he still attends events there .
Former Reps. Steve Largent ( R - Okla . ) , Jim Ryun ( R - Kan. ) , and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) have also studied at C Street .
The large townhouse , valued at more than $ 1.8 million , is run by Christian network of nonprofits and ministries known as “ The Fellowship . ”
Headquartered in Arlington , Va. , the group focuses on what Fellowship leaders call the “ up and out , ” or powerful politicians struggling to confront their personal demons .
By ministering to the most powerful , The Fellowship believes , it can bring Christian beliefs to the larger culture .
Jeff Sharlet , who wrote a book about his time in The Fellowship 's Virginia headquarters , said the group believes that lawmakers have been " chosen " to lead by Jesus Christ .
“ The C Street house is a house for powerful people and broken people , ” said Michael Cromartie , vice president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center .
“ A lot of people go there as they would go to a church to receive healing and counsel . ”
Like most political prayer groups , C Street operates under a code of silence ; supporters say it ’s the only way lawmakers can feel safe being completely honest about their personal struggles .
Former Rep. Tony Hall ( D - Ohio ) said weekly prayer breakfasts he attended on Capitol Hill were “ probably some of the best moments I had during the week ” precisely because “ we closed the doors . ”
“ No staff is allowed in , ” he said .
“ No reporters are allowed in — nobody from the outside , only members . ”
But in the wake of the C Street - related sex scandals , the code of silence can seem less like pastoral privacy and more like “ what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas . ”
When news broke that Coburn confronted Ensign about his affair at C Street , the Oklahoma Republican and practicing OB - GYN declared that he could n’t be compelled to testify about the matter because he was counseling Ensign “ as a physician and as an ordained deacon . ”
“ When you operate in secret in Washington you raise an immediate red flag and then it gets redder when it gets mixed with any ideological agenda , ” said Barry Lynn , executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State .
The Fellowship ’s only public activity is organizing the National Prayer Breakfast , an annual event that draws thousands from around the world including members of Congress and the president .
The group also organized the first weekly prayer breakfasts in the House and Senate during the 1940s .
Those breakfasts continue today .
About 40 members attend the House prayer breakfast each week , said Rep. Jo Ann Emerson ( R - Mo. ) , a former president of the group that organizes it .
According to one regular , Rep. Joe Pitts ( R - Pa. ) , a member usually shares a life story or a “ walk of faith ” and then takes questions from the group .
“ Somebody gets a word from the Scriptures , ” Hall explained , “ and somebody talks a little bit about their life in a very personal way .
Sometimes the member becomes very vulnerable and you become vulnerable to one another .
That ’s good because in a political life , you do n’t get a chance sometimes to build the kind of personal relationships that everybody needs . ”
In the Senate , roughly 25 members meet for an hour at 8 a.m. every Wednesday .
“ The meeting in small groups is scripturally based on Acts 2:42 , where you get together on a regular basis and do four things : eat together , pray together , fellowship together and talk about the precepts of Jesus together , ” said Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) , president of the Senate prayer breakfast .
Members of both houses also participate in outside prayer groups and Bible study sessions .
Rep. Marsha Blackburn ( R - Tenn . ) said she attends a weekly Wednesday morning breakfast with several other congresswomen from both sides of the aisle .
She said the meeting is off campus , but that ’s all she would say .
“ You know , ” she said , “ we do n’t talk the specifics . ”
Because of the secrecy , it ’s hard to know exactly how frank the various prayer sessions are — although it ’s clear that Ensign ’s affair was a topic of conversation at C Street .
Coburn and others confronted Ensign about the affair there last year , and Wamp said that Ensign recently apologized to fellow C Streeters for his indiscretion .
Cromartie said the sessions at C Street may be more secular than they seem from the outside .
“ I do n’t know how much they really ever get around to the Bible , ” he said .
“ There ’s a lot of sharing .
It ’s kind of like an AA group where people get together . ”
Indeed , says Rice University professor Michael Lindsey , the author of “ Faith in the Halls of Power , ” what happens in most Washington - based faith sessions is “ personally , pastorally related . ”
“ [ Politicians ] usually do n’t get that level of pastoral support from their local churches because they do n’t feel like they ’re among peers , or that they could be vulnerable , ” he said .
“ Most of what ’s been written about The Fellowship is very conspiratorial .
I studied it for three years , and I just do n’t find much support for the conspiracy theories .
To the extent that it ’s conspiratorial , I would say it ’s a private support group for people in power .
So because it ’s private , you assume there ’s something bad going on . ”

13 doctors demand inquest into Dr David Kelly 's death
No inquest : Dr David Kelly in the days before his death
The death of Government scientist David Kelly returned to haunt Labour today as a group of doctors announced that they were mounting a legal challenge to overturn the finding of suicide .
Dr Kelly 's body was found six years ago this week in woods close to his Oxfordshire home , shortly after he was exposed as the source of a BBC news report questioning the grounds for war in Iraq .
Unusually , no coroner 's inquest was held into his death .
The only official verdict has come from the Hutton Inquiry , commissioned by Tony Blair , which concluded that Dr Kelly , 59 , died from loss of blood after cutting his wrist with a blunt gardening knife .
Critics regarded the report as a ' whitewash ' , and Mr Blair remains acutely sensitive to the accusation that he has ' blood on his hands ' over the scientist 's death .
But now a team of 13 specialist doctors has compiled a detailed medical dossier that rejects the Hutton conclusion on the grounds that a cut to the ulnar artery , which is small and difficult to access , could not have caused death .
It will be used by their lawyers to demand a formal inquest and the release of Dr Kelly 's autopsy report , which has never been published .
It will also be sent to Sir John Chilcot 's forthcoming inquiry into the Iraq War .
The 12 - page opinion , a copy of which has been seen by The Mail on Sunday , concludes : ' The bleeding from Dr Kelly 's ulnar artery is highly unlikely to have been so voluminous and rapid that it was the cause of death .
Speaking out : David Halpin , pictured with his wife Sue , is among the doctors behind the legal challenge
' We advise the instructing solicitors to obtain the autopsy reports so that the concerns of a group of properly interested medical specialists can be answered . '
The doctors do not say how , or why , they believe Dr Kelly did die but they have worked closely with campaigning Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker , who believes that the scientist was murdered by enemies he made in the course of his work as a weapons inspector .
And two of the doctors have added to the sense of persistent intrigue surrounding Dr Kelly by claiming that thousands of emails relating to the case had ' vanished ' from their computers , in what one claimed was an act of ' state - sponsored sabotage ' .
A coroner 's inquest into Dr Kelly 's death was suspended before it could begin by order of the then Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer .
He used the Coroners Act to designate the Hutton Inquiry as ' fulfilling the function of an inquest ' , but as a judicial investigation it had no power to make witnesses give evidence under oath .
After taking evidence from - but not cross-examining - Dr Nicholas Hunt , the pathologist who carried out the post - mortem examination , Lord Hutton concluded that ' the principal cause of death was bleeding from incised wounds to the left wrist ' combined with the consumption of painkillers and ' silent coronary artery disease ' .
Not forgotten :

The doctors also say that the level of the painkiller co-proxamol in Dr Kelly 's blood was about one third of that required to produce death and point to Dr Hunt 's comments at the end of giving evidence to Lord Hutton .
Asked if there was anything further he would like to say on the circumstances leading to Dr Kelly 's death , he said : ' Nothing I could say as a pathologist , no . '
After the report was published , Dr Hunt added to the doctors ' suspicions by telling Channel 4 that he thought a full coroner 's inquest should be held .
The doctors have hired solicitor Martin Day , of Leigh Day and Co , and received advice from barrister Richard Hermer , QC , both of whom have a strong track record in civil liberties actions , including winning nearly £ 3 million in compensation from the British Government for the family of Iraqi Baha Mousa , who died while being detained by UK troops .
They intend to use the Coroners Act to challenge Lord Falconer 's suspension of the inquest .
One of the doctors , David Halpin , told The Mail on Sunday that they had argued their case in the legal document in ' microscopic ' detail .
He said : ' We reject haemorrhage as the cause of death and see no contrary opinion which would stand its ground .
I think it is highly likely he was assassinated . '
Mr Baker said : ' The fact that eminent medical experts feel so strongly that the official explanation for Dr Kelly 's death cannot be sustained and are now taking legal action against the Government to secure a proper inquest demonstrates both how suspect Lord Hutton 's conclusions were and how this dark chapter cannot be closed unless Sir John Chilcott 's inquiry into the Iraq war addresses this issue .
' A proper inquest into Dr Kelly 's death must take place . '
Among the doctors is Christopher Burns - Cox , 71 , the former senior consultant physician for the Frenchay Healthcare Trust , Bristol , and current co-chairman of the NHS consultants ' association .
Campaign : Lib Dem MP Norman Baker at the place where Dr Kelly 's body was found in 2003
Mr Halpin , 69 , meanwhile , is a former lecturer in anatomy at King 's College , London , and a former consultant in orthopaedic and trauma surgery at Torbay Hospital .
He continued in general practice until 2005 .
Mr Halpin said that he lost more than 6,000 pieces of correspondence - many relating to Dr Kelly - during his investigation , explaining that the mystery began when the ' firewall ' on his computer , which all similar machines are fitted with as a security measure , became inactive without warning .
His emails started disappearing as though they were being sifted remotely .
' I believe this will have been done by a state - sponsored agency and not by an amateur acting singly , ' he said .
A close associate of Mr Halpin 's who has also taken an active interest in the case confirmed to The Mail on Sunday that at around the same time he , too , fell victim to what he believes was a rogue agent , losing ' somewhere in the region of 2,000 emails ' , many of which discussed Dr Kelly .
For professional reasons , the individual concerned , a civil servant , said that he could not be identified by name .
He said : ' I have no doubt that my computer was hacked into and I also have reason to believe that both my mobile telephone and my landline have been bugged until fairly recently .
It echoes on the end of the line , things like that .
' But if I made an accusation like that in public without being able to prove it , it would compromise me and for the sake of my children I do not want to enter that territory .
I can not say any more about it at the moment . '
Mr Baker , who published a book about Dr Kelly 's death in 2007 , also believes that his computer was hacked into remotely , leading to the loss of sensitive files about David Kelly from his constituency office in Lewes , East Sussex .
' I think it is highly likely he was assassinated '
And Mr Halpin added that Rowena Thursby , who helped establish the Kelly Investigation Group which has campaigned for the inquest into Dr Kelly 's death to be reopened on several occasions , has also lost scores of emails in a similar , suspicious manner .
The developments come as investigative journalist Bob Coen prepares to screen a 90 - minute documentary , Anthrax War , in London on the sixth anniversary of Dr Kelly 's death , this Friday .
The film claims that Dr Kelly 's death may have been linked to the secret world of germ warfare research .
Until his death
Dr Kelly was privy to some of the state 's most sensitive information and worked closely with the intelligence services of all the major industrialised countries .
Among notable claims in the film , which was made over four years , is Dr Kelly 's connection with Dr Walter Basson , whose work for the South African apartheid regime used chemical and biological weapons research destined for extrajudicial execution , and whose goals included ethnic cleansing .
The film also suggests that Dr Kelly was preparing to write a book that would have breached the Official Secrets Act .
He could not have died from loss of blood , say the experts
The draft version of the doctors ’ dossier – a final version , including diagrams and a copy of Dr Kelly ’s death certificate , is being prepared for lawyers this week – concentrates on the ulnar artery , a blood vessel in the forearm .
The Hutton Report quoted Dr Nicholas Hunt , the forensic pathologist who examined
Dr Kelly ’s corpse , as seeing ‘ evidence of a significant incised wound to his left wrist , in the depths of which his left artery had been completely severed ...
‘ The arterial injury had resulted in the loss of a significant volume of blood , as noted at
the scene . ’
But the doctors draw on their specialist knowledge of human anatomy to argue in detail that a wound to this artery could not have resulted in enough blood loss to cause his death .
‘ This artery has the width of a matchstick in its constricted state , ’ they write .
‘ It is not easily felt on the little finger side of the wrist ... on the contrary , the radial artery
pulse is easily felt beneath the skin on the opposite side of the wrist .
It is thus more
difficult to cut the ulnar artery . ’
They go on to argue that , according to the evidence given by Dr Hunt to Lord Hutton ’s
inquiry , Dr Kelly ’s blood would have quickly clotted , thus stemming the flow and preventing his death .
They write : ‘ Dr Hunt describes complete severance of this artery , ie transection .
This
means the elasticity of the artery would have caused it to retract within its sheath .
‘ Contraction of the circular smooth muscle within the arterial wall would have narrowed the artery , thus reducing or stopping blood flow .
Blood clots would have formed in the wound , but also within the narrowed artery .
‘ That clotting within the artery would have happened more speedily because the cutting was done with considerable trauma , thus causing more damage to the lining membrane , the intima .
Damage to the cells of the intima causes aggregation of blood platelets , thus
hastening clotting within the vessel . ’
The doctors cite a number of studies which they say prove for ‘ all practical purposes ’ that suicide using the means allegedly adopted by Dr Kelly ‘ does not exist in Britain ’ .
Although the doctors do not believe the painkillers taken by Dr Kelly contributed to his
death in any way – as argued by Lord Hutton – they have restricted the scope of their dossier to refute the reasoning he used on the question of haemorrhage .

[ Ed Note : Coleen Rowley will be one of my guests on the nationally syndicated Mike Malloy Show , which I 'm guest hosting this week from 6 p - 9 p PT , 9 p - Mid. ET each night .
More details here ... - BF ]
Guest Blogged by Coleen Rowley , FBI whistleblower , TIME 's 2002 ' Person of the Year '
By late January / early February , 2003 , I and other Americans were witnessing the Bush Administration 's final and intense push to launch their pre-emptive war on Iraq , based largely on ( what are now well known as ) two completely false pretexts : Iraq 's possession of WMD and its connections to Al Qaeda terrorists .
My knowledge that Iraq 's WMD was being exaggerated was merely what anyone could gain from close reading of public sources : the McClatchy news articles by Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel ( who later won Pulitzers for their reporting ) as well as a few buried articles in the Washington Post and Newsweek debunking the " evidence " being educed by Bush - Cheney - Powell - Rice - Rumsfeld et al .
Due to the Minneapolis FBI 's pre-9/11 investigation of an Al Qaeda operative , however , I was in a better position to know more than J.Q. Average Citizen in regard to the non-existence of ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda .
I felt it my responsibility to speak out , and so I did --- or tried to --- to my bosses at the FBI , and to the media , including CBS ' 60 Minutes ...
Deja Vu All Over Again
The Administration knew how important it was to cleverly fabricate this connection and , by February 2003 , they had succeeded in misleading 76 percent of Americans to believe Saddam Hussein provided assistance to al - Qaeda .
Cheney would lie about 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta meeting with an Iraqi intelligence agent in Prague , while the FBI Director would look down at his shoes , knowing the FBI had documentary proof that Atta was in the U.S. at the time ( and not meeting Iraqi agents in Prague ) .
I also knew the FBI Director was under enormous pressure to keep his mouth shut and go along with whatever the Administration wanted , in order to keep them from splitting the FBI in half .
In addition to its pre-9/11 lapses , the FBI 's round - up of a thousand immigrants after 9/11 , which they had touted for PR purposes , had turned out not to be terrorists while actions that did make sense : i.e. requests to interview terrorist suspects already in custody about second wave plots and threats , were declined .
Less than 18 months before , I 'd witnessed one of the worst consequences ; the 9/11 attacks unfolded after ( what we were to learn was ) a multitude of lapses , including Minneapolis agents ' legitimate concerns being dismissed by FBI Headquarters .
Less than 9 months before , FBI Director Robert Mueller had advised me to contact him directly if I ever had concerns of any similar problem .
And just 2 months prior , I had been featured as one of Time Magazine 's " Persons of the Year " for being a " whistleblower " whose disclosures led to investigation and numerous embarrassing findings that 9/11 might have been prevented .
The incompetence and dissembling about all the prior failures and mistakes had first shocked but then desensitized me .
But the false info being sold to the American public that the 9/11 attacks were connected to Iraq was a whopper with potentially grave consequences .
The Media Go to War
Colin Powell 's presentation at the U.N. , seemed to mark the point where the mainstream media caught " war fever " and swung solidly behind Bush 's plans .
What few knew was that , in addition to Powell 's PR home - run , Rumsfeld 's assistant Victoria Clarke had leaked her 300 page plan of " Embedding the Media in Iraq " to U.S. media heads .
The Pentagon Pundit Program was also established to insert retired pro-war military officers as talking heads on the TV News programs .
After some initial flurry , the word came back from the magazine heads that Iraq was essentially a done deal and they had no interest .
It was a couple weeks after my op - ed was turned down that I remembered the FBI Director 's stated willingness to accept critical information from me about problems and dangers .
So on February 26 , 2003 , I took a deep breath and sent an e-mail to FBI Director Robert Mueller .
It contained all the points I could think of that the FBI Director ought to be warning the President about --- in a nutshell , how wrong and counterproductive the launching of war on Iraq would be to our efforts to reduce terrorism .
A week passed without any response from the FBI Director .
I was starting to panic as , according to news reports , that first week of March , American troops were already in place , just waiting for orders from Bush to commence the attack .
I could not watch another calamity unfold without trying , so at that point I called up reporters at two newspapers : the New York Times and the Minneapolis Star Tribune .
Philip Shenon of the NY Times and Greg Gordon at the Minneapolis Star Tribune ( who now writes for McClatchy ) were interested and both papers subsequently published front page stories about my warning to the FBI Director on March 6 , 2003 .
Although I had technically broken FBI policy by not seeking FBI " pre-publication review " and approval for sharing my letter with news outlets , nothing in my letter was classified or secret by law .
It certainly was the kind of thing more suitable for a letter of resignation and way over my lowly ( GS 14 ) pay grade but no one at the higher ranks was doing anything !
They all seemed muzzled .
The morning the articles were published , the FBI 's " Office of Professional Responsibility " ( internal discipline unit ) as well as Headquarters Legal Counsel and Press Office quickly engaged with my field office boss ( the " Special Agent in Charge " ) to let me know I 'd be facing disciplinary action for the unapproved media contact and publication .
The reason I had not sought " pre-publication review " was due to time sensitivity .
I was aware of the FBI using its " pre-publication review " policy to delay releasing other agents ' writings for years , not due to legal reasons ( secrecy of the info ) but just as a way of controlling employees ' speech , when it could prove embarrassing to the FBI .
( In all fairness this rarely happened , as no employees in their right mind would go through the pre-publication rigmarole without some kind of monetary profit incentive . )
All of my colleagues in the Minneapolis FBI office were shocked at the news articles on March 6 , 2003 , at what they thought was a totally crazy action on my part .
Given the war fever and sense of futility , even the few who were against the Iraq War disapproved of my attempt to engage the media .
Some agents joined pundits in publicly denouncing me .
Those in my office said they could no longer trust me and called on my boss to relieve me of my division legal counsel duties .
( Only one , however , had the integrity to confront me directly and question me on the substantive facts and issues ; the lack of justification for launching the new war on a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 . )
Enter CBS ' 60 Minutes
Amongst the calls from the media that ensued from my warnings in the NY Times and Minneapolis Star Tribune on March 6 , 2003 was a request for an exclusive interview from the celebrated CBS 's 60 Minutes investigative news program .
One of correspondent Scott Pelley 's producers at the time had worked on prior news reports exposing the Moussaoui investigation and I had previously met him a couple times ; the first occasion was in Senator Grassley 's office as I had waited to testify on June 6 , 2002 to the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Pelley and his producer flew in to the Twin Cities to interview me the next day .
By that time , the FBI had reviewed my e-mail letter to Mueller ( which had resulted in the articles ) and they knew there was nothing in it that was secret or legally protected .
The FBI , however , had initiated a potential disciplinary action against me for failure to seek " pre-publication review " .
At that point , I therefore asked for the FBI 's approval to accommodate the 60 Minutes request .
After taking an additional day to respond , the FBI ended up saying they could n't stop me from repeating the points in my letter but also basically read me the ' riot act ' in terms of warning me not to do it .
Before that happened , Pelley and his producer already tried to convince me to do the interview without worrying about FBI approval .
On the morning of March 7th , while their cameras were being set up , and I was trading phone calls with my boss and FBI Headquarters , Pelley tried to convince me to just go ahead .
It was then that he divulged how Colin Powell 's speech had been the thing that convinced him of the need for this new war on Iraq .
He said he'd been very skeptical prior to hearing Powell but that Powell was persuasive and seemed to have swayed the bulk of the media .
But , Pelley continued , that if there were solid arguments and information that weighed against precipitously launching this new war , the people of the country needed to hear it .
The FBI had n't responded to my request by 11 a.m. and so I told the 60 Minutes crew I could n't do the interview .
Their camera team packed their equipment up and put our living room furniture back in place .
It was almost noon and Pelley and his producer had given up and left when the FBI finally provided their weird response : half approval and half warning .
Pelley had already returned to the airport , but when I called and said I could do the interview , they turned around and called their camera crew to come back and set up again .
I had a prior commitment to give a two hour talk on " legal and law enforcement ethics " at a Twin Cities law school that afternoon but when I got home around 4 pm , 60 Minutes started filming the interview .
It was an interview from hell , quickly turning into an excruciatingly difficult and painful affair for everyone involved .
Pelley asked the same or similar questions over and over , I suppose in an effort to get better or stronger responses .
I was trying to be careful and not stray from the FBI 's " permission " which was limited to what I 'd already said in the letter to Mueller .
Canister after canister of film was loaded , used and wasted , capturing the repeated questioning which continued almost until midnight .
There were only a few short breaks , making for almost eight hours worth of ( thoroughly repetitive ) interview tape !
By the end , judging from their faces going out the door , it was obvious that most if not all of the tape was destined for the cutting room floor .
Nothing from the interview aired that Sunday , March 9th .
Pelley 's producer may have even been fired due to how much time and effort was wasted in the hours and hours of interview they conducted with me , especially since it occurred on a Friday night , less than 48 hours before Sunday night show time .
I never heard from anyone at 60 Minutes ever again .
The Cost of Speaking Up
Unsurprisingly , my career at the FBI was destroyed as a result of my speaking out against the war .
It 's a much longer story but the group of agents with the worst case of ' war fever ' pressured my boss to make me step down from the GS 14 legal position I 'd had for 13 years .
In a way they were right , as the attorney - client legal representation aspect of my division legal counsel position required the trust of all the employees .
I made a quick decision that the better part of valor would be to give them their pound of flesh .
My stepping down , along with volunteering for the various odd shifts , out of town and holiday assignments , all night surveillances , and odd jobs no one wanted like " informant coordinator " , got me through the next 22 months to retirement eligibility , albeit with a pension accordingly reduced for having given up one GS - level .
Over six years later , I find it 's still painful to remember and recount --- like throwing oneself at a train would be .
I 've blocked a lot of it out .
In all fairness , there were probably many reasons that nothing from the canisters and canisters of film produced from that painful interview ever aired on 60 Minutes that war - fevered week ( which was about 10 days before Bush ordered the attacks to begin ) .
But there are also lots of unanswered questions .
The significant investment of time and resources Pelley ended up wasting on my warnings about launching war on Iraq less than 48 hours from their Sunday night show time was itself evidence of the bit of open - mindedness the show 's producers obviously retained even at that late date .
It would be interesting , if the tapes of the interview still exist somewhere at 60 Minutes , to listen to them now .
Maybe I just did n't sound authoritative enough .
A guy like Cheney not only had all the power but he always spoke in the most authoritative way , as if he knew everything for sure .
How much was due to the fact I was a GS - 14 " nobody " on a straight path to GS - 13 " nobody " ?
But credibility is n't exactly the same thing as power .
I had been proven correct about the mistakes leading to 9/11 and the fact that 9/11 might have been prevented .
My concerns about invading Iraq would all prove pretty much correct too ( unfortunately ) .
It 's impossible to overstate how bad and how powerful the deception by those in control of the government could be .
Certainly much of what I observed and disclosed was available for many others to see and say but almost nobody did .
I probably would n't have gone to these lengths either , had I not witnessed and suffered through what happened on 9/11 and reproached myself for not having done more , even if it meant acting above my pay grade .
Did the effort at " perception management " by those in power simply trump reality and substance ?
The Iraq War lead - up presented an unusual situation because most of the mainstream media was duped , self - censoring or actively helping the Bush Administration sell the deception .
The media had most of the facts or access to most of the facts themselves .
But only a small segment , a really small segment of reporters were reporting the facts .
Bill Moyers has since interviewed a number of them , including the late Tim Russert , in a program called " Buying the War " .
The stories by the small handful of news reporters who got it right were either buried or did not get wide circulation .
Only a few people with credibility and the ability to get a bit of air time and / or get an op - ed published were speaking out : Scott Ritter , Joe Wilson , Jimmy Carter .
So it was a classic " Emperor Has No Clothes " situation , but there was just no little boy who could yell loud enough .
The 9/11 lapses had allowed Bush to wield more power over his entourage , including the FBI , CIA and other government agencies so they too were forced to applaud their naked emperor 's march .
What 's worse is that the trends towards ' perception ' mattering more than substance ; personal power and ' info - tainment potential ' over accuracy ; and ' selling ' over objective insights did not end with Bush ( and Karl Rove 's ) departure .
Powerful neo-con columnists like William Kristol at the NY Times and Charles Krauthammer at the Washington Post never looked back and still frame most of the leading national news coverage despite having been wrong on everything .
Even Paul Wolfowitz is regularly published .
In other words , they are still selling their invisible garments .
I think it would be good to ask , if nothing else , for 60 Minutes to keep the tapes , if they still have them , to contribute to efforts by historians who will try , at some future point , to figure out how such a naked emperor was able to continue despite some of us who tried to yell .

But it has n't been only the French .
Uneducated Brits pride themselves on hating abroad and all who come therefrom .

It probably has a lot to do with drink .

The development of science and technology has procured solutions to many sufferings that human beings had to endure when there was no proper medical diagnosis or treatment for the sufferings .
Today , advanced medical science has the solution for every type of problems or sufferings that a human being has to face irrespective of age or gender .
If we take up the case of excessive sweating then a few years back people took it as a natural problem and endured the problems related to excessive sweating by using temporary methods of reducing the sweating for few hours .
However , in this modern age medical experts have succeeded in obtaining a solution to the problem of excessive sweating as they have discovered a drug called Botox ..
London Botox Clinics provides long - term relief from Palmar Hyperhidrosis which means excessive sweating on the palms of the hands .
Botox is an injection that is prepared from the extract taken from botulinum toxin and the toxin has the capacity to reduce the sweating for a long duration when injected in the skin covering those areas where excessive sweating takes place .
Botox treatment is best for those people , who have tried all other methods of treatment for reducing Palmar Hyperhidrosis , but did not get fruitful result .
However , there is one drawback in treating Palmar Hyperhidrosis with Botox .
That is , the pain in the hand a person has to endure when Botox administration takes place in the palm of the hands with the help of an injection .
Along with that , there is the problem of developing muscle weakness during the treatment phase with Botox so most of the people do not prefer to undergo this treatment .
Nevertheless , there is a solution to every type of problem ; medical experts have found the solution for eradicating the intense pain while treating patients suffering from Palmar Hyperhidrosis .
The latest method that they have developed for providing painless treatment is the use of the Dermojet Promedical device with the help of which painless administration of botox in London clinics has become a practical possibility .
The Dermojet Promedical device is painless as the syringe used for injecting the medicine does not have any type of needle yet the appliance has the facility of injecting all type of liquids in the body with the help of a process called intradermic projection .
This process eliminates the use of the needle that is normally used for injecting any type of liquid medicine in the body moreover , in this process the injection does not make any contact with the patient ’s skin so it has proved to be relatively painless method of injecting Botox in London for the treatment of Palmar Hyperhidrosis .
The Dermojet Promedical device has four models used for different purposes .
Therefore , if you have to take twenty or thirty injections in the palm of your hands of local anesthetic there will be very little marks on your palm , neither will you have the problem of bearing all the pain and other problems that you had imagined with the use of ordinary syringe .
Results Of Our Preliminary Tests With The Device :
– Though anaesthesia is easily achieved in the areas of the palm required there is a drawback to the use of this device .
The skin in the palms is quite thicker than other areas on the body and hence with the pressure administered by the device the drug( anaesthetic ) does n’t just diffuse through the skin but causes minor splits in the skin which are not really noted at the time but once the anaesthesia has worn of it is tender for upto 24 hours .
We are still testing the device in the palms with other applicator heads ( with three and five holes ) to see if it causes less skin splitting .
Article 548 was abolished by Bashar al - Assad 's presidential decree
Syria has scrapped a law limiting the length of sentences handed down to men convicted of killing female relatives they suspect of having illicit sex .
Women 's groups had long demanded that Article 548 be scrapped , arguing it decriminalised " honour " killings .
Activists say some 200 women are killed each year in honour cases by men who expect lenient treatment under the law .
The new law replaces the existing maximum sentence of one year in jail with a minimum jail term of two years .
Justice Minister Ahmad Hamoud Younis said the change was made by the decree of President Bashar al - Assad , following a recent increase in " wife- killings ... on the pretext of adultery " .
The new law says a man can still benefit from extenuating circumstances in crimes of passion or honour " provided he serves a prison term of no less than two years in the case of killing " .
The legislation covers any man who " unintentionally " kills his wife , sister , daughter or mother after catching her committing adultery or having unlawful sex .
It also covers cases where the woman 's lover is killed .
Reports say women 's rights activists have given a cautious welcome to the change , with one group calling it a " small contribution to solving the problem " .
Their objection remains , however , that the new law still apparently invites men to murder women if they catch them having sex or suspect them of doing so .
India :
Gay sex is not a crime
A Delhi court has ratified that homosexual sex between two adults is not a criminal offense , as long as the act comes with consent from both parties .
Sexual intercourse between two people of the same sex was punishable in India with a 10 - year prison sentence , according to a colonial law dating back 148 years that declares it as an “ unnatural offense “ .
The new ruling nullifies that .
The court ruled that laws that condemned homosexual acts were discriminatory , and “ violated human rights “ .
India has long been known to be largely discriminatory and persecutive of homosexuals , and human rights activists see this new motion to be the first step in a more liberal India .
A troupe of morris dancers were prevented from performing at a school because they blacken their faces , they said today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Members of Motley Morris group , who are based in Dartford , Kent , smear black make - up across their faces as part of their traditional costume .
They were meant to perform their routine at Chantry Primary School in Gravesend on Friday but were asked not to attend due to fears they could cause offence .
Spokesman Simon
Ford said today : " Our style of morris dancing originates from the Welsh / Shropshire borders .
" Our blackened faces are a form of disguise .
Traditionally they used burnt cork , which came out black , but if it had come out red then we would have had red faces , that 's all it is .
" It 's part of our English culture which goes back hundreds of years , it 's an age - old tradition . "
Speaking of the cancelled booking at the school , he said : " We were n't too impressed by it .
" They said it was supposed to be a cultural evening but they had n't even bothered to find out why it is we have blackened faces .
" They 're obviously afraid of upsetting someone . "
Motley Morris squire Peter Hargreaves said the school asked the men if they would perform without blackened faces but they refused .
He also admitted that it was the third event that had been cancelled this year , but this was still only the third time in the group 's 28 - year history .
Chantry Primary School headteacher Hazel King said she had been faced with a " damned if we do , damned if we do n't scenario " .
She said : " We organised the event to bring a diverse and fragile community together .

" To celebrate all cultures we booked a morris troupe having failed to recognise the possible significance for our community of their tradition to perform with blackened faces and for this we sincerely apologise .
" We found ourselves in a difficult position of weighing up any potential offence versus not wishing to compromise the morris dancers ' tradition .
" It 's a ' damned if we do , damned if we do n't ' scenario and quite understandably it will be a talking point as to the rights and wrongs of our decision .
" I apologise to the morris troupe for any inconvenience caused and ask for people 's understanding at what was a difficult but well intended decision . "

" Go Forth And Multiply ! "
That 's what the human population has successfully been doing for thousands and thousands of years , expanding , exploring , migrating , conquering , utilizing , evolving , civilizing , industrializing , and now , destroying the very land upon which we live .
Many feel ( as has been the case throughout history ) that the major international wars to be fought in the future will continue to be over natural resources .
Power conflicts and self - interest will perhaps mean that there will be gross violation of basic rights and death or misery for millions of innocent people .
Throughout history , most wars have had trade and resources at their core ( leading to ideological battles ) fueled by imperialistic motives .
In the future , while this pattern is likely to continue , as resources get depleted and wasted in these wars ( hot and cold ) , additional conflicts and contention will arise through access to even more limited resources .
Many of us have grown up learning and being told that 6 billion is too much and this " over population " is primarily impacting the planet 's ability to cope .
But is that really the case ?
Sure , the planet is facing incredible stress .
But how much of that is due to large populations , and how much is based on other factors , such as how we choose to live , how we produce , consume and waste our resources ?
The poor are numerous , but as we shall see , consume far less resources of the planet , for example .
Studies point to ecological limits to sustain people , but these limits can be different , based on the way we consume resources etc so it is hard to say for sure what over population means let alone if we are at some threshold , below , or above it .
The information understood so far provides valuable insights and is very important to consider , nonetheless .
Yet , the figure of 6 billion and literature about over - population naturally looks to the poor regions where there are high populations and environmental degradation as the problem .
In the poverty section of this web site , we see numerous causes of poverty , and many are found in unfair economic and trade agreements from wealthier nations and institutions .
While it might be an oversimplification to say the poor are victims , a lot of poverty , if not the majority is caused by factors which the poor themselves often have no control or choice over .
Yet , at the same time the poor seem to get the blame for burdening the planet .
Is this the case ?
While the concern for the environment and the planet 's health is usually the central issue here , is there a risk of addressing the issue in ways that may not get to the root causes of any problems that are perceived to require serious attention ?
This section of the globalissues.org web site attempts to look at and introduce some of these issues .

Populations : A Numbers Game Last updated Sunday , September 02 , 2001 .
The human population of the planet is estimated to now have passed 6 billion people .
But are large numbers themselves a problem ?
Europe for example , has higher population densities than Asia .
There are more than two sides to the debate on whether population numbers equate to over - population or not .

Population and Feeding the World Last updated Monday , July 09 , 2001 .
The food scarcity part of the argument in the population debate is an interesting one -- people are hungry not because the population is growing so fast that food is becoming scarce , but because people cannot afford it .
Food may be scarce , but it is international trade , economic policies and the control of land that have lead to immense poverty and hunger and therefore less access to food , not food scarcity due to over population .

Stress on the environment , society and resources ?
Last updated Tuesday , September 18 , 2001 .
Does population affect and put stress on the environment , society and resources ?
Existing consumption patterns as seen in Europe and North America can put strain on the environment and natural resources .
But how much of the environmental degradation we see today is as a result of over - population and how much is due to over - exploitation due to consumerism and geopolitical interests ?
Especially when considering that " [ g] lobally , the 20 % of the world 's people in the highest - income countries account for 86 % of total private consumption expenditures - the poorest 20 % a minuscule 1.3 % " , according to the United Nations Development Programme 's 1998 Human Development Report .

Other Issues Affect and Get Affected by Population Last updated Saturday , May 05 , 2001 .
How do human rights , conflict , trade / development patterns , and the environment come into all this ?
Poverty is the number one health problem , in developing and developed nations alike .
Structural Adjustment policies , for example , from the IMF have not helped in many situations as social expenditure has had to be cut back .
This has led to less investment in health , education and other basic services ( things that have led to a better quality of life in Europe after the second world war ) .
Coupled with corrupt rulers and dictators , often backed by the powerful nations , due to national geopolitical interests , a large number of people have suffered .

Effects of Over-Consumption and Increasing Populations Last updated Wednesday , September 26 , 2001 .
The State of the World , 1999 Report from the Worldwatch Institute suggests that the global economy could be seriously affected by environmental problems , such as the lack of access to enough resources to meet growing population demands .
Environmental degradation can contribute to social and political instability , which can lead to security issues .
This has not currently been addressed by the foreign policy of many nations .
Already around the world we are seeing an increase in violence and human rights abuses as disputes about territories , food and water are spilling into wars and internal conflicts .

Gender and Population Issues Last updated Wednesday , June 13 , 2001 .
By ensuring women 's rights can be upheld , and realizing that women play a crucial role in the development of society , many underlying issues which lead to conflict and problems can be tackled more effectively .
Better care , education and rights for women mean that children should also benefit .
This can eventually allow a society to enjoy more rights and the society can be enriched .
Yet these very same provisions are being cut back , oftentimes as a result of harsh structural adjustment policies imposed by the IMF .

Thanks to the many who responded to my survey on comp.lang.lisp and on my blog .
It seems like more than 80 % of the more than 60 people who responded do not avoid using the same names for variables and functions .
The original statement that inspired the survey was posted to the arc forum a few days ago .
Five Reasons to Watch the 2009 Belmont
The 141st running of the Belmont Stakes takes place today ( post time is at 6:30 ET ) and although 2009 Preakness winner Rachel Alexandra wo n’t run , there are still plenty of intriguing storylines surrounding this year ’s annual race from Belmont Park in Elmont , New York .
Here are five of them .
1. Calvin Borel ’s quest for his own Triple Crown .
Not many people outside of the horse racing world had ever heard the name Calvin Borel before the 2009 Kentucky Derby , but the jockey started gaining a name for himself after riding 50/1 long shot Mine That Bird to victory at Churchill Downs .
Then , when the opportunity presented itself a couple weeks after the Derby , Borel once again was the winning jockey , this time riding 3 - year old filly Rachel Alexandra to victory at the Preakness Stakes .
With Rachel Alexandra skipping the Belmont , Borel has again hitched a ride on Mine That Bird and if he wins today at the Belmont , he would become the first jockey since Steve Cauthen in 1978 to win the Triple Crown .
A win would also make him only the second individual to win the Triple Crown by sweeping the three legs in one year while riding different horses .
( The other being D. Wayne Lukas , a trainer , in 1995 . )
2. Mine That Bird continues his amazing season .
Entering the 2009 Kentucky Derby , Mine That Bird was a 50/1 long shot to win .
But thanks to a sloppy track , this powerful horse was able to claim victory at Churchill Downs and turned the horse racing world on its head .
( At least for this season , that is . )
Even though he won the Derby , many people were convinced that the poor track conditions at Churchill Downs played a major factor in Mine That Bird ’s victory .
Therefore , Rachel Alexandra was made the odds favorite to win the 2009 Preakness and even though the 3 - year old filly won , Mine That Bird gained respect by finishing second at Pimlico .
Now that Rachel Alexandra is out for the Belmont , Mine That Bird is once again a favorite and with a victory , he should at least gain some notoriety as one of the best thoroughbred racehorses of 2009 .
3 . Watch out for the dark horse ( no pun intended ) .
One horse to keep an eye on today to play spoiler at the Belmont is Charitable Man ( 5/1 ) .
He has the next best odds to win today behind Mine That Bird and for good reason – he ’s undefeated so far at Belmont Park and also undefeated on dirt tracks .
Charitable Man was bred to race on one and a half mile tracks like the one he ’ll run on today at Belmont Park and he ’s also fresh , which is one thing Mine That Bird cannot say after racing in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness .
Nobody is going to consider him a long shot today at 3/1 odds , but if you ’re looking for a horse to upset Mine That Bird at the Belmont , Charitable Man could be your thoroughbred .
4. Flying Private : The Ultimate Long Shot ?
One long shot that is creating a buzz is Flying Private , who has already faced stiff competition at the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and could be a potential sleeper to give Mine That Bird a run for his money .
At 18/1 odds , Flying Private certainly is n’t the type of long shot that Mine That Bird ( 50/1 ) was when he won the Kentucky Derby , but then again odds makers are n’t handing out those kinds of odds today anyway .
( The horse with the longest odds to win today is Luv Gov at 25/1 . )
After a lackluster 19th place finish at the Kentucky Derby , Flying Private seemingly came out of nowhere to finish fourth at the Preakness Stakes and that could mean he ’s prime to make another leap at the Belmont today .
He certainly has the experience and while he might not be as fresh as some of the other horses , Flying Private has already squared off against Mine That Bird twice and therefore he could be your best shot at cashing in on a long shot .
5 . This is the finale , so eat it up while you can .
The Belmont is the third and final leg of horse racing ’s Triple Crown , so soak up the action while you can .
While this year ’s Belmont certainly lacks the excitement of last year when Big Brown was going for the Triple Crown , there are still plenty of reasons to watch today .
Enjoy the race and if you ’ve decided to throw a few coins down today , good luck .

Is defense reform a lost cause ?
To answer that question , MoJo talked to defense experts , mined years of GAO reports and congressional testimony , and found that the same themes crop up again and again .
Here are the main problems that defense reforms almost always fail to truly address :
The Pentagon does n’t know where its money goes .
In fact , its accounting systems are so spectacularly busted that it ’s impossible to even conduct an audit of the agency , which has been on the Government Accountability Office ’s high - risk list since 1995 .
Its computer programs are prehistoric and do n’t connect the money that comes in with the money that goes out .
There is no reliable way to detect when contractors are overbilling .
DOD ’s various agencies and services maintain 2,480 different systems to manage procurement , finances , and logistics , many of which are n’t interlinked .
Often , reams of vital data must be entered by hand .
All of this creates myriad possibilities for fraud and abuse .
Over the past few decades , the government has spent billions to modernize the DOD ’s bookkeeping , but to no avail .
Consequently , no one really knows for sure how much the Pentagon has spent , is spending , or should spend on weapons .
Instead , the government essentially relies on information from private contractors to make budget decisions .
A report by the Defense Science Board Task Force on Developmental Test and Evaluation found that between 1997 and 2006 , 67 percent of Army systems flunked testing requirements , yet many were put into development anyway .
The notion that the Pentagon should “ try before it buys ” has been on the books since at least the 1970s , but DOD officials and Congress have never properly enforced it .
For all Robert Gates ’ encouraging talk about reform , he is set to make the same mistake by fast - tracking production of the F - 35 .
Military brass often order up futuristic equipment that is fantastically complicated — ” exquisite , ” in Pentagon parlance — but scientifically unproven .
The Pentagon routinely enters into contracts based on hopelessly unrealistic cost and schedule estimates .
This is n’t just the contractor ’s fault .
Military officials have a powerful incentive to sign off on lowball estimates , because if they revealed the true cost at the outset , they ’d never get their dream toys .
Every once in a while Congress or the White House will demand a new office to produce independent cost estimates , but it ’s extremely difficult to make such initiatives genuinely independent because of the cozy relationship between Pentagon officials and the defense industry .
And in recent years , this relationship got a lot cozier as the department has relaxed conflict of interest rules for Pentagon officials who move on to the private sector .
In 2006 , 2,435 former DOD officials , generals , and contract staff were employed by defense contractors , and at least 400 of those may have worked on contracts directly related to their former agencies .
There are no consequences for screwing up .
When contractors run years behind schedule and billions over budget , they still get paid .
By law , Congress must be notified about programs that run 30 percent over budget , and programs costing more than 50 percent must be recertified or terminated , but lawmakers grant exceptions as a matter of routine .
The best way to get a sense of the monumental task facing President Obama and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates is to look at the special commissions , reform initiatives , and tough new laws that Washington has been churning out ever since the Pentagon was created .
Some of these measures did more harm than good , others never got off the ground , and still others remain on the books but are rarely , if ever , enforced .
Here ’s a brief but sorry history of DOD “ reform ” :
1949 : The landmark Hoover Commission exposes rampant waste at the Pentagon .
1961 : President Dwight D. Eisenhower warns of the growing might of the “ military industrial complex ” in his last speech as commander in chief .
He originally wanted to say “ military industrial congressional complex , ” but aides talked him out of it .
1971 : The Fitzhugh Commission enlists Pentagon official David Packard to help fix the contracting process .
He offers the groundbreaking conclusion that the services should “ fly before you buy . ”
The DOD establishes a testing office to make sure that weapons are fully developed before they are purchased .
The office is later found to be ineffective , because industry interests were allowed to help design the tests .
1980s : Some good news : Congress overhauls government contracting , requiring competitive bidding , accurate cost assessments , and accounting oversight .
The bad news :
Over the next two decades these reforms get watered down by numerous loopholes .
1981 : No. 2 at the DOD , Frank Carlucci , introduces 32 initiatives to encourage more realistic cost estimates and increased competition among contractors .
Carlucci also wants Congress to pay more for big programs up front rather than putting off the bulk of the expense for future years .
( Any of this sound familiar ? )
However , his suggestions have their own shortcomings , the most glaring of which is that the Pentagon relies on contractors for estimates rather than producing its own .
1982 : Nunn-McCurdy Amendment orders termination of programs whose total costs have grown by more than 25 percent over original estimates .
However , Congress routinely makes exceptions at the secretary of defense ’s request .
Today nearly half of the DOD ’s big weapons programs are in breach of the law .
1985 : David Packard put in charge of another commission , discovers that nothing has changed at the Pentagon since the first one .
After measures to “ streamline ” acquisitions are introduced , cost overruns on Air Force and development contracts more than triple .
1990s - 2000s : Numerous “ innovations ” are made to Pentagon purchasing .
See : the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act , the Federal Acquisition Improvement Act , the Acquisition Streamlining Task Force , Total System Performance Responsibility , and the spiral development and capabilities - based acquisition initiatives .
But do n’t worry about keeping all the names straight .
The salient fact to remember about this spurt of reform is that the number of acquisitions staffers , who oversee big , complex contracts , gets drastically reduced and the budget for their operations slashed .
Much of this valuable work is outsourced to the private sector .
At the Missile Defense Agency , for instance , private contractors now comprise 49 percent of the workforce charged with monitoring private contracts .
The late 1990s and Bush administration years also see the increasing use of “ lead systems integrator ” deals .
That ’s the technical term for an arrangement in which private industry teams not only design and build lucrative weapons systems , but also oversee all the contracting .
Unsurprisingly , this setup produces some spectacular cases of waste and abuse , including Future Combat Systems .
2009 : The White House promises to employ 20,000 more staffers over the next five years to keep track of contracts and spending — a welcome move , although it will be several years before it bears fruit .
In addition , Armed Services Committee members Carl Levin and John McCain sponsor the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 .
The legislation initially looks promising , but some critical measures get weakened by the time it reaches Obama ’s desk .
For instance , although the law now promises to terminate any programs that violate the Nunn - McCurdy requirement , it does n’t outlaw exemptions for national security purposes .
You can guess what ’s going to happen to that provision .
The law also establishes an office of Independent Cost Assessment — but it does n’t cover all weapons programs .
The first director of the new office , by the way , is William Lynn , a former lobbyist for defense - supplier Raytheon .
Special Report : Shock & Audit
Over the last few years , Microsoft 's chief executive Steve Ballmer has made a number of highly contentious claims that Linux uses " our " - meaning Microsoft's - " intellectual property " , and infringes as many as 235 Microsoft patents .
Last week it was revealed that Microsoft had filed an action for patent infringement against TomTom , the Dutch manufacturer of Linux - based GPS navigation systems , and many have seen this move as the opening skirmish in a coming patent war .
Although the action is n't against Linux , it is implicated in two of the eight patents for which the claim is made .
These two US patents , # 5,579,517 and # 5,758,352 , bear the titles " Common name space for long and short filenames " , and are specific to the Microsoft FAT ( File Allocation Table ) file system .
FAT claims
FAT was the file system for DOS and Windows 9 x and became the standard file format for digital devices .
Nobody would pretend that FAT represents any great technical accomplishment or innovation .
FAT is used for digital devices and SD cards because it provides interoperability with Windows , and interoperability with Windows has been essential to the manufacturers of such devices because Microsoft has owned the desktop .
FAT is also used by Samba which is used by most Linux and Unix distributions to provide full file client and server interoperability with Windows networks .
A Linux utility dosfstools is used by TomTom to transfer files between SD cards and Linux - based GPS navigation systems .
A quarter of them also had to retake the numeracy test – up from 19 per cent in 2000 – while 13 per cent needed at least three attempts before they managed to pass a counting test .
The simple literacy test , which last year asked trainees to spell the words ‘ following ’ , ‘ formally ’ , ‘ preference ’ and ‘ acknowledge ’ , had to be retaken by one in five would - be teachers , which was more than three times the failure rate back in 2000 .
Yesterday Michael Gove , the Shadow Schools Secretary , pledged that a future Conservative government would raise teaching standards .
He said : “ It is vital children have the best teachers available .
It is very worrying that so many more trainees are having to repeat these tests .
We want the most talented people to be encouraged to enter the profession .
“ We want a new generation of maths and science teachers in primary school and secondary school .
At the moment , trainee teachers can re-sit the basic literacy and numeracy tests , which are the gateway to the profession , an infinite number of times .
Shoreview , Minn. , is betting on a new " green " concrete paving method that lets rainwater pass right through the street surface to prevent damaging runoff .
Pervious concrete _ made of gravel and cement minus the sand that gives regular concrete its impenetrable density _ has the porous quality of a Rice Krispies bar .
Because it will allow water to drain straight to the ground below , Shoreview will install about a mile of pervious concrete streets without storm sewers in a neighborhood on Lake Owasso .
This $ 1 million , all - in bet on the new pavement technology has many cities looking over Shoreview 's shoulder , wondering whether they might try the same approach .
" This is the first complete commitment to using a pervious pavement on a residential street replacement " in Minnesota , said Shoreview Public Works Director Mark Maloney .
Over the past five years , other Minnesota cities , including Minneapolis and Richfield , have been experimenting with pervious concrete on parking lots and other hard surfaces , hoping for better storm - water management .
But in Shoreview , " We are completely replacing a storm drainage system with a pavement that will infiltrate " water to the ground , Maloney said .
Tests " have shown that it is as durable as standard concrete for low - volume roads , " Maloney said .
" The science behind that is very sound and supported . "
But there are few examples of a local government saying " this is going to be our pavement in lieu of a sewer system , " he said .
" We wo n't have catch basins , pipes and ( settling ) ponds . "
Cities are finding that piping storm water to settling ponds eventually fills the ponds with sediment that has to be dredged out and disposed of as toxic material , Maloney said .
If there is an alternative that lets soil naturally filter out pollutants as rain soaks into the ground , cities are keenly interested , he said .
That possibility sold the Shoreview City Council on the project .
Some residents questioned how the unusual pavement would look and how it would perform under severe weather conditions .
They also asked how it might feel to someone who fell off a bike onto the surface .
Despite such questions , council members were eager to use the pavement to protect nearby Lake Owasso , whose water quality has been declining .
" This community is very nicely positioned on Lake Owasso , and currently the storm water from the street just washes directly into the lake , " said Mayor Sandy Martin .
" For years , some of the people who live near the discharge have asked the city to create a holding pond or a way to divert the water before it goes into the lake , carrying salt and sand and oil and all those things .
But there is no land available in this neighborhood to create any kind of a holding pond . "
Because the soil under the street has the high sand content that would promote the desired drainage , " We thought this would be the perfect opportunity to use the pervious concrete , " Martin said .
Pervious concrete has been in use in Minnesota on a limited basis for about five years , said John Lee , an engineer and sales manager for Cemstone , a Mendota Heights , Minn . - based concrete supplier for the Midwest , which will supply pervious concrete to Shoreview .
The Minnesota Department of Transportation , working with the Aggregate Ready Mix Association , began studying pervious concrete in 2005 on a driveway , sidewalk and road test strips at its MnROAD research center at Albertville .
Although MnDOT is still evaluating its performance , " We think , based on the tests at Albertville , that it can be made freeze - thaw durable , " Lee said .
The original theory was that snow and ice would build up in the pores of the pervious concrete and tear it apart during the freeze - thaw cycle , Lee said .
But the pavement design includes a layer of aggregate under the pervious layer that stores water while it filters into the ground .
" The whole point is that you do n't have ice and water building up in the pervious concrete itself .
It is designed to be free - draining . "
Making it work also requires using an aggregate that does not break down with freezing and thawing and a cement paste that also stands up to the cold , he said .
Because of these requirements , pervious concrete is a third to 50 percent more expensive than regular concrete , Lee said .
" But now you have a pavement that is not only a pavement but also a storm - water management system . "
Pervious concrete requires special installation and maintenance .
Keeping its pores open for optimum draining requires monthly vacuuming with a special air - brush street - sweeper .
Shoreview plans to buy one to handle the job .
The concrete installation also requires special skill and experience because the concrete comes from the mixer stiff and dry , and must be worked into place with minimal handling to keep the voids open .
It also must be allowed to cure slowly under a membrane that holds in moisture .
" If it dries out too quickly and does n't gain the strength it needs , then you get little pieces of rock popping off , " Maloney said .
Shoreview set rigid requirements for installation and rejected three of six of bids for the contract because the companies lacked experience with pervious concrete , Maloney said .
The winning bid was slightly more than $ 1 million .
Work is expected to be completed by fall .
Representatives are going to be watching the project as well , making sure it is installed properly and using it as a training ground , Maloney said .
The Ramsey Conservation District also will be watching .
Four wells will be sunk when the streets are built , so it can monitor how drainage through the pavement affects the level and purity of the area 's groundwater .

What You Need to Know About Colon Cancer
Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer - related deaths .
Because colon cancer progresses very slowly , it may go undetected for several years – and because of low detection rates , it is responsible for thousands of deaths every year .
Many symptoms of colon cancer are often interpreted as other conditions , making colon cancer screening critical for accurate diagnosis .
While scary , colon cancer can best be treated when detected early , and in cases where patients have pre-cancerous polyps , the detection and removal of these lesions can effectively PREVENT the development of cancer – which is why we believe it ’s critical to always visit your doctor with any colorectal health concerns .
Detecting colorectal cancer
The most effective means of detecting colorectal cancer in its early stages is through colonoscopy .
These tests will help your doctor determine whether or not you are suffering from the disease , or if you have changes which , if left alone could develop into a cancer .
If it is caught in the early stages , the prognosis is very good for treatment .
If you age 45 or older , you are at an increased risk .
You should have a colonoscopy at least once every 10 years , with examinations more frequently in certain circumstances .

You should have a colonoscopy at least once every 10 years , with examinations more frequently in certain circumstances .
If you have a family history of colon or other forms of cancer , more frequent scopes may be recommended .
of colon or other forms of cancer , more frequent scopes may be recommended .
Certain patients with rectal bleeding or other colorectal symptoms should have colonoscopy in order to help rule out precancerous or cancerous lesions as the cause of these symptoms .
You should talk with your doctor to see if you are a candidate for colonoscopy and a colorectal screening .
About Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal cancer is typically felt to develop within certain types of polyps which commonly develop in the colon and rectum .
If left unchecked , these polyps can develop into cancers which can become quite large before they can be detected , and which may spread to lymph nodes , the liver , and to other structures .
Since the symptoms early on in the disease are minimal , many patients do n’t know they are affected until the disease has progressed substantially .
A screening colonoscopy can often find these lesions at an early stage , increasing the likelihood of a successful treatment , or find suspicious polyps before they have developed into cancer .
The removal of these polyps can then effectively prevent the development of cancer !
You can increase your chances of early detection by watching for these important warning signs :
Blood in stool :
This symptom often goes undetected , especially if the blood is dark .
This blood may be traced to a tumor in the colon or rectum , and may vary from being bright red to a very dark maroon color that is almost black .
It is very important to monitor the color and consistency of your stool .

Constipation or changes in bowel activity : Constipation that occurs with regularity , such as more than three times a week , is an indication that there may be a blockage in the bowel .
Narrowing of the stool is another warning sign .
Any sudden change in bowel habits that cannot be attributed to diet or exercise modification should be evaluated .

Anemia :
This is frequently the result of a tumor that is bleeding into the intestinal tract .
It may cause weakness or dizziness and is quite common .
Unexplained anemia that cannot be traced to another source should be investigated .
Sometimes patients mistake the signs of colon cancer for hemorrhoids , or vice - versa .
That ’s why accurate diagnosis is essential .
If you are concerned about these symptoms , find a physician now .

La décision a de quoi surprendre : d'après le Parisien , Voltalis , un fabricant de boîtiers permettant d'économiser de l'électricité , a été condamné à verser une taxe à EDF , qui se plaint de perdre de l'argent à cause de cette technologie .
Le boîtier de Voltalis se fixe entre le compteur EDF et le tableau électrique et se commande depuis Internet .
L'utilisateur peut par exemple couper en temps réel le chauffage ou la climatisation afin de faire fondre sa facture .
EDF avait déposé une requête devant la Commission de régulation de l’énergie ( CRE ) afin de récupérer « une rémunération de l’énergie effacée » par Voltalis .
Du côté de la start - up crée en 2007 , on crie au scandale .
La taxe pourrait s'élever à 70 - 80 % des revenus de l'entreprise , autrement dit un gouffre .
« C ’est une décision contraire à la mission de la CRE de servir les intérêts du consommateur , contraire au Grenelle de l’environnement et contraire aux lois du marché car elle constitue une entrave à la concurrence » , estime le PDG Pierre Bivas .

Columbus Day almost killed me .
I woke up avalanched under a junkyard of pain , my body a trap of torn nerves and trashed organs .
An oily rash of sweat had soaked through my pillow and into the mattress .
I was coughing , confused and crazy with anger .
A throbbing , deep - pink chemical sunburn covered my face ; my bowels were spitting hot mercury .
I slid out of bed and dropped to the floor , the weight of a snarling mountain gorilla bearing down on me .
I saw myself in the mirror as I fell .
I looked puffy .
Outside , the sun was terrifying , while the hiss from a neighbor 's dancing sprinkler got in my head and pissed me off so much , it felt as though my blood had become flammable and would ignite at the next insult .
I made it to the car and somehow drove one block down to the mailbox , expecting the Priority Mail package from my eBay dealer to save me .
Nothing .
I hobbled into the car and drove back to the house , used the bathroom and looked on the computer .
The U.S. Postal Service
Web site tracker verified that my box of poppies had been delivered to Reno at exactly 10:32 a.m .
Well , where the hell was it ?
I typed a threatening e-mail to my supplier but did n't send it .
Then I got back into the car , reeling and jumpy , went back and opened the mailbox .
Nothing .
I closed it .
Locked it .
Waited a second and then stuck the key in and opened it back up .
Still not there .
I got back in the car and decided to wait it out .
My head whirled with psychic errata -- miscalculations in the synapses .
As though faced with gravity for the very first time , I struggled to hold the horizon line , like an infant with an iron skull .
I wanted to ram my head straight into the dashboard but feared the airbag might blow and deliver the knockout punch .
Or , worse , I 'd miss and hit the damn horn .
Everything hurt , but the pain came in slow motion and actually seemed to stop to register with each and every nerve .
My pulse rattled , and my heart seemed to sizzle .
Maybe my package had been intercepted by the Drug Enforcement Administration .
Good , I thought .
Maybe they 'll be able to get me off this stupid homemade junk .
I sat there for less than a minute .
Maybe I sat there for an hour ; I do n't know .
But something had to be done .
I stuck some Klonopin under my tongue and drove to the post office , expecting to turn myself in .
Give up .
Take the 15 years , if they would just give me the fix .
But the door was stuck .
I pushed , pulled .
It would n't budge .
No , it was locked .
Closed for Columbus Day .
Columbus Day .
No wonder everyone hated him .
That tabard - wearing bastard had been dead for 500 years and was still causing trouble .
I took a dozen allergy pills to make me drowsy but could n't sleep .
I lay awake in bed for the next two days before the shipment finally arrived .
The postman had decided to make a long weekend out of the cheap - ass holiday .
I should 've stayed in bed and ridden it out .
I had put a price on my head in the form of a box - a - day addiction but already had endured the worst part of the withdrawal : the first 48 hours .
But then the box arrived , and I was a helpless slave .
I ripped it open by its pull string and dumped a dozen poppy pods onto the bed , trying to eat one whole .
I then made a quick , crude tea , drank it and started to feel a rabid glow of health return in seconds .
What had all the fuss been about ?
In better days , I used to crack the dried poppy pods over the blender like eggs , little rivulets of blue - black seeds rushing out as I shattered the crowned pods .
Sometimes , I 'd commandeer the kitchen and make a big production out of the whole thing , as though I was hosting some kind of lowbrow cooking show , doing stupid cockney accents while explaining the preparation process to the viewers .
Start with a clean , chemical - free stock of dried poppy pods .
Pulverize in a blender and scald with water .
Do n't boil .
Do n't burn .
Do n't vaporize .
Just scald .
Blend on low for about a minute , and then add a dash of lemon juice to taste .
Add a cup of fine , aged brandy and then strain through an old T - shirt to remove lingering lumps .
Not only did the brandy serve to recreate that loose - laudanum effect ; a swig satisfied the senses while I waited the few minutes for the infernal teapot to boil .
I had a whole list of fuel additives I 'd researched on the Internet to intensify the tea experience : tyrosine , ascorbic acid , allergy medicine .
After downing a few bowls of tea , I 'd lie down on the bed and watch the ceiling fan spin until my body felt etherized and free again .
Ready for the imminent rapture .
But that was the first phase .
And it did n't last very long .
On a field trip to Washington , D.C. , Nancy Reagan promised us third - graders that there were people in the world who actually wanted nothing more than to give us drugs -- for free !
Free crack .
Free cigarettes and beer .
Free grass .
Free coke .
Free PCP and LSD .
At the time , I remember thinking this notion carried the vague backing of Mr. T .
Back at school , they showed us a video of the circumstances and places these drugs might be obtained : playgrounds , especially while playing kickball ; from ice - cream trucks ; in restrooms at parties .
I played lots of kickball , but no goon in a trench coat ever trapped the ball under his foot and asked me if I wanted to fly .
My friends could n't score a Jolt cola , let alone a bump of nose candy .
It was probably for the best .
Had someone handed me a rock of crack , I think I would 've put it in my mouth and eaten it .
I could n't even get a beer .
And New Year 's was coming up .
One place to get free stuff was the library .
My mother dropped me off like it was day care , me and the damn bums .
I looked for books with naked people .
I read through investment magazines .
Finally , I found the fiction section and a book called Beowulf .
I liked it .
The Vikings drank this stuff called " mead . "
It was an alcoholic drink made from honey .
I looked in the card catalog and found a book on mead .
It even showed how to make it .
I was 12 .
The librarian had her hair full keeping the bums from falling asleep on the newspapers .
She stamped my books and sent me away .
The recipe seemed simple enough .
I rode my bike to the supermarket and bought a bear - shaped jar of honey and some Fleischmann 's yeast .
I kept my mead in a pair of empty plastic Coke bottles .
Every day , I 'd have to twist the cap off and release the carbon dioxide , or the stuff would explode .
On New Year 's Eve , I poured my first glass .
It was warm , almost hot .
It was n't sweet at all - - it tasted like some kind of milky lard .
I could n't drink it at first , but I made myself chug the stuff .
I 'm not sure what happened , but all of a sudden it was dark outside , I thought I heard Dick Clark talking about his balls , and I could n't stand up .
Because my neighborhood had failed me with its lack of blight , I began to see the supermarket and drugstore as potential drug dealers .
I drank bottles of cough syrup before I knew what dextromethorphan was .
I ate catnip and did n't feel anything .
I ate nutmeg and felt everything .
There was no Internet to guide me and nothing in the library about morning - glory seeds .
My mother just happened to have some Heavenly Blues in the junk drawer .
I had never seen the carpet move like that before .
I tried everything in the medicine aisle and everything in the bulk food hoppers .
I got my first pain pills from my friend 's dead grandmother .
I liked them .
I liked them so much , I started hanging out with my own grandmother , just checking in on her every now and then .
By the time I was driving , I still had n't found out where to get anything stronger than pot on the street .
But they had just opened a whole - foods store about 20 miles away .
Also , there was this damn new thing called the World Wide Web .
There were whole pages on " legal highs . "
I was an opiate man .
At the health - food store , I looked at the huge bins of sesame seeds and fennel seeds and poppy seeds .
The page on legal highs had said that trying to extract opium from poppy seeds was ridiculous .
You needed pounds of the stuff .
I bought pounds of the stuff .
I had them back - ordered and front - ordered at 97 cents a pound .
Per instructions , I boiled some water and slurred the mix around until it poured out in a pale yellow oil .
I added some lemon and forced it down .
Thirty minutes later , I was a poppy plant floating in the vase of my own body .
It felt like I had a headache that did n't hurt , just these pleasant vexations .
Later , I remembered this feeling , this innocent password to paradise .
In college , after a few semesters of spiking needles in my arms and toes before class , my friend Lukas never came back from spring break with the heroin he had promised .
The way they described it , his heart had exploded .
They called it an allergic reaction .
I did n't know what to think except that the greedy bastard had copped my share .
I remember needing a fix but was too scared to shoot up .
The shrink had me on Klonopin for anxiety attacks .
I drank until drinking did n't work .
I tried every drug I could find .
I stole Vicodin from medicine cabinets and kept an open ear for those with upcoming dental work , but the stuff was getting harder and harder to score .
There were online pharmacies on the Internet .
I ordered Tramadol from Mexico and Nurofen Plus with the legal max 12.8 milligrams of codeine per tablet from New Zealand .
Then that got tougher .
Finally , I found eBay .
I had been looking for old motel stationery and fake Jackson Pollock drip paintings .
They sold everything -- why not drugs ?
I typed " poppy pods " into the search bar .
Like anyone trolling the Internet at 4 a.m. , I had been looking for some kind of temporary fix .
I found it on eBay under Crafts > Floral Supplies > Flowers , Foliage > Dried .
Crafting .
Sure .
I liked art .
A query turned up all sizes and quantities of poppies .
Some , called gigantheums , were as big as tennis balls .
A special of " 600 XXL - sized gigantheums " was selling for $ 399 .
Fortunately , for crafting projects requiring so many poppy plants , financing was available for $ 17 per month .
For all of us hard - core flower arrangers , of course .
The recipe was simple enough .
I ordered a few dozen dried flowers from a seller with more than 3,000 positive - feedback points and a clever handle that was a clear double - entendre on horticulture and getting high .
At first , the plants came double - boxed , rubber - banded by the dozen with the stems intact .
But after a few more orders , the seller seemed to cut out the pretense that I might actually be using the poppies for floral arrangements and just sent the pods themselves .
The first taste gave off a steamy insult .
Even after being filtered twice , the manna was as putrid as a bowl of warm pus .
It seemed completely undrinkable .
Its fermented , earthy taste - - a little like a liquid squeezed from gym socks -- had to be chased with something sweet .
The dark grinds of crushed seed and sediment formed a repulsive grit in a half - ring around the bottom of the bowl .
As I poured the slosh into what would become my ceremonial chalice - - a plastic child 's cereal bowl with a built - in silly straw on the side -- I learned how to drink it .
Rather , it seemed to teach me how .
Its nauseating properties demanded that it be downed fast at first , and then titrated for the rest of the session .
Fifteen minutes after downing my first bowl of poppy - pod tea , I entered " Flanders Fields , " from the John McCrae poem :
Where the poppies blow between the crosses , row on row .
Immediately , I felt redeemed .
The raw reel of life became distant , pleasant .
My head was an overstuffed pillow that could softly implode any minute , and it did n't matter .
Nothing could .
A pleasant pressure settled on the back of my neck .
I was snacky .
I wanted sweets .
I felt the promise of a divine massage as the pressure spread through my shoulders and opened my ribs like wings .
My thoughts slowed down until just about everything seemed to fold neatly inside everything else .
I became happily over - focused in the comfortable mud of abstraction and triumph ; immortality bobbed around me like fat peaches in a hot tub .
It was far from the predictable recklessness of alcohol or the silly buzz of marijuana .
I did n't have the lubricated jaws of a chatty coke fiend or the mystical misconceptions of a psychedelic spaceman .
It was quiet up there .
For a while .
Poppy tea seemed to inspire creativity , from conception to actual completion , without any of those time - consuming frat - boy impulses .
It effectively killed the sex drive for the night .
As such , much writing could be done .
A good dose could keep me up all night without that toothless amphetamine tic .
By morning , things tended to irritate me , and the return of the sun seemed an impossibly horrifying affront .
I covered the windows with blankets .
As the original confessional opium - eater , Thomas DeQuincey , put it way back in the September 1821 edition of London Magazine , " Booze is an acute pleasure while opium is a chronic one .
It introduces among the faculties the most exquisite order , legislation , and harmony .
Wine robs a man of his self - possession , opium greatly invigorates it . "
Another thing opium tea slows down is the bowels .
As an experienced pod-head , I learned to carry a Fleet two - pack before any major binge .
( Those are the enemas in the green box . )
Opium bunged things up the way eating a beach towel might .
When things did finally make their exit , they felt like pine cones being forced through a tiny hole in a dry brick .
There was also the cottonmouth .
It was once so bad that it was physically impossible for me to eat a sandwich .
Poppy tea was an extreme beverage for sure , but no more foul than that goofy , green yuppie - goo : wheat grass .
I swallowed the tea a few times .
Then a few more .
By a month , I was drinking the juice of upward of 60 crushed pods per day -- swallowing gallons of liquid and pissing out about $ 300 a week worth of tea matter .
Bowl after bowl of blissful narcotic bloat that I sucked down with a silly straw .
Often , late into a session , I 'd get that uncontrollable opiate itch .
Raking my skin with a giant plastic comb seemed to help .
Occasionally , I 'd bleed or accidentally scrape a piece of a mole right off .
The thing is , heroin gets you addicted to heroin .
But opium is 40 to 50 different alkaloids , meaning 40 to 50 different drugs I was becoming addicted to .
Some nights on the tea , I 'd just lie in bed , content , even cheerful and impossibly satisfied enough to watch my wife read a copy of Lucky magazine , helping her put those little stickers on items she wanted .
Admittedly , slugging down bowl after bowl of plant slop through a silly straw lacked the romance of an opium den or the skinny - tie - and - suit jet - setting of the French Connection ; it did n't have the instant appeal of the smoky red - light pleasures -- the real ensemble pieces of the imagination -- the ones where curly white smoke swirls in slow motion until it takes on the figure of an overly gracious geisha girl in fine red silk .
Poppy tea did n't leave me fashionably thin , either .
In fact , after four months of constant use , I had never been so freaking fat in my life .
I swelled from a size 30 to a 38 in jeans .
I gained 65 pounds , almost exclusively in the middle , from the constipating bloat and junk - food chasers .
While hard drugs collapsed on the user like a broken elevator when they wore off , poppy tea seemed to fade into the next day like a down escalator .
At first .
The chronicles of the opium trade zigzag through early civilizations from Mesopotamia to China and eventually wander to Neolithic southwestern Europe , where groups of early open - minded dump dwellers found the opium poppy plant , papaver somniferum , growing like a weed among piles of refuse .
They soon discovered that not only would the plant seemingly thrive almost anywhere , but , also , when eaten or brewed into a primitive tea , it even took the edge off of living in a dump .
During the 1800s , when the strong painkilling alkaloid morphine was first isolated from the poppy and used in everything from battlefield amputations to snake oils and suspect tonics with names like " Mister Jim's Special Relief for Facial Neuralgia " or " Calmer 's Baby Tonic for Calmer Babies , " the poppy 's use as a tea fell out of practice .
Purified morphine was cheaper than liquor , and a mix of the two , called laudanum , was sold as a kind of cure - all by greedy , apple - cheeked pharmacists everywhere .
Once morphine was processed into brand - name heroin , the use of poppy tea just about came to an end , at least until eBay came onto the scene .
As a modern world - bazaar or world - sized museum of bizarre junk , eBay reconnected well - worn trade routes electronically that had disappeared and grassed over centuries ago .
While becoming a worldwide garage sale , global swap meet and anthropologist 's curio shop , eBay also quite naturally had become the official opium gray market to at least some of the masses .
But it did n't also sell the cure .
It was sometime before sunrise , and I was sitting in a motel in Carson City , Nev .
My wife did n't kick me out .
She did n't even tell me to stop drinking the tea .
There was no ultimatum .
I just packed three huge boxes of poppies in the car with the blender and left .
I did n't tell her where I was going .
I did n't really know .
But that seemed to be where you were likely to end up -- at a cheap motel .
There was some equation there .
I walked a few miles to a grocery store for some lemon juice , Coke and junk food for the binge .
I tried to get the motel tap water running to a boil , but the closest I could get was to put the hand - crushed poppies in the ice bucket and run the shower until steamy water filled it to the brim .
I drank it down in hideous gulps .
The reverie , the calm of my ocean , a measured but strong divine state for silent natural trances .
I was back in the folds of the plant .
I realized I had left because I did n't want to share this experience with anyone .
I reached into the grocery bag and ripped open a three - pack of yellow Easter Peeps .
This was living .
DeQuincey noted that some nights he seemed to live for 70 to 100 years .
This was going to be one of those nights .
As long as I did n't die , at least .
I took a poppy pod out of the box and looked it over .
It was regal , like a birch - colored rose wearing a halo ; a poet could sit and be effusive for days meditating over its near - beauty .
Insulated by the opium and the sumptuousness of a secured motel room , I lay down with hopes of the state between consciousness and sleep .
Suddenly , everything got blurry .
The lights stayed put while my eyes moved .
It was as though they were riding on oily ball joints .
Or were the lights on ball joints ?
My lips shrank , and I could n't talk .
My heart drummed fiercely .
I needed to calm down .
I panicked .
The fear was intense .
My toes wiggled around and got stuck in a cigarette hole in the bottom sheet of the motel bed .
Did I drink too much ?
This was the high - water mark .
I scratched my itches .
Chasing .
Always chasing .
But this time , I was n't catching anything .
I was caught .
I made more tea .
Used more pods than ever before .
I was trying to blast off somewhere .
A few hours later , I had drunk the salt of 200 pods but only felt a kind of necessary doom .
I got out of bed and looked in the mirror to make sure I was still there .
I looked like that mug shot of Nick Nolte , my hair up in the air , pasted in place by sweat and spilled drink .
Tiny poppy seeds were stuck to my shirt .
They were everywhere .
In the bed .
Under my feet .
On the floor .
I turned on the TV .
The news .
Some jackass was trying to sell a body part on eBay , and it had made the headlines .
I felt like I was trapped in an aviary of evil eye - pecking birds .
The threats were soaring overhead , then dive - bombing beak - first into the pores in my aching skull .
I screamed .
The writhing , palpitating torment ; the shattering headache ; and the enormous irritability and agitation of the world all fit into the grit in my teeth .
I needed something , some kind of painkiller , or I was going to die .
I did n't know any old people who might have medicine cabinets stocked with Norco .
I needed help .
I thought about the stairwell .
I thought maybe I could push myself down the stairwell and break something and go to the emergency room and get some pain meds .
I hurried down the hall and stood over the top , but I could n't throw myself off .
It was carpeted .
I might just bruise , not break .
I could n't jump .
My eyes fogged over with tears that did n't stream .
I never knew how serious it had gotten until it had gotten serious .
I had left my wife .
I had blown through our savings .
But I could n't make myself take the final fall and literally hit bottom .
I went back into my room and found the Bible .
I promised to God I 'd quit .
I tried to read some passages , but my eyes kept closing .
I knew if I fell asleep , I would n't wake up .
I found a section called " Leviticus . "
It was awful .
Something about an " unclean creeping carcase . "
I had to get out of there .
By " there , " I meant my body .
But I was stuck .
I 've been off opium tea for almost two weeks : twelve days of nonstop low - grade flu and restless thoughts of maybe sawing off my head with a bowie knife .
I 've also considered a homemade lobotomy with a knitting needle .
I can't live on this plane of plain sobriety .
When I can sleep , I wake up after a couple of hours , shivering , as though I 've been sleeping in the steerage of some Alaskan fishing boat .
Everything hurts .
I 've tried jogging to build up that natural high , but my brain 's capacity to make natural painkillers has been so dimmed by the opium that it feels like my knee joints are ripping with every stride .
The thing about it is I realize that I 'm going to order more poppies .
It 's not a question of " if . "
I know where I can get them .
It 's only a matter of time before I do this all over again .
As long as someone sells the pods , and nobody cares to stop them , my recidivism is all but assured .
Poppies have shown me a better place .
An occasional oasis of emotional stability .
It 's medicine for life .
I doubt it will ever kill me .
Perhaps make me into a 400 - pound shut - in .
Whatever -- as long as I can get to the mailbox .
Scott Rolen Trade Analysis
The news just came across the wire via Sports Illustrated writer Jon Heyman .
Scott Rolen has been dealt to the Cincinnati Reds for Edwin Encarnacion , Josh and Zack Stewart .
Let ’s look at this deal purely by the numbers for the MLB players and with some forward looking assumptions for the prospects .
Scott Rolen
Rolen has upped his value to around a five win above replacement level player .
From a linear dollar win value Rolen should be worth about $ 20 million this season .
( pro-rated , currently he is 3.0 WAR and $ 13.6 million ) .
I take these numbers with a grain of salt .
Still , they will be useful for this comparison .
For the record Rolen was due $ 11 million by the Jays next season .
When aquired the Jays gave the Cards $ 1.8 million .
St. Louis is on the hook for paying the $ 4 million bonus due to Rolen in 2010 .
The rumors going around are that the Jays are on the hook for a portion of Rolen ’s contract this season ( and possibly next ) .
Edwin Encarnacion
Edwin Encarnacion has gone from decent to below replacement level .
Before we jump into the fancy numbers I ’ve spotted one big negative trend , his contact rate .
This season his overall contact rate is at a career low .
Also , his LD % is lowly 13.9 % .
Both of these numbers are well below major league average .
These are the main reasons for his .209 batting average and - 1.9 batting runs .
Edwin is one of the worst fielding players in the MLB .
His UZR / 150 this season is - 23.1 .
His fielding runs are - 6 and climbing .
On an overall basis Edwin is - 7.7 runs on the season .
His overall value is - $ 700,000 and his WAR is - 0.2 .
To top things off Edwin is due $ 4.75 million next season
Comparison at Current Levels
WAR : Rolen 3.0 Edwin - 0.2
Batting Runs : Rolen 11.5 Edwin - 1.9
Fiedling Runs : Rolen 4.8 Edwin - 6.0
Value : Rolen $ 13.6 Million Edwin - $ 0.7 Million
Contact : Rolen due $ 11 million Edwin due $ 4.75 million .
Prospects
Josh Roenicke : Roenike is a 26 year old hard throwing right - hander .
He ’s been a reliever his entire minor league career and has been developed as a closer .
His K / Rate is 10.9 for his minor league career , and his K / BB ratio is 2.82 .
Opponents have a hard time hitting the longball off of Josh , with only six hit in 159 IP .
This season in 13.1 major leageu IP Josh has struck out 14 vs 4 BB .
He has allowed 13 hits , with 11 being singles .
He has an above average GB / FB ratio .
The Jays are probably expecting Josh to become a closer or set - up man at the MLB level .
Zach Stewart : Zack had very little pitching experience in a major college program , pitching only one season at Texas Tech after bouncing around junior college .
In his final season he posted a poor 1.47 WHIP and struggled with command .
Still , scouts loved his stuff ( mid 90 ’s fastball , good slider ) and the Reds selected Zach # 88th overall in 2008 .
This season Stewart has owned minor league hitters , with a 1.67 ERA in 91.2 IP .
Over this time he ’s allowed only 87 hits , struck out 79 vs 26 BB and surrendered only two longballs .
His GB / FB ratio is above average , at 2.05 this season .
His BB total has been high in college and at certain pro-levels .
The main issue with Zach ( aside from control ) is building up arm strength ( he started only 3 games in his final college season vs 17 relief appearances ) .
This season in AA Stewart had a 3 - 0 record with a 1.46 ERA over seven starts , yet only threw 37 IP .
Stewart has worked exclusively out of the pen in AAA Louisville .
Realistically Zach is a few seasons away from contributing as a starter .
Will the Jays brass convert him to the pen in the short - term ?
Verdict :
At first glance I hated this trade .
Rolen has a year and two months left on his contract , which is now starting to look like a bargain .
Edwin is awful .
I ’m sure he was forced upon the Jays in this trade , with his below replacement level production and $ 4.75 million contract in 2010 .
The two power righties are intriguing .
I like the Jays getting arms with upside vs soft - tossers that are heavily stocked in the system .
As for this trade itself I ’m on the fence .
In the short - term this should be a disaster , but if one or both of the arms produce this may wind up to be a decent deal in the long - term in terms of value vs win expectancy .
This trade could go either way .
The rule is this : convention t- shirts are awful , cheap things you see stuffed in swag bags then only again seen on large men at LAN parties .
The exception to that rule is this Capcom shirt for Comic - Con .

To be given away free to advertise Resident Evil : The Darkside Chronicles , it appears at first glance to be part of " the rule " ; a rubbish black t- shirt doing nothing but blandly advertising a video game .
But there 's a trick .

Boo !
Nice touch , Capcom .
This not a fox but rather a rare albino raccoon that lives in the woods of Rockledge , Florida .
A local woman has been lobbying for the zoo to capture it for its own protection .
Michelle Smurl , Brevard Zoo 's director of animal programs , said the zoo is not at liberty to trap an adult animal that is thriving in the wild .
She viewed photos of the animal and confirmed that it is a white raccoon .
" The raccoon looks healthy , and it looks like it 's doing well , " Smurl said .
" I grew up with white squirrels up in New York , and I was worried that someone was going to shoot them . "
Here is a solid stop- motion video short done by the folks at Kia Motors to showcase the new Kia Soul .
The car arrived on our shores in March as a 2010 model .
Kia Soul Rock is a great ode to their newest MPV - style vehicle .
The North American version of the car comes outfitted with either a 1.6 - liter inline four - cylinder engine producing 122 hp and operated by a five - speed manual transmission or the 2.0 - litre unit producing 142 hp mated to a 5 - speed manual transmission with a four - speed automatic optional .
The video shows a nice display of dozens of 2010 Kia Soul vehicles engaged in synchronized stunt driving with a few power slides here and there .

Ezra Klein highlights an important point about the baffling health care debate going on in Washington right now :
There are elements of health reform that are important , but will be sharply unpopular .
Almost 60 percent , for instance , oppose efforts to tax generous health care benefits .
I ’d guess that when people hear about penalties in the individual mandate , that policy will prove controversial too .
Luckily , there are some elements of health reform that meet with overwhelming public approval .
Among them is the public plan .
According to the poll , 76 percent of Americans believe it ’s either “ extremely important ” or “ quite important ” to “ give people a choice of both a public plan administered by the federal government and a private plan for their health insurance . ”
Much in health reform is unpopular .
The choice of a public insurance option is n’t .
And given the many hard and controversial choices that will need to be made to achieve health reform , it ’s not clear to me that the Democrats can afford to lightly remove the genuinely popular aspects of the legislation .
First , two quotes from my review of the original iPhone :
“ The issue is that the iPhone interface is just as responsive as a computer , so you inherently expect the sort of performance you 'd see on a notebook and it's just impossible on a device like the iPhone . "
“ I think overall we need a handful of upgrades to the iPhone alongside 3G ; we need a faster processor , possibly more system memory , maybe even faster flash .
The MLC flash in the iPhone has absolutely horrendous write speeds compared to SLC , which could be holding the iPhone back a bit .
I can see Apple introducing a 3G version in about 12 months , addressing many of these issues at the same time . ”
Indeed , 12 months after the launch of the first iPhone - Apple did fix the wireless performance issues with the iPhone 3G .
Unfortunately , the hardware remained untouched .
All of my other complaints in those two quotes remained open ticket items between Apple and I .
In fact , things got worse .
Here we have what I wrote at the end of my iPhone 3G review :
“ Apple must be wary of the direction the iPhone is headed in .
While the UI was absolutely perfect for the phone that launched a year ago , today ’s iPhone is hardly the same .
With easily over twice as many applications on an iPhone today vs. a year ago , performance and navigation have both suffered .
The impact is n’t tremendous , but Apple will have to adjust the iPhone accordingly in order to avoid turning the platform into a bloated , complicated mess . ”
Two days ago , Apple announced the iPhone 3GS - designed to address one thing : performance .
The other half of my complaint in the conclusion of my 3G review , addressing navigation and UI with the new expanded iPhone platform , is n’t addressed by the 3GS .
I suspect that in another year we ’ll see that .
But today , it ’s about hardware .
The Impetus
After yesterday 's Pre vs. iPhone 3G battery life article I got a few emails from people very close to the chips used in the iPhone 3GS .
A couple of exchanges later and I realized it might be time to go a little deeper with the hardware behind the iPhone 3G , iPhone 3GS and the Palm Pre .
The Original
The iPhone and iPhone 3G use a system on a chip ( SoC ) from Samsung .
The SoC is a custom part and actually has Apple ’s logo on the chip .
The SoC houses the CPU , GPU and memory for the iPhone .
The CPU is based on the ARM11 core , in specific it is the ARM1176JZF - S .
The CPU runs at 412MHz to save power , although the core is capable of running at 667M Hz .
The ARM11 CPU is a single - issue in - order microprocessor with an 8 - stage integer pipeline .
It ’s got a 32 KB L1 cache ( 16KB for instructions , 16 KB for data ) and no L2 cache .
The ARM11 CPU in the iPhone also has a vector floating point unit , but thankfully the SoC includes a separate GPU for 3D acceleration .
You can think of this core as a very high clocked , very advanced 486 .
And extremely low power .
Under typical load , the CPU core should consume around 100 mW .
By comparison , the CPU in your laptop can require anywhere from 10 - 35W .
Idle power is even lower .
Paired with this CPU is a PowerVR MBX - Lite GPU core .
This GPU , like the CPU , is built on a 90nm process and is quite simple .
The GPU does support hardware transform and lighting but it ’s fully fixed function , think of it as a DirectX 6/7 class GPU ( Riva TNT2 / GeForce 256 ) .
Here ’s PowerVR ’s block diagram of the MBX :
The MBX - Lite in the iPhone shares the same architecture as the MBX but is optimized , once more , for power efficiency and thus is significantly slower .
I do n’t have exact clock speed information for the MBX - Lite in the iPhone but I ’m guessing around 60MHz .
Coupled with the CPU and the GPU in the iPhone ’s SoC is 128MB of DDR memory , all on the same chip .
It ’s a pretty impressive little package .
You get a CPU , GPU and memory all in a package that ’s physically smaller than Intel ’s Atom .
Now the 486 came out in 1989 and the original 3dfx Voodoo graphics card came out in 1996 .
The iPhone ’s SoC would be ridiculously powerful if it were running the sorts of applications we had back then , but it ’s not .
We ’re asking a lot from this little core and although it has performed admirably thanks to some clever software engineering on Apple ’s part , it ’s time for an update .
The roots of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal lie not in the criminal inclinations of a few Army reservists but in a decision , approved last year by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , to expand a highly secret operation , which had been focussed on the hunt for Al Qaeda , to the interrogation of prisoners in Iraq .
Rumsfeld ’s decision embittered the American intelligence community , damaged the effectiveness of élite combat units , and hurt America ’s prospects in the war on terror .
According to interviews with several past and present American intelligence officials , the Pentagon ’s operation , known inside the intelligence community by several code words , including Copper Green , encouraged physical coercion and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners in an effort to generate more intelligence about the growing insurgency in Iraq .
A senior C.I.A. official , in confirming the details of this account last week , said that the operation stemmed from Rumsfeld ’s long - standing desire to wrest control of America ’s clandestine and paramilitary operations from the C.I.A .
Rumsfeld , during appearances last week before Congress to testify about Abu Ghraib , was precluded by law from explicitly mentioning highly secret matters in an unclassified session .
But he conveyed the message that he was telling the public all that he knew about the story .
He said , “ Any suggestion that there is not a full , deep awareness of what has happened , and the damage it has done , I think , would be a misunderstanding . ”
The senior C.I.A. official , asked about Rumsfeld ’s testimony and that of Stephen Cambone , his Under - Secretary for Intelligence , said , “ Some people think you can bullshit anyone . ”
The Abu Ghraib story began , in a sense , just weeks after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , with the American bombing of Afghanistan .
Almost from the start , the Administration ’s search for Al Qaeda members in the war zone , and its worldwide search for terrorists , came up against major command - and - control problems .
For example , combat forces that had Al Qaeda targets in sight had to obtain legal clearance before firing on them .
On October 7th , the night the bombing began , an unmanned Predator aircraft tracked an automobile convoy that , American intelligence believed , contained Mullah Muhammad Omar , the Taliban leader .
A lawyer on duty at the United States Central Command headquarters , in Tampa , Florida , refused to authorize a strike .
By the time an attack was approved , the target was out of reach .
Rumsfeld was apoplectic over what he saw as a self - defeating hesitation to attack that was due to political correctness .
One officer described him to me that fall as “ kicking a lot of glass and breaking doors . ”
In November , the Washington Post reported that , as many as ten times since early October , Air Force pilots believed they ’d had senior Al Qaeda and Taliban members in their sights but had been unable to act in time because of legalistic hurdles .
There were similar problems throughout the world , as American Special Forces units seeking to move quickly against suspected terrorist cells were compelled to get prior approval from local American ambassadors and brief their superiors in the chain of command .
Rumsfeld reacted in his usual direct fashion : he authorized the establishment of a highly secret program that was given blanket advance approval to kill or capture and , if possible , interrogate “ high value ” targets in the Bush Administration ’s war on terror .
A special - access program , or sap — subject to the Defense Department ’s most stringent level of security — was set up , with an office in a secure area of the Pentagon .
The program would recruit operatives and acquire the necessary equipment , including aircraft , and would keep its activities under wraps .
America ’s most successful intelligence operations during the Cold War had been saps , including the Navy ’s submarine penetration of underwater cables used by the Soviet high command and construction of the Air Force ’s stealth bomber .
All the so - called “ black ” programs had one element in common : the Secretary of Defense , or his deputy , had to conclude that the normal military classification restraints did not provide enough security .
“ Rumsfeld ’s goal was to get a capability in place to take on a high - value target — a standup group to hit quickly , ” a former high - level intelligence official told me .
“ He got all the agencies together — the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. — to get pre-approval in place .
Just say the code word and go . ”
The operation had across - the - board approval from Rumsfeld and from Condoleezza Rice , the national - security adviser .
President Bush was informed of the existence of the program , the former intelligence official said .
The people assigned to the program worked by the book , the former intelligence official told me .
They created code words , and recruited , after careful screening , highly trained commandos and operatives from America ’s élite forces —
Navy seals , the Army ’s Delta Force , and the C.I.A. ’s paramilitary experts .
They also asked some basic questions :
“ Do the people working the problem have to use aliases ?
Yes .
Do we need dead drops for the mail ?
Yes .
No traceability and no budget .
And some special - access programs are never fully briefed to Congress . ”
In theory , the operation enabled the Bush Administration to respond immediately to time - sensitive intelligence : commandos crossed borders without visas and could interrogate terrorism suspects deemed too important for transfer to the military ’s facilities at Guantánamo , Cuba .
They carried out instant interrogations — using force if necessary — at secret C.I.A. detention centers scattered around the world .
The intelligence would be relayed to the sap command center in the Pentagon in real time , and sifted for those pieces of information critical to the “ white , ” or overt , world .
Fewer than two hundred operatives and officials , including Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , were “ completely read into the program , ” the former intelligence official said .
The goal was to keep the operation protected .
“ We ’re not going to read more people than necessary into our heart of darkness , ” he said .
“ The rules are ‘ Grab whom you must .
Do what you want . ’ ”
One Pentagon official who was deeply involved in the program was Stephen Cambone , who was named Under - Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in March , 2003 .
The office was new ; it was created as part of Rumsfeld ’s reorganization of the Pentagon .
Cambone was unpopular among military and civilian intelligence bureaucrats in the Pentagon , essentially because he had little experience in running intelligence programs , though in 1998 he had served as staff director for a committee , headed by Rumsfeld , that warned of an emerging ballistic - missile threat to the United States .
He was known instead for his closeness to Rumsfeld .
“ Remember Henry II —
‘ Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest ? ’ ” the senior C.I.A. official said to me , with a laugh , last week .
“ Whatever Rumsfeld whimsically says , Cambone will do ten times that much . ”
Cambone was a strong advocate for war against Iraq .
He shared Rumsfeld ’s disdain for the analysis and assessments proffered by the C.I.A. , viewing them as too cautious , and chafed , as did Rumsfeld , at the C.I.A. ’s inability , before the Iraq war , to state conclusively that Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction .
Cambone ’s military assistant , Army Lieutenant General William G. ( Jerry ) Boykin , was also controversial .
Last fall , he generated unwanted headlines after it was reported that , in a speech at an Oregon church , he equated the Muslim world with Satan .
Early in his tenure , Cambone provoked a bureaucratic battle within the Pentagon by insisting that he be given control of all special - access programs that were relevant to the war on terror .
Those programs , which had been viewed by many in the Pentagon as sacrosanct , were monitored by Kenneth deGraffenreid , who had experience in counter - intelligence programs .
Cambone got control , and deGraffenreid subsequently left the Pentagon .
Asked for comment on this story , a Pentagon spokesman said , “ I will not discuss any covert programs ; however , Dr. Cambone did not assume his position as the Under - Secretary of Defense for Intelligence until March 7 , 2003 , and had no involvement in the decision - making process regarding interrogation procedures in Iraq or anywhere else . ”
In mid-2003 , the special - access program was regarded in the Pentagon as one of the success stories of the war on terror .
“ It was an active program , ” the former intelligence official told me .
“ It ’s been the most important capability we have for dealing with an imminent threat .
If we discover where Osama bin Laden is , we can get him .
And we can remove an existing threat with a real capability to hit the United States — and do so without visibility . ”
Some of its methods were troubling and could not bear close scrutiny , however .
By then , the war in Iraq had begun .
The sap was involved in some assignments in Iraq , the former official said .
C.I.A. and other American Special Forces operatives secretly teamed up to hunt for Saddam Hussein and — without success — for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
But they were n’t able to stop the evolving insurgency .
In the first months after the fall of Baghdad , Rumsfeld and his aides still had a limited view of the insurgency , seeing it as little more than the work of Baathist “ dead - enders , ” criminal gangs , and foreign terrorists who were Al Qaeda followers .
The Administration measured its success in the war by how many of those on its list of the fifty - five most wanted members of the old regime — reproduced on playing cards — had been captured .
Then , in August , 2003 , terror bombings in Baghdad hit the Jordanian Embassy , killing nineteen people , and the United Nations headquarters , killing twenty - three people , including Sergio Vieira de Mello , the head of the U.N. mission .
On August 25th , less than a week after the U.N. bombing , Rumsfeld acknowledged , in a talk before the Veterans of Foreign Wars , that “ the dead - enders are still with us . ”
He went on , “ There are some today who are surprised that there are still pockets of resistance in Iraq , and they suggest that this represents some sort of failure on the part of the Coalition .
But this is not the case . ”
Rumsfeld compared the insurgents with those true believers who “ fought on during and after the defeat of the Nazi regime in Germany . ”
A few weeks later — and five months after the fall of Baghdad — the Defense Secretary declared , “ It is , in my view , better to be dealing with terrorists in Iraq than in the United States . ”
Inside the Pentagon , there was a growing realization that the war was going badly .
The increasingly beleaguered and baffled Army leadership was telling reporters that the insurgents consisted of five thousand Baathists loyal to Saddam Hussein .
“ When you understand that they ’re organized in a cellular structure , ” General John Abizaid , the head of the Central Command , declared , “ that . . . they have access to a lot of money and a lot of ammunition , you ’ll understand how dangerous they are . ”
The American military and intelligence communities were having little success in penetrating the insurgency .
One internal report prepared for the U.S. military , made available to me , concluded that the insurgents ’ “ strategic and operational intelligence has proven to be quite good . ”
According to the study :
**{ : .break one} **
Their ability to attack convoys , other vulnerable targets and particular individuals has been the result of painstaking surveillance and reconnaissance .
Inside information has been passed on to insurgent cells about convoy / troop movements and daily habits of Iraqis working with coalition from within the Iraqi security services , primarily the Iraqi Police force which is rife with sympathy for the insurgents , Iraqi ministries and from within pro-insurgent individuals working with the CPA ’s so - called Green Zone . **
The study concluded , “ Politically , the U.S. has failed to date .
Insurgencies can be fixed or ameliorated by dealing with what caused them in the first place .
The disaster that is the reconstruction of Iraq has been the key cause of the insurgency .
There is no legitimate government , and it behooves the Coalition Provisional Authority to absorb the sad but unvarnished fact that most Iraqis do not see the Governing Council ” — the Iraqi body appointed by the C.P.A. — “ as the legitimate authority .
Indeed , they know that the true power is the CPA . ”
By the fall , a military analyst told me , the extent of the Pentagon ’s political and military misjudgments was clear .
Donald Rumsfeld ’s “ dead - enders ” now included not only Baathists but many marginal figures as well — thugs and criminals who were among the tens of thousands of prisoners freed the previous fall by Saddam as part of a prewar general amnesty .
Their desperation was not driving the insurgency ; it simply made them easy recruits for those who were .
The analyst said , “ We ’d killed and captured guys who had been given two or three hundred dollars to ‘ pray and spray ’ ” — that is , shoot randomly and hope for the best .
“ They were n’t really insurgents but down - and - outers who were paid by wealthy individuals sympathetic to the insurgency . ”
In many cases , the paymasters were Sunnis who had been members of the Baath Party .
The analyst said that the insurgents “ spent three or four months figuring out how we operated and developing their own countermeasures .
If that meant putting up a hapless guy to go and attack a convoy and see how the American troops responded , they ’d do it . ”
Then , the analyst said , “ the clever ones began to get in on the action . ”
By contrast , according to the military report , the American and Coalition forces knew little about the insurgency : “ Human intelligence is poor or lacking . . . due to the dearth of competence and expertise .
. . .
The intelligence effort is not coördinated since either too many groups are involved in gathering intelligence or the final product does not get to the troops in the field in a timely manner . ”
The success of the war was at risk ; something had to be done to change the dynamic .
The solution , endorsed by Rumsfeld and carried out by Stephen Cambone , was to get tough with those Iraqis in the Army prison system who were suspected of being insurgents .
A key player was Major General Geoffrey Miller , the commander of the detention and interrogation center at Guantánamo , who had been summoned to Baghdad in late August to review prison interrogation procedures .
The internal Army report on the abuse charges , written by Major General Antonio Taguba in February , revealed that Miller urged that the commanders in Baghdad change policy and place military intelligence in charge of the prison .
The report quoted Miller as recommending that “ detention operations must act as an enabler for interrogation . ”
Miller ’s concept , as it emerged in recent Senate hearings , was to “ Gitmoize ” the prison system in Iraq — to make it more focussed on interrogation .
He also briefed military commanders in Iraq on the interrogation methods used in Cuba — methods that could , with special approval , include sleep deprivation , exposure to extremes of cold and heat , and placing prisoners in “ stress positions ” for agonizing lengths of time .
( The Bush Administration had unilaterally declared Al Qaeda and other captured members of international terrorist networks to be illegal combatants , and not eligible for the protection of the Geneva Conventions . )
Rumsfeld and Cambone went a step further , however : they expanded the scope of the sap , bringing its unconventional methods to Abu Ghraib .
The commandos were to operate in Iraq as they had in Afghanistan .
The male prisoners could be treated roughly , and exposed to sexual humiliation .
“ They were n’t getting anything substantive from the detainees in Iraq , ” the former intelligence official told me .
“ No names .
Nothing that they could hang their hat on .
Cambone says , I ’ve got to crack this thing and I ’m tired of working through the normal chain of command .
I ’ve got this apparatus set up — the black special - access program — and I ’m going in hot .
So he pulls the switch , and the electricity begins flowing last summer .
And it ’s working .
We ’re getting a picture of the insurgency in Iraq and the intelligence is flowing into the white world .
We ’re getting good stuff .
But we ’ve got more targets ” — prisoners in Iraqi jails — “ than people who can handle them . ”
Cambone then made another crucial decision , the former intelligence official told me : not only would he bring the sap ’s rules into the prisons ; he would bring some of the Army military - intelligence officers working inside the Iraqi prisons under the sap ’s auspices .
“ So here are fundamentally good soldiers — military - intelligence guys — being told that no rules apply , ” the former official , who has extensive knowledge of the special - access programs , added .
“ And , as far as they ’re concerned , this is a covert operation , and it ’s to be kept within Defense Department channels . ”
The military - police prison guards , the former official said , included “ recycled hillbillies from Cumberland , Maryland . ”
He was referring to members of the 372nd Military Police Company .
Seven members of the company are now facing charges for their role in the abuse at Abu Ghraib .
“ How are these guys from Cumberland going to know anything ?
The Army Reserve does n’t know what it ’s doing . ”
The EOCS adult game censorship regulations imposed in response to feminist criticism have finally been revealed in detail , and it seems they are shockingly draconian , practically banning all pictures and text which stray from the missionary position .
Not just rape and loli are now banned ; all group sex , kinkiness and anything else which might cause trouble or offence is banned , whether in pictures or text ; it is difficult to characterise such a sweeping ban as anything but a complete victory for opponents of freedom of expression and sexuality .
The full list of what is now completely off limits to adult games published through traditional channels :
( Some terms do not have clear English equivalents )
Rape Loli Gang Rape Assault Brutality “ Reverse ” Rape Girl Adultery “ Reverse ” Assault Compulsion Gangbang Student Council Bestiality Bondage Coercion Train Molestation Enjo Kousai ( Prostitution )
Incest Torture Binding Pregnancy Violation Slaves Pregnant Women Confinement Conception
The ban covers all pictures , text , packaging and even the names of the publishers themselves .
Euphemisms are also banned , and the list will be added to as required .
It seems the only major omission is homosexuality ; it is also not clear whether the ban on pregnancy and conception means games must now feature obligatory contraception …
The source is a publisher quoting the EOCS guidelines for the benefit of their own partners , so it is still not a direct announcement , but seems as close to one as can be expected .
This also confirms the previous publisher misgivings that a game featuring nekomimi and consensual pregnancy would be banned under the new regulations .
Details of how this may affect publishers and retail channels are covered in the previous articles , suffice to say it seems the retail trade in such games will be undergoing a severe contraction .
With such a spectacular success in censoring so broad an array of deviancy , it seems only a matter of time before a similar assault is launched against anime and manga , to say nothing of the wider pornography industry …
Partial Vote Count Declaring Ahmadinejad Win Amidst Allegations of Widespread Fraud “ Gross violation of the right to a free and fair election ”
( 13 June 2009 ) [ As of 7 am Tehran time ]
After a disputed election , the offices of two reformist candidates , Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi were seized and locked by intelligence and security forces .
As the Interior Ministry is declaring Ahmadinejad as the victor , the security apparatus loyal to him have taken to the streets in an overwhelming show of force .
According to unconfirmed reports , Mir Hossein Moussavi may have been detained by intelligence agents as he traveled to the Supreme Leader ’s residence to meet with him .
By all indications , the government of Ahmadinejad , which is in charge of conducting the elections and counting votes , is using a combination of intimidation and military might to prevent any challenges to announced results of the election .
“ It appears that a coup has taken place in Iran overnight to force the results on other parties .
These elections cannot be considered fair by any measure under such circumstances , ” said Hadi Ghaemi , spokesperson for the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran .
Moussavi ’s official website , www.ghalamnews.ir, reported that when his supporters gathered around his headquarters to celebrate what they believed was his victory based on reports of his representatives at polling stations , police forces confronted them using pepper spray and violently dispersed them .
Moussavi ’s headquarters have been since shut , similar to Karroubi ’s headquarters .
At 11 PM Tehran time , Moussavi told a press conference , “ I am the absolute winner of the election by a very wide margin .
It is our duty to defend people ’s votes .
There is no turning back . ”
However , since then the situation seems to have drastically shifted in favor of Ahmadinejad , with continuous announcements of his wide margin of victory .
According to reports from Tehran , heavy armed agents , many in plainclothes , have taken control of major intersections .
As of this writing , crowds of Ahmadinejad ’s supporters are reportedly already celebrating his victory in the streets .
The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran expressed its serious concerns about the vote counting process and the intimidation of candidates to accept results of government counts without any challenge .
The Campaign is also seriously concerned about the safety of Moussavi and Karroubi and their top advisors , as well as the possibility of violence against any protestors who may publicly challenge the government .
“ The Iranian people , throughout this entire election process , believed that through peaceful and legal means significant change could be achieved and they participated enthusiastically , but their right to a free and fair election has been grossly violated , ” Ghaemi said .
The Obama administration is considering a change in the law for the military commissions at the prison at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , that would clear the way for detainees facing the death penalty to plead guilty without a full trial .
The provision could permit military prosecutors to avoid airing the details of brutal interrogation techniques .
It could also allow the five detainees who have been charged with the Sept. 11 attacks to achieve their stated goal of pleading guilty to gain what they have called martyrdom .
The proposal , in a draft of legislation that would be submitted to Congress , has not been publicly disclosed .
It was circulated to officials under restrictions requiring secrecy .
People who have read or been briefed on it said it had been presented to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates by an administration task force on detention .
The proposal would ease what has come to be recognized as the government ’s difficult task of prosecuting men who have confessed to terrorism but whose cases present challenges .
Much of the evidence against the men accused in the Sept. 11 case , as well as against other detainees , is believed to have come from confessions they gave during intense interrogations at secret C.I.A. prisons .
In any proceeding , the reliability of those statements would be challenged , making trials difficult and drawing new political pressure over detainee treatment .
San Francisco -
A federal judge today dismissed dozens of lawsuits over illegal domestic surveillance of American citizens , ruling that telecommunications companies had immunity from liability under the controversial FISA Amendments Act ( FISAAA ) .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) and the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) California and Illinois affiliates are planning to appeal the decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , arguing that FISAAA is unconstitutional .
" We 're deeply disappointed in Judge Walker 's ruling today , " said EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn .
" The retroactive immunity law unconstitutionally takes away Americans ' claims arising out of the First and Fourth Amendments , violates the federal government 's separation of powers as established in the Constitution , and robs innocent telecom customers of their rights without due process of law . "
Signed by President Bush in 2008 , the FISAAA allowed for the dismissal of the lawsuits over the telecoms ' participation in the warrantless surveillance program if the government secretly certifies to the court that the surveillance did not occur , was legal , or was authorized by the president .
Then - Attorney General Michael Mukasey filed that classified certification with the court in September and demanded that the cases be dismissed .
" The immunity legislation that the court upheld today gives the telephone companies a free pass for flouting the law and violating the privacy rights of millions of their customers , " said Ann Brick , ACLU of Northern California staff attorney .
In today 's ruling , Judge Walker left the door open to accountability for the government , holding that " plaintiffs retain a means of redressing the harms alleged in their complaints by proceeding against governmental actors and entities who are , after all , the primary actors in the alleged wiretapping activities . "
EFF is also suing the government for the illegal surveillance in a separate case , Jewel v. NSA .
EFF and the ACLU are co-coordinating counsel for all 46 outstanding lawsuits concerning the government 's warrantless surveillance program .
Additionally , EFF is representing the plaintiffs in Hepting v. AT&T , a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of millions of AT&T customers whose private domestic communications and communications records were illegally handed over to the National Security Agency .
" By passing the retroactive immunity for the telecoms ' complicity in the warrantless wiretapping program , Congress abdicated its duty to the American people , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kurt Opsahl .
" Now it is up to the Court of Appeals to stand up for the Constitution , and reverse today 's decision . "

( CNN ) --
A political crisis in Honduras escalated Thursday as a defiant President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales , followed by hundreds of supporters , led a loud but peaceful protest to a military base in order to personally take possession of thousands of ballots to be used in a contested referendum Sunday .
President Manuel Zelaya Rosales , middle , reviews troops with Gen. Romeo Vasquez Velasquez , right , in 2008 .
Zelaya , a leftist elected in 2005 , suddenly found himself pitted against the other branches of government and military leaders over the issue of the referendum .
The referendum at the center of the storm asks voters to place a measure on November 's ballot that would allow the formation of a constitutional assembly that could modify the nation 's charter to allow the president to run for another term .
Zelaya , whose four - year term ends in January 2010 , cannot run for re-election .
The Hondurans Supreme Court had ruled the referendum illegal , and Congress and the top military brass agreed , but Zelaya remained steadfast .
" Sunday 's referendum will not be stopped , " Zelaya said at the entrance of the military base where boxes of ballots were removed from storage and put into trucks to be taken to the presidential palace .
Moving the ballots prevented them from being voided or destroyed to comply with the court 's ruling of the illegality of the vote .
Zelaya and his supporters braved an overcast and rainy day and sang the national anthem as the cardboard boxes filled with ballots were moved out of storage .
" We have the right to vote and the right to organize , " Zelaya said .
" The military should rectify their position in favor of the people and ignore the extortion of the elite . "
The protest was the latest in a day of developments that have created a political crisis in a country where some 70 percent of the population lives in poverty .
Earlier Thursday , the Supreme Court ordered that the military 's top commander be returned to his job immediately , a little more than 12 hours after Zelaya fired the general for saying the armed forces would not support the referendum .
Gen . Romeo Vasquez Velasquez had said the military was caught in a difficult position because the Supreme Court had ruled earlier that the referendum is illegal , but Zelaya was going ahead with the vote and instructed the armed forces to provide security .
The heads of the army , navy and air force had resigned to show their support for Vasquez .
Zelaya referred to the court as the " Supreme Court of Injustice " after their ruling .
The court ruled 5 - 0 that Zelaya violated the general 's constitutional rights by firing him without cause , said magistrate Rosalina Cruz .
Also on Thursday , the National Congress convened an emergency session at which many members lauded Vasquez and the military , calling them " heroes . "
The general 's firing was arbitrary , many members said .
The president of the Congress , Roberto Micheletti , said the assembly unconditionally supports the armed forces for respecting the constitution , news reports said .
In another blow for Zelaya , the Supreme Electoral Tribunal said Thursday the referendum is illegal .
The military chief had said after he was fired that he respected the president 's decision to dismiss him but could not violate a Supreme Court order last week that prohibited the military from supporting the referendum .
" We are soldiers and we have to comply with our responsibilities , " Vasquez said early Thursday .
" We are not afraid of any judge , " he said .
" We are only afraid of the judge of history . "
Zelaya said he would ask the Organization of American States to investigate the " crisis , " which he said was being perpetrated by people who want to hurt democracy in Honduras .
Congress passed a law Tuesday night that would prohibit a referendum 180 days before or after the planned November general election .
Under that law , Sunday 's referendum could not be held .
Politicians huddled Thursday as tension gripped the nation .
Rumors of a coup had been circulating for days , heightened Wednesday when the armed forces were placed on high alert and held training exercises to prepare for civil disturbances and urban warfare , news reports said .
There were no signs of any military intervention Thursday , though .
David Matamoros , a member of the nation 's Supreme Electoral Tribunal , said on CNN affiliate Televicentro that the election panel supports the military 's action .
The military ruled Honduras for 25 years , until a democratically elected civilian government came to power in 1982 .
Zelaya narrowly won the presidency on November 27 , 2005 , garnering 49.8 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent for Porfirio " Pepe " Lobo .

Una familia de argentinos , de cinco integrantes , vive hace un mes en el aeropuerto internacional de Río de Janeiro sin dinero y de la caridad de los empleados de la terminal aérea , informó hoy el cónsul argentino en esa ciudad , Cristian Dellepiane .
La familia busca regresar a Panamá , su país de residencia , pero no tiene dinero para regresar .
Sin embargo , tampoco aceptó la oferta del consulado argentino en Río de Janeiro de pagarle los boletos para viajar a Buenos Aires .
" También les ofrecimos alojamiento pero quieren quedarse en el aeropuerto " , dijo Dellepiane en diálogo con el canal de noticias TN .
Dentro del aeropuerto , la familia , que duerme en los bancos de una cafetería , recibió la solidaridad de trabajadores y comerciantes del lugar , que les acercan comida y contención afectiva .
" Han sido muy discretos en el aeropuerto , son muy queridos allí " , agregó el funcionario .
Según indicó Dellepiane , la familia viajó por tierra desde Buenos Aires hasta Río de Janeiro , pero llegó con cuatro días de atraso para su vuelo a Paraná .
Así , desde el pasado 11 de junio se encuentran acampando en el aeropuerto Tom Jobim .
" Tenemos entendido que vivían en condiciones de indigencia en Panamá " , agregó el cónsul .
Insanity of vegetarianism has no limits
It seems that the discussion of the good and bad of vegetarianism will never subside .
The proponents of abstinence from meat claim that meat contains a whole bouquet of harmful substances .
Their opponents say that the animal protein is absolutely essential for the human body .
Who is right and who is wrong here ?
Below you will find the list of most talked - about statements about the vegan diet .
Insanity of vegetarianism has no limits
Myth No. 1 . Meat contains toxins – by - products of the decomposition of the post - mortem poison , which gradually intoxicate the human body .
As a matter of fact , it is dangerous to eat only tainted meat , which indeed contains the products of decay .
Many vegetarians do not eat meat , but they do eat fish assuming that there are no toxins in fish .
Some others decline even eggs , in which there can be no vestiges of post - mortem poison found , of course .
Myth No. 2 . Meat contains cancer - producing substances .
Eating meat on a regular basis leads to the development of cancer .
As a matter of fact , carcinogens can be found in fried and smoked food .
If you eat boiled , stewed meat or shashlik ( shish - kebab ) there is no danger posed whatsoever .
Myth No. 3 . Meat makes one put on weight .
As a matter of fact , all sorts of meat differ .
It is generally believed that meat adds more fat to the body because it is digested entirely .
A person eating fatty meat all the time will definitely put on weight , but they have a variety of other sorts of meat to choose from – low - fat beef or poultry , for example .
Myth No. 4 . Vegetarians live longer than non-vegans .
As a matter of fact , there are many factors that exert influence on longevity : genetic background , ecology , stresses and many other aspects .
Many long - living individuals have never stuck to any diets at all .
Many of them eat anything they want and whenever they want .
Myth No. 5 . Vegetarians are generally healthier than those who eat meat .
As a matter of fact , meat contains protein and ferrum , which is a compound of hemoglobin .
The shortage of ferrum develops general fatigue .
Some sorts of fish , which vegans strongly decline , contain omega - 3 aliphatic acids , which produce the anti-inflammatory effect .
It has been determined that those excluding meat from their daily menus suffer from heart diseases a lot more frequently .
The shortage of useful substances shows a direct influence on vegans ’ looks .
As a rule , many of them look pale because of the disturbed blood circulation .
In addition , they are more prone to cold - related diseases .
Myth No. 6 . A human being is a herbivorous creature by nature .
As a matter of fact , many researchers say that humans are genetically capable of digesting meat food .
Carnivorous beings cannot digest too much vegetable food and cannot live normally without the products of animal origin .
Herbivorous beings cannot consume meat .
If humans were not omnivorous , it would never occur to anyone to eat meat .
Researcher Barry Groves , the author of “ Trick and Treat : How Healthy Eating Is Making Us Ill ” said that diet food is mostly unnatural for humans because human beings are carnivorous by nature , and the human digestive system is made to digest fatty meat and other anti-vegan food .
A healthy diet is a diet of no extremities .

Speaking with Petro Piaseckyj , Managing Producer for SCEA during our session with Heavy Rain he mentioned that Heavy Rain DLC is indeed in the works .
Heavy Rain will feature 4 playable characters , with intertwining storylines .
He spoke about how Heavy Rain DLC could potentially bring different perspectives of the title , possibly from additional characters .
Stay tuned to PlayStation LifeStyle as we will have a HD video of our Heavy Rain Demonstration coming later tomorrow .
Imagine , for a second , you get called up to the show .
It ’s your first week in the big leagues and you connect for your 1st career home run .
A fan catches the ball in the bleachers .
You want the ball back for your personal collection , but the fact remains , it ’s now the property of the fan .
What ’s the ball worth to you ?
More on this later …
My good friend “ Dino ” and I were going to the game together .
We were both jacked for this day .
He arrived at the house with his glove in tow .
It still had the price tag on it .
I asked him if he planned on using that glove to catch anything .
It was rigid and right off the shelf .
So , we took it down into the basement for some much needed love .
A little bit of mink oil on that glove to condition it …
… and 40 seconds in the microwave to soften the leather .
Now , it just needed to be used .
We got to the stadium and grabbed a table out on Friday ’s patio .
Here ’s “ Dino ” sporting the shirt …
… good taste .
Here ’s an abbreviated account of how Batting Practice went …
Ball # 1 was a CARLOS CORPORAN toss - up requested in Spanish .
Ball # 2 was caught on the fly off the bat of COREY HART .
Ball # 3 , # 4 , # 5 and # 6 were all easter eggs discovered in the left field bleachers !!
Whoa !
Brewers BP concluded .
Ball # 7 was caught on the fly off the bat of BRETT CARROLL .
Ball # 8 was via a JEFFREY URGELLES toss - up .
Marlins BP concluded .
Ball # 9 was tossed up by the infamous CHRIS COGHLAN after he finished warming up by the dugout .
Ball # 10 was ALFREDO AMEZAGA ’s warmup ball used by the dugout .
Ball # 11 was JEREMY HERMIDA ’s warmup ball used by the dugout .
What came next changed the complexion of the evening in a big way .
Marlins prospect CHRIS COGHLAN , who had just been summoned to the major leagues the week before , stepped to the plate .
“ Dino ” had gone to the can and I was in the process of putting my long sleeve on due to a drop in the weather .
The ball went up , I ran over , I leaned over and made the catch .
If you look closely at the highlight , I have another ball in my right hand while I ’m making the catch . (?)
The Marlins bullpen called me over and I spoke with Bullpen Coach Steve Foster .
Mr. Foster informed me that the ball was Chris Coghlan ’s first career home run .
He offered me another baseball in exchange .
I respectfully declined .
With over 775 career baseballs snagged , I did n’t need another ball .
He asked me what I was looking to get .
I informed him I would like a couple of bats .
Especially , one by the player who hit the ball .
He told me , “ oh , you are a big fan .
No problem , we can do that . ”
I assured him that Chris Coghlan would get his home run ball .
I told him the first thing I wanted to do , before all else , was to get the baseball authenticated by major league baseball .
That way , there would be no question as to the authenticity of the ball .
I told him I would not give up the ball until it was authenticated .
He had no problem with this request .
None whatsoever .
Not at this current time ( he later bashed me in the Florida media - changed his tune just a tad ) .
So , I went over to guest relations and spoke with a supervisor .
I requested the on - site major league baseball authenticator .
After approx . 25 minutes , an authenticator could not be located .
Someone was not doing their job .
For those who do not know , every team is SUPPOSED to have two ( 2 ) authenticators present at every major league baseball game .
Not just for the inevitable milestones ( ie. 500th home run , 300th win , 3000th hit , etc. ) , but for the unexpected ones as well ( ie. 1st career home run , hit for the cycle , unassisted triple play , etc . )
It was at this time , Media Relations Manager MARTY SEWELL approached me and began to discuss the swap .
I told him I wanted the ball authenticated for the benefit of all parties involved .
That way , there would be no question as to the authenticity of the ball .
I also informed Mr. Sewell I wanted to personally present the ball to Mr. Coghlan at the end of the game for a photo opportunity .
He told me to meet at the Marlins dugout at the end of the game .
When we both realized the ball would not be authenticated , he stated he had no problem with me going back to my seat with the home run ball .
When I got back to my seat , Marlins TV - man CRAIG MINERVINI ( the only respectful Marlins employee in this whole ordeal ) was in my seat interviewing my buddy “ Dino . ”
A few minutes later , this was the scene …
… and this …
… Mr. Minervini was extremely cool .
He asked me about my website .
He asked me about my ballhawking career stats .
Finally , he asked me what it would take to give up the Coghlan home run ball .
For all Florida viewers to see , I handed Craig the
handwritten requests I had decided on 30 minutes earlier .
On those two slips of paper read the following :
1st piece of paper :
CHRIS COGHLAN GAME BAT signed -
“ To Nick , thanks for catching my first home run ! ”
+
one ( 1 ) signed CHRIS COGHLAN ball
AND
2nd piece of paper :
HANLEY RAMIREZ GAME BAT
THE END .
Mr. Minervini then held up the two slips of paper for the camera and I held up the home run ball .
There you have it .
So , where ’s the confusion ??
Where ’s the part about me being unreasonable and asking for a whole bunch of stuff from other players ?
Where ’s the part about me holding the ball for ransom ?
Two bats .
Simple as that .
Plain English - right in front of the camera .
Documented and concrete .
One by the player who hit the home run AND one by the Marlins stud .
Is that asking too much ?
Is that being unreasonable ?
I just do n’t see it that way .
It ’s my hobby , people …
… some people choose to sell drugs to kids .
Some people choose to abuse drugs , themselves .
Some people choose to get all liquored up and drive their vehicles .
Some people choose to be abusive to their wives and kids .
Some people choose to rob , steal and cheat .
Some people take the lives of others .
Some people choose to snag baseballs at the ballpark .
Whoopee .
Let me ask you this :
QUESTION : Is it okay to catch a historic milestone home run and sell it at auction for $ 1 million dollars ?
ANSWER : If that ’s what it ’s worth to someone , hell yeah it ’s okay .
On the flip - side :
QUESTION : Is it okay for a fan to catch a personal milestone of a little - known player and ask for two bats ?
ANSWER : If that ’s what it ’s worth to someone , you bet it is .
Two different levels …same premise .
During the game , I gave out two ( 2 ) baseballs to two kids sitting in my section .
They did n’t ask .
They did n’t have gloves ( that I could see ) .
They were just playing around and I had a few extra .
About twenty minutes later , this lovely family showed up in my section to congratulate me on my catch …
… they were so nice , I gave their daughter a baseball .
That ’s Cassidy holding up her newest prize .
What a cutie !
The game could n’t get over with soon enough .
I was itching to make the swap of the home run ball for the two bats .
To pass the time …
… I christened a new “ CUBS SUCK ” ball .
( For those who do not know , the CUBS SUCK ball is used as the throwback ball when an opposing team hits a home run to me ) .
I keep the real game home run ball and throw back the CUBS SUCK ball .
NOTE : I did not throw a ball onto the field after catching Chris Coghlan ’s first career homer .
I knew it was Chris ’ first home run and did n’t want to get kicked out .
In around the 7th inning , I was approached by this guy …
… that ’s visiting team clubhouse manager PHIL ROSEWICZ .
He came out to my seat with this …
… very cool , indeed .
But , only 1 / 2 of my request .
I do n’t blame Phil .
He was only acting at the request of the Florida Marlins .
I could sense this becoming a bigger deal than it needed to be .
Back to the story .
So , the agreement with the Florida Marlins media relations man was I would return to the Marlins dugout with the ball at the end of the game .
I did exactly that .
After being hassled by every grumpy old usher inside Miller Park , I finally made it down to the dugout after the game .
I posed one last time with the home run ball and the written requests …
… okay , it ’s no secret .
I wear the opposing team ’s hats for their portion of Batting Practice to maximize my ballhawking efforts .
Call me a poseur , call me a fake … whatever .
I call it smart .
I was then greeted by this fella …
… who said he was the on - site MLB authenticator .
Where was he before when I needed him ?
Next , the second guy to greet me …
… Media Relations Manager Marty Sewell .
Marty was all smiles at first .
Until he opened his mouth .
His first words , you ask ??
“ You better not be jerking us around . ”
“ Is this the real home run ball ? ”
“ Why did you have another ball in your hand when you made the catch ? ”
“ This is n’t the home run ball . ”
My response , you ask ?
“ Sir , this is the real home run ball .
I ca n’t explain why I had another ball in my hand .
Actually , I do n’t even remember having another ball in my hand when I made the catch . ”
I did n’t realize it until I saw the replay .
Either way you look at it , I was being accused of swapping out the baseballs .
Real classy on their part .
That ’s NOT how you start a negotiation with someone .
Take a look at how ol ’
Marty ’s tune changed in the following pics …
Good …
DAYS after Air France 's ill - fated Airbus A330 plunged mysteriously into the southern Atlantic Ocean four hours after leaving Rio de Janeiro for Paris on May 31st , rescuers were still searching for debris .
After such a long delay , all hope of finding any survivors among the 228 people aboard the stricken aeroplane was reluctantly abandoned .
The wreckage is thought to lie up to some 3,700 metres below the waves , possibly in one of the many trenches that riddle the rocky undersea mountain range west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge .
Its exact location may not be known for several weeks .

The battery - powered sonar pingers on the aeroplane 's two “ black boxes ” will carry on bleeping for a month .
Their acoustic signals carry 6,000 metres through seawater and should be detectable from the surface .
But the dense basaltic rock of the ocean floor will hinder the search party 's sonar equipment , creating erroneous echoes and shadows that mask the wreckage 's presence .
All told , it could be years before the French accident - investigation team makes its final report .
One of the hazards of flying over oceans is the lack of radar coverage .
Even the latest radar equipment can reach out no more than 550 kilometres ( 300 nautical miles ) from land .
Once out of radar range , pilots flying intercontinental routes make scheduled radio contact every half an hour or so with air - traffic control stations , behind or ahead of them , to report their positions .
The rest of the time , no one knows exactly where they are .
A number of countries , especially those surrounded by oceans or by vast expanses of rugged wilderness are none too happy with this .
America , Australia and Canada have been among the most active proponents of satellite navigation for commercial aircraft .
The Canadian authorities began operation of such a system in January .
It uses what is known in aviation circles as ADS - B , short for automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast .
The technology combines the precise position of the aircraft , as identified by global - positioning satellites , with data about its flight number , speed , direction and attitude ( whether it is climbing , descending or turning ) .
The combined data are then broadcast automatically every second to all suitably - equipped ground stations and other aircraft within a radius of 240 km ( 150 miles ) .
As a result , ground controllers and pilots can see exactly where all the traffic in the vicinity is at any given instant .
That is far more precise than today 's air - traffic control systems , in which it can take anything up to half a minute for ground controllers to get a radar fix from a passing aeroplane 's echo transponder .
An aircraft can thus be eight kilometres farther on from where it appears on an air - traffic controller 's radar screen .
Compared with conventional radar , ADS - B lets aeroplanes travel much closer together without sacrificing safety .
It offers pilots greater control over their own flight paths , so they can select more direct paths instead of having to stick to today 's zigzag routes .
Its use can allow landings to be spaced just 45 seconds apart .
The technology also provides ground controllers with valuable extra time to resolve potential conflicts before they become serious .
Trials under way by the Federal Aviation Administration in Alaska have amply demonstrated ADS - B's safety benefits .
Alaska had the worst aircraft - accident record in the whole of America but fatal accidents fell by 47 % after aeroplanes flying in south west Alaska were fitted with ADS - B transponders .
The Alaska trials have also shown that ADS - B works equally well at low altitudes and even on the ground , making it ideal for monitoring aeroplanes as they taxi and race down the runway .
The authority is now having ADS - B equipment installed at Louisville in Kentucky , and Philadelphia and Houston .
It hopes to give the go - ahead in September 2010 for ADS - B to be introduced across America .
The plan is to have the system up and running by 2013 , and all aircraft operating in American airspace fitted with ADS - B transponders by no later than 2020 .
Although ADS - B would not have prevented the crash into the Atlantic Ocean , it might well have helped locate the debris more quickly .
That is because it could allow pilots to radio their precise positions , once a second , to ground stations many thousands of kilometres away .
( The range over land is deliberately limited to 240 km to avoid overloading people with information . )
Knowing the exact location of the accident would allow rescue craft to be on the scene within hours , pulling any survivors from the water .
That too would be a great benefit of the new air - traffic - control technology .

Noctilucent Cloud Storm Panorama
P - M Hedén ( Clear Skies , TWAN )
Explanation : Noctilucent or night - shining clouds lie near the edge of space .
From about 80 kilometers above Earth 's surface , the icy clouds can still reflect sunlight even though the Sun itself is below the horizon as seen from the ground .
Usually occurring at high latitudes in summer months , the diaphanous apparitions are also known as polar mesospheric clouds and may be connected to global change in the lower atmosphere .
This impressive 360 degree panorama made from 34 separate images captures an impressive display of noctilucent clouds all over the sky .
It was recorded last month from Vallentuna , Sweden .
The photographer reports that the display was like a noctilucent cloud storm , one of the best he 's ever witnessed .
Today is System Administrator Appreciation Day .
Maybe you heard ?
If you ’re reading this blog , you probably did .
Statistically speaking , you ’re in the minority .
Most people do n’t know about it .
Heck , it ’s not a REAL holiday , so most people ca n’t be blamed .
There ’s no special section at Hallmark , you ca n’t go buy clothes on sale at Macy ’s , and we do n’t even get a banner strung across main street in a sleepy little farm town .
In the immortal words of Anonymous :
Any father who thinks he ’s all important should remind himself that this country honors fathers only one day a year while pickles get a whole week .
And Fathers Day has cards .
No , System Administrator Appreciation Day is put below many other holidays , most of which are just as made up as ours .
We ’re on the bottom rung of the holiday scale .
Administrative Professionals
Week ( formerly known as Secretary ’s Day , which got an upgrade of both nomenclature AND time span ) is fully deserved .
But more fully than System Administrator Appreciation Day ?
I ’m probably biased , but I do n’t think so .
At the same time , “ System Administrator ” is an odd sort of title .
Technically speaking , it ’s the title that I have on my business cards , but it does n’t really describe half of what I do .
I know most of you are probably the same .
“ System Administrator ” also precludes non-system administrators who are just as valuable to the infrastructure .
Many large companies ’ system administrators would n’t have much to do without the dedicated workers on the network side .
Network Admins , System Admins , security , domain , storage , and application administrators are all necessary and vital to the functioning of the entire infrastructure .
But System Administrator Appreciation
Day sort of leaves them out in the cold .
So here is what I propose : Let us take a page from the Secretaries ’ book , and rename our holiday .
Each one of those valuable people above fall under one titular umbrella : IT Administrator .
Let us celebrate “ IT Administrator Appreciation Day ” , and include the network admins , the storage admins , and let us have one unified front to present to the world , and to Hallmark .
Maybe we ’ll even get one of those cool cards with the lights and microchips .
Happy IT Administrator Appreciation Day .
I leave you with this …
Four of the five judges are from Jefferson County , which is the largest county in the state and includes Birmingham .
The fifth is from Montgomery County , where the state capitol is located .
Additionally , former state Rep. Johnny Ford of Tuskegee , a rare black Republican in Alabama , is rejoining the Democratic Party after having switched to the GOP several years ago .
Jefferson County is a mixture of Democratic black - majority Birmingham and very Republican suburbs that surround it .
The suburbs are the sort of place where you can still find W stickers and McCain / Palin stickers proudly displayed on bumpers .
Obama actually carried Jefferson County 52 % to 47 % , which was something of a surprise because even though Birmingham is black - majority it is outnumbered by the white suburbs .
So these judges switching is not as big of an earth - shaking event as if judges from Shelby or Baldwin County had switched , but it is a telling sign .
For more than 20 years the trend has been in the opposite direction -- local officials switching en masse to the GOP , following not just the voters but the fundraising prowess of the GOP .
That is starting to change .
So join me in welcoming Judges Virginia Vinson , Dan King , Eric Fancher , Sheldon Watkins and William Shashy as Alabama 's newest Democrats .

Actor David Carradine was found dead in the closet of a Bangkok hotel room Thursday with a cord wrapped around his neck and genitals , leading Thai police to suspect his death was not a suicide but an accident resulting from dangerous sex practices .
Carradine , 72 , best known for his role in the 1970s television drama " Kung Fu , " was found by a chamber maid at Bangkok 's Park Nai Lert Hotel naked and dead , slumped in a closet with cords bound and connecting his neck and his genitals , Bangkok police said .
" The two ropes were tied together , " Police Lt. Gen. Worapong Chewprecha told reporters .
" It is unclear whether he committed suicide or not or he died of suffocation or heart failure . "
Citing Porntip Rojanasunan , the director of the Central Institute of Forensic Science , told the Bangkok Post that the actor may have died from auto- erotic asphyxiation , the practice of cutting off one 's air supply to heighten sexual pleasure .
Carradine had been in Thailand since May 29 to shoot his latest film , " Stretch . "
Thai Police completed the autopsy Friday , but would not release the results until next week , Police Col. Somprasong Yenthuam told the Associated Press .
Somprasong said there was no indication that there was someone else in the room with Carradine at the time of his death .
Recently discovered court documents from the actor 's latest divorce posted by The Smoking Gunsuggest that Carradine may have have long history of " deviant sexual behavior which was potentially deadly , " according to ex-wife Marina Anderson .
In a a sworn statement filed in 2003 , Anderson also alleged that Carradine carried on an " incestuous relationship with a very close family member . "
The court documents do not include details about Carradine 's " deviant sexual behavior " or name the family member with whom Anderson alleges he had a relationship .
Carradine 's been married five times and has two children .
Born in 1936 in Hollywood , Calif. , Carradine came from a showbiz family .
His father was actor John Carradine , and his brothers were actors Bruce , Robert and Keith Carradine .
Friends of Carradine initially skeptical that the veteran actor would have intentionally killed himself were shocked at details emerging from the investigation .
" It is shocking to me that he is no longer with us .
I had been thinking about calling him for the last several days and advise anybody who has been thinking about reaching out to a loved one to do so , " said actor Michael Madsen , who worked with Carradine on " Kill Bill " and in the upcoming " Six Days in Paradise . "
" I 've just been told that possibly his hands were tied , in either the front or the back , and that there was something in his mouth , stuffed in his mouth , and that he used a rope that is used with the curtains , " said friend David Winters
Carradine 's Best - Known Roles : " Kung Fu " and " Kill Bill "
Carradine was perhaps best known for his role as Caine , a Chinese martial - arts master wandering the American West in the 1970s television series " Kung Fu . "
Though he had starred in more than 100 films , his career was most recently revived in Quentin Tarantino 's " Kill Bill " ( 2003 ) and " Kill Bill II " ( 2004 ) in which he played a steely assassin .
The actor spoke openly about his earlier abuse of drugs and alcohol but had reportedly remained sober for several years .
Friends and family said he had no history of depression .
" I did n't get into drinking till I was in my 40s , and by that time I had stepped away from the rest of drugs , " he told the Irish Times in 2004 .
" There was only a period of a few years when I was drinking too much .
I had a friend who was a mentor , and he suddenly said , ' I 've never seen you abuse a substance before . '
I said , ' Am I doing that now ? '
And I was .
That was spring of 1996 .
I like to think that I stopped drinking on St. Patrick 's Day , but it was actually a month later , " he told the paper .
Of primarily Irish ancestry , Carradine 's ambiguous features landed him a lifetime of roles playing a range of ethnicities , although he was often cast as Chinese .
He most recently starred as Poon Dong , a Chinese mobster , in the action film " Crank : High Voltage . "
New York , NY , June 4 , 2009 – In 2007 , before the current economic downturn , an American family filed for bankruptcy in the aftermath of illness every 90 seconds ; three - quarters of them were insured .
Over 60 % of all bankruptcies in the United States in 2007 were driven by medical incidents .
In an article published in the August 2009 issue of the American Journal of Medicine , the results of the first - ever national random - sample survey of bankruptcy filers shows that illnesses and medical bills contribute to a large and increasing share of bankruptcies .
The share of bankruptcies attributable to medical problems rose by 50 % between 2001 and 2007 .
Following up on a 2001 study in 5 states , where medical problems contributed to at least 46.2 % of all bankruptcies , researchers from Cambridge Hospital / Harvard Medical School , Harvard Law School and Ohio University surveyed a random national sample of 2,314 bankruptcy filers in 2007 , abstracted their court records , and interviewed 1,032 of them .
They designated bankruptcies as " medical " based on debtors ' stated reasons for filing , income loss due to illness and the magnitude of their medical debts .
Using identical definitions in 2001 and 2007 , the share of bankruptcies attributable to medical problems rose by 49.6 % .
The odds that a bankruptcy had a medical cause were 2.38 fold higher in 2007 than in 2001 .
According to the study , a number of circumstances propelled many middle - class , insured Americans into bankruptcy .
For 92 % of the medically bankrupt , high medical bills directly contributed to their bankruptcy .
Many families with continuous coverage found themselves under- insured , responsible for thousands of dollars in out - of - pocket costs .
Out - of - pocket medical costs averaged $ 17,943 for all medically bankrupt families : $ 26,971 for uninsured patients ; $ 17,749 for those with private insurance at the outset ; $ 14,633 for those with Medicaid ; $ 12,021 for those with Medicare ; and $ 6,545 for those with VA / military coverage .
For patients who initially had private coverage but lost it , the family 's out - of - pocket expenses averaged $ 22,568 .
Because almost all insurance is linked to employment , a medical event can trigger loss of coverage .
Nationally , a quarter of firms cancel coverage immediately when an employee suffers a disabling illness ; another quarter does so within a year .
Income loss due to illness was also common , but nearly always coupled with high medical bills .
Writing in the article , David U. Himmelstein , M.D. , states , " The US health care financing system is broken , and not only for the poor and uninsured .
Middle class families frequently collapse under the strain of a health care system that treats physical wounds , but often inflicts fiscal ones . "
" This study provides further evidence that the US health care system is broken , " according to James E. Dalen , M.D. , M.P.H. , University of Arizona College of Medicine , Tucson .
" Medical bankruptcy is almost a unique American phenomenon , which does not occur in countries that have national health insurance .
These long - time advocates of a single payer system give us another compelling reason to work toward this goal as a nation . "

A frank discussion with a mother of 11 on the pros and cons of large families .
Living in the exotic Old City of Jerusalem , and needing to make ends meet by renting out our guest room , I have hosted many young , accomplished American women travelers as my boarders .
Over herb tea in my kitchen , some have wanted to talk about Eastern religions , some about Israeli politics , and some about feminist issues .
One young woman confided in me her shock and dismay at discovering that most religious families have half a dozen children , and some a full dozen !
To her , this was a flagrant violation of her most cherished ideal of zero population growth .
" How can anyone who cares about the future of the planet go about brazenly overpopulating it like this ? " she asked me with a combination of disbelief and pique .
" I can understand such disregard for the problems of overpopulation in uneducated women living in third world countries , women who have never heard of birth control .
But in the religious community here , I 've been meeting educated , modern women who make a positive ideal out of large families .
Why are so many apparently intelligent women filling up their already cramped apartments and emptying their already depleted pocketbooks in an energetic effort to produce large families ? "
Having married a month short of my 39th birthday , I felt blessed to have two children – one born when I was 41 , another when I was 46 .
I certainly was not qualified to expound on the merits or demerits of large families .
So I arranged for my vexed boarder to meet with one of my teachers from a Jerusalem women 's college , an articulate mother of 11 children .
Their encounter took place across my kitchen table .
Q : Given the dire state of overpopulation in the world , is n't it socially irresponsible to give birth to eleven children ?
A : It 's very easy to attribute all the things that are wrong with the world to external causes .
But what 's really wrong with the world is violence , avarice , and callousness .
All of the problems in the world could be solved if there were good people .
It 's a qualitative , not a quantitative , issue .
The problem is n't that there are too many people .
The problem is that there are not enough good , caring people .
If you see the world in purely physical terms , then the more people , the less each one gets .
If you see the world in purely physical terms , then of course , the larger the population , the less resources are available to each person ; each one gets a smaller sliver of the pie .
But if you see the world in spiritual terms – that the planet is here to provide a setting for souls to learn and grow , and that each soul who comes into this world has a unique mission and shines a unique light – then the more people , the more light .
The issue really is :
Do more children bring more light or more darkness ?
The answer is :
It depends on how they are raised and what they are raised towards .
Certainly , the amount of spiritual light in the world is increased by the presence of more good people .
Conversely , producing just two children whose basic self - definition is as materialists and consumers , using a disproportionate amount of the world 's resources for their physical satisfaction , may deplete the world more than it benefits the world .
Q : If this is indeed the goal of your community , then we should find numerous examples of adults who are significantly helping the world .
Is this in fact true ?
A : I can tell you about my own family .
Of my children who have reached adulthood – all are in the helping professions .
Two of my daughters and one of my sons are teachers .
My second daughter directs a special education facility .
Another daughter stays at home to raise her children , but volunteers a tremendous amount of time and energy finding good foster homes for children in emergency situations .
My second son is still studying , but devotes a lot of time to outreach programs , reaching out to his fellow Jews in order to improve the spiritual quality of their lives , usually without remuneration .
My next son is finishing his term of service in the Israeli army , and also gives classes in the evening to youth .
By the way , my family is in no way exceptional .
Q : It can not be that in a family of over ten children that each child gets the attention from the parents – in terms of time and energy – that a child from a smaller family gets .
Given that , are n't you depriving your children of the attention they need to develop optimally ?
And are n't you also depriving them of the enrichments which , let 's face it , only money can buy ?
A : When you talk about time and energy – as with any other resource , you have to ask how much is required to achieve your goal .
If your goal is to heat a house for 24 hours , and you can heat that house with fifty gallons of oil , you would n't need to worry about supplying that house with a hundred gallons of oil per day .
One way to gauge if parents are giving enough attention is to look at those children as adults .
One way to gauge if parents are giving their children enough time and attention to produce well - adjusted , secure , reasonably happy , and altruistic adults , is to look at those children when they reach adulthood .
If the children are well - adjusted , secure , happy , and altruistic , then whatever amount of time and attention the parents gave them was apparently enough .
Is it accurate to say that children who grow up in small families are happier ?
More secure ?
More altruistic ?
I certainly doubt it .
I have friends with one or two children who tell me that it's a major problem in their neighborhood of a very few children to find a friend for their child to play with every afternoon .
And if the friend rejects their child , as can often happen with children , their child 's whole self - image crumbles .
In large families , where there 's always a playmate a couple years older or younger , the problem of making friends does not assume such importance .
The same is true about enrichments which cost money , such as lots of educational toys , computer programs , art lessons , etc .
I could argue that these are replacements for having a set of live - in playmates .
A brother or sister is a constant source of stimulation , which needs no batteries , never performs an illegal operation ( well , not the computer kind , anyway ) , and teaches a lot about interpersonal relationships .
If you would interview the children of large families , and ask them , " Would you rather have more toys , or another brother or sister ?
Would you rather have your parents or your siblings sit down and play dominoes with you ? " the answers might surprise you .
Q : But does n't a lot of the security in large families come from the older children raising the younger children ?
Is this fair to the older children , especially the first daughter , who often has to shoulder much of the responsibility for her younger siblings ?
A : There 's a metaphysical rule in Judaism that , in terms of material things , the more you give , the less you have , while , in terms of spirituality , the more you give , the more you are .
It may be accurate that the older children share the burden of raising their younger siblings , but this often gives them a stronger sense of self - confidence , achievement , and the ability to deal with life .
Older children who help raise younger siblings are more confident and better able to deal with life .
If you actually spent time with a large family , I think you would be impressed at how much joy there is .
Of course , every family has their share of squabbles .
But , in general , I see a lot of security , sharing , mutual inter- dependence , and laughter in my family and other large families I know .
Q : What about the women themselves ?
From the time you gave birth to your first child , at age 19 , and for the next thirty years , you 've had to work incredibly hard at keeping house , raising children , holding down a part - time job , not to mention fulfilling your other obligations .
Did n't you ever feel like having a little time for yourself ?
A : Certainly the main part of my life has been spent raising my family .
If you 're comparing me to career women or mothers of small families , the crucial question is : " Is a particular woman 's occupation satisfying to her , and does it develop her or leave her time for self - development ? "
I can't imagine an occupation which is anywhere nearly as satisfying as building people .
Could building bridges , designing clothes , constructing advertising campaigns ... could any of these be as personally satisfying as building human beings ?
Now of course , I could have been a social worker or a psychologist , who also are involved with people , but there my commitment would have been short - term .
Is n't a long - term commitment to particular people more satisfying than a revolving door - clientele ?
Let 's say I had chosen to become a psychologist instead of a mother of a large family .
The question remains : Would there be time for other interests ?
The answer is also the same :
It would be difficult , but if I wanted to fit into my schedule an exercise routine , a hobby , or an occasional outing with a friend , I could .
No one with a career pursues her own interests all day every day .
And neither do I .
Q : You must admit to some level of physical exhaustion .
Waking up in the middle of the night to nurse a baby for years , or even decades , on end must take its toll .
A : Exhaustion is a real issue .
And the fact is , again , that many other careers demand a tremendous expenditure of energy and time .
One does n't stop brain surgery in the middle to play a round of tennis ( hopefully , that is ) .
This is an issue that has to be dealt with through prioritization .
Of course , taking care of oneself is as important as taking care of someone else .
No matter what comes up in the afternoons , I give myself a nap from 2 o'clock to 3:30 .
Everyone in the family knows that mother is resting during that time , and no one dares disturb me .
This is a matter of discipline .
A mother of a large family will work herself into exhaustion if she does n't learn how to prioritize .
Many women fail in this discipline .
They feel the need for a nap , but then the phone rings , and they can't resist answering it .
Or the baby falls asleep , and instead of jumping into bed that minute , and getting a solid two hours ' nap , they decide to " just " do the dishes and " just " fold the laundry , and before they know it , their two hours have disappeared .
Women also have to learn not to sacrifice their rest on the altar of their self - image .
In the above example , the mother might feel less of a homemaker if her husband comes home to a sink full of dirty dishes , or the laundry remains unfolded .
But , so what ?
That 's what I mean by " prioritization . "
Q : Do you have household help ?
A : I always had household help , because I work out of the house during the morning hours .
I 'm a teacher – this is for me a secondary career which I engage in for my own fulfillment .
Most of what I earn goes to pay for household help .
I do n't believe that the mother has to be the one who washes the dishes and folds the laundry .
Q : But you do believe that the mother has to be the one to raise the children .
By working outside the home , are n't you hiring someone else to raise your children ?
A : In Israel , children go to government preschools from the age of three .
It 's true that I did leave my toddlers in the morning hours with hired help .
But I carefully chose someone whose career was to take care of children , and I paid her a third or more of what I made .
In fact , the woman who worked for us for twenty years was regarded like a member of our family .
She was an older , childless woman , who treated my children like the grandchildren she never had .
I paid her a significant portion of my earnings , far more than the going rate , because I considered top- quality childcare a priority .
I considered my children an investment worthy of her .
Q : In almost all countries where people have large families , the government ends up giving large doles to support the children .
I understand that the Israeli government gives quite generous child allowances .
Is n't this an unfair drain on the taxpayers ?
A : The child allowances here are not what most people would consider " quite generous . "
They amount to around $ 100 per child , so no family actually lives off the government grant .
I would like to point out something about the government 's intent .
The Israeli government realizes that its greatest resource is people .
Israel is not Texas nor Montana .
We do not have oil , mineable ore , or miles of rolling fields of grain from sea to shining sea .
If Israel is going to succeed , we need highly motivated , able people .
Nobody can provide the state with this manpower without having them .
Q : In all honesty , during the years when you were producing children at a rate of one every two years , did n't you feel like a baby machine ?
A : I certainly did sometimes feel like I was involved in a cycle of meaningful work that was n't always spontaneous or exciting , but I would say that this is true in every career .
A doctor seeing her fourth earache of the day does not feel the same excitement and inspiration as when performing her first heart surgery .
A professor marking the 37th freshman paper on Hamlet may also find it tedious .
I think that the concept of careers outside the home has been overly glamorized .
Every career has its monotonous components .
And every career has its peak moments of inspiration and creativity .
Motherhood is second to none in the frequency of such moments .
In all honesty , how could producing a book or a computer program be anywhere nearly as gratifying as producing a human being ?
For those who want to see a bit of what Waxman will would do to this country , here are some of the provisions , which can be found at FOOD FREEDOM .
http://foodfreedom.wordpress.com/...
Alarming Provisions :
Some of the more alarming provisions in the bill are :
* HR 2749 would impose an annual registration fee of $ 500 on any " facility " that holds , processes , or manufactures food .
[ is n't this every home in the US , every garden ? ]
Although " farms " are exempt , the agency has defined " farm " narrowly .
[ What is the definition ? ]
And people making foods such as lacto - fermented vegetables , cheeses , or breads would be required to register and pay the fee , which could drive beginning and small producers out of business during difficult economic times .
[ Yes .
There are laws against this corporate - size - destroys - the - little - guy policy , are n't there ?
Are home bread or cheese or lacto - fermented vegetable makers who make for their own families included in this ? ]
* HR 2749 would empower FDA to regulate how crops are raised and harvested .
It puts the federal government right on the farm , dictating to our farmers .
[ What is missing in pointing out this astounding control , is that it opens the door to CODEX and WTO " good farming practices " will include the elimination of organic farming by eliminating manure , mandating GMO animal feed , imposing animal drugs , and ordering applications of petrochemical fertilizers and pesticides .
Farmers , thus , will be locked not only into the industrialization of once normal and organic farms but into the forced purchase of industry 's products .
They will be slaves on the land , doing the work they are ordered to do - against their own best wisdom - and paying out to industry against their will .
There will be no way to be frugal , to grow one 's own grain to feed the animals , to raise healthy animals without GMO grains or drugs , to work with nature at all .
Grassfed cattle and poultry and hogs will be finished .
So , it needs to be made clear where control will take us .
And were n't these the " rumors on the internet " that were dismissed but are clearly the case ? ]
* HR 2749 would give FDA the power to order a quarantine of a geographic area , including " prohibiting or restricting the movement of food or of any vehicle being used or that has been used to transport or hold such food within the geographic area . "
[ This - that has been used to transport or hold such food - would mean all cars that have ever brought groceries home so this means ALL TRANSPORTATION can be shut down under this .
This is using food as a cover for martial law . ]
Under this provision , farmers markets and local food sources could be shut down , even if they are not the source of the contamination .
The agency can halt all movement of all food in a geographic area .
[ This is also a means of total control over the population under the cover of food , and at any time . ]
* HR 2749 would empower FDA to make random warrantless searches of the business records of small farmers and local food producers , without any evidence whatsoever that there has been a violation .
[ If these bills cover all who " hold food " then this allows for taking of records of anyone at any time on no basis at all . ]
Even farmers selling direct to consumers would have to provide the federal government with records on where they buy supplies , how they raise their crops , and a list of customers .
[ NAIS for animals and all other foods ? ]
* HR 2749 charges the Secretary of Health and Human Services with establishing a tracing system for food .
Each " person who produces , manufactures , processes , packs , transports , or holds such food " [ Is this not every home in the US ? ] would have to " maintain the full pedigree of the origin and previous distribution history of the food , " and " establish and maintain a system for tracing the food that is interoperable with the systems established and maintained by other such persons . "
The bill does not explain how far the traceback will extend or how it will be done for multi-ingredient foods .
With all these ambiguities , [ with all these ambiguities , it is dangerous , period , separate from the money ] it 's far from clear how much it will cost either the farmers or the taxpayers .
[ It is massive and absurd and burdensome beyond the capacity of people to comply - is this not fascism ? - so it is a set up for being used to impose penalties endlessly and / or to eliminate anyone at will . ]
* HR 2749 creates severe criminal and civil penalties , including prison terms of up to 10 years and / or fines of up to $ 100,000 for each violation for individuals .
[ Does it include judicial review , Congressional oversight , a defined and limited set of penalties and punishments for a defined set of " crimes " ?
Or is it entirely ambiguous and left to the whim and sole power of " the Administrator " ?
Who is that person set to be ?
Is it Michael Taylor , Monsanto lawyer and executive , as Food Democracy has said ?
That is , do these bills set up an agency by which the entire US food supply will be turned over to the control of a multinational corporation under WTO regulations ( and not to US farmers and not to US laws under the Constitution ) , with boundless freedom to do what it wants , and one infamous for harm to farmers and lack of safety of food ? ]
If it was not clear before how frightening these bills were , this small section of provisions , should make their actual fascism clear now .
It goes way beyond " food safety " to absolute control over farms , animals , food , and us , including our movements and access to food at all .
( CNN ) -- Four U.S. troops were killed in eastern Afghanistan on Monday in what NATO 's International Security Assistance Force said was a roadside bombing , according to a senior U.S. official there .
U.S. Marines take part in an operation to push Taliban fighters out of Herati , Afghanistan , on Sunday .
The deaths would raise the total of U.S. military fatalities in Afghanistan to 30 in July , the highest monthly toll since the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in October 2001 .
The bombing comes amid an uptick in fighting across Afghanistan , where international forces and Afghan troops have been battling the Taliban .
Part of the intensified fighting is due to a U.S. - led offensive in southern Afghanistan 's Helmand province , a Taliban stronghold and poppy - growing region .
The forces are trying to gain and hold ground in the perilous region ahead of national elections this August .
Last week , the total of international military fatalities in Afghanistan for July surpassed the previous record tally for one month .
The previous mark was 46 ; counting Monday 's deaths , the total for July would be at least 56 , a CNN count of official statistics shows .
Monday 's deaths would put the number of U.S. troops who have died in Afghanistan since October 2001 at 659 .

Springer - Konzern will neue Zwangsabgabe auf Computer Peter Mühlbauer
Mit dem eingenommenen
Geld sollen Verlage subventioniert werden
Der Springer - Konzern , der unter anderem die Bild - Zeitung und die Welt veröffentlicht , glaubt nicht mehr an die Marktwirtschaft .
Zumindest dann , wenn es um die Gelegenheit geht , Geld auf einfachere Weise einzuziehen .
Auf dem Horizont Online Marketing Kongress forderte Peter Würtenberger , der Chief Marketing Officer der Axel Springer AG , eine neue Zwangsabgabe auf Computer , die zusätzlich zur bisher bestehenden Abgabe für die GEZ erhoben werden soll .
Die VG
Wort hatte bereits vor einigen Jahren versucht , eine solche Abgabe zu verlangen , scheiterte aber vor dem Bundesgerichtshof , der im letzten Herbst entschied , dass diese Geräteabgabe nach bestehender Rechtslage nur dann erhoben werden kann , wenn der PC zusammen mit Drucker und Scanner verkauft wird , da Computer alleine nicht zur Herstellung fotomechanischer Vervielfältigungen geeignet sind .
Vorlagen für die Forderung Würtenbergers waren unter anderem der Heidelberger Appell , eine monatelange Kampagne der FAZ und zuletzt ein Artikel von Hubert Burda .
Der forderte unter anderem eine Umsatzbeteiligung bei Google und begründete dies mit der Rolle des " Qualitätsjournalismus " für die " Demokratie " .
In Blogs sah man darin einen Hinweis an die Politik , dass sie auf gefällige Berichterstattung angewiesen sei und deshalb alles unternehmen müsse , dass diese weiterhin so funktioniert wie bisher .
Würtenberger behauptete , dass Google den " Content " von Verlagen als " kostenloses Vermarktungsasset " nutzen würde und äußerte " Verständnis " für das Anliegen Burdas , der auch ein " erweitertes " Leistungsschutzrecht für Verlage forderte , mit dem die " Nutzung " von Texten vergütungspflichtig werden soll .
Dies würde nicht nur Google betreffen , sondern auch viele Blogs , die sich auf Medienkritik spezialisiert haben und darauf angewiesen sind , aus anderen Texten zu zitieren .
Hintergrund der Forderungen Burdas und Würtenbergers ist unter anderem , dass Google beim Akquirieren von Online - Werbung bisher wesentlich erfolgreicher agiert als die deutschen Zeitungsverleger .
So sollen einer Studie zufolge von insgesamt 2,5 Milliarden Euro Online - Werbevolumen 1,5 Milliarden Euro an das Unternehmen mit Sitz im kalifornischen Mountain View gehen .
Die restliche Milliarde verteilt sich danach auf etwa 600 Millionen Euro für Social Communities und Ähnliches sowie jeweils 200 auf Partnerprogramme und Verlagsangebote mit journalistischen Inhalten .
Zur neuen Skepsis an der Marktwirtschaft passt , dass der Springer - Vorstandsvorsitzende Mathias Döpfner heute ankündigte , sich im Oktober mit ehemaligen Gegnern aus der Studentenbewegung " an einen Tisch setzen " und Vergangenheitsbewältigung betreiben zu wollen .
Die geplante Tagung ist für Döpfner eine Fortsetzung des " Springer Tribunals " , das im Februar 1968 von dem von Hans Magnus Enzensberger angeführten " Republikanischen Club " ins Leben gerufen wurde , um die Rolle des Verlages beim Tod des Studenten Benno Ohnesorg aufzuklären .
Heute sieht Enzensberger seinen Hauptfeind nicht mehr im Springer - Konzern , sondern in Google .
Der Spiegel und die Zeit , deren Verleger Rudolf Augstein und Gerd Bucerius das Tribunal damals finanziell unterstützten , sollen dem Willen Döpfners nach " auch diesmal wieder einen kleinen Obolus zur Unkostendeckung entrichten " .
Auch diese beiden Verlagshäuser sind sich in ihren aktuellen politischen Forderungen mittlerweile weitgehend mit Springer einig und unterzeichneten im Juni eine Erklärung , in der sie von der Bundesregierung die Gewährung eines neuen Monopolrechts fordern .
( Peter Mühlbauer )
The 9 - year - old girl had been raped by her father .
She was 18 weeks pregnant .
Carrying the baby to term , going through labor and delivery , would have ripped her small body apart .
There was no doctor in her rural Southern town to provide her with an abortion .
No area hospital would even consider taking her case .
Susan Hill , the president of the National Women ’s Health Foundation , which operates reproductive health clinics in areas where abortion services are scarce or nonexisistent , called Dr. George Tiller , the Wichita , Kan. , ob - gyn who last Sunday was shot to death by an abortion foe in the entry foyer of his church .
She begged .
“ I only asked him for a favor when it was a really desperate story , not a semi - desperate story , ” she told me this week .
Tiller was known to abortion providers — and opponents — as the “ doctor of last resort ” — the one who took the patients no one else would touch .
“ He took her for free , ” she said .
“ He kept her three days .
He checked her himself every few hours .
She and her sister came back to me and said he could n’t have been more wonderful .
That ’s just the way he was . ”
Other patients of Dr. Tiller ’s shared their stories this week on a special “ Kansas Stories ” page hosted by the Web site “ A Heartbreaking Choice . ”
One New York mother wrote of having been referred by an obstetrician to Tiller after learning , in her 27th week of pregnancy , that her soon - to - be son was “ so very sick ” that , once born , he ’d have nothing more than “ a brief life of respirators , dialysis , surgeries and pain . ”
In - state doctors refused to perform an abortion .
“ The day I drove up to the clinic in Wichita , Kansas , to undergo the procedure that would end the life of my precious son , I also walked into the nightmare of abortion politics .
In this world , reality rarely gets through the rhetoric , ” wrote another mother , from Texas , of the shouts , graphic posters and protesters ’ video camera that greeted her when she came to see Tiller .
Our understanding of what late abortion is like has been almost entirely shaped in public discourse by the opponents of abortion rights .
In recent years , discussions of the issue have been filled with the gory details of so - called partial - birth abortion ; the grim miseries that drive some women and girls to end their pregnancies after the first trimester have somehow been elided .
“ Late abortion is not a failure of contraception .
It ’s for medical reasons , ” Eleanor Smeal , the president of the Feminist Majority Foundation , who has worked to defend abortion providers like Tiller against harassment and violence since the mid-1980s , told me this week .
“ We ’ve made pregnancy a fairy tale where there are no fetal complications , there ’s no cancer , no terrible abuse of girls , no cases where to make a girl go all the way through a pregnancy is to destroy her .
These are the realities of the story .
That ’s what Dr. Tiller worked with — the realities . ”
There was a great deal of emotion in the air this week as the reality of Tiller ’s death set in .
Much of it was mournful , some was celebratory , some was cynical and self - serving .
There were the requisite expressions of disapproval and disavowal by politicians from both sides of the abortion divide .
And yet it seemed to me that even from pro-choice politicians , the response was muted .
In death , as in life , no one wanted to embrace this man who had specialized in helping women who learned late in their pregnancies that their fetuses had gross abnormalities .
It seemed that no one wanted to be too closely associated with the muck and mire of what Tiller had to do in carrying out the risky and emotionally traumatic second - and third - trimester abortions that other doctors and hospitals refused to do .
In news reports , there was a tendency to frame the “ abortion doctor ’s ” murder almost as a kind of combat death : a natural occupational hazard .
Yet Tiller — who went to work in a bulletproof vest , lived in a gated community and drove a bulletproof car — was a doctor , not a soldier .
And it is precisely this kind of thinking — this viewing of his life and work through the lens of our most gruesome cultural warfare , this slippage and mixing up of medicine and politics — that left him largely unprotected at the time of his death .
Someone resembling Scott Roeder , the man charged in Dr. Tiller ’s murder , was seen on Saturday trying to pour glue into the lock on the back door of a Kansas City clinic .
Before that , abortion providers around the country had been telling local law enforcement and the United States Justice Department that harassment at their clinics was on the rise , and they were scared .
The Feminist Majority Foundation had been hearing all spring that the atmosphere outside clinics was heating up in the wake of the new pro-choice president ’s election .
“ We all lived through Clinton , the shootings in ’93 and ’ 94 .
We were concerned some of the extremists said they had to take the fight ‘ back to the streets , ’ ” Smeal said .
There are legal protections in place that ought to keep abortion providers like Tiller safe .
The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances ( FACE ) Act , passed by Congress after the 1993 murder of Dr. David Gunn outside his Pensacola , Fla. , women ’s health clinic and the attempted murder of Tiller that same year , prohibits property damage , acts or threats of force , and interference with and intimidation of anyone entering a reproductive health care facility .
When the federal law is backed by complementary state laws , and when local law enforcement officers apply those laws assiduously , serious violence greatly declines .
When the law ’s not applied strenuously , when vandalism goes uninvestigated , when protesters are allowed to photograph or videotape patients arriving at women ’s health clinics , when death threats are n’t followed up , more serious acts of physical violence follow .
In fact , when intimidation occurs at a clinic , the reported rate of violence triples , the Feminist Majority Federation ’s 2008 National Clinic Violence Survey found .
“ We really do need to arrest people who are trespassing .
Arrest people who are gluing locks .
Committing more minor violations of the law so criminal activity does n’t escalate , so these criminals do n’t feel emboldened , ” said Vicki Saporta , the president of the National Abortion Federation .
“ In places where the laws are enforced , you do n’t see violence escalate .
Protesters generally go someplace where there ’s a more hospitable climate , ” she told me .
But , she added , in a lot of communities , law enforcement views clinic violence as a political problem .
“ They do n’t view it for what it is : criminal activity outside of a commercial establishment , ” she said .
“ Law enforcement ca n’t treat this as a political issue .
It ’s a criminal issue . ”
We as a nation cannot continue to provide a hospitable environment for the likes of Roeder because the thought of what happens to fetuses in late abortions turns our stomachs .
We have to accept that sometimes terrible things happen to young girls .
We have to face the fact that sometimes desired pregnancies go tragically wrong .
We have to weigh our repugnance for late abortion against the consequences for women and girls of being denied life - saving medical treatment .
Only a tiny handful of doctors in this country will , like Dr. Tiller , provide abortion services for girls or women who are advanced in their pregnancies .
These doctors are n’t well known to patients or even to other doctors , but they ’re closely monitored by anti-abortion groups , who know where they work , where they live and where they worship .
Roeder may have been a lone gunman , but in the largest possible sense , he did not act alone .
The location of Tiller ’s gated community was prominently featured on an easily - accessed Web site , along with a map of the streets surrounding his house .
It was really only a matter of time before someone was unbalanced enough to take the bait .
Most Americans , I ’m sure , do not believe that a 9 - year - old should be forced to bear a child , or that a woman should have no choice but to risk her life to carry a pregnancy to term .
By averting our eyes from the ugliness and tragedy that accompany some pregnancies , we have allowed anti-abortion activists to define the dilemma of late abortion .
We have allowed them to isolate and vilify doctors like Tiller .
We can no longer be complicit — through our muted disapproval or our complacency — in domestic terror .
A new drive to contain the spread of HIV / Aids in Laos is forcing officials to recognise a marginalised group - transgender men known as " katheoy " .
The BBC's Jill McGivering went to meet some of them in the capital , Vientiane .
Discrimination can make it hard for katheoys to find work Khom was born male .
But she has thought of herself as female since she was about nine years old .
Now 28 , she could easily be accepted as a woman .
She has long , styled hair , make - up , and a gentle , feminine manner .
But when she talks about her experiences of being " katheoy " in Laos , her voice is solemn .
They 're not fully accepted , she says .
She uses the example of trying to find a job .
If she fills in an application form , it always needs a photograph as well .
The selectors look at his gender - " male " - and at the photograph .
It goes in the wastepaper bin , and she never gets called for interview .
High - risk
But after being largely ignored for so long , katheoys like Khom are suddenly the focus of attention from the Lao government .
Some are " long - haired " katheoys like Khom , who present themselves as women .
Others are " short - haired " katheoys who present themselves as men .
Both groups have sex with men .
They have emerged as the country 's highest risk group for HIV / Aids - and are now the target of a special campaign .
Sex education is vital in the fight against HIV / Aids In Vientiane , I visited one of three new men's health and social centres which target katheoys and their male partners .
The centres have free internet access , dance classes and a social programme - alongside education about safe sex and condom use , and a doctor 's clinic which specialises in treating sexually transmitted infections .
Rob Gray of the charity Population Services International showed me around it , and explained the particular focus on katheoys and other men who have sex with men .
Last year , he told me , a government survey found the HIV rate amongst men who have sex with men in Vientiane was 5.6 % .
For Laos , that 's very high - higher than the rate amongst other high - risk groups , including female sex workers .
There are now plans for a nationwide survey which should be completed later this year and give a much broader picture .
' Unthinkable ' behaviour For Laos government officials , mostly drawn from the older generation , addressing the issue of men having sex with men has apparently not been easy .
Five years ago , say health officials , it would have been unthinkable .
Dr Chansy Phimphachanh is the director of the government 's Centre for HIV / Aids .
It has been a struggle , she says , to get senior leaders to understand and confront the idea of sexual behaviour which seems to them to be unorthodox .
Dr Chansy Phimphachanh says ignorance has been an obstacle " The first time we really held a meeting about men who have sex with men , it was hard for policymakers and some government officials to recognise this .
At the beginning , it was very hard .
The issue was new and it was hard to explain it .
Now we can talk about it much more openly . "
Wider Lao society seems far more in touch with katheoy culture - and generally tolerant of it .
I went with Khom and her friend to walk along the banks of the Mekong river .
Families were having picnics under the trees in the sweltering heat .
Children were playing on the nearby swings , and vendors were selling cooked meat and cold drinks from carts .
' Third ' gender Everyone I asked knew exactly what katheoys were .
Many people described them as a " third " gender .
One or two people frowned when they saw Khom and her friend pass .
One man said he would rather not talk to katheoys .
But most people seemed sympathetic .
I just want to be accepted and not separated from the rest of society
Khom , transgender Lao
" It 's their nature , they were born that way .
They can't help it , " shrugged one middle - aged man .
I asked one man how he would feel if his son was katheoy .
" I 'd be disappointed , " he said .
" But I 'd learn to live with it .
It 's not something you can change . "
The issue of HIV prevention may force Laos to acknowledge its population of katheoys more fully .
Khom certainly hopes for greater tolerance .
" I just want to be accepted , " she told me , " and not separated from the rest of society . "

Never mind , I was beaten on this three times over .
Only two sizes of black holes have ever been spotted : small and super - massive .
Scientists have long speculated that an intermediate version must exist , but they 've never been able to find one until now .
Astrophysicists identified what appears to be the first - ever medium - sized black hole , pictured in an artist 's rendition above , with a mass at least 500 times that of our Sun .
Researchers from the Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements in France detected the middling hole in a galaxy about 290 million light - years from Earth .
The discovery may shed some light on the origins of super - sized black holes like the one at the center of our own galaxy .
These astral heavyweights top out at several million to several billion times the mass of the Sun , but their origin remains a mystery .
Small black holes , between three and 20 times the mass of the sun , are created when big stars collapse and leave behind a gravitational pull strong enough to block nearby light rays .
Researchers have speculated that super - massive black holes result from the successive fusion of many smaller black holes .
But without finding evidence of a medium - size hole , it was a tough theory to prove .
" The existence of such intermediate - mass black holes is in dispute , " the French scientists wrote Wednesday in Nature , " and though many candidates have been proposed , none are widely accepted as definitive . "
The new discovery is the most convincing evidence to date that medium black holes exist .
Using the European Space Agency 's XMM - Newton X - ray space telescope , the researchers identified a radiation source that gives off X - rays 260 million times brighter than the radiation of the Sun .
Called " Hyper - Luminous X - ray Source 1 , " the structure sits on the edge of galaxy ESO 243- 49 .
Because of the source 's physical characteristics and the pattern of its radiation , the researchers conclude it must be a black hole more than 500 times the mass of the sun : not too big , not too small , and the first of its kind .

Digital content owners continue to emphasise enforcement and protection of intellectual property .
However , the impact that litigation and legislation have had with the purpose of limiting illegal file sharing remains questionable , thus setting the stage for new economic models and approaches that could serve as a remedy .
Recent aggressive attempts by a government to limit file sharing include France ’s HADOPI law , which is heavily criticised for being unenforceable and could possibly violate constitutional protections .
The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and affiliates ’ litigation campaign in the United States , which has gone on for five years and led to over 30,000 lawsuits , has hardly deterred illegal file sharing .
Despite other initiatives around the world in addition to actions taken in France and in the United States , artists or music companies are paid for only about 5 percent of all music files that are downloaded worldwide , according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) .
Content owners of video , games , and other digitised media also share the same plight .
In many respects , the RIAA ’s litigation campaign and other more aggressive copyright protection and enforcement measures may turn out to be just a blip in new media ’s history .
Instead , new distribution models are likely to emerge that appease both content owners and consumers while replacing established commercial channels , such as CDs and even more modernistic online music sales .
Indeed , while the IFPI and the RIAA , for example , still maintain rigorous enforcement policies on behalf of their affiliates , these associations also now back alternative business models for digital content distribution .
“ There is this sort of idea , on one hand , that copyright enforcement and the development of new business models are in opposition to each other .
But they have been replaced by an assumption that they go hand in hand , ” said Adrian Strain , a spokesman for the IFPI London .
“ There is enforcing the law , and on the other hand , there is the development of very interesting and proper digital services to consumers . ”
But what alternatives exist that can appease those with royalty interests as well as meet the demand of consumers , especially those who actively engage in sharing copyright - protected media files ?
We look at some future models file sharing could take during the coming years .
Free Music with Paid Ads
The idea of unfettered access to music and video files free of charge may seem to fly in the face of industry copyright - protection and enforcement philosophies .
Yet , the IFPI / RIAA has begun to embrace music streaming sites such as Deezer and Spotify that use ad revenues to pay royalties when songs are accessed .
However , while ad - revenue generating platforms that offer free content are something to consider , the commercial viability of these streaming sites remains uncertain .
“ The industry will have to take into account the proliferation of interactive platforms and the common goods that are emerging from them , which should rather lead to a share of ads revenues rather than a strict application of DMCA [ the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act ] , which is sometimes far too strict , ” said Philippe Gillieron , an attorney with Switzerland - based Bianchi , Carnice , Christin , and de Coulon .
“ The future of all these systems will obviously also depend upon the way service providers can monetise this interactivity , an issue that largely remains unsolved so far except for ads revenues , whose sustainable growth , however , remains dubious in the long run in my opinion . ”
Just as newspapers struggle to compensate for losses from their print operations with online advertising sales , websites may also struggle to make money with advertising while paying royalty fees for music and other content accessed by users free of charge .
“ If this kind of offer becomes more and more popular , conversely , the number of people buying music will diminish , ” said Nicolas Maubert , an attorney in the IP , Telecommunications , Media , and Technology department for the Paris - based law firm Gide Loyrette Nouel , referring to Deezer .
“ This means that all the majors ( who have signed deals with Deezer ) will very likely want to renegotiate these deals and increase the price to be paid by Deezer , meaning that Deezer in turn will need to find additional sources of revenues . ”
In Asia , and particularly in China where hundred of millions of users take advantage of unfettered file sharing and unlicensed streaming sites with little , if any , risk of legal consequences , major media companies have begun to accept free downloads by consumers in exchange for advertising revenues .
EMI , the Warner Music Group and Universal Music , for example , formed an alliance earlier this year with Google for free music file downloads for users in China .
The move was largely seen as example of record companies throwing up their hands in a region where copyright enforcement laws in China are largely inexistent compared to Western countries .
Still , the future of file sharing China as well as in Japan remains murky , although a new legal framework could still emerge in these regions , said Joichi Ito , CEO of Creative Commons , who said that his comments did not necessarily reflect those of his firm .
“ I think the legal roadmap for both China and Japan are unpredictable and thus I ’d hate to predict them , ” Ito said .
“ However , they are evolving and I hope and almost predict that some sort of compulsory licenses scheme gets implemented at some point . ”
The End of Open PC Systems
The personal computer ( PC ) serves as the box from which files are exchanged , while the internet serves as the pipes through which digitised copies of content are distributed .
Both were designed to facilitate the free exchange of files between users .
These open systems are also the main technology enablers allowing users to exchange millions of files that violate copyright protections on any given day .
Content providers have sought to use digital rights management ( DRM ) software to block users from making digital copies in the past , yet easy - to - install DRM - cracking software and consumer backlash have largely served to end its adoption .
But now , the wide - scale adoption of new original equipment manufacturers ( OEM ) devices , such as video consoles , video players , set - top boxes , and smart phones , make file sharing more difficult due to their closed architectures , unlike the more open PC platforms .
A video game cartridge for game consoles , for example , is difficult to copy and distribute over the internet compared to the file format of PC versions of the same game .
In the case of emerging multimedia products for the PlayStation , the Wii , and the Xbox , such as “ Rock Band ” and “ Guitar Hero , ” the content remains largely locked while several royalty streams exist , including money paid for use of copyright - protected songs as well as to the game developers .
Other new similar locked - down products should also emerge for digitised content .
If consumer demand shifts away from open - system PCs to more closed systems , then illegal distribution of media content would thus likely be significantly hampered .
“ On a standard PC , a workaround to DRM has traditionally been a mere double - click away , ” said Jonathan Zittrain , a professor at Harvard Law School and co-founder of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society .
“ That ’s harder with , say , an iPhone , since the vendor gets to control what will and wo n’t run on the phone , short of some much more labour - intensive hacking . ”
Still , some legal experts and representatives from digital rights consumer groups still doubt that closed OEM systems will completely replace open systems in the future , even if locked - down devices replace the PC model as the main consumer computer .
“ Closed systems proliferate because they offer experiences that cannot be found elsewhere ( iPod mobility , Xbox Live , etc. ) , but consumers are not giving up open platforms .
If anything , consumers are increasingly comfortable with owning multiple networked devices for multiple activities , ” said Fred von Lohmann , a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) .
“ File sharing capabilities are also increasingly being baked into inexpensive stand - alone devices , such as network - attached storage drives , so consumers no longer need to rely on PCs for file sharing . ”
Some observers maintain that even if closed hardware systems were to successfully end the issue of lost royalty payments due to massive file sharing , the adoption of hardware equivalents of DRM software could prove harmful for consumers in the long run , while carrying inherent risks .
“ [ Locked - down hardware ] is designed to treat their owners as attackers , and to carry out policy that is adverse to their owners , at the behest of remote parties , without the owner ’s consent and sometimes without their knowledge .
This is a bad way to design systems from a security perspective , ” said Cory Doctorow , a successful science fiction writer , net activist , and editor of blog boingboing .
net .
“ It means that our world is slowly filling up with devices , which if hijacked – either by a media company with dumb ideas about its business model , or by a would - be monopolist seeking lock - in , or by criminals seeking to abuse and rob a user – are designed to give the hijacker the advantage over the user , ” he said .
Global Licences
Some policy decision makers around the world have begun to advocate a system that would enable consumers to pay a fee , possibly to service providers that would pay for unlimited file downloading of content .
William Fisher of Harvard Law School and others in mostly academic circles a few years ago touted the idea .
Patrick Bloche , the national media secretary for France ’s Socialist Party and the mayor of Paris ’ 11th arrondissement , is among the backers of a common licence .
Such a model , under which consumers would pay a monthly fee for unfettered media - file sharing , would also pay the artists more handsome royalties compared to how they are now compensated , Bloche said .
“ The new [ HADOPI ] law will not pay most artists a single euro more , ” Bloche said .
“ A ‘creative fee ’ paid could generated 400 million euros per year for artists and content developers . ”
One potential drawback involved in paying a common licence fee is that it could be difficult to administer , attorney Gillieron said .
“ The problem for most people is that such a system turns what should be a remuneration ( which should bear some relation with the actual consumption of the work ) to a mere tax system , ” Gillieron said .
But in the long run , whether content royalties are paid for with a monthly fee or through ad revenues , content owners will eventually “ benefit from abundance rather than scarcity , ” Harvard law professor Zittrain said .
“ With better internet connectivity , more and more people will be persuaded to enjoy their entertainment ‘ just in time , ’ streamed at the moment they want it , as part of an environment – a social network or a virtual world – where there are more opportunities for control and gate keeping , ” Zittrain said .
“ The idea of obsessing over who holds a ‘ gold ’ copy of a song ( namely , everyone who possesses a CD of it or a file ripped in good quality from the CD ) will seem antediluvian . ”
Metal Gear Solid fans felt an explosion of extreme fandom as Metal Gear Solid : Rising and Metal Gear Solid : Peace Walker were both announced at this year ’s E3 .
Both titles will be coming to PlayStation platforms , one being on PS3 ( Rising ) , and the other being on PSP ( Peace Walker ) .
Though many would believe that Metal Gear Solid : Rising as the true Metal Gear Solid 5 , that just is n’t the case .
Famitsu recently interviewed Hideo Kojima , who revealed that he will be fully involved in the PSP title , Peace Walker .
He will serve as the game ’s director , producer , and game designer .
Kojima calls Peace Walker the “ Metal Gear Solid 5 inside me . ”
Along to Rising now , Kojima said that he will not be involved as much as he is with Peace Walker .
He told this to Famitsu Magazine :
“ I ’m not the director .
I ’m not doing game design either .
Although , I do issue complaints ( laughs ) .
But , not too much . ”
Although he does n’t have much of an importance in Rising as he does in Peace Walker , Kojima still describes Rising as the “ next generation Metal Gear Solid 5 . ”
Stay tuned on PlayStation LifeStyle for more information on both of these new Metal Gear titles .

S is for Starlink Satellites Monday was the last night it 's been clear enough to see Comet Neowise .
I shot some photos with the Rebel , but I have n't quite figured out the alignment and stacking needed for decent astrophotos , so I do n't have much to show .
I can't even see the ion tail .
The interesting thing about Monday besides just getting to see the comet was the never - ending train of satellites .

Comet C/2020 F3 NEOWISE in the evening sky Comet C/2020 F3 NEOWISE continues to improve , and as of Tuesday night it has moved into the evening sky ( while also still being visible in the morning for a few more days ) .
I caught it Tuesday night at 9:30 pm .
The sky was still a bit bright , and although the comet was easy in binoculars , it was a struggle to see it with the unaided eye .
However , over the next fifteen minutes the sky darkened , and it looked pretty good by 9:50 , considering the partly cloudy sky .
I did n't attempt a photograph ; this photo is from Sunday morning , in twilight and with a bright moon .

Solstice Sun Dagger Today is the summer solstice .
Happy solstice !
When I was in grade school -- probably some time around 7th grade -- I happened upon an article in Scientific American about the Anasazi Sun Dagger on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon .
On the solstices and equinoxes , a thin dagger of light is positioned just right so that it moves across a spiral that 's carved into the rock .
I was captivated .
What an amazing sight it must be , I thought .
I wondered if ordinary people were allowed to go see it .
Well , by the time I was old enough to do my own traveling , the answer was pretty much no .
Too many people were visiting Fajada Butte ...

F is for Food Waste I keep seeing people claim that 40 % of consumer food in the US is thrown away uneaten , or hear statistics like 20 pounds of wasted food per person per month .
I keep seeing people claim that 40 % of consumer food in the US is thrown away uneaten , or hear statistics like 20 pounds of wasted food per person per month .
I simply do n't believe it .
There 's no question that some food is wasted .
It 's hard to avoid having that big watermelon go bad before you have a chance to finish it all , especially when you 're a one - or two - person household and the market wo n't sell you a quarter pound of cherries or half a pound of ground beef .
And then there 's all the stuff you do n't want to eat : the bones , the fat , the banana peels and apple cores , the artichoke leaves and corn cobs .
But even if you count all that ... 40 percent ?
2/3 of a pound per day per person ?
And that 's supposed to be an average -- so if Dave and I are throwing out a few ounces , somebody else would have to be throwing out multiple pounds a day .
It just does n't seem possible .
Who would do that ?
When you see people quoting a surprising number -- especially when you see the same big number quoted by lots of people -- you should always ask yourself the source of the number .

Plotting Epicycles Galen Gisler , our master of Planetarium Tricks , presented something strange and cool in his planetarium show last Friday .
He 'd been looking for a way to visualize the " Venus Pentagram " , a regularity where Venus ' inferior conjunctions -- the point where Venus is approximately between Earth and the Sun -- follow a cycle of five .
If you plot the conjunction positions , you 'll see a pentagram , and the sixth conjunction will be almost ( but not quite ) in the same place where the first one was .
Supposedly many ancient civilizations supposedly knew about this pattern , though as Galen noted ( and I 'd also noticed when researching my Stonehenge talk ) , the evidence is sometimes spotty .
Galen 's latest trick : he moved the planetarium 's observer location up above the Earth 's north ecliptic pole .
Then he told the planetarium to looked back at the Earth and lock the observer 's position so it moves along with the Earth ; then he let the planets move in fast - forward , leaving trails so their motions were plotted .
The result was fascinating to watch .
You could see the Venus pentagram easily as it made its five loops toward Earth , and the loops of all the other planets as their distance from Earth changed over the course of both Earth 's orbits and theirs .
You can see the patterns they make at right , with the Venus pentagram marked ( click on the image for a larger version ) .
Venus ' orbit is white , Mercury is yellow , Mars is red .
If you 're wondering why Venus ' orbit seems to go inside Mercury 's , remember : this is a geocentric model , so it 's plotting distance from Earth , and Venus gets both closer to and farther from Earth than Mercury does .
He said he'd shown this to the high school astronomy club and their reaction was , " My , this is complicated . "
Indeed .
It gives insight into what a difficult problem geocentric astronomers had in trying to model planetary motion , with their epicycles and other corrections .
Of course that made me want one of my own .
It 's neat to watch it in the planetarium , but you can't do that every day .
So : Python , Gtk / Cairo , and PyEphem .
It 's pretty simple , really .
The goal is to plot planet positions as viewed from high above the north ecliptic pole : so for each time step , for each planet , compute its right ascension and distance ( declination does n't matter ) and convert that to rectangular coordinates .
Then draw a colored line from the planet 's last X , Y position to the new one .
Save all the coordinates in case the window needs to redraw .
At first I tried using Skyfield , the Python library which is supposed to replace PyEphem ( written by the same author ) .
But Skyfield , while it 's probably more accurate , is much harder to use than PyEphem .
It uses SPICE kernels ( my blog post on SPICE , some SPICE examples and notes ) , which means there 's no clear documentation or list of which kernels cover what .
I tried the kernels mentioned in the Skyfield documentation , and after running for a while the program died with an error saying its model for Jupiter in the de421.bsp kernel was n't good beyond 2471184.5 ( October 9 2053 ) .
Rather than spend half a day searching for other SPICE kernels , I gave up on Skyfield and rewrote the program to use PyEphem , which worked beautifully and amazed me with how much faster it was : I had to rewrite my GTK code to use a timer just to slow it down to where I could see the orbits as they developed !
It 's fun to watch ; maybe not quite as spacey as Galen 's full - dome view in the planetarium , but a lot more convenient .
You need Python 3 , PyEphem and the usual GTK3 introspection modules ; on Debian - based systems I think the python3 - gi - cairo package will pull in most of them as dependencies .
Plot your own epicycles : epicycles.py .

Planetarium Show Friday : Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Moon This Friday , Dave and I will be presenting a planetarium show called The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Moon : Visit the Moon Without Leaving Your Home Planet .
I 'm jazzed about this show .
I think it 'll be the most fun planetarium show we 've given so far .
We 'll be showing a variety of lunarfeatures : maria , craters , mountains , rilles , domes , catenae and more .
For each one , we 'll discuss what the feature actually is and how it was created , where to see good examples on the moon , and -- the important part -- where you can go on Earth , and specifically in the Western US , to see a similar feature up close .
Plus : a short flyover of some of the major features using the full - dome planetarium .
Some features , like Tycho , the Straight Wall , Reiner Gamma , plus lots of rilles , look really great in the planetarium .
If you can't get to the moon yourself , this is the next best thing !
The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Moon : 7 pm at the PEEC nature center .
Admission is free .
Come find out how to explore the moon without leaving your home planet !

Reasons abound for GM 's bankruptcy , including legacy costs , fuel prices and the conventional wisdom of East Coast media elite , but we must n't forget in the end it 's all about the cars .
And frankly , some of them really sucked .
Here 's the ten vehicles most responsible for driving GM into bankruptcy .
GM Bankruptcy Official Chevrolet - Saturn of Harlem , a General Motors Corporation dealership in New York , is the first to …

Chevrolet SSR
The Chevrolet SSR was meant to capture the imagination of buyers .
Unfortunately , few buyers were imagining an expensive , gas - guzzling convertible truck that , due to the size of the hardtop convertible , was basically unusable as a truck .

Saturn L- Series
The original S - series Saturn cars were meant to compete with foreign small car makers by offering unique , reliable small cars .
The success of this move can be debated , but they 'd at least built a following .
By 2000 , they 'd given up on the original mission of Saturn and tried to pass off an old Opel platform as the new Saturn .
It was a failure , much like the Saturn brand itself .
At best , Saturn did succeed in crushing its domestic small car competitor Geo ... another company owned by GM .

Hummer H2
The popularity of military Humvee conversions convinced AM General to make a civilian version called the Hummer .
Low gas prices and a strong economy convinced GM to buy the rights to build Hummers and create a more civilized version based on an existing GM platform .
Dealerships were opened and , initially , sales were good .
But when gas prices started to rise the idea of spending $ 65,000 for a truck that gets 10 MPG seemed ridiculous and the Hummer brand came to represent everything wrong with U.S. automakers .

Subaru 9 - 2 x " Saabaru "
GM thought it would be a great idea to join Ford in buying another European automaker .
Just as Volvo has n't particularly worked out for Ford , Saab transformed from quirky to boring quickly .
Needing a sporty model , they combined the Subaru WRX ( GM owned about 20 % shares of Subaru ) with a Saab badge and the " Saabaru " was born .
Like the WRX , it was a great performance deal and fun car .
But it was the representation of a company with an unclear mission .

GMC Envoy XUV
GM spent millions developing a " midgate " system for their Envoy SUV , which would allow the vehicle to be transformed from an awkward truck to an awkward SUV using an expensive and complex retractable rear roof .
GM expected approximately 30,000 people would need an SUV to double as antique furniture transport .
They were off my almost as much as a third and it was discontinued after two years .
This is what they did instead of building a small car .
Advertisement
GM B- Body
The problem with badge - engineering is sometimes it works .
The 90s - era GM B-Body vehicles were successful and people ended up buying the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser , Buick Roadmaster , Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham , Chevy Caprice and Chevy Impala SS .
Unfortunately , it was a dilution of brand missions and only perpetuated the company 's problems rather than solve them .
Advertisement
Cadillac Escalade EXT
The Cadillac Escalade gained popularity and notoriety among celebs , at least until the Prius became cool .
As popular as the Escalade was , the company decided to make a truck version .
This was the truck version of an SUV based on a truck platform for luxury buyers , who never wanted or needed a truck in the first place .
It 's yet another example of GM building more trucks at the expense of passenger vehicles .
Advertisement
GM EV-1
When the California Air Resourced Board required automakers to sell 2 % of cars as Zero Emissions Vehicles most responded with electric versions of cars they already built .
GM built the purpose - built EV1 .
It was popular despite the limited range but it cost the company more to make than they were getting in leases .
After the rule was waived GM recalled the leases and canceled the program .
This caused environmentalists to go nuts and blame GM for killing the electric car .
It was an image disaster .
Advertisement
Pontiac Aztec
The Pontiac Aztec was one of the first major crossover vehicles brought to market in the U.S.
It 's combination of car - like handling and fuel economy with SUV - like space and aggressive appearance .
The concept was a hit and now most automakers are shifting towards crossover .
The Aztec was a massive failure .
It was an attractive idea in an amazingly unattractive shell .
It failed almost entirely based upon its appearance .

Chevrolet Pontiac Aveo G3 Wave
This is your subcompact offering ?
Really ?
American car companies have had little success with building small cars , but the Korean - designed Chevy Aveo is among the worst .
It 's too small .
It 's ugly .
It 's not comfortable .
It 's not well - designed .
It 's not overwhelmingly fuel efficient for its size .
It 's so bad , the only thing a struggling GM could do with it was try and make a version for Pontiac called the G3 Wave so Pontiac dealers would have a small car .
When you 've got a bad hand , you do n't double down .
Associated PressLocal real estate ads in Detroit , where houses can be had for less than the price of a used cars .
General Motors ' trip through bankruptcy court delivers a new blow to Detroit 's long - suffering real estate market .
The struggling auto industry has made Michigan one of the epicenters of the foreclosure crisis dating to early 2005 , well before the housing downturn hit overheated markets in Florida , California and the Southwest .
Houses in some of the most distressed parts of Detroit sold for less than new cars .
Now , the closure of auto dealerships and the loss of white - collar jobs threatens a new round of pain in high - end suburban housing markets , as BusinessWeek examines .
The twin bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler also dampen prospects for Detroit 's commercial real estate industry .
An effort to revive the city 's St. Regis Hotel stumbled earlier this year when the developer defaulted on a construction loan .
And leaner companies could mean rising office vacancies , spurring debate over what Detroit should do now .
A column in Crain 's Detroit Business argues that Quicken Loans could be one possible suitor for office space in the Renaissance Center .
The real estate impact of GM 's bankruptcy will also be felt beyond Motor City , as some 2,300 dealership closings by GM and Chrysler weigh on the already sagging retail real - estate market .
The retail sector has been hit particularly hard rising vacancies during the recession ; mall landlord General Growth Properties filed for bankruptcy earlier this year .

It was half past midnight when Jerry Cornelius returned to Tenby as a last desperate resort .
There are many desperate resorts along the South Wales coast .
Tenby ’s turn had finally come .
Jerry drove a Gilbern and smoked a cheroot as he changed gear .
It was n’t easy swapping jacket and trousers while driving .
When the process was complete , he changed gear .
He felt unfashionable .
But disguise was important here .
The antiquated car radio played an early song by the Manic Street Preachers , so distorted it was impossible to make out the words .
It was like music from another county .
Jerry fiddled with the tuner and found a news bulletin .
“ New border clashes include spitting and swearing ! ” announced the announcer .
It was getting nasty .
As he entered the town and drove towards the beach , he reflected on how much he trusted his own motives .
Not at all , he decided cheerfully .
He wound down the window and the smack of salt air came to him like the kiss of a wet dog .
He sniffed .
A late reveller turned out of a pub and flagged him down .
“ You from round here ? ”
“ Not as such , ” admitted Jerry .
“ Where you from then ? ”
Jerry decided to take a risk .
“ Next town over . ”
“ Where ’s that then ? ”
“ Sort of in a sideways direction .
I ’m no good at geography .
A bit further than the edge of this place . ”
“ Do n’t like the sound of that , do I ? ”
Jerry nodded .
“ Stick with what you know . ”
The man winked .
“ That ’s right , good advice , ca n’t be too careful .
See this knitted tie ?
My gran made that for me , said it would never let me down , and it has n’t , not once , ever . ”
“ That ’s stability for you , ” agreed Jerry .
He accelerated away and turned down Battery Road onto the Esplanade .
The Gilbern was sluggish and he was grateful to abandon it near the museum , where it rightfully belonged .
He walked rapidly past the castle to the quay .
The yacht was waiting for him , a badly carved wooden dragon fixed to the prow like a figurehead , leering awkwardly .
Jerry sighed deeply .
Of all places .
Wales .
He was truly stuck this time .
—
Caldey Island monastery was still in good condition .
The hole in the roof of the refectory let in the rain but not much light .
Jerry followed the silent servant to the round table and took his place .
His neighbours squinted at his clothes and nodded .
Jerry wore a dragon flag t- shirt and a woollen jacket and faded red braces held up his thick cord trousers .
On his head he sported a crushed bowler hat .
His feet were clamped in hobnailed boots .
He fitted in perfectly .
There were six figures already seated on the low chairs .
He was the seventh .
There was one empty space .
The table bore a striking pattern , eight arrows pointing eight different ways , but one of these arrows was straighter , thicker and longer than the others , as if urging them to swing round and point in its direction .
“ Robert will soon be here , ” said the man opposite Jerry .
“ He prefers a dramatic entrance ? ”
“ I do n’t think so .
He ’s just very busy .
Why do n’t I introduce the company to you ?
I am Dafydd ap Bedwyr and I represent the Druids .
This is Owein ap Cadwr for the Shepherds . ”
The introductions continued .
“ Iorwerth ap Sawyl of the Miners … Garanwyn ap Mercher of the Chapels … Peredur ap Rhuvawn of the Rugby Players … Teirwaedd ap Ysgithyrwyn of the Caravan Parks .
And you are ? ”
“ Jerry Cornelius .
Drugs and Grooves . ”
“ Do you mock us ?
You must have an ‘ ap ’ .
Who are you the son of ? ”
Jerry pondered .
“ Call me Jerry ap Man . ”
“ Apeman ? ” They enjoyed the joke .
Jerry had won them over and was safe .
He mouthed the word quietly to himself and was misunderstood .
“ Oh yes , ” said Dafydd , “ we ’re quite safe here .
Robert managed to purchase eight radiological Alazan rockets from the breakaway Russian republic of Transdniester .
He fired one straight at Caldey Island .
The contamination is not particularly harmful but it keeps snoopers at bay .
Too much broken crockery , though . ”
“ Does he intend to do that before every meeting ? ” asked Jerry .
“ Such precautions are necessary , I fear . ”
Jerry nodded .
“ And fun . ”
They laughed again but inside Jerry felt a growing sickness that had nothing to do with gamma rays .
—
After the meeting , Jerry lay on his bed .
Part of the problem was that ‘ nationalism ’ was not a dirty word in Wales .
In fact it was considered highly desirable to have nationalistic tendencies .
This gave Robert the perfect cover for his scheme .
For the first time in decades the most historically inaccurate but powerful factions of Welsh culture had agreed to work as a team .
Wales was such a fragmented place .
What had ever kept it together ?
Something as simple and strong as boredom ?
Jerry rose and strolled through the monastery .
The rain outside had stopped but the wind still howled .
Glancing at his wristwatch , Jerry noted that the spinning dials were speeding up and slowing down , but without any discernible pulse .
Like everything else in Wales , time here was undecided .
The interior of the monastery was illuminated by dim electric lamps hung from the ceiling at random intervals .
Jerry kept tripping over his own flares .
His burberry pyjamas were far too long , but any deviation in any detail would be his undoing .
From somewhere ahead , a radio played a Super Furry Animals song , so dated already , a desperate echo of the brief Welsh Revival of the 1990s , when provincial bands seemed more sagacious and sharp than anything from the metropolis , and may well have been .
Jerry passed through a shattered doorway into a courtyard .
Slogans were still potent in this land .
When people heard the call to KEEP WALES TIDY they thought only of excluding the English .
They did n’t think about who would really be excluded .
The far right had found a different agenda using the same terminology .
Now they could exploit it for their own ends without modifying their language .
Jerry blinked .
Here was the proof .
Robert Wyvern was goosestepping on the gravel , raising his arm in a curiously limp Nazi salute .
Behind him real geese followed in his tracks , pecking at the imprint of his heels , the studs having left marks like irregular crumbs of bread .
—
Angharad sat in a pink twinset in her jumpjet .
She yawned as she waited for Jerry to climb into the cockpit behind her .
The aircraft wheezed and gasped .
The fuselage was by Tupolev , the wings by Boeing , the engines by Schweppes .
It was not a vital VTOL .
“ Funds are low , Mr C , ” she said apologetically .
“ I ’ve tightened my belt . ”
He tried to relax into his seat , found himself feeling itchy and blue .
“ It ’s the sticks , you see , ” she added .
“ Provincial entropy is the hardest to do anything with , ” he sighed .
He stared at the back of her head as she steered the shuddering bucket into the sky .
He felt even more sick .
“ It was customised by a farmer , ” she continued .
Something cracked somewhere .
Time and space became a quick downward spiral .
Angharad apologised again as they dropped into the crater dug by their own jets .
The impact jarred his bones .
“ Those bleeding buggers ! ”
“ Now , now Mr C , do n’t say you did n’t anticipate it . ”
“ Fobbing us off with junk . ”
“ Not the first time , so I ’ve heard , eh ? ”
“ Anything broken ? ”
She was bewildered .
“ Most things , surely .
You do n’t mean to say you expect anything to be whole again ? ”
“ I suppose not , ” he conceded .
“ Devolution , Mr C , it just keeps going . ”
—
Jerry woke with a throbbing headache and a body covered with bruises .
He wondered if he had enjoyed himself the previous night or not .
Then as he slowly stood , the bruises began to sting .
Yes , clearly a good time .
Angharad had left her suspender belt behind .
There was a knock on the door .
A delivery man wheeled in a gigantic box .
This was his replacement transport .
Alvarez at the Time Centre must have sent it before the crash .
“ He knew all along , ” Jerry muttered ruefully .
Then he laughed and began carefully unpacking the kit .
Whatever it was , it had to be better than the cobbled jumpjet .
He turned his head to glance through the grimy window of the hotel .
The wreck still rested on the beach , a new tourist attraction .
How long before the local council printed leaflets proclaiming it a sight worth an afternoon ’s detour ?
At least a few years .
By that time it would have been stripped bare .
Devolution and diversification are not the same thing at all , Jerry mused as he studied the assembly instructions .
An amphibious craft , very experimental , partly inflatable .
The canister of nitrogen was included .
He scratched his reeling head .
The roar of an Alazan rocket made the window rattle .
Jerry turned and followed the wavering vapour trail .
Robert was preparing the next meeting place .
Somewhere near Swansea .
Jerry hastily slotted together the components and used the canister to inflate the machine .
It was almost as big as the room .
There was no way he would get it through the door .
Fortunately the beak of the craft concealed a 76.2 mm Kurchevsky recoilless cannon .
Jerry jumped into the driving seat and fired a short burst at the wall .
Pallid residents stumbled and coughed in panic as the machine nosed through collapsing masonry and over little hills of rubble .
Then with a triumphant squeal , Jerry accelerated towards the industry scarred lands of the east , a message in his heart and a Hungarian 7.65 Fegyvergyar pistol holstered at his hip .
Just like the old days .
But in Wales it was always the old days .
—
In the ruins of the giant statue of Catherine Zeta - Jones , the delegates gathered .
The icy waves broke with a chiding slap on the plaster ankles .
Once this had been the site of the Mumbles lighthouse but the local council had known better .
The 300 metre tall figure , circa Darling Buds of May , had glared down at Swansea on the other side of the bay .
Now only the lower half remained .
A cheap erection , typical of anything to do with Catherine .
Posters flapped on her calves announcing forthcoming gigs in local venues .
Jerry was excited to spy a torn flier with Stereo printed on it , but when he rejoined the fluttering half he saw the rest of the word was phonics instead of lab .
Other bands on the same bill included Catatonia , The Caves and The Frictionless Man .
For better and for worse , Jerry knew them all personally .
He went inside .
Sweeping geiger counters from side to side , silent servants found the least harmful spot for setting up the round table .
As Jerry glanced around , he recognised a familiar face .
“ Miss Brunner , ” he groaned .
“ I guessed you might turn up , ” she sniffed .
She was dressed in the full cliched costume , stovepipe hat coated in plaster dust and a wilted daffodil pinned to her collar .
She met his gaze and licked her lips .
“ So you ’re the devil in Miss Jones ? ”
“ What happened to Dafydd ap Bedwyr ? ”
“ Crushed by a collapsing menhir .
Bloody thing must have been on the verge of toppling for centuries .
Unless it was a Victorian folly .
I saw my chance and took his place . ”
“ You do n’t look very convincing , ” Jerry observed .
“ It ’s a question of attitude . ”
“ Women are n’t allowed to be Druids , are they ? ” he insisted .
She applied her lipstick and snapped shut her vanity case .
“ You ’ll have to define allow for me .
Movement always relies on allowances being made .
Robert is English , you know . ”
Jerry nodded .
“ Revolutions are never straightforward .
Owain Glyndwr made alliances with the English too .
Whatever works , I suppose .
All the same , that costume is a trifle … ”
She arched an eyebrow .
“ A trifle what ? ”
Jerry rubbed his chin .
“ Just that .
A trifle .
Did you expect more ?
I mean it ’s a sickly concoction . ”
Miss Brunner laughed .
“ In 1797 the French invaded Wales at Pen Caer but surrendered when they encountered a group of local women dressed in traditional hats and red flannel dresses .
I ’ve done my research .
It was the last attempted invasion of Britain , although I ’m sure Robert would disagree with that statement . ”
“ Quite , ” said a voice behind her .
It was Robert himself .
His mood was ebullient as he rubbed his sweaty palms together .
“ What the hell is that vehicle parked outside the doorway ? ”
Jerry lit a cheroot .
“ A Duck Billed Platitude .
Robert patted Jerry on the arm .
“ Good to see you have a sense of humour .
Or is it irony ?
Or allegory ?
It does n’t matter .
Our movement has always needed men with a light touch .
All those drinking songs and starched armbands can get a bit boring , what ? ”
“ No it really is a Duck Billed Platitude .
Come and have a look at the engines .
They were made by Canada Dry . ”
“ Later , Mr Cornelius , later . ”

The British National Party has unveiled its new tactic to win the race hate vote in Wales — party political broadcasts in Welsh .
The far right party ’s leader Nick Griffin , who lives in Powys , will star in the English version of the video , but his 17 year old daughter will front the Welsh language rant on deporting and repatriating non-whites from the UK .
It ’s the party ’s latest role for Jennifer Griffin , a pupil at Ysgol Gyfun Llanfair Caereinion near Welshpool , who has admitted she would like to become BNP leader .
She already chairs the BNP Supporters ’ Club — a group for 14 to 18 year olds .
The broadcasts are part of their biggest ever assault on Wales as the party attempts to get a foothold in councils and puts up two candidates for the European elections .
They will be screened on terrestrial television in the lead - up to polling day on June 10 .
Politicians last night dismissed the ads as a stab at gaining a “ cloak of respectability ” .
But Mr Griffin insists there is support in Wales , particularly on “ English migration ” to Wales , which he claimed is “ pushed by the multi-cultural society of England .
WALES ON SUNDAY , May 9 , 2004

“ The trouble is , ” said Stuart as he lowered the heat on the stove , “ that when I began losing my friction I envisioned all sorts of opportunities slipping through my fingers . ”
Jerry was cleaning his 9 mm Luger .
“ I bet . ”
“ In fact it just meant they fell into my lap instead . ”
Turning away from the bubbling lasagne Stuart looked up .
His girlfriend had just come home from university .
Monica threw her battered copies of Kant onto the table and nodded at Jerry .
“ Hello Mr C . What can we do for you ? ”
“ It ’s a question of drag , ” Jerry admitted .
“ I can wear some of Monica ’s clothes , ” Stuart offered .
Jerry shook his head .
“ Business first .
The drag I ’m referring to is the component of the aerodynamic force on an aircraft that lies along the longitudinal axis .
What do you know about ground effect vehicles ? ”
“ I flew an A - 90 Orlyonok Ekranoplan once . ”
“ Efficiency is the key , ” said Jerry .
“ This is n’t a rich country and the cheaper anything can be done the better .
Mass movement is my latest hobby .
With practise I might get good at it . ”
“ Shall we play before or after dinner ? ” Stuart asked .
“ Might as well get the work done first . ”
Stuart nodded .
“ Do you mind jamming without a drummer ? ”
“ No , that ’s fine .
My Gibson ’s packed up .
May I borrow yours ?
If you do n’t have one , a Stratocaster will do . ”
“ I have a Rickenbacker . ”
Stuart went to look for the instrument and Jerry turned to Monica .
“ Curious that you live in Delhi Street . ”
“ All the streets around here are named after battles .
I think Delhi was a battle , was n’t it ? ”
“ Well it might be . ” Jerry blinked .
Stuart returned with the guitar .
“ I ’ll turn the stove off .
Do n’t want the lasagne burning , do we ? ”
They tuned up and plugged in .
They quickly went through the entire Frictionless Man set .
Soon the dust in every room was airborne , every speck floating through the half grey , half milky light that pushed into the house from the Welsh sky .
“ That will do . ” Jerry nodded and unplugged .
“ Righto , Mr C , ” replied Stuart as he went back into the kitchen to heat up the lasagne again .
There was no entropy here .
It was an oasis of mood , meals and mutability .
Jerry started up the Goblin 320 series cylinder vacuum cleaner and moved through the house sucking up the dust .
When the bag was full he switched it off and settled down on a chair .
Stuart dished up briskly .
“ What do you want my skin flakes for , Mr C , if you do n’t mind me asking ? ”
“ Coating .
Better than Teflon , ” Jerry answered .

On the roof of the Brendan Guest House , Aberystwyth .
They had erected a tarpaulin to protect themselves from the worst of the rain , but it blew sideways and diluted their cocktails .
So much for a romantic evening in starlight .
So much for settling for less .
“ Bloody Wales .
What am I doing here ? ”
Angharad said , “ How do you think I feel ?
I was pulled out of India for this assignment .
I ’d only been travelling around for three months and was getting into the vibe . ”
“ I ’ve forgotten what the sun looks like . ”
“ It ’s night , Mr C . ”
“ Every time he holds a meeting , Robert convinces another of the major stereotypes .
He does n’t need to be too clever or too charming .
He ’s done the minimum necessary .
I bet he feels there ’s something lacking .
His kind like to compare themselves to dynamos .
Eight different locations , eight different purposes , but really just one direction .
Funny how law can hide in chaos , and chaos in law .
Robert promises dynamism but will deliver stagnation . ”
“ Constant readjustments are n’t for everyone . ”
“ It seems a thankless task sometimes . ”
“ But you would n’t feel comfortable doing anything else .
What choice do you have , realistically ?
Law and Chaos are both self - destructive .
Law denies everything , even time , because time is movement , so when it gets what it wants it vanishes , because it no longer exists in time .
Chaos in contrast admits everything , even order , and so will eventually get stuck in a groove which includes permanent stability as one of its qualities .
Striking a balance is the only option . ”
“ I ’ve made my bed , ” Jerry agreed .
“ I ’m just tired of lying in it . ”
“ It ’s our bed now , ” corrected Angharad .
Jerry wept .
With gratitude .

Bishop Beesley eased his enormous bulk out of the wicker chair and waddled to the bar for another glass of milk stout .
It was quiet in The Jolly Englishman tonight .
Captain Maxwell , Sir Kingsley and Lady Sunday lounged in their own chairs around the table , tearing beer mats into neat strips and muttering .
“ I wonder how Miss Brunner is getting on ? ”
“ As best as she can , no doubt . ”
The Bishop returned with his drink and sat back down with a contented sigh .
He licked his sticky fingers and unwrapped another chocolate bar .
“ Do you think she can handle Cornelius ? ”
“ Well it ’s always worth a try . ”
The Bishop seemed oblivious of the sombre mood .
He munched happily .
“ But if Wales wins its independence what ’s to stop the fringe counties of England following suit ?
We might end up with Yorkshire and Cornwall seceding from the union . ”
“ And even Surrey and Sussex , ” beamed the Bishop .
He gestured with his half eaten Mars .
“ I know what worries you .
It worries me too .
Where does devolution stop ?
Independent cities and towns , independent streets , independent individuals .
But I have faith . ”
“ In what exactly ? ”
Something inside the Bishop seemed to deflate but he remained as gross on the outside as ever .
“ It ’s my job , dear boy . ”
Then he leaned forward and slurped his beer from the glass without lifting it .
“ I suppose we might reconsider our options . ”
“ Heaven help us , ” chorused the others .

Back at the Time Centre , Alvarez demonstrated his latest device to Jerry with an insouciant air .
The response was good with almost no unintended hiss .
Jerry nodded his approval and Alvarez smirked .
High above them the subway trains rumbled and sparked .
“ Gorky ’s Zygotic Mynci .
In the entirety of Wales there ’s no music more evocative of the ‘ 70s . ”
“ Which ‘ 70s exactly ? ”
Alvarez shrugged .
“ Any one . ”
“ As long as I can take my pick , ” said Jerry .
He was feeling better physically but was emotionally depressed .
“ Shame it did n’t work out with Angharad . ”
“ But it did , ” Jerry responded .
“ She ’s returned to India .
Who am I to hold her back ?
She ’s young . ”
“ Our turn will come , ” said Alvarez hopefully .
“ Shall we begin ? ” asked Jerry .
Alvarez nodded .
“ Do you know anything about the Main ? ”
“ Part of New England surely ? ”
“ Not this time .
I ’m talking about the Spanish Main .
The islands of the Caribbean .
The Antilles , Jamaica . ”
“ Are we going to buy our way out of this one ? ”
Alvarez nodded bleakly .
“ Feels almost like cheating , does n’t it ?
A paradox .
But you ca n’t transmogrify a Wyvern .
There ’s no other method , at least none we can afford . ”
“ You are a wag , ” said Jerry unconvincingly .
Alvarez handed him the flintlock pistol .
Jerry pressed the barrel against his right temple and pulled the trigger .
The opening chords of ‘ Merched ya Neud Gwallt eu Gilydd ’ flooded the Time Centre .
With a pop of imploding air Jerry vanished and Alvarez returned to his monitors .

The pirates sat around the table and laughed .
The ship swayed at anchor and the lanterns squealed as they moved , the wicks spluttering .
Burning whale oil made the vessel smell like a Bridgend high street on Saturday evening .
It truly was 1671 .
Jerry fitted in perfectly .
Tufts of his hair were knotted with black ribbons and he had a broad white stripe painted across his face .
His false leg was false and his hook hand was also fake but the creak of his boots was real .
“ Give us that shanty again !
‘ Tis rare ! ” one shouted .
“ Aye , a rum tune ! ” cried another .
Jerry rolled his eyes in exasperation but obliged .
He gritted his teeth and sang , “ Is this the way to Amarillo , every night I ’ve been hugging my pillow , dreaming dreams of Amarillo … ”
“ Har! har ! har ! ” roared the pirates .
“ He sings it like a woman ! ” approved one .
“ Let ’s go and sack that Armadillo ! ” suggested another .
“ Burn it to the ground ! ” seconded a third .
“ And kill all the Spaniards we find inside !
Call the captain .
Where is Armadillo ?
Fetch the charts ! ”
“ Amarillo , ” corrected Jerry .
It was going to be a long evening .
He was rescued by the captain himself .
Henry Morgan came down the companionway and stood on the warped boards with his hands on his hips and a pipe clenched between his thick lips .
His expression was a mixture of admiration and regret .
He nodded at Jerry and waved to his men .
Jerry stood unsteadily and followed him to the deck .
The mist slicked his face like cold chip oil .
He sneezed .
“ It ’s not too late to change your mind , ” said Morgan .
Jerry smiled thinly .
“ I made a vow . ”
“ This is awfully good of you .
I never expected anyone to volunteer .
I assumed I would have to use force . ”
Jerry squinted into the mist .
“ Where are we ? ”
“ Off the coast of South Wales . ”
“ Really ?
I imagined you might choose Cuba or the Bahamas . ”
“ Are you disappointed ?
It seems to me that nobody will ever think of looking here .
I ’m quite a sentimental old sod too , if truth be told .
I know I should n’t be , but I am . ”
“ Like a character in an early John Steinbeck novel , ” Jerry said .
He noticed the frown on Morgan ’s face and added , “ Let ’s get it over with .
I am cold , tired and a little sick . ”
“ After you , dear boy . ”
Jerry climbed over the rail and used the rope ladder to lower himself into the longboat .
Morgan followed .
Then they cast off and Jerry rowed through the mist .
He followed Morgan ’s complicated directions , veering first one way , then another , to confuse any observers on the ship .
But in fact the mist was too thick for even the most powerful spyglass to penetrate .
Shingle crunched beneath them .
Jerry leaped out and dragged the boat onto the beach .
Morgan strutted forward and pointed at the mouth of a narrow cave .
“ This is the one . ”
Jerry heaved the heavy chest out of the boat and staggered after Morgan into the cave .
The chest was full of the choicest treasure from the looting of Panama .
Morgan lit a lantern and cast a spade at Jerry ’s feet .
“ Dig here .
It ’s the perfect spot . ”
When Jerry had finished , Morgan smiled affectionately at him and said , “ You know I have to kill you now , to protect my secret .
Your ghost will stand guard over my treasure for a thousand years .
Well , I do n’t really believe that , but it may put your mind at ease .
Once again , I ’m awfully grateful to you . ”
“ No problem , ” said Jerry .
As Morgan fumbled for the pistol at his belt , Jerry handed him his own flintlock .
“ Here , use this .
It ’s a very nice model with an ivory handle . ”
Morgan took it and pointed it at Jerry .
A relay inside clicked and the music began playing in reverse .
Jerry vanished .

Miss Brunner held a scarf to her face as they waddled down the muddy lanes of the Vale of Glamorgan .
The Duck Billed Platitude stank almost as bad as the landscape .
Poison leaked from the spur on its back leg .
It would soon conk out completely .
Jerry was in his element , an orange Nepalese shirt on his back , a pair of Turkish trousers on his legs , Italian shoes on his feet .
He was armed only with a khukri but he radiated confidence and danger .
As Miss Brunner sniffed unhappily he patted her saucily on the leg with a hand glittering with silver rings .
“ What made your side decide to throw in with my lot ? ”
She gritted her teeth .
“ We despise your whimsicality slightly less than his version of stability .
While we approve of his aims , we ca n’t condone the way he intends to achieve them .
We do n’t want an independent Wales , not even a clean one . ”
“ Nothing like a bit of internecine , ” said Jerry .
“ Hurry up , ca n’t you ? ”
Jerry said , “ This is the beach . ”
He turned the vehicle down a steep path and cut the engine on the sand .
He helped Miss Brunner climb down and led her to the cave mouth .
The moment they were inside he handed her the shovel .
“ I buried it .
You can dig it up . ”
“ Curious idea of fair play you have , ” she whined .
“ Symmetry is n’t always fair . ”
“ I suppose not . ”
With a snort she began work .
“ Will this really be enough to pay for what you intend ? ”
“ I think so . ”
He smoked a green Fortuna .
Half an hour later the spade struck the chest .
He unsheathed the khukri and approached her almost timidly .
“ You do n’t mind , do you ?
I ca n’t afford to share .
I need every last doubloon of it . ”
“ Really , Mr C , ” she muttered as he cut her throat .

A BBC journalist is urging helpful linguists to come forward to help solve a mystery — why the Hindi accent has so much in common with Welsh .
Sonia Mathur , a native Hindi speaker , had her interest sparked when she moved from India to work for the BBC in Wales — and found that two accents from countries 5000 miles apart seemed to have something in common .
It has long been known that the two languages stem from Indo - European , the “ mother of all languages ” — but the peculiar similarities between the two accents when spoken in English are striking .
Ms Mathur explained that when she moved to Wales , everyone instantly assumed she was Welsh from her accent .
“ I would just answer the phone , and they would say ‘ oh hello , which part of Wales are you from ? , ” she said .
“ I would explain that I ’m not from Wales at all — I ’m from India .
It was just hilarious each time this conversation happened . ”
But not only do the two languages ’ accents share notable common features — their vocabularies do too .
Ms Mathur ’s own research on basic words , such as the numbers one to 10 found that many words were similar — “ seven ” , for example , is “ saith ” in Welsh , “ saat ” in Hindi .
She later spoke to Professor Colin Williams of Cardiff University ’s School of Welsh , who specialises in comparative languages .
He suggested that the similarities are because they come from the same mother language — the proto-European language .
“ It was basically the mother language to Celtic , Latin and Sanskrit , ” Ms Mathur added .
“ So basically that ’s where this link originates from . ”

Robert Wyvern parked his Range Rover and stepped cautiously out into the light drizzle .
He avoided the worst of the puddles and the fatalism in his eyes was wholly affected .
As he approached Jerry he nodded curtly and lowered his cricket bag .
“ I have to say I ’m dreadfully disappointed with you . ”
“ You must have known I was a traitor to your cause .
Miss Brunner blew my cover , did n’t she ? ”
Robert lowered his head .
“ Of course .
But I appreciated your drive .
And I thought at least you ’d let me kick out the Bengalis .
Now you ’ll be stuck with them on your turf . ”
“ Wales desperately needs colour , ” quipped Jerry .
“ Damn it man , what ’s wrong with having just one tiny corner of this sceptered isle reserved for whites ? ”
Jerry misheard .
“ Septic ?
Yes I suppose it is . ”
“ The final meeting would have been in Maerdy in the Rhondda , the cradle of socialism in Wales .
Ironic , do n’t you think ? ”
“ I do n’t much involve myself with irony these days . ”
Jerry shrugged his apology .
“ Shall we toss for it ? ”
“ I do n’t have to agree to this you know . ”
“ Come now , how can you resist the challenge of a cricket match ? ”
Jerry threw the coin .
It was double headed .
“ Seems that I get to bowl .
It ’s all in the wrist . ”
“ Are those the wickets ? ” Robert asked glumly .
He squinted at the vast stones of the Pentre Ifan cromlech , moody in the greyish light .
Jerry nodded and Robert made his way to the crease in front of the ancient monument .
As he took up position , an enormous shadow crossed the landscape .
They gazed at the Ekranoplan in awe .
The Fairchild fuselage shuddered , the Sukhoi wings glittered , the Corona Dandelion & Burdock engines fizzed merrily .
Robert was dismayed .
“ Almost frictionless ! ” he gasped .
“ There ’ll be another over soon , ” said Jerry .
“ Several hundred in fact .
We ’re transporting the entire population of Wales to India .
Just for three months or so .
Let them travel around a bit , learn to haggle , try a bhang lassi , maybe a holiday romance … ”
“ That must have cost a fortune . ” Robert blinked .
“ An arm and a leg , ” sighed Jerry .
“ It wo n’t make them love other cultures , ” sniffed Robert .
“ They may return with even more loathing . ”
“ Not the point , ” said Jerry .
“ At least they ’ll get an opportunity to see what they ’re missing .
I ca n’t do everything , you know .
I would n’t want to even if I could .
They have to make their own decisions at some point .
Now are you ready , old boy ? ”
“ I am . ” Robert adjusted his grip on his bat .
“ I ’m going to demonstrate a bowling technique suggested to me by a fellah named Morgan .
It ’s quite radical . ”
“ Go ahead , ” muttered Robert .
Jerry walked to a covered object directly facing the cromlech .
Then he pulled the crimson frayed blanket off to reveal a fully loaded 17th Century Spanish cannon .
Robert gulped .
But he gripped his bat even more tightly and tried to look incorrigible .
“ Out for a duck , ” whispered Jerry as he flicked open his Zippo lighter and touched the flame to the fuse .
The theremin is n't only good for playing " Good Vibrations " , it 's also good for playing Super Mario Bros . — not just the music , but the game itself .
YouTuber conquerearth explains how it works :
The sound from the theremin is split into its frequency and amplitude components in real time , which are then mapped to values in a linear scale representing the X and Y axis .
Pitch becomes horizontal control , and Volume becomes vertical control .
The X and Y scales are then cut up into different zones .
In this case , Left ; Right and dead zones for the horizontal , and a single trigger and dead zone for the vertical .
The trigger zones are then mapped onto a virtual joystick hooked into an emulator .
The end result is a fairly usable input control for playing games like mario .
The bars give the much needed visual feedback as to how " in tune " you are , so you have a better feel of where the trigger points are .
Cheney blasts media on al Qaeda - Iraq link
Says media not ' doing their homework ' in reporting ties
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Vice President Dick Cheney said Thursday the evidence is " overwhelming " that al Qaeda had a relationship with Saddam Hussein 's regime in Iraq , and he said media reports suggesting that the 9/11 commission has reached a contradictory conclusion were " irresponsible . "
" There clearly was a relationship .
It 's been testified to .
The evidence is overwhelming , " Cheney said in an interview with CNBC's " Capitol Report . "
" It goes back to the early '90s .
It involves a whole series of contacts , high - level contacts with Osama bin Laden and Iraqi intelligence officials . "
" The press , with all due respect , ( is ) often times lazy , often times simply reports what somebody else in the press said without doing their homework . "
Members of 9/11 commission found " no credible evidence " that Iraq was involved in the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks carried out by al Qaeda hijackers , and they concluded that there was " no collaborative relationship " between Iraq and Osama bin Laden , the network 's leader , according to details of its findings disclosed Wednesday at a public hearing .
However , the commission also found that bin Laden did " explore possible cooperation with Iraq . "
Cheney told CNBC that cooperation included a brigadier general in the Iraqi intelligence service going to Sudan , where bin Laden was based prior to moving his operations to Afghanistan , to train al Qaeda members in bomb - making and document forgery .
Both Cheney and President Bush are strongly disputing suggestions that the commission 's conclusion that there were no Iraqi fingerprints on the 9/11 attacks contradicts statements they made in the run-up to the Iraq war about links between Iraq and al Qaeda .
Bush , who has said himself that there is no evidence Iraq was involved in 9/11 , sought to explain the distinction Thursday , saying that while the administration never " said that the 9/11 attacks were orchestrated " with Iraqi help , " we did say there were numerous contacts between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda . "
" The reason I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq and Saddam and al Qaeda [ is ] because there was a relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda , " the president said .
( Full story )
In his CNBC interview , Cheney went a bit further .
Asked if Iraq was involved in 9/11 , he said , " We do n't know . "
" What the commission says is they can't find evidence of that , " he said .
" We had one report , which is a famous report on the Czech intelligence service , and we 've never been able to confirm or to knock it down . "
The uncorroborated Czech report , which has been widely disputed , alleged that 9/11 ringleader Mohammed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence agent in Prague before the attacks .
Asked if he knows information that the 9/11 commission does not know , Cheney replied , " Probably . "

Advertisement Nesting swans have had all their eggs smashed by vandals who threw bricks at their nest in east Dorset .
Andrew Stevens , who lives nearby , said he noticed on Tuesday that the nest and all six eggs had been smashed .
He told the BBC : " It 's heartbreaking what 's happened to them .
She was clearly in distress and trying to incubate the bricks . "
But swan rescue expert Ken Merriman said the birds were not injured and appeared healthy .
Mr Stevens said he cycles past the nest to and from work every day and the nest was targeted sometime during the day on Tuesday .
He said : " As I cycled away it brought tears when I noticed what had happened .
It 's awful , absolutely awful . "
Richard Pogson , another local resident , said he had been following the pair building the nest over the past couple of months and last week noticed they had laid six eggs .
Healthy birds " I went past again on Wednesday afternoon and saw quite a few pieces of brick on top of the nest and all the eggs appeared to have been smashed .
" I am at a loss to understand the mentality of so - called human beings who clearly take some sort of pleasure in doing this type of thing .
" Whilst I appreciate the are an awful lot of bad things going on in the world , what I saw saddened me greatly . "
Mr Merriman , owner of the Swan Rescue Sanctuary in Holt , Wimborne , said he had checked the pair on Thursday and they were not injured .
" The parent birds are perfectly healthy , normal looking birds .
" My concern is primarily the welfare of the birds and they are not stressed , they are not agitated .
" She was preening herself next to the nest while he was swimming up and down the river chasing other swans off , like he should be doing . "
The RSPB condemned the act but said swan nests can become targets for vandals because of their large size .

Recently by Ron Paul : International Bailout Brings Us Closer to EconomicCollapse
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
As far as finance and business goes , at least one rule generally holds true
And this rule makes your job as an investor , entrepreneur or analyst ten times easier .
The rule ?
If you ca n’t explain a particular investment or innovation to an eleven - year - old , then something shady is going on .
Credit Default Swaps , Securitization , GSEs , CDOs all of these things were considered financial wizardry  back in the bubble days .
Now they ’ve been exposed as little more than Wall Street ’s version of three - card Monte .
Secrets of the Temple : ... William Greider Best Price : $ 1.57 Buy New $ 15.97 ( as of 02:40 EST - Details )
But the card sharks behind these scams — not the individual investment banks on the frontline , but the huckster who put his seal of approval on these street - side swindlings the guy whose rate - setting mandates created the environment for these bubble shenanigans that yahoo is still at large , and no one in the government really seems to care .
No one ; that is , except for a rogue Texan .
A man who wo n’t settle for anything less than the America he was promised in the constitution The Doctor is In
Most of us grew familiar with Ron Paul in late 2007 and early ’08 .
He campaigned on a platform of smaller government ; specifically by means of eradicating the Fed and the Internal Revenue Service a platform that turned out to be just a few months early .
But our Resident Offshore Expert — Former Congressman Bob Bauman — knew Ron from their days together in the House .
As you might expect , Bob says the soft - spoken doctor is a kind man one who definitely talks the talk in addition to walking the walk .
And beyond that , Ron ’s surely no average politician .
No , he actually serves a practical purpose within his community imagine that .
He ’s a doctor .
An obstetrician , which has proven to be a bit of a roadblock for his less useful competition
 I had real difficulty down in Brazoria County , where he practiced , because he ’d delivered half the babies in the county .
There were only two obstetricians in the county , and the other one was his partner . 
That was a competitor — Gammage — talking about one of Paul ’s first campaigns that came in the wake of the Watergate scandal .
It should ’ve been a pushover for the Democrats .
In hindsight , Gammage realized that he underestimated the grass roots pull that Ron Paul had amongst his constituents .
Since then , Ron ’s been an established fringe voice in Congress .
His message , steeped in fiscal common sense and Austrian school economics , has grown more popular over the years , culminating in his run at the 2008 primaries .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are being “ treated more like animals than human beings , ” former U.S. president Jimmy Carter said on Tuesday .
On a visit to the enclave , he condemned Israel ’s January bombardment of Gaza and its continuing trade blockade , which he said forbids even children ’s toys .
“ I understand that even paper and crayons are treated as a security hazard , ” he told Gazans at a local United Nations office .
“ I sought an explanation of this when I met with Israeli officials and I received none , because there is no explanation . ”
Carter , 84 , has spent far more years as a human rights activist than he did in the White House from 1977 to 1981 .
He is easily the most outspoken former U.S. president on the Middle East conflict , and seen by many Israelis as a harsh critic .
He ignored a U.S. government ban on dealings with Gaza ’s Islamist rulers Hamas and had talks with its leaders .
Israel tightened a blockade on Gaza in 2007 when Hamas took control after routing rival Fatah forces loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas , who favors a peace deal with Israel .
In late December , Israeli forces bombed then invaded Gaza , devastating its already battered infrastructure .
Since then , Israel has blocked imports of steel , cement and other goods to the population of 1.5 million Palestinians , saying Hamas could use many items for military purposes .
Carter , a Democrat , said he had seen for himself there had been almost no reconstruction in Gaza over the past five months .
“ Never before in history has a large community like this been savaged by bombs and missiles and then been deprived of the means to repair itself , ” he said .
Federal prosecutors in Virginia have leveled conspiracy and bank - fraud charges against the alleged leader and nine members of a national organization of high - tech pickpockets that 's been the scourge of police around the country since at least early 2007 .
The suspects allegedly stole the identities and bank - account information from victims around the country through pickpocketing and other means , including stealing checks from a Washington , D.C. , charity - fundraising group .
They 're accused of using the information to cash checks through victim accounts in several states .
The charges represent the federal government 's first large - scale swipe at the 200 - plus members of " Cannon to the Wiz , " a Chicago - based identity - theft ring known for marrying high - tech fraud techniques with the Dickensian art of pickpocketing .
Police have said the thieves sometimes keep computers , cameras and printers in their cars so they can substitute their own photos on stolen driver 's licenses within minutes of lifting them , and rack up thousands of dollars in charges at nearby shops before victims have even noticed they 've been robbed .
The feds say the crooks also worked a convoluted shell game to exploit victims ' bank accounts .
They 'd steal personal checks from one victim , deposit them into another victim 's legitimate account , then withdraw the money and disappear .
The scheme , known as " split deposits , " resulted in losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars to banks .
The ring allegedly travels around the country to crowded events , and targeted sports fans attending the Final Four basketball games in Detroit in April .
" I was a nervous wreck , " says Donna Pendergast , whose wallet was stolen from her purse after she passed through security at Ford Field in Detroit .
" An absolute nervous wreck .
All I could think of was a house being [ bought ] in my name .
And you would never know about that until you end up with a bill collector on your doorstep . "
Pendergast , who happens to be assistant attorney general in Michigan , is one of at least seven victims hit at Ford Field .
Detroit police made four arrests in April , including alleged ringleader 39 - year - old Leonardo Darnell Zanders .
Zanders , now being held in Wayne County Jail in Detroit , is also named as the lead defendant in the new federal conspiracy case .
According to court documents , federal law enforcement began investigating Zanders in September 2007 , when he tried to mail three packages through Federal Express that contained stolen personal checks , IDs , bank cards and other documents swiped from 14 victims in Virginia and Washington , D.C .
He fled the FedEx office before authorities could catch him .
But in February of this year , postal inspectors executed a search warrant at Zanders ' house and found documents for 36 victims in nine states and the District of Columbia .
The same month , the Secret Service searched the Maryland house of Zanders ' alleged associate Clyde Austin Gray Jr. , aka " Big Head " and " Poochie , " and found I.D. and bank documents for 85 more victims .
The defendants had packets of documents for each victim , bound with rubber bands .
Each packet included personal checks and bank cards stolen from the victim , as well as the original driver 's license , and a fake one printed with a thief 's photo , according to an affidavit filed by a U.S. postal inspector Monday .
According to an affidavit filed Monday ( .pdf ) , not all of the victims were pickpocketed .
At least some of them were targeted after sending checks to the Combined Federal Campaign for the National Capital Area , an organization that conducts an annual fundraising campaign among federal employees to raise money for multiple charities .
The organization raised $ 62.7 million in 2008 , according to its website .
According to the complaint , an employee appeared to have pilfered some of the donor checks in order to steal the names and account details from them .
At least one victim told the feds that a check sent to the CFCNCA in 2006 was never cashed .
Authorities found it in the drawer of a worker at the organization .
Authorities also found photocopies of another 13 checks made out to the CFCNCA .
The organization did not respond to an inquiry from Wired.com Wednesday .
Several informants inside " Cannon to the Wiz " helped the feds crack the case , including one who told postal inspectors that he or she was paid between $ 200 and $ 500 for each set of documents passed on to the ring .
One informant told postal inspectors that he alone had handed over personal information and bank details on 37 victims , which resulted in losses totaling $ 385,000 through split deposits .
In addition to Zanders and Gray , the eight others charged are Wenona Latrice White , Sydney Anthony Charles , Shonya Michelle Young , Darryl Earl Price , Sylvester Vaughn , George Lee Reid , Claire Barker and Lennier McLeod .
McLeod is already serving a six - year prison term for identity theft , after posing as a bank customer at a Suntrust branch in Memphis in 2007 in a split - deposits scheme .

One day , after years of agony , an Australian man took a large quantity of dry ice and intentionally damaged his left leg , so that a surgeon would have to amputate it .
The action was intentional and the man , Robert Vickers , described the feeling of waking up in the hospital without his leg as " absolute ecstasy . "
He 's one of a small number of people who have what psychiatrists have come to call body integrity identity disorder in which patients report the desire to have one or more of their limbs amputated because the extremities do n't feel like they " belong " to their bodies .
The disorder is the subject of a debate between psychiatrists and neuroscientists about whether the brain physiology causes the psychiatric condition or whether the causality runs in the other direction .
New research by both sides has yielded fresh ammunition for both interpretations , highlighting how difficult it is to separate biological from psychological phenomena .
Columbia University psychiatrist Michael First helped pioneer the identification of the disorder and his latest research suggests it 's just a subset of a larger psychiatric condition in which people become fixated on being disabled .
On the other hand , Paul McGeoch 's recent work at the University of California , San Diego seems to explain the disorder as a purely neurological disease resulting from a malfunctioning right parietal lobule , which appears to maintain the mind 's body map .
His lab used fMRI to determine that four self - reported BIID patients ' right parietal lobules did n't light up when their unwanted limbs were touched .
Normal people 's did .
" Oh , this is certainly a breakthrough .
We were stunned by the results , " David Brang , a graduate student who co-authored a paper on the study with McGeoch , said recently on the Australian television show on which Vickers told his amazing story .
" It ’s very clear that this is a neurological phenomenon when it always been thought of as a psychological issue . "
First , though , disagrees .
He 's in the midst of a new study about a small group of people who do n't want their limbs amputated , but do want to be disabled in some other way .
Some of the 47 people First has interviewed want to be paraplegic , for example , and feel that their healthy bodies are mismatched with their internal representations of themselves .
The study is a follow - up to an similar set of psychiatric evaluations
First did on people who wanted their limbs amputated .
The new group turns out to have a lot of the same feelings and desires as people with BIID .
" The vast majority of people that I interviewed are very similar to the BIID group , " First said .
Both groups express a lifelong desire to be disabled .
They pretend to be disabled .
They occasionally injure themselves in an attempt to reach that state , although First said only one person reported an attempt to induce paraplegia by injecting alcohol into the spine .
His findings could indicate there is a deeper psychiatric disorder underlying the neurophysiological observations from UCSD .
" It suggests that the common factor has to do with the desire to be disabled , " First said .
" As children , we see disabled people all the time and for whatever reason .
For certain children , they see people who are disabled and decide they want to be that way .
The nature of the disability is variable , but the desire is common . "
First does n't rule out the importance of the fMRI study , but he disputes that the results show the cause of the illness .
" You are seeing a brain manifestation of a psychiatric illness , " he said .
" I find their work exciting , but I 'm dismayed at how they came to their conclusion . "
One area where the neurological results could be helpful is to change the treatment regimen for BIID patients who want amputations to include remediation exercises to retrain the brain into readopting a limb as its own .
How such a treatment could be accomplished for people who want to be paraplegic is unclear .

The list is based on the popular cable television show Gossip Girl and is headlined " Gossip Girl for Aschamites " .
Comments about the students included allegations of a girl having sex with numerous boys .
Others were : " biggest bitch in our year " ; " she became cool in term 4 in year 8 and became really popular , that is all changing now " ; " she thinks she 's best friends with lots of people but they actually hate her " ; " she has a big mouth especially to her mum , she tells her everything and [ that is ] one of the reasons why everyone 's parents find out information " ; " she also tried to do the gossip girl thing with year 9 , spent over $ 1000 in phone bills and got into a lot of trouble with her parents " ; " she has a weird laugh and looks like a koala " ; and " she tells everyone she is a homaphrodite [ sic ] and showed people her vagina at Outward Bound " .
A parent of one of the girls named on the website said boys who had read the post approached his daughter in public .
" She was approached when she was in Bondi Junction last week … and at a party she went to last Saturday night , " he told the ABC .
" Everybody 's aware of it .
I would say the eastern suburbs schools are all aware of it . "
The Edgecliff school 's headmistress , Louise Robert - Smith , sent a letter to parents on Wednesday confirming the cyber - bullying incident .
" We regret to confirm there has been a recent serious instance of cyber - bullying involving a number of girls in year 9 , " Mrs Robert - Smith wrote .
" Two girls have left the school as a result of this incident . "
She said the posting had been removed but the material was still being disseminated .
Parents were advised to collect mobile phones from their children before they went to bed to stop them sending text messages through the night .
" Have your household computers in public areas , not tucked away in bedrooms , " Mrs Robert - Smith 's letter said .
A parent of a girl named on the website said he believed the school had handled the matter well .
He said his daughter was horrified at the comments posted on the site .
" It has confirmed my idea that these websites are dangerous , " he said .
Mrs Robert - Smith declined to comment but Sefiani Communications Group issued a statement on her behalf saying the school was made aware of the matter last Friday morning .
The statement said two girls were placed on in - school suspension pending a detailed investigation before both girls " were withdrawn permanently from the school by their parents " .
It said the girls removed the posting after becoming aware it was in the public domain .
Counselling was offered to the girls affected and the school acknowledged the potential for emotional distress and long - term harm .
" Ascham places the highest priority on providing a caring environment for students and does not tolerate bullying of any sort , " the school statement said .
Ascham was among the first schools to take part in a $ 126 million Federal Government cyber - safety program introduced in May last year .
Electric cars are something really serious these days and despite their small sizes , odd looks , they have the ability to surprise everyone with their exceptional performance .
It ’s not now that these electric cars have begun to inspire us with their exceptional performance , as they have been doing so for quite some time and it ’s really a difficult task to pick the best when it comes to their performance , as they all have been doing great in their respective times .
Here is the list of top five electric cars that has been based on the best available information ; however , you would n’t reckon it the final word on this topic .
1 ) Chevy S - 10 aka Smoke Screen
Dennis Berube built Chevy S - 10 alias Smoke Screen is considered the fastest street legal electric car in the world .
Dennis Berube has also built EV dragster that is also known as Current Eliminator .
The S - 10 boasts 11.083 @ 120 and just goes to 60 mph mere in two and a half second .
2 ) 1972 Electric Datsun
It ’s impressive design is enough to tell every story about this one of the fastest electric monsters in the world this pacey machine or to be more precise rocket just gets to 0 to 60 in 2.95 seconds while 130 mph figure has been estimated as its top speed .
3 ) The Wrightspeed X1
With its Ariel Atom and 3 - phae AC inducting motor that AC Propulsion is quite well - known for , the Wrightspeed X1 handsomely reaches 0 - 60 mph in just 3.07 seconds .
Like Tesla Roadster , the Wrightspeed seems quite impressive with its AC power plant .
There are lithium polymer batteries to power its electrical system .
It ’s without clutch , shifting and it takes you to 112 mph in the first gear .
It has a 100 mile range that is equivalent to 175 mpg overall .
4 ) The AC Propulsion tzero
AC Propulsion tzero was the first vehicle in the world that showed quite an amazing performance with its li-ion of the shelf laptop batteries and seems quite furious with its 0 - 60 mph capability in 3.6 seconds .
No doubt about it that the present day li-on battery electrification move in the automobile was introduced by this very vehicle .
Alan Conconi , a former GM engineer , originally fitted the 165kw 3 phase AC motor in the Honda Civic , but as it was a front wheel drive , so could n’t show the full potential of it .
5 ) The Tesla Roadster
With its impressive 53 kwh Li-ion battery and 185kw 3 phase AC motor , this AC propulsion tzero production version is claimed as the fastest electric sports car in production that goes to 0 - 60 mph in just 3.9seconds .
There is a gas guzzling 110 liter engine in the Ferrari Enzo that needs hefty $ 58 for filling in the US while $ 175 if you are in some European country , while in the Tesla Roaster you can enjoy the same nice performance with the fill of just $ 5.00 .
Books , no matter the genre , have always fascinated me .
The process of taking a ream of paper , setting it permanently within the grasp of binding , and designing a front and back cover so as to capture the gist of the content within – to me there is no form of art as transcendent or laden with meaning .
To others , however , beloved books exist only to be sullied , mutilated , and , from the bibliophile ’s vantage , destroyed .
Brian Dettmer , a 1997 graduate of Columbia College Chicago , has created quite the buzz in the art circuit doing precisely this .
When asked to describe his art in a recent interview with Outside the Artist ’s Studio , Dettmer waffles , describing it in a single breath as mixed media , sculpture , and remixed media – sculpture because it is three - dimensional , and remixed media because he takes someone else ’s work and scrambles the elements to make it his own .
Get it ?
He remixes the media like a DJ , sampling the creations of our greatest writers , dissecting their pages as a way to afford them reincarnation .
Alright , maybe our greatest writers is a bit of a hyperbole – he claims that his victims are primarily dated , non-fiction pieces – but they ’re writers nonetheless !
On the one hand , I appreciate his remixing for the same reason that I appreciate the ineluctable cycle of life : old breeds new , aged spawns young , parents give birth to progeny , cats have kittens .
In this way , his work appeals to the naturalist in me , the macro-man who sees the overarching patterns in history , and who succumbs to these patterns only because fighting them will make him smaller than he already is .
On the other hand , I ca n’t ignore the destructive element in his artwork .
Must we destory to rid ourselves of the old and get something new ?
Ca n’t old and new have more of a symbiotic relationship ?
Here ’s a sampling of Dettmer ’s autopsies :
As you can see , he compromises the binding , carves front and back covers , and cuts away generous portions of text so as to render the books unintelligible .
All this in the name of mixed media , or sculpture , or remixed media .
This kind of reckless , abusive behavior has given him enough art cred to convince students at Kent State University that their sculpture will benefit from his critique more so than from mine or yours .
On February 20 , 2008 , there are photos that document him dressed in Zorro attire as he strikes thoughtful poses and wows young KSU minds with his insight .
Thanks zosojake :
This is not to say that Dettmer has no credibility .
Who am I to make such a claim ?
I am only arguing that , as a bibliophile , his fame and everything related to his fame is antagonistic .
The books he performs so - called autopsies on are no longer able to be read .
They are , in effect , no longer books .
Dettmer has , no doubt , defended this angle of attack on numerous occasions :
There is this idea that , if you are altering a book , you are destroying something someone else made and something that could still be read … some people feel or believe that by tearing the book up you are destroying those ideas …
The flip side is that most books are mass produced objects and are often discarded .
The economist would let the market decide what camp is right , and , though in the past consumers have not been kind to altered books , amid today ’s whirlwind of technology , it is books in their original format that are slumping .
Dettmer sells his works ranging anywhere from two to three thousand , and , according to one source , the five or so galleries that have an inventory of Dettmer ’s work are constantly harping for more .

Some Comments :
Brian Dettmer
Hello Herocious ,
A friend linked me to your review and I wanted to thank you for your attention to my work .
First , I want to point out that books do not only serve the purpose as sculptural material for myself .
I am an avid collector , reader and lover of books .
I value the ideas and the materials .
This is part of what my work is about .
Also , I do n’t think I need to defend my use of materials any more than someone who carves wood has to defend their use of using wood .
Physically , my materials have less of an impact , and culturally , one point of my work is to call attention to issues of re-use , authorship , context and the liquidity of origins as ideas shifts to newer media .
On the issue of authorship , I ’d also like to point out that I have never referred to my work as “ Book Autopsies ” ( although other blogs have made the same mistake due to lack of research - copy / paste - call it your own ) , that the website you linked to is a great blog but not my own site , and that your copying and pasting of other ’s ideas makes you no less guilty than I am in the realm of culture borrowing .
As far as tools go , I think that a knife to explore and expose something is much less destructive than using sarcasm to cut something down that you do n’t understand .
Blogging about the importance of books is like flying a jet around the world to preach about the environment .
Your method contradicts your message .

I think that you should reconsider your unfairly critical view of Brian Dettmer and his extraordinary artwork , of which I am a big fan .
First , you ca n’t seriously believe that “ no matter the genre … there is no form of art as transcendent or laden with meaning ” as the book , which you superficially define in terms of its paper , binding , and cover .
There has to be more to celebrate in a book than the physical integrity of its binding .
Do you treasure and preserve your old phone books , dictionaries , and college text books ?
Dettmer , recognizing that there is more to a book than its “ unsullied ” cover , brings new life to old books that might have otherwise spent the remainder of their days on a dusty bookshelf or in the trash heap .
Do you know what libraries do with old encyclopedias and other books that no longer circulate ?
I love Dettmer ’s work because I love books .
Dettmer ’s “ reckless , abusive behavior ” forces us to consider the purpose of old books :
Do we treasure them as trophies of assimilated ideas ?
Have they become mere stores of old information made redundant in the age of the Internet ?
He raises these questions using only the book ’s own content , which is exposed and re-contextualized to give a beautiful sculpture like a Cubist ’s portrait of the essence of the book .
Think of it as a celebration , rather than a mutilation .
Your sarcasm - laden essay seems to be motivated by more than just your love for the integrity of the printed page .
Perhaps Kent State rescinded its invitation to you to critique the work of its students , when the widely - acclaimed artist Dettmer made himself available ?
Perhaps you still suffer from childhood nightmares of Zorro shredding your entire collection of Dr. Suess books ?
Finally , sticking to facts over speculation , it should be pointed out that the link you provided is not “ Brian Dettmer ’s Official Site . ”
( I do n’t think that he has one . )
And , anyone who is offered a Dettmer altered book priced at two to three thousand should not hesitate to jump on such a deal , well - below the current market ( which has apparently decided that “ [ Dettmer ’s ] camp is right . ” )
TK
Herocious , I just wanted to emphasize that my Kent State and Zorro remarks are tongue - in - cheek .
They read much snarkier than intended , as yours no doubt do also .
Texpat
I miss the days when artists produced beauty , not statements .
TK
Texpat : there is no shortage of “ beautiful ” contemporary art that does not come with an artist ’s statement .
I do n’t think that Dettmer ’s beautiful work needs a statement to be effective , but the intellectual element makes it even more interesting and compelling .
snow day
i think its a mistake to say this work is ne’t beautifull - it is and that is part of the point .
that he is taking something old and not used any more and making it into art .
anyone who dissaggrees with it on the basis that he is destroying an art of work , i think , has missed the point of books .
a book is not an art of work all by itself and say that to any author and i think they would be rather annoyed .
a spine , a hard cover does not make a book beautifull otherwhise Mein Camp would be just as beautifull as any other book .
its the words inside that make them works of art , its the fact that people are reading them .
stop reading a book and it becomes an object that will only mean something to you , and there is the beauty .
These carved books that were long forgotten meant something to Brian Dettmer and so they became beautifull .
and since when , ( urinal hanging from a wall !! ) does art have to be beautifull ?
John S

Professor Steven Pinker has picked the three winners :
Here is what Professor Pinker had to say about the winners ( he even manages to include a charming mini- science essay of his own ! ) :
When I edited The Best American Science and Nature Writing a few years ago , here ’s how I characterized what I look for in a science essay :
The best science essays give readers the blissful click , the satisfying aha ! , of seeing a puzzling phenomenon explained .
When I was a graduate student the antiquated plumbing in my apartment sprang a leak , and an articulate plumber ( perhaps an underemployed PhD ) explained what caused it .
When you shut off a tap , a large incompressible mass moving at high speed has to decelerate very quickly .
This imparts a big force to the pipes , like a car slamming into a wall , which eventually damages the threads and causes a leak .
To deal with this problem , plumbers used to install a a closed vertical section of pipe , a “ pipe riser , ” near each faucet , .
When the faucet is shut , the water compresses the column of air in the riser , which acts like a shock absorber .
Unfortunately , gas under pressure is absorbed by a liquid .
Over time , the air in the column dissolves into the water , which fills the pipe riser , rendering it useless .
So every now and again a plumber has to bleed the system and let air back into the risers , a bit of preventive maintenance the landlord had neglected .
It may not be the harmony of the spheres , but the plumber ’s disquisition captures what I treasure most in science writing : the ability to show how a seemingly capricious occurrence falls out of laws of greater generality .
By that standard , Daylight Atheism ’s Bands of Iron is my top pick .
He starts with something that attracts your attention purely on aesthetic grounds – stripes in a rock .
He explains it by invoking deep , non-obvious , yet understandable principles , at the same time illuminating one of the most interesting phenomena in science – the coevolution of early life and the planet Earth –with a nod to a current issue for good measure .
My second pick is Southern Fried Science ’s
The ecological disaster that is dolphin safe tuna .
It ’s a fine example of one of what I consider to be one of the most important lessons of science : that emotional moralization can lead to outcomes that are morally worse than those based on hard - headed analyses .
Third prize goes to Bad Astronomy ’s Ten Things You Don't Know About Hubble .
I liked the unassuming style , the slew of interesting facts , and the window it provides into the life a working - day scientist – and not the Alpha Primate , but the unsung graduate students and postdocs who actually do the work of science .
Finally , a good blog should not just present text but take advantage of its medium , including page structure and graphics .
I liked the use of a captioned slide show , and the varied photographs , particularly the gorgeous opening shot of the Hubble Telescope against the curve of the Earth and the closeup of a lavender Venus .
It ’s one of the greatest displays of philistinism in human history that so few people appreciate the breathtaking photography made possible by probes like Hubble and Cassini ( and , of course , the large terrestrial telescopes ) .
Not only are the photographs beautiful in their own right , but just think about what we are looking at !
[ Thanks to the members of my lab group — Brian Atwood , James Lee , Rebecca Sutherland , and Kyle Thomas – for their votes and comments . ]
Grand Parkway plan gets boost from stimulus funds MOVE IT !
Like beauty , “ shovel ready ” is in the eye of the beholder .
Despite President Barack Obama calling for stimulus funds to go to “ shovel ready ” projects , the term has no legal or technical definition .
So who decides what qualifies among the thousands of delayed or underfunded transportation projects in Texas and across the U.S. ?
Local decision - makers do .
In the Houston region , that 's the Transportation Policy Council , a 24 - member body comprising elected officials or engineers appointed by the eight counties around Houston , and some of the cities in those counties .
It also includes representatives from the Metropolitan Transit Authority , Texas Department of Transportation and Port of Houston Authority .
The council chose 14 major new transportation projects to spend the stimulus money on .
TxDOT proposed another four projects for our region , but the council had to approve those , too .
A Grand design ?
One of those four is a 14 - mile segment of the Grand Parkway , planned to run across the mostly open Katy Prairie and connect Interstate 10 with U.S. 290 .
This one project , “ Segment E , ” will take $ 181 million of the area 's stimulus allocation for road and bridge projects .
That 's 37 percent of the available pie .
The next - costliest project is $ 50 million — to finish adding direct connector ramps between the Eastex Freeway and Beltway 8 .
But is Segment E “ shovel ready ” ?
While the project has completed the necessary environmental review with the Federal Highway Administration , it lacks a necessary permit from the Army Corps of Engineers .
The permit allows wetlands to be filled in and is needed before construction can begin .
Segment E could involve filling in at least 23 acres of wetlands .
There is also the question of two lawsuits that have been filed concerning Segment E and the future development it will enable .
So why was this considered “ shovel ready ” ?
The designation — and the stimulus money that came with it — angered urban planning groups and environmentalists who say the road is a waste of taxpayer money since few people presently live out there .
They say the money would be better used to solve the hideous traffic problem of the 290 corridor .
Growing area
In a sense , those critics are re-fighting a battle they have already lost , since the Transportation Policy Council added the Grand Parkway to its agenda of “ to do ” projects in 2007 .
“ Look at the growth that 's going to happen in this city , out 290 , and ... look at the growth going out the I - 10 corridor , and you have the opportunity to link those two growth centers , and be ahead of , not playing catch up to congestion , ” said Houston City Councilwoman Sue Lovell , a TPC member .
But Grand Parkway opponents had been hoping that the project , though on the “ to do ” list , would die for lack of funding .
The stimulus money changed all that .
TxDOT put it on the list .
Segment E “ is a priority for the region , ” a TxDOT spokesman said in a statement .
“ If we did not feel it met the standard for ARRA ( stimulus ) funds , we would not have advanced the project . ”
“ I was somewhat surprised about the Grand Parkway because it is a little less nailed down than some of the projects , ” said Alan Clark , a transportation adviser to the TPC .
Members of the council point out that TxDOT decided Segment E should get stimulus money , and they just approved the choice .
The critics wished they had pushed back a little harder , so the money could go to other roads .
“ The Policy Council never asked me to go back to the Commission and ask ‘ What if we do n't pick the Grand Parkway , what else we can ask ? ' ”
Clark said .
“ People felt very constrained about their choice , because of the timelines and the hoopla about the money being taken away , ” he added .
Changing priorities
But critics say the stimulus pick has had a ripple effect on local priorities .
For example , Harris County has cut in half the funding it had planned for the Hempstead Tollway in the 290 corridor .
Three weeks ago , the county commissioners reviewed their new capital infrastructure plan for the next five years .
Last year , the five - year spending plan called for $ 2.05 billion to be spent on a Hempstead Tollway and $ 620,000 on the Grand Parkway .
But the new version of the plan provides $ 1.08 billion for Hempstead and $ 603 million for the Parkway .
“ That 's a terrible trade , ” said David Crossleyof Houston Tomorrow , a nonprofit that advocates denser development .
“ If they 're lowering the amount of money available to spend on this ( Hempstead ) project , I 'd say that 's quite a blow for people who are struggling through congestion on 290 right now . ”
Harris County Judge Ed Emmett declined to “ read anything ” into the changing amount , noting that the five - year capital plan is just that , a plan .
Individual projects still must be approved by the Court .
“ There 's been no slowdown on the Hempstead Tollway , ” he said .
“ There 's a design question on how best to connect it to 610 . ”

After my last video about using a barcode scanner to add and search books in your library , I was feeling pretty happy .
Bar code scanners are pretty cheap–mine cost about $ 65 .
But then Google released the Android Scripting Environment ( ASE ) and it turns out that you do n’t even need a bar code scanner .
Instead , you can use an Android phone such as the G1 .
Just as a proof - of - concept , here ’s a barcode scanner written in six lines of Python code :
import android
droid = android .
Android ( )
code = droid.scanBarcode ( )
isbn = int ( code [ ‘ result ’ ] [ ‘ SCAN_RESULT ’ ] )
url = “ http://books.google.com?q=%d” % isbn
droid.startActivity (‘android.intent.action.VIEW ’ , url )
Thanks to fellow Googler Vijayakrishna Griddaluru for sending me this sample code .
Visiting the resulting url offers the option to add that book to your library :
Pretty easy , huh ?
You can read all about the new scripting environment .
Not only can you scan bar codes , you can use text - to - speech , make phone calls , send text messages , read sensor data , and find your location–all from easy scripts .
One person wrote a script to go into silent mode when the phone is placed screen - down on the table .
It took less than 20 lines of code , and that ’s including comments !
The Android Scripting Environment should make fun projects even easier .
Brad Fitzpatrick wrote about using his Android phone to open his garage door automatically when his motorcycle gets close to home .
Now those sorts of projects are even easier to write . 🙂
Woman and boyfriend accused of letting Khyra Ishaq , 7 , and five other children go hungry as ' punishment '
The body of a seven - year - old girl who died after being starved under a " punishment regime " looked like an African famine victim , a court heard today .
Khyra Ishaq 's " emaciated " body was found in May last year after she had allegedly been held captive by her mother , Angela Gordon , and Gordon 's boyfriend , Junaid Abuhamza .
Khyra and five other children had been locked out of a fully stocked kitchen for up to six months , Birmingham crown court was told .
On the rare occasions they were fed , they were given dry bread or porridge , which they had to eat with their hands on the floor .
If the children were caught " stealing " food they were punished with " detention " , made to stand outside in the cold , beaten with a cane or made to overeat until they were sick , the court heard .
Neighbours reported hearing screams of " let me out , let me out " in the middle of the night , and saw the " abnormally thin " Khyra in the garden in her underwear .
Police and social workers went to the home in Handsworth , Birmingham , several times but Gordon would not let them in , the court heard .
Jurors wept when they were shown pictures of Khyra taken before and after her death on 17 May last year .
Handing over the first picture , taken in April 2007 , the prosecution barrister , Timothy Raggatt QC , said : " That is Khyra Ishaq as she was in life , about a year before the events you are going to be concerned with .
" You see there a picture of a normally developing healthy girl .
That is how her wider family remember her and describe her in life . "
Raggatt then asked the jury to turn to the picture taken at postmortem , which he suggested was reminiscent of something seen in an African famine .
" That did not happen naturally – it was not a result of accident or disease .
It was result of deliberate action .
That is why there 's a charge of murder . "
The jury were shown photographs of a fully stocked kitchen and fridge .
The court heard a lock was fitted high up on the kitchen door to keep the children out .
Raggatt said : " That household was not a household that was short of food , there was ample food in it for everyone .
The supply of food was controlled , it was controlled by these two [ defendants ] . "
The court was told Khyra died of an infection .
But Raggatt said the fact she died of an infection was " really neither here nor there .
The cause of her death was the physical state that she was in .
In a nutshell , their [ position ] is exactly the same as anyone who kept a prisoner and sets out to starve them to the point where their life is at risk .
It 's just as much murder ... as if they had shot , stabbed , beaten or strangled Khyra to death . "
Gordon , 34 , and Abuhamza , 30 , had a duty in law to care for Khyra but had betrayed that duty in every possible sense , while also mistreating five other children in their control , the prosecutor said .
" All of them , as well as being starved , were subjected to violence of differing degrees , " Raggatt said .
The jury was told that Abuhamza , who denies murder , pleaded guilty on Wednesday to child cruelty charges relating to the five other children .
Gordon denies murder and five charges of child cruelty alleged to have been committed between December 2007 and 17 May 2008 .
The court heard Khyra had lived a " normal and happy family life " while her natural parents were together .
But the marriage failed and in 2007 Gordon and Abuhamza became a couple , with Abuhamza moving into the home .
In December 2007 things changed " dramatically " , Raggatt said , when Khyra was removed from school and Gordon refused to admit visitors .
Summarising defence case statements prepared before the trial , Raggatt said Gordon had denied depriving Khyra of food .
" She is saying that none of this is her doing .
Angela Gordon believes Khyra may have suffered from E coli or been poisoned by food given to her by her neighbours . "
Abuhamza had acknowledged he was party to the unlawful killing of Khyra , ­Raggatt said .
The trial continues .
Just as CERN finished repairing the damage last September 's Large Hadron Collider helium leak , a new problem cropped up .
Engineers discovered two vacuum leaks in areas of the enormous atom smasher that are supposed to be maintained at ultracold temperatures .
They 'll have to warm those areas up to complete the repairs , which will set back the project another couple of months .
Now , it wo n't be ready for new particle beams until mid-November .
Late last year , CERN foresaw the LHC back up and running in July 2009 .
In February , the schedule was pushed back to September , and now we probably should n't expect actual particle beams until late November .
The LHC is currently a full 2 1/ 2 years behind the schedule laid out in CERN 's 2005 annual report by the project 's leader , Lyn Evans .
" [ O ] ur commitment is still firmly behind the objective of colliding beams in the summer of 2007 , " Evans wrote back then .
With a machine as complex as the LHC , delays are n't exactly surprising .
Like the International Space Station or National Ignition Facility , the engineering challenges that these unique projects present are difficult to predict ahead of time .
The delays could mean that U.S. physicists using the well - worn Tevatron at Fermilab outside Chicago have more time to discover the famed Higgs Boson .
If that long postulated but never observed particle is as heavy as scientists suspect , Tevatron scientists still have a shot at spotting some signs of its existence .

I used to work on a Java application that ran 24/7 and logged to a file on the system .
The log file was rotated every week and it usually stood around 4GB .
When the shit hit the fan , I checked the log and tried to reverse - engineer how things got so bad .
This is similar to what investigators do with a black box after a plane crash .
How do you inspect a 4GB file with a text editor ?
You might be surprised to know how far Vim can take you in that direction .
I have opened gigabyte - sized files before , and it worked … for some value of “ worked ” .
Luckily , the log4j format the application used contained the timestamp in ISO 8601 format .
It looked something like YYYY - MM - DD hh : mm:ss .
Thankfully , this is trivial to parse and guarantees that alphanumeric sorting ( read : plain old sorting ) will keep the dates in chronological order .
grep and sed
I ’ll cover a simpler example and come back to dates later .
( seq might be called gseq on your system )
seq 10000 > 10000.txt
This created a 10000 - line file with one number , from 1 to 10000 , per line .
I used this contrived example instead of ISO 8601 formatted dates because it was simple to generate and the relationship between the line number and the line content is obvious .
The next piece of the puzzle is grep .
Grep has the -n /-- line - number flag to “ prefix each line of output with the line number ” .
We ’re going to extract from the line containing 444 to the line containing 2000 .
Of course , we know what those line numbers are because of how we generated this file .
This is usually not the case .
Right , we want the first match …
Part of the solution is to use a tighter regular expression .
Also , and the reason I did this , is to realize that the file will keep being parsed after the first match is found .
On huge files , waiting for grep to finish is both time - consuming and unnecessary .
The -m NUM /-- max - count=NUM flag will “ stop reading a file after NUM matching lines . ”
Combining the line numbers , we can slice the log with sed :
sed -n ‘ 444,2000 p ’ 10000.txt
Discussion
Why not skip grep and just RTF sed manual ?
sed -n ‘/^444$/,/^2000$ /p’
10000.txt
My reason : I want to visually confirm that my regular expressions matched the right lines .
The time I would have saved bypassing grep would be wasted the first time I would open a file which did n’t contain what I really wanted .
Why not just grep for timestamp and use that ?
That ’s a subtle point .
The log files contained YYYY - MM - DD hh : mm:ss at the beginning of almost every line .
Initially , I tried :
grep ‘^2009-06-28 04 : ’ log.file
To get the log lines between 4 am and 5 am on a specific date .
This was simple to understand and explain , and it worked beautifully until we realized that it was almost every line … it was missing the stack traces .
It was also missing , although rare in that application , other multi-line log messages .
So , I used :
grep -m 1 -n ‘^2009-06-28 04 : ’ log.file
grep -m 1 -n ‘^2009-06-28 05 : ’ log.file
and used sed to extract the lines in - between .
The Obama Administration 's intention to expand antitrust enforcement appears to be continuing apace , as a number of reports are describing the opening of a new investigation , one that targets a variety of high - tech companies in California 's Bay Area .
This time around , however , the target is n't anticompetitive behavior in the consumer market .
Instead , the Department of Justice has apparently opened an investigation of whether the companies are colluding in the process of hiring , distorting the market for their employees by forging agreements not to recruit from other , similar ventures .
In recent years , there have been a number of high - profile fights involving companies that have lured away an employee of a competing firm .
In the cases that have made their way to court , such as Google - Microsoft and Apple - IBM , the employee was subject to a noncompete contract clause , and the legal battle focused on whether the work for the employee 's new company actually involved competing with their former one .
All of the companies listed as targets of the new investigation , however , are based in California — that state 's Supreme Court declared that noncompete clauses violated state employment law , and were void within its boundaries .
All of the reports of the matter appear to trace back to two sets of sources ; some spoke to The Washington Post , while others talked to a subscription site run by TheDeal.com .
They could , in fact , have been the same sources speaking twice , since the stories seem to have complete agreement regarding the details of the investigation .
Several major high - tech companies are said to be involved , including Apple , Google , and Yahoo , although the source indicated that the inquiry would be " industry wide . "
The odd man out in the investigation is Genentech .
Prior to a recent agreement that will see it folded into the pharmaceutical giant Roche , Genentech was one of the largest publicly traded biotechnology companies .
The biotech job market in the Bay Area tends to be very fluid , with many employees moving around as a steady stream of startups either fold or get purchased by larger concerns .
Unlike the other firms , which could largely forge agreements among themselves , there 's no obvious candidate for Genentech to to have colluded with , which does suggest that the inquiry will ultimately spread well beyond the Bay Area .
In any case , the investigation is likely to be a challenging one .
It 's pretty unlikely that any agreements of the sort were ever formally committed to paper , which would mean that any legal action that resulted would ultimately rely on retained emails or personal testimony .
Cases of that sort have been successfully pursued , but they tend to be more challenging , since it can be difficult to establish whether an employee 's words reflected official company policy .
One possibility is that the DOJ is n't pursuing the investigation with the expectation that it will ultimately lead to legal action .
The administration could simply intend to signal to companies that it is watching , and count on the threat that a business ' hiring practices would be subject to extended legal oversight to be sufficient to restrain anticompetitive practices .
This guy arrives at the Pearly Gates .
He has to wait to be admitted , while St. Pete leafs through his Big Book .
He 's checking to see if the guy is worthy of entry or not .
Saint Peter goes through the books several times , furrows his brow , and says to the guy , " You know , I can't see that you did lots of good in your life but , you never did anything bad either .
Tell you what , if you can tell me of one REALLY good deed that you did in your life , you 're in . "
The guy thinks for a moment and says , " Well , there was this one time when I was drivin ' down the highway and I saw a Biker Gang assaulting this poor girl .
I slowed down my car to see what was going on , and sure enough , that 's what they were doing .
There were about 50 of 'em torturing this chick .
Infuriated , I got out my car , grabbed a tire iron from my trunk and walked straight up to the leader of the gang .
He was a huge guy with a studded leather jacket and a chain running from his nose to his ear .
As I walked up to the leader , the Gang formed a circle all around me .
So I ripped the leader 's chain off his face and smashed him over the head with the tire iron .
Then I turned around and yelled to the rest of them , ' Leave this poor , innocent girl alone , you slime !
You 're all a bunch of sick , deranged animals !
Go home before I teach you all a lesson in pain ! ' "
St. Peter , extremely impressed , says , " Really ?
Wow , when did all this happen ? "
" Er .. about two minutes ago . "
Every Saturday morning at the bustling organic farmers market in rural Point Reyes Station , California , local residents buy food directly from the farmers who have grown it .
Though one can walk from end to end of the market in a single minute , the diversity it offers is bewildering : first there are the vegetables : spiky leeks , autumn greens and warm - toned squashes .
Then you have the processed goods , everything from ice cream and olive oil to soap .
A musician plays for the crowd and the conversation is lively .
Here Cowgirl Creamery Dairy sells Mount Tamalpais cheese , over there Kevin Lunny of Inverness sells grass fed beef while Warren Weber 's Star Route Farms of Bolinas sells edible flowers and Margie McDonald 's Wild Blue Farm sells pumpkins .
The shoppers will tell you they prefer organic foods for both health and environmental reasons .
The absence of pesticides is generally equally important as the guarantee that food will not contain genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) , whose health effects are still largely unknown .
Meanwhile at the other end of the North American continent , Whole Foods , a Texas - based natural food chain , recently opened New York 's biggest grocery store in at Time Warner Center 's new shopping mall , touting it as 59,000 square feet of the " Ultimate Grocery and Lifestyle Shopping Experience . "
The company promises to turn " a seemingly mundane chore into one of New York 's favorite new pastimes . "
Customers are offered Jamba Juice fruit smoothies , Genji Express Sushi wrapped in organic seaweed ; more than 700 varieties of wine ; and a Chocolate Enrobing Station " where customers can request just about anything covered in chocolate . "
Until a decade ago , organic foods were available only through tiny farmers markets , health and natural food stores , but today their growing popularity means that more organic food is now sold by chain stores like Whole Foods .
Often , the food itself is produced by companies ranging from General Mills to Nestle to Coca Cola , and grown on corporate - owned farms no longer synonymous with small farms , rural communities , social justice and humane treatment of animals .
Small Brands , Big Owners
What have organic brands Health Valley ( cereals ) , Bearitos ( corn chips ) , Bread Shop ( granola ) and Celestial Seasonings ( tea ) have in common ?
These apparently independent companies are all owned by the Hain Celestial Group
Even though Hain Celestial is an organic giant in its own right , it has even bigger owners .
According to research by Paul Glover and Carole Resnick of the Greenstar Food Coop ( Ithaca , New York ) the company 's investors include Philip Morris , Monsanto , Citigroup , Exxon - Mobil , Wal - Mart and aerospace military contractor Lockheed Martin .
And in September 1999 the H. J. Heinz food conglomerate bought a 20 % stake in Hain Celestial .
Hain Celestial is by no means a unique case :
* Cascadian Farms is a subsidiary of Small Planet Foods , which is a division of agribusiness colossus General Mills .
And General Mill 's main shareholders include Philip Morris , Exxon - Mobil , General Electric , Chevron , Nike , McDonald's , Monsanto , Dupont , Dow Chemical and PepsiCo .
* Silk Soy Drink is part of the White Wave corporation , itself a Dean Foods subsidiary .
And according to Glover and Resnick , Dean Foods ' main investors include Microsoft , General Electric , Citigroup , Pfizer , Philip Morris , Exxon - Mobil , Coca Cola , Wal - Mart , PepsiCo and Home Depot .
* Odwalla , makers of organic orange juice , is owned by Minute Maid , which is in turn a division of Coca Cola .
* Boca Burger is owned by Kraft , which is part of Philip Morris .
* Arrowhead Water and Poland Spring Water , are Nestle subsidiaries .
* Organic Cow , founded by small New England organic dairy farmers , is now part of the Colorado - based Horizon , whose sales just topped $ 200 million annually and which controls 70 % of the American organic milk market .
Horizon Holding company was itself was acquired by the Dean Foods conglomerate in 2003 .
" I'm all for it as long as it's for real , " says Jeremy Rosen of Fresh Run Farm at the Point Reyes market , whose little stand boasts vegetables ranging from artichokes and arugula all the way through nettles and turnips .
" [ But large corporations ] wo n't be able to put all the care into the land that small organic farmers put in . "
Rosen 's farm , located just a few miles from Point Reyes , is in one of the first organic production zones in the San Francisco Bay area and he doubts that large corporate farms will ever be truly sustainable because " conserving soil on a huge farm scale is not possible . "
Yet , in order to meet the increasing demand for organic food , production is increasing far beyond its original base .
Sales of organic foods and beverages in the United States surpassed the $ 11 billion mark in 2002 , and according to a 2003 survey sponsored by the Whole Foods retail chain , 54 % of US consumers have tried organic foods and one third consumed more of them than in the previous year .
America 's mega-stories like Wal - Mart , Price Chopper and 7 - Eleven are already in on the organic action , offering organic products on their shelves , and food corporations , such as agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland and Campbell 's Soup , have added organic items to their product lines .
The organic market in the United States is expected to reach $ 30.7 billion by 2007 , with a five - year compound annual growth rate of 21.4 % between 2002 and 2007 , according to the Datamonitor research firm .
" There are people who criticize the entry of these megacorporations into organic [s ] ...
They fear that they will jeopardize organic standards and the very ideas organic agriculture is based upon , " says Helge Hellberg , director of Marin Organic a non-governmental organization that promotes sustainable agriculture .
" But it is also true that we need these companies in order to make a nationwide movement for organic products , " he adds .
The increasing level of consumer demand means boom times for U.S. organic farms .
The state of Vermont , for example , had 78 organic certified producers in 1993 , and by 2003 their number had grown to 289 .
Certified acreage in the state has grown from 23,638 in 2001 to 30,387 in 2003 .
In California , Certified Organic California Growers confirms that the state has 170,000 organically grown acres .
At current growth rates , organic sales will constitute 10 % of American agriculture by 2010 .
These skyrocketing growth rates convinced the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) to set national organic standards in October 2002 , after 12 years of delays .
While some organic advocates consider USDA recognition a triumph , according to Ronnie Cummins of the Minnesota - based Organic Consumers Association ( OCA ) , the department set the standards largely at the request of agribusiness corporations and mass retailers .
He believes they wanted uniform national standards to speed their entry into the organic market , replacing multiple state standards that made it more complicated for the chains who grow in one part of the country and sell at the opposite end of the nation .
" The biggest problems with the USDA organic regulations is that they say nothing about subsidized
water , animal treatment , labor standards and food miles ( organic advocates want to reduce the distance that food travels from farm to consumer in order to reduce fossil fuel use and promote local sustainable development ) .
Also the organic standards are biased in favor of large corporations because they are size - neutral , that is they apply equally to an agribusiness giant and a small family farm .
Large businesses can cover the costs of these regulations more easily , " says Cummins .
Indeed , according to a recent International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements ( IFOAM ) report , the USDA is now investigating support for international organic standards in order to facilitate global trade in organic food .
The USDA itself does not certify farms or products .
Rather , it accredits institutions , be they public agencies or private firms , to do the actual certification .
Neither growers nor sellers are allowed to label " organic " any product that has not been certified as such by a USDA accredited institution , and the agency is the final authority for appeals on just what the organic standard will mean .
Olivia Sargeant , a nutritional consultant from San Francisco , who works at the Marin Sun Farm booth at the Point Reyes market thinks the bigger corporate and governmental role " has both pros and cons . "
Wider penetration " will bring some education to people , but it's also co-opting the very term ' organic ' . "
Sargeant is also concerned that large natural food retailers like Whole Foods are putting mom-and - pop stores out of business in the same manner as conventional food chains like Safeway and Wal - Mart .
" My local health food store went out of business because of Whole Foods .
Large retail chains , no matter how ' ecological ' they may be , are bad for locally - owned businesses . "
But even natural foods giant Whole Foods could eventually lose out to conventional stores .
USDA statistics estimate that the market shares for organic food sales are : conventional supermarkets have 49 % , natural food stores have 48 % and farmers markets and food buying clubs just three percent .
And a June 2003 MarketResearch.com study , which uses stricter criteria for what constitutes a health food and natural food store , estimated that the percentage of sales of organic food sold through these outlets fell from 62 % in 1998 to just 31 % last year .
Despite the fact that most consumers are buying their organic food from the big retailers , buried in the 2003 Whole Foods survey is another interesting piece of information : 57 % of organic consumers believe that organic foods are grown on small farms .
While Cummins believes that this is still largely true in practice , he says that this will change over time .
" I see some troubling trends , especially in organic dairy .
In that sector there is a major move toward moving production from family farms to industrial feedlot factory farms .
Horizon controls 70 % of the US organic dairy market , and last year it was bought by Dean Foods , " he told CorpWatch ..
" No way in hell can you be organic if you have over a few hundred cows .
After a certain size , the operation cannot be ecologically sound anymore , among other things because of the amount of manure produced , " added Cummins .
" In California there are huge organic farms that produce organic lettuce and carrots in large monocultures , using large energy inputs and receiving subsidized water - three elements that are anti-environmental and unacceptable for those who want ecologically sound farming , " he adds .
In a 2002 study conducted at the University of California at Davis , Karen Klonsky documents that organic food production in California is already concentrated .
Two percent of organic farm operations , about 27 growers , bring in over $ 1 million a year and represent over half of the organic sales in the state .
Indeed while over 90 % of all U.S. farms are categorized by the USDA as small , the other 10 % -- big agribusiness -- provide approximately 60 % of all food sales .
Nationwide , two corporations , United Natural Foods and Tree of Life , control the distribution of about three - fourths of all - natural products .
Tree of Life is owned by Koninklijke Wessanen , a Dutch conglomerate that is itself one of the largest food companies in Europe .
Not all in the organic food business see these trends as negative , Barbara Haumann , spokesperson for the U.S. Organic Trade Association says , " The more players , the more products will be available to consumers , who , in turn , will buy more products .
This will result in more land under organic production , regardless of the size of the operation .
And that will be better for the environment , local communities and the planet . "
Another supporter of corporate entry into the market is the pioneering organic yogurt maker Gary Hirshberg CEO of Stonyfield Farms .
He shepherded the sale of the United State 's premiere organic yogurt maker to the France - based multinational Danone corporation while keeping himself as CEO of the acquired company .
Hirshberg 's family made an estimated $ 35 million on the $ 125 million dollar sale .
He says he believes the end result of the deal is a win-win situation for organic producers and consumers .
Asked if the buyout had affected Stonyfield 's practices , company spokesperson Mary Townsend says : " Danone actually let us operate the way we always had , contracting with small family farms and in line with the strictest organic standards .
Furthermore , Danone is asking us to help them change their operations worldwide to organic production . "
Laurent Sacchi , vice president of corporate communications for Groupe Danone , tells CorpWatch : " Danone has encouraged ( and will continue to encourage ) Stonyfield to continue the practices that have made them distinct ; for example , the 10 % profits for the planet program , the support of family farming , their support of organic .
Danone is using Stonyfield as a model for how alternative ways of doing business and farming could be successfully developed , even inside or in the frame of a more ' classical ' company . "
Business accounts of the sale note that since it costs $ 70 - 80 million just to launch a national brand in the U.S. acquiring an established name like Stonyfield is far less risky than starting a competitor .
But Paul Cienfuegos of the California - based Arcata Committee on Democracy and Corporations and a longtime critic of " corporate organics " accuses large firms like Stonyfield of using their organic subsidiaries to infiltrate sustainable agriculture and water down organic standards .
He cites a recent organics convention in Texas where an OTA sponsored panel considered how organic and genetically engineered ( GE ) crops could co-exist .
Cienfogos maintains that most advocates believe that the discussion on GE crops should focus on how to get them banned , not on how they could co-exist with non-GE crops .
" The fact that the General Mills corporation [ Owner of the Cascadian organic brand ] is a major donor ( of OTA ) may have had something to do with this , " he says .
And critics such as Rich Ganis , who writes for the online newsletter informedeating .org , contend that the modest ecological benefits of more organic acres under production due to corporate agriculture are being " offset by the tremendous amount of fossil fuel , packaging , and other resources expended in the production and distribution of these ' value - added ' products .

The doctor who tried to save an Iranian protester as she bled to death on a street in Tehran has told the BBC of her final moments .
Dr Arash Hejazi , who is studying at a university in the south of England , said he ran to Neda Agha - Soltan 's aid after seeing she had been shot in the chest .
Despite his attempts to stop the bleeding she died in less than a minute , he said .
Video of Ms Soltan 's death was posted on the internet and images of her have become a rallying point for Iranian opposition supporters around the world .
Dr Hejazi also told how passers - by then seized an armed Basij militia volunteer who appeared to admit shooting Ms Soltan .
Dr Hejazi said he had not slept for three nights following the incident , but he wanted to speak out so that her death was not in vain .
He doubted that he would be able to return to Iran after talking openly about Ms Soltan 's killing .
Neda Agha -Soltan was shot in the chest " I was there with some friends because we had heard that there were some protests and we decided to go and take a look , " he said .
" Anti-riot police were coming by motorcycles towards the crowd . "
Dr Hejazi said he saw Ms Soltan , who he did not know , with an older man who he thought was her father but later on learned was her music teacher .
" Suddenly everything turned crazy .
The police threw teargas and the motorcycles started rushing towards the crowd .
We ran to an intersection and people were just standing .
They did n't know what to do .
" We heard a gunshot .
Neda was standing one metre away from me .
I turned back and I saw blood gushing out of Neda 's chest .
" She was in a shocked situation , just looking at her chest .
Then she lost her control .
" We ran to her and lay her on the ground .
I saw the bullet wound just below the neck with blood gushing out .
" I have never seen such a thing because the bullet , it seemed to have blasted inside her chest , and later on , blood exiting from her mouth and nose .
Ms Soltan has become a rallying point for protesters around the world " I had the impression that it had hit the lung as well .
Her blood was draining out of her body and I was just putting pressure on the wound to try to stop the bleeding , which was n't successful unfortunately , and she died in less than one minute . "
Dr Hejazi said he first thought the gunshot had come from a rooftop .
But later he saw protesters grab an armed man on a motorcycle .
" People shouted ' we got him , we got him ' .
They disarmed him and took out his identity card which showed he was a Basij member .
People were furious and he was shouting , ' I did n't want to kill her ' .
" People did n't know what do to do with him so they let him go .
But they took his identity card .
There are people there who know who he is .
Some people were also taking photos of him . "
Dr Hejazi said he knew he was putting himself in jeopardy by talking about what happened .
" It was a tough decision to make to come out and talk about it but she died for a cause .
She was fighting for basic rights ...
I do n't want her blood to have been shed in vain . "
He added : " She died on the streets to say something . "
Dr Hejazi said he did not believe he could now return to Iran .
" They are going to denounce what I am saying .
They are going to put so many things on me .
I have never been in politics .
I am jeopardising my situation because of the innocent look in her ( Neda 's ) eyes . "

RIVERSIDE , Calif . —
Same - sex behavior is a nearly universal phenomenon in the animal kingdom , common across species , from worms to frogs to birds , concludes a new review of existing research .
“ It ’s clear that same - sex sexual behavior extends far beyond the well - known examples that dominate both the scientific and popular literature : for example , bonobos , dolphins , penguins and fruit flies , ” said Nathan Bailey , the first author of the review paper and a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biology at UC Riverside .
There is a caveat , however .
The review also reports that same - sex behaviors are not the same across species , and that researchers may be calling qualitatively different phenomena by the same name .
“ For example , male fruit flies may court other males because they are lacking a gene that enables them to discriminate between the sexes , ” Bailey said .
“ But that is very different from male bottlenose dolphins , who engage in same - sex interactions to facilitate group bonding , or female Laysan Albatross that can remain pair - bonded for life and cooperatively rear young . ”
Published June 16 in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution , the review by Bailey and Marlene Zuk , a professor of biology at UCR , also finds that although many studies are performed in the context of understanding the evolutionary origins of same - sex sexual behavior , almost none have considered its evolutionary consequences .
“ Same - sex behaviors — courtship , mounting or parenting — are traits that may have been shaped by natural selection , a basic mechanism of evolution that occurs over successive generations , ” Bailey said .
“ But our review of studies also suggests that these same - sex behaviors might act as selective forces in and of themselves . ”
A selective force , which is a sudden or gradual stress placed on a population , affects the reproductive success of individuals in the population .
“ When we think of selective forces , we tend to think of things like weather , temperature , or geographic features , but we can think of the social circumstances in a population of animals as a selective force , too , ” Bailey said .
“ Same - sex behavior radically changes those social circumstances , for example , by removing some individuals from the pool of animals available for mating . ”
Bailey , who works in Zuk ’s lab , noted that researchers in the field have made significant strides in the past two and a half decades studying the genetic and neural mechanisms that produce same - sex behaviors in individuals , and the ultimate reasons for their existence in populations .
“ But like any other behavior that does n’t lead directly to reproduction — such as aggression or altruism ?
same - sex behavior can have evolutionary consequences that are just now beginning to be considered , ” he said .
“ For example , male - male copulations in locusts can be costly for the mounted male , and this cost may in turn increase selection pressure for males ’ tendency to release a chemical called panacetylnitrile , which dissuades other males from mounting them . ”
The review paper :
Examines work done to test hypotheses about the origins of same - sex behavior in animals .
Provides a framework for categorizing same - sex behavior , for example , is it adaptive , not adaptive , occurs often , infrequently ?
Discusses what has been discovered about the genetics of same - sex behavior , especially in the model organism , the fruit fly Drosophila , and in human beings .
Examines connections between human sexual orientation research , and research on non-human animals , and highlights promising avenues of research in non-human systems .
The reviewers expected the research papers they read for their article would give them a better understanding of the degree to which same - sex behaviors are heritable in animals .
“ How important are genes to the expression of these behaviors , compared to environmental factors ? ” Bailey said .
“ This is still unknown .
Knowing this information would help us better understand how the behaviors evolve , and how they affect the evolution of other traits .
It could also help us understand whether they are something that all individuals of a species are capable of , but only some actually express . ”
Bailey recommends that fellow evolutionary biologists studying same - sex behavior in animals adopt some of the research approaches that have been successful in human studies .
“ We have estimates , for example , of the heritability of sexual orientation in humans , but none that I know of in other animals , ” he said .
“ Scientists have also targeted locations on the human genome that may contribute to sexual orientation , but aside from the fruit fly , we have no such detailed knowledge of the genetic architecture of same - sex behavior in other animals . ”
Next in their research , Bailey and Zuk plan to begin experimentally addressing some of the many issues raised in their review .
Said Bailey , “ We want to get at this question : what are the evolutionary consequences of these behaviors ?
Are they important in the evolution of mating behavior , or do they just add extra ‘ background noise ’ ?
We are pursuing work on the Laysan Albatross , in which females form same - sex pairs and rear young together .
Same - sex behavior in this species may not be aberrant , but instead can arise as an alternative reproductive strategy . ”

For five months now in the Umbrian hill town of Perugia , an American exchange student called “ Angel Face ” by the tabloid press has been on trial for the murder of her roommate .
On Friday , for the first time , that student , Amanda Knox will testify on her own behalf .
The case against Knox has so many holes in it , and is so tied to the career of a powerful Italian prosecutor who is under indictment for professional misconduct , that any fair - minded jury would have thrown it out months ago .
That is not to say the Italian courts are not fair - minded .
We kill innocent Americans often enough through our legal system , kill them because of shoddy police work or racial prejudice .
Knox ’s fate is in the hand of six jurors , two judges among them , who meet two days a week and will soon take a long summer break before reaching a verdict in the fall .
But this is not about whose system is better .
This is about a high - spirited British student , Meredith Kercher , found strangled and stabbed in November of 2007 in the Perugian cottage she shared with Amanda Knox .
Justice must be done .
And in fact , a man has already been convicted of her murder – more about that in a moment .
But it is also about Amanda Knox , an equally high - spirited student whose life has been nearly ruined by this collision of predatory journalism and slipshod prosecution – “ the railroad job from hell , ” as one outside expert hired by CBS News concluded .
Amanda Knox was 20 years old , a Jesuit - educated student from a Seattle family without money , when she arrived in Italy for a term abroad .
She had worked three jobs while attending the University of Washington to save money for this trip .
She had no criminal record , was an athlete whose soccer tricks had earned her a grade school nickname of “ Foxy Knoxy , ” a lover of theater and the written word .
And she was also a “ little spacey , ” in the words oft - used by friends to describe her .
She started seeing an Italian student , Raffaele Sollecito , the son of a prominent doctor .
They spent the night of the murder at his apartment , she said , and no reliable witness or credible evidence has ever placed them at the crime scene .
But within days of the killing , these two would be painted across Europe as thrill - seekers who killed a woman in a drug - fueled orgy .
That may sound like a preposterous motive for a murder by college kids , but it ’s a recurring obsession for the prosecutor in the Knox case .
“ Case closed , ” the Italian authorities said in those first days of November , 2007 , even though they had yet to arrest the only man who has ever been found guilty of the murder .
As it happened , my daughter was studying in Italy at the same time – like Knox , una studentessa di Seattle .
They did not know each other .
But after the tabloid fallout , any female exchange student from Seattle was suddenly cast in a dark light .
After my daughter wrote about her experience for this newspaper , she found the paparazzi camped outside her room in Bologna .
For all of that , our family consider ourselves honorary Italians ; we lived there for a short while , our kids went to grade school there , and we love the country dearly .
Knox may not feel the same way .
She spent nearly a year in jail without being charged .
This , despite the fact that the only physical evidence found on the murder victim ’s body was from someone else – a drifter with a drug problem named Rudy Guede .
Shortly after the crime , Guede fled Italy for Germany .
His prints and his DNA were found in Kercher ’s room and on the body .
After being arrested , he underwent a fast - track trial and was found guilty last fall of complicity in the murder , and sentenced to 30 years in prison .
That should have been the end of it .
Guede initially told one story : that he had sex with Kercher and then went into the bathroom , plugged in his iPod , and came out to find a strange man standing over her with a knife .
Then , months later , Guede changed his story : he said that strange man was now Sollecito , assisted by Amanda Knox in a sex game that went wrong .
Neither of them had been named by him before .
Guede denied being the killer .
But if Knox and Sollecito had killed Kercher , and were in that blood - splattered room , why is there no physical trace from them on the body ?
A print ?
A swap of DNA somewhere ?
After all , Kercher had died after a brutal strangulation , evidence of considerable struggle , with knife pokes in the neck .
“ In every murder , the killer always leaves something behind and always takes something with him , ” said Anne Bremner , a former prosecutor and prominent attorney , a member of International Academy of Trial Lawyers , who is assisting the Knox family , pro-bono – though she has no role in the actual defense .
“ All the forensic evidence points to Rudy Guede . ”
The prosecution says at least one of the college students did leave something behind .
They said they found a bra clasp with Sollecito ’s DNA on it .
But they discovered Kercher ’s clasp nearly six weeks after the murder – a highly suspect and tainted piece of evidence from a contaminated crime scene .
Knox and Sollecito were arrested in large part because of what they said under duress by interrogation of the prosecutor , Giuliano Mignini .
Remember that name .
After being questioned all night without an attorney or a professional translator , Knox said some things in response to a series of hypothetical questions .
This was initially trumpeted as a contradiction , or worst – a confession .
A higher court later threw out the most damning statements .
Lurid details were leaked to a press corps that trolled through Knox ’s college sex life – something they would never do to a man .
Her social network computer pictures , showing the usual 20 - year - old drinking faces , were splashed across front pages .
The Brits , in particular , had a field day .
Locked from her house in the first days after it became a crime scene , Knox went to a store one day with Sollecito to buy emergency underwear .
The British tabs bannered this as a g - string celebration of remorseless killers .
Little wonder that an Italian television poll found Amanda Knox a bigger personality than Carla Bruni .
Still , Knox ’s statements were troubling .
She and Sollecito gave different versions of what they had done the night of the killing , their memories clouded no doubt because they ’d been smoking hashish .
And Knox raised the possibility that a bar owner with an airtight alibi could have been involved .
The authorities later claimed they found the murder weapon , a kitchen knife , at Sollecito ’s house .
The knife had Knox ’s DNA on the handle – no surprise , considering how much time she spent with her boyfriend .
But it was also described , after repeated and highly questionable testing , as containing a tiny amount of DNA that might match that of the victim .
That DNA , according to several outside experts , was of such trace amounts , and was available only after numerous enhancements in the testing , that it could belong to many people .
Also , the knife did not match the bloody outline of a knife at the crime scene .
So why push forward against Knox and Sollecito ?
They had no motive .
The evidence is flawed and flimsy .
One explanation comes from Douglas Preston , a prominent best - selling American author who lived in the Florentine hills while researching a book about a serial killer never found , “ The Monster of Florence , ” co-authored by Italian journalist Mario Spezi .
After the serial murders stopped , a prosecutor decided to reopen the case .
His theory was that the killer or killers were Satanists from an ancient cult that harvested body parts .
That prosecutor is the same one in the Knox case – Giuliano Mignini .
“ One day I ’m walking down the streets of Florence when my cell phone rings , ” said Preston in an interview .
“ They say , ‘ This is the police – we ’re coming to get you . ’”
For three hours , the author was interrogated by Mignini about possible connections to the case .
His phone calls with co-author Spezi had been wiretapped , and Mignini asked him to explain things .
Preston said he was told he must confess to perjury or obstruction of justice .
“ I ’m not the kind of person who could be broken down , ” said Preston .
“ But now I ’m terrified .
My wife and kids are out having lunch , and I ’m thinking I ’m never going to see them again . ”
Preston is indicted – Mignini has that power – but then told he can go free if he leaves Italy .
The author departs the next day , banished , humiliated and deeply troubled .
Fast forward to the Amanda Knox interrogations .
She ’s 20 , hardly a world sophisticate , who spoke only passable Italian at the time .
Mignini used the same methods – a pattern now coming to light in the misconduct case against him , in which he is accused by a Florentine judge of intimidation and wiretapping journalists and other perceived enemies .
He has denied any misconduct .
When Preston looked at the case against Amanda Knox , he saw a rogue prosecutor and a miscarriage of justice .
“ There was no evidence , ” he said .
“ I realized it was all bogus .
Mignini believes that Satan walks the land and anyone who is against him must be working for the other side . ”
One more thing about this case : a civil suit by the victim ’s family and the wrongly accused bar owner is going forth at the same time , meaning that highly prejudicial information that a criminal jury would not usually hear is being aired , before the same people .
Amanda Knox faces 30 years in prison if convicted .
For Mignini , what is at stake is his reputation , his honor – no small things in Italy .
I ’m haunted by an observation from Rachel Donadio , my Times colleague in Rome .
In last Sunday ’s paper , in trying to explain Silvio Berlusconi , she wrote :
“ In Italy , the general assumption is that someone is guilty until proven innocent .
Trials – in the press and in the courts – are more often about defending personal honor than establishing facts , which are easily manipulated . ”
All trials are about narrative .
In Seattle , where I live , I see a familiar kind of Northwestern girl in Amanda Knox , and all the stretching , the funny faces , the neo - hippie touches are benign .
In Italy , they see a devil , someone without remorse , inappropriate in her reactions .
In the end , of course , this is about the victim .
Meredith Kercher is gone , a daughter no more , leaving behind the “ brutality , the violence , and the great sorrow it has caused , ” as her mother said in court last week .
But one life taken should not keep anyone from asking the right questions before ruining two others .
Does Tiller murder presage a surge in right - wing domestic terrorism ?
Here ’s part of Planned Parenthood ’s statement on Tiller …
Dr. Tiller was the epitome of high quality medical care underscored by deep compassion for his patients .
He provided critical reproductive health care services , including abortion services to women facing some of the most difficult medical circumstances .
He was continually harassed by abortion opponents for much of his career – his clinic was burned down , he was shot by a health center protestor , and he was recently targeted for investigation only to be acquitted by a jury just a few months ago .
None of this stopped George Tiller from his commitment to providing women and their families with compassionate care that others were unwilling to offer .
I HAVE to write a separate news story about the Sotomayor confirmation hearings this week , so the column will probably be about something non-newsy : a summer camp for the children of atheists in Ohio .
I visited Camp Quest a couple of weeks ago .
It 's like a regular summer camp — lots of kids sleeping in cabins , exploring the woods , roasting marshmallows over campfires and heaving buckets of water over each other for no particular reason .
But unlike , say , Bible camp , there 's a strong atmosphere of scepticism .
All the counsellors are secular humanists .
The kids are taught to question everything .
They also learn about the scientific method while examining bugs in a pond .
Summer camps satisfy a ravening demand .
American kids have immensely long summer holidays , while their parents hardly get any time off at all .
Solution : send the little blighters to sleep in the wilderness .
Camp Quest offers something more specific .
In the most religious parts of America , it is tough being a secular teenager .
Many of the kids at Camp Quest say that , at school , they either keep quiet about their lack of belief or are teased for it .
What they like about Camp Quest is that no one tells them they are going to Hell .
Plus , of course , summer camp is fun .
You get to shoot longbows and stage comedy skits .
I listen to an amateur naturalist teaching the older kids something slightly rude about a certain type of toad they find in that pond .
You can tell a male from a female because it croaks when you press its back .
Why ?
Because males of this species will try to mate with anything .
So when a male feels a weight on his back , he assumes it is another male .
He croaks to say : " I 'm male , too .
Go away . "

Wächst die Wut in Deutschland ?
Florian Rötzer
Auch in Deutschland sollen sich die Sicherheitsbehörden auf soziale Unruhen aufgrund der Wirtschaftskrise vorbereiten und einen " Atlas der Wut " erstellt haben , behauptet zumindest ein Buchautor
Angeblich haben die deutschen Sicherheitsbehörden einen " Atlas der Wut " angelegt , wie Udo Ulfkotte in seinem neuen Buch " Vorsicht Bürgerkrieg !
Was lange gärt , wird endlich Wut " schreibt , das morgen in den Verkauf geht und für das heute schon mal mit dramatischen Tönen Werbung gemacht wird .
Man gehe davon aus , dass es in Deutschland nach Finanz - und Wirtschaftskrise zu Protesten und Unruhen kommen könne .
Die
Wut soll wachsen , zumal wenn die Arbeitslosigkeit zunimmt , die Inflation wieder kommt , die sozialen Sicherungssysteme und andere staatliche Leistungen aufgrund der explodierenden Schuldenlast abgebaut werden und Union sowie FDP die Menschen trotzdem mit dem Wahlversprechen auf Steuersenkungen zu umgarnen suchen .
Zuletzt wurde auch von Gewerkschaften und der SPD vor möglichen sozialen Unruhen gewarnt , was aber nicht gerne gehört wurde ( Soziale Unruhen - mehr als ein Medien - Hype ? ) .
Auch in Großbritannien und anderen Ländern bereitet man sich vor , nachdem es erste Protestwellen bereits in Griechenland , Ungarn , Island oder Litauen gegeben hat ( Rezession und Repression , Die Wut einer enttäuschten Generation ) .
Ende 2008 warnte bereits IWF - Direktor Dominique Strauss - Kahn vor Aufstände und Unruhen .
In Großbritannien , wo der womöglich " heiße Sommer " schon länger diskutiert wird ( Britische Polizei bereitet sich auf " heißen Sommer " vor ) , ist man allerdings schon damit konfrontiert , dass die Polizei dieses Jahr 480 Millionen Pfund [ http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6597434.ece sparen ] und weiter Personal entlassen muss .
Fast in der Hälfte der Polizeibezirke in England und Wales sind dieses Jahr schon Personalreduzierungen vorgenommen worden .
In den Medien wird die Befürchtung geäußert , dass dies zusammengeht mit einer wachsenden Arbeitslosigkeit und der daraus entstehenden Kriminalität .
Von möglichen Unruhen einmal ganz abgesehen .
Ulfkotte , der bislang die Angst vor den Islamisten beschworen hat , behauptet , die deutschen Sicherheitsbehörden hätten schon nach den Unruhen 2005 in Frankreich damit begonnen , eine Liste mit den Orten und Stadtteilen zusammenzustellen , in denen das Risiko für Krawalle besonders hoch sei .
Die ständig aktualisierte Liste umfasse 165 Orte und Stadtteile , schreibt die Leipziger Volkszeitung .
Als problematisch sollen das Ruhrgebiet , Sachsen , Stadtteile in Hamburg , Bremen , Berlin , Frankfurt , München und Hannover , in Ostdeutschland in Leipzig ( Leutzsch und Kleinzschocher ) , Dresden ( Prohlis und Pieschen ) , Jena , Chemnitz , Hoyerswerda , Halle oder Rostock - Lichtenhage aufgeführt sein .
In der Ankündigung des Buches wird viel versprochen und Angst geschürt , was ja schon der Titel leisten soll , in dem vom drohenden Bürgerkrieg die Rede ist : " Linke gegen Rechte , Arme gegen Reiche , Ausländer gegen Inländer , mittendrin religiöse Fanatiker – das explosive Potential ist gewaltig .
… Fakt ist : Es gärt im Volk , die Wut wächst und die Spannungen nehmen zu .
Es ist nur noch eine Frage der Zeit , wann sich aufgestauter Ärger und Hass entladen werden . "
Nach dem Crime - oder Kaufkraft - Mapping bietet Ulfkotte nun das Notstands - Mapping an – mit konkreten Handlungshilfen .
In den Risikoorten sollte man womöglich nicht investieren , wer dort wohnt , sollte überlegen , ob er nicht woandershin zieht .
Es könnte ja auch sein , dass man ähnlich wie in Frankreich keine Arbeit mehr erhält , wenn man aus dem sozialen Brennpunkt der Banlieus kommt , oder dass die Polizei sich aus diesen Orten zurückzieht und nur noch in Stoßtrupps erscheint .
Angeblich würde sich die Polizei zusammen mit der Bundeswehr auf die Bekämpfung schwerer Unruhen vorbereiten .
Für das Buch , das im wenig vertrauenserweckenden Kopp Verlag – dem nach eigener Darstellung " Verlag und Fachbuchversand für Enthüllungsliteratur , Verschwörungen , unterdrückte Informationen und Erfindungen und Geheimgesellschaften " - erscheint , wird auch so geworben : " Immer , wenn in der Geschichte eine schwere Wirtschaftskrise , ethnische Spannungen und staatlicher Machtzerfall zusammen kamen , hat es blutige Bürgerkriege und ethnische Säuberungen gegeben .
Die Geschichte wiederholt sich .
Was können Sie tun , um sich und Ihre Familie noch rechtzeitig zu schützen ?
Inklusive großer Deutschlandkarte zum Herausnehmen . Mit allen bürgerkriegsgefährdeten Gebieten . "
Das ist doch einmal eine andere
Art des Selbsthilfebuchs .
Jetzt brauchen wir noch Ratgeber , wie und wo wir in der deutschen Wildnis – oder in einem Nachbarland - einen Bürgerkrieg überleben können und wie wir unsere Häuser und Gärten zur Selbstverteidigung – und - versorgung aufrüsten müssen .
Möglicherweise sollten wir möglichst schnell noch einen Unterschlupf auf dem Land suchen und einem Schützenverein beitreten .
Es wurde ja schon von der Regierung vermieden , die Waffengesetze wirklich zu verschärfen .
( Florian Rötzer )
This is pretty beyond the pale , even for Fox News :
Here ’s a key part of what he said :
Now look , Julie , I want to be clear .
If , when the facts are in , we find out that through some convoluted chain of events , he really was captured by the Taliban , I ’m with him .
But , if he walked away from his post and his buddies at wartime …
I do n’t care how hard it sounds , as far as I ’m concerned , the Taliban can save us a lot of legal hassles and legal bills .
Amazing how these sociopaths are able to get up on the teevee day after day and say horrible stuff like this and it ’s all ok — because you ’re a Republican .
Could you imagine the non -stop 24 - hour - news freak - out on the right if someone like Howard Dean or Wesley Clark said something like this ?
So , should you send a thank you note after you have your interview ?
Absolutely , because everyone does it , right ?
Wrong !
Not everyone does it , in fact most people DO NOT send thank you notes .
Let 's look at the reasons for sending a thank you note , what to write , and who should receive your note .
Why should you send one ?
Because it is :
1 . The considerate thing to do .
2 . It helps reiterate your interest in the company and the position .
3 . Promotes name recognition for you and shows the company that you are considerate ( # 1 ) and interested ( # 2 ) .
What should the thank you note say ?
According to Spherion , the North American staffing company , they suggest that you follow these simple guidelines to write thank you letters that will make you hard to forget .
* Make a statement of appreciation
Be sure to thank your interviewer for his / her time .
* Recall the interview
Make reference to at least one topic of discussion during your visit to demonstrate your interest in the conversation and the company .
* Connect yourself to the job
Remind the interviewer of how your qualifications meet the needs of the company and emphasize your interest in the job .
* Indicate next contact
Let the interviewer know that you look forward to speaking with her / him soon about the job opportunity .
* Proofread your note
Be sure your letter is flawless .
Do not tarnish a great interview with poor spelling or grammar in the follow - up thank you letter .
All excellent points , I might add !
When you craft your note , do it in writing .
Yes , email is pervasive but it can get lost , deleted , or dumped into a junk mail folder .
With the rise of spam , many people -- especially Human Resources professionals who have heavy people contact -- get bombarded by messages .
Do you think they have the time to read everything in their inbox ?
I doubt it .
Therefore , simply PRINT a brief note on thank you note paper or on writing paper [ remember when that was vogue ? ] and send it via regular mail .
Your contact , or the person 's assistant will see the note .
Send a note to the primary interviewer , but if you are interviewed by other people send them a note as well .
Please , before leaving the company pick up everyone 's business card who interviewed you and make sure that you have their name and title correct in addition to all the other address information .
How embarrassing to send a note and goof up a name or a title .
You 'll be quickly forgotten in the process .
MD6 Withdrawn from SHA - 3 Competition
In other SHA - 3 news , Ron Rivest seems to have withdrawn MD6 from the SHA - 3 competition .
From an e-mail to a NIST mailing list :
We suggest that MD6 is not yet ready for the next SHA - 3 round , and we also provide some suggestions for NIST as the contest moves forward .
Basically , the issue is that in order for MD6 to be fast enough to be competitive , the designers have to reduce the number of rounds down to 30 - 40 , and at those rounds , the algorithm loses its proofs of resistance to differential attacks .
Thus , while MD6 appears to be a robust and secure cryptographic hash algorithm , and has much merit for multi-core processors , our inability to provide a proof of security for a reduced - round ( and possibly tweaked ) version of MD6 against differential attacks suggests that MD6 is not ready for consideration for the next SHA - 3 round .
EDITED TO ADD ( 7/1 ) :
This is a very classy withdrawal , as we expect from Ron Rivest — especially given the fact that there are no attacks on it , while other algorithms have been seriously broken and their submitters keep trying to pretend that no one has noticed .
EDITED TO ADD ( 7/6 ) : From the MD6 website :
We are not withdrawing our submission ; NIST is free to select MD6 for further consideration in the next round if it wishes .
But at this point MD6 does n’t meet our own standards for what we believe should be required of a SHA - 3 candidate , and we suggest that NIST might do better looking elsewhere .
In particular , we feel that a minimum “ ticket of admission ” for SHA - 3 consideration should be a proof of resistance to basic differential attacks , and we do n’t know how to make such a proof for a reduced - round MD6 .

A recent study by the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) found that over 20 % of the private wells sampled contained at least one contaminant at levels of concern for potential health issues .
Most of the contaminants came from natural geological sources in the aquifers , such as radon and arsenic , but some were from human sources , including nitrate from fertilizer application .
“ The results of this study are important because they show that a large number of people may be unknowingly affected .
Greater attention to the quality of drinking water from private wells and continued public education are important steps toward the goal of protecting public health . ” – Matt Larsen , USGS Associate Director for Water
The USGS took samples from 2100 private wells in 48 states , and found elevated concentrations of nitrate in areas with intensively farmed land , such as the Central Valley of California and in parts of the Midwest Corn Belt .
Nitrates were found at concentrations greater than the Federal drinking - water standard for public - water supplies ( 10 ppm ) in about 4 percent of sampled wells .
The study also measured radon at relatively high concentrations in crystalline - rock aquifers in central Colorado , the Northeast , and in the central and southern Appalachians .
The study sampled water from these private wells from 1991 to 2004 in 30 of the U.S. ’s principal aquifers used for water supply .
They measured 219 properties and contaminants , including nutrients , pH , major ions , trace elements , pesticides , microbial contaminants , volatile organic compounds ( VOC ) , and radionuclides .
The samples were taken before any home treatment was applied to the water .
Man-made organic contaminants , including insecticides , herbicides , disinfection by - products , solvents , and petro-chemicals , were also found , although only a few organic contaminants ( 7 out of 168 ) exceeded health benchmarks , and less than 1 percent of sampled wells had organic contaminants above health benchmarks .
The study also found that the contaminants usually occurred as mixtures with other contaminants rather than alone , which can be a concern because contaminant mixtures can have a greater total combined toxicity than that of a single contaminant .
Relatively low concentrations of mixtures of contaminants were found in the majority of wells , and mixtures with multiple contaminants above health benchmarks were only about 4 percent of the total .
Because relatively little is known about potential health effects of most mixtures of contaminants , and the synergistic effects on human health of mixtures of man-made chemicals at low levels are not well understood , the report stressed the need for continued research on this issue .
Private wells are not regulated by the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act , and about 15 % of the U.S. population ( 43 million people ) source their drinking water from these private domestic wells .

In New York , the city that never sleeps , George Dawes Green stands in Thompkins Square Park .
The author of The Juror and now Ravens has a sleep cycle that migrates until night is day and vice versa .
TROUBLE SLEEPING ?
TROUBLE SLEEPING ?
More than 20 million Americans complain of insomnia , the American Academy of Sleep Medicine says .
Although people with chronic insomnia may need the help of a sleep specialist , experts say people who suffer from occasional insomnia can take steps to improve their sleep .
Most people need seven or eight hours of sleep .
Tips for achieving that : DO • Exercise in the morning several times a week .
•
Keep the bedroom dark , quiet , cool ( 75 degrees or cooler ) . •
Get up at the same time every day .
•
Try to get bright light exposure in the morning , soon after waking .
•
Avoid bright lights at night .
•
Jot down worries before bedtime in a different room and then say goodnight to them .
•
Have a routine that prepares you for bed so your body will recognize it and want to sleep .
•
Use your bed only for sleeping and sex .
Condition yourself to associate your bed with sleep .
•
Give yourself 30 - 60 minutes to wind down and relax before hitting the sheets .
•
Try a hot bath .
Warming up and then cooling down can make you drowsy .
•
Use medications carefully , especially ones that contain stimulants or ingredients that make you drowsy .
DO NOT •
Go to bed unless you 're sleepy .
•
Have a big meal before bed .
•
Take naps unless you have to and never after 3 p.m. • Drink alcohol within six hours of bedtime .
•
Take a sleeping pill for more than three weeks without consulting your physician .
•
Smoke a cigarette or ingest other forms of nicotine before bed .
• Drink caffeine after lunch .
• Workout strenuously within six hours of bedtime . •
Use the bed to watch TV , talk on the phone or play videogames .
•
Hit the snooze button .
Oversleeping will make it harder to fall asleep at night .
Do n't sleep late on weekends , either .

So much for counting sheep when he cannot sleep , or for trying meditative readings .
Those salves might work for others who toss and turn at night , but not for George Dawes Green .
The author has a rare sleep disorder that affects less than 2 % of the population , experts say .
His sleep schedule evolves , turning day into night and night into day .
Oddly enough , Dawes takes solace in writing psychological thrillers , page - turners enriched by flawed and vulnerable souls who , like himself , he says , are captive to spells they both loathe and enjoy .
In his third novel , Ravens ( Grand Central Publishing , $ 24.99 ) , out today , winning a $ 318 million lottery turns out to be a family 's nightmare .
" That 's the way life is , " Dawes says .
" We are all captives .
No one is happy about the IRS and all the laws we have to follow , but there are authorities that tell us what to do , and we find it a good idea to listen . "
What he found a good idea to obey is his disorder , called non -24 - hour sleep - wake syndrome , or hypernychthemeral .
He tried to fight it as a child and young adult , but not now .
He goes with it .
" It 's never easy , " Dawes says .
" There is always that sense ( that ) if only I had a regular schedule , I could get so much more done .
But I could n't be as creative .
When I let myself go free — going to sleep when I want — then creativity surges through me . "
He says he sleeps a solid eight hours and is awake for about 17 hours — just not the same hours as everyone else .
His waking changes about 20 minutes a day he adds .
In other words , someone could sleep from 1 a.m. to 9 a.m. during Week 1 , then by Week 4 sleep from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m .
Sleep cycle askew Experts say people who have the disorder can rarely work a normal workday or have satisfying relationships — and are often mistaken for having insomnia .
Dawes is single , although , he says , " I 'm a very social person . "
He tried shift work and worked as a guard at night before he started his own business .
" Most people are in sync with the external environment , " says Phil Gehrman , an assistant professor of psychiatry and sleep specialist at the University of Pennsylvania .
" Pretty much every process in our body follows a 24 - hour circadian rhythm .
" The main driving force is a nucleus in the brain .
It sends out a signal to train the body and brain to follow these rhythms .
In most people , those rhythms are set to a 24 - hour cycle . "
Gehrman says the duration of the cycle can be " way different from 24 hours .
You can have a period that was less than 24 hours , and you 're finishing the day faster .
If they have a longer rhythm , then it takes them longer biologically to complete a day . "
At times , Dawes ' night will match up with the real night , but then his rhythm will drift and he 'll be off the pace of the rest of the world .
" It can be hard to adjust , " Gehrman says .
By using bright lights in the morning , Gehrman says , you can attempt to bring the day forward .
Using melatonin at night can bring the night forward .
Dawes says a New York sleep specialist suggested he try both , but " I got insomnia and could n't sleep for days . "
When he learned to follow his own sleep schedule , he said life became " rich and joyful .
" I always thought I was an incredibly stressed person , but found out I was not stressed if I could live with this condition . "
As a child , he could n't stay awake in class .
He says he did n't pass after the fourth grade and dropped out of public schools when he was a teen : " It got worse and worse .
I really could n't focus in school at all . "
He was a voracious reader ( " loved Edgar Allan Poe and Dostoevski " ) and earned a high school diploma by passing the New York Regents exams .
He decided early on he was a novelist , " but they were very dark novels .
Now , splashes of humor create a quirky tension between good and evil in his writing .
Burris is the lead detective in Ravens .

" He was fun to work on , " Dawes says .
The Moth storytellers After his second book , The Juror , became a best seller ( and was turned into a motion picture starring Demi Moore and Alec Baldwin ) , he set out in 1997 to re-create a storytelling group called The Moth ( themoth.org ) in his New York apartment .
It now has several locations around the country , and the website gets a half - million downloads a month on iTunes .
Participants have included Garrison Keillor of Prairie Home Companion , Todd Hansen , head writer of The Onion , Candace Bushnell of Sex and the City , Malcolm Gladwell of The Tipping Point and Blink .
" When I was in my 20s , we 'd stay up all night on a friend 's porch drinking bourbon and telling stories .
The moths would come onto the screen and start spinning around the porch light .
That 's how I got the name . "
The Moth meets at 7:30 tonight at The Players .
Dawes will be the guest of honor at Dial M for Moth : Thriller Stories and will tell a tale .
Any guesses on whether the audience will be able to drift off to a peaceful sleep afterward ?
" I do have to worry people , " he says with a laugh .
" It 's part of the fun . " READERS :

He has famously vowed to keep going until his 80th birthday .
But Michael Eavis , 73 , the eccentric dairy farmer and host of the world 's best - known music festival , has announced plans to hang up his boots to make way for a " new generation " headed by his daughter , Emily , and her fiance .
Sitting at Worthy Farm 's kitchen table , the Glastonbury festival 's headquarters for the past four decades , Eavis said the handover to his daughter had already begun , and he expected " two more full years " at the helm .
He said his last festival is likely to be in 2011 , five years earlier than expected .
This week will see 140,000 festivalgoers troop to Eavis 's Somerset farm for what has become an annual pilgrimage .
Tickets sold out months ago .
Eavis 's retirement , when it comes , will mark the end of a remarkable career which has transformed a £ 1 - a - ticket hippy gathering , with " free milk to all campers " , into a British summer institution showcasing the best live music acts in the world .
His contribution to music was recognised last month in Time Magazine 's list of the world 's 100 most influential people , an accolade Eavis collected at a New York gala alongside Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama .
He said the experience made him " nervous " .
" I like being a slightly chaotic dairy farmer who is a bit of a chancer and follows his heart .
And then suddenly I 'm on a par with Kate Winslet , Gordon Brown and Stella McCartney .
I thought , ' Oh my god , have I got to behave myself now ?
Have I got to be more respectable ? ' "
Glastonbury began in 1970 with a pink piece of paper handed out to locals advertising the arrival of the Kinks .
" They had a number one with Lola at the time , so they could n't really be playing a ' mini ' festival , " Eavis recalled .
" The agent said ' they 've all got laryngitis – medical certificates are in the post ' . "
Their replacement turned out to be Marc Bolan and his band , T - Rex , establishing the event 's musical reputation .
The following year David Bowie and Hawkwind took to the very first pyramid - shaped stage .
In the 1980s , Eavis established the event as a bastion of the left : CND , Oxfam and Greenpeace all had a role , and he set aside a field for new age travellers .
But many regard the following decade as the event 's heyday , when gatecrashers swelled capacity to as many as 250,00 to witness career - transforming performances from the likes of Pulp , Robbie Williams , Oasis and Radiohead .
Eavis missed the anarchy that ended with the erection of an impenetrable fence in 2002 .
" Young people who come here now are all well - behaved , " he said .
" They 're A level students – motivated and ambitious . "
Despite years that saw flash floods , mass evacuations and riots with police , Eavis said last year 's event , which almost failed to sell out , was his most difficult .
A month before the gates opened , he faced a £ 5 m shortfall .
" We could have gone bankrupt , " he said .
" I got a cold sweat in the night , which I 've never had before .
I thought : I 'm killing myself over this . "
The failure to shift tickets was initially put down to Glastonbury 's experiment with Jay - Z , a decision construed as a betrayal of the festival 's rock traditions .
Eavis said he only agreed to his daughter 's pleas to bring Jay - Z to the farm because his preferred act – Radiohead – fell through .
" It was either that or cancel the show , " he said .
" I knew she had sensible ideas so I had to go with that .
It was the last throw of the dice for me .
We either throw the dice or abandon the festival . "
It fell to Eavis to call that rapper 's agent .
" I had to ask how you pronounce it .
' Is it Jaze ?
Is it Jacy ? ' "
Eavis said he stood firm when Jay - Z's agent offered him Kanye West instead .
In then end Jay - Z triumphed , delivering a landmark performance credited with turning around the festival 's fortunes .
The success of the US rapper was also a coup for Emily , 29 , who has gone from running the Park area of the festival to taking control of much of this year 's line - up .
Eavis and his wife , Liz , have meanwhile moved into a new house .
Her inheritance of the festival came a step closer when she moved into the farmhouse with her fiance , Nick Dewey , 36 , earlier this year .
Her father moved into another house with his wife , Liz .
" I 'm living on top of the hill now , away from the farm , " Eavis said .
" So [ Emily 's ] taking over the house , which is nice .
A new generation of Eavises can live here . "
He added : " I still feel I have an important role to play .
Even if I go I 'll worry about the drains , the rubbish , the recycling .
There will be a gradual process of her and Nick taking it over . "
Eavis agreed that this year 's " top three " headline acts – Bruce Springsteen , Neil Young and Blur – were " thoroughly , thoroughly predictable " , but said they would please the event 's traditionalist base .
The mood on the seven farms that Eavis merges for the annual music pilgrimage has been remarkably calm in recent days , although Eavis he still felt slightly bemused at the thousands of workers who gather to prepare the fields .
" I was out there at 7 am this morning and there were all these people putting up marquees , generator tents , track fencing , " he said , sipping tea .
" For a second I thought : what are all these people doing ? "
Here comes the sun
Thursday and Friday should be sunny and warm , though there is a small risk of a heavy shower on Friday afternoon or evening .
Festivalgoers should pack waterproofs and wellies as well as shorts and suncream , however , as heavy rain is threatening to return on Saturday and Sunday .
Met Office forecaster Dean Snowden said : " At the weekend , there is a little bit more risk of catching showers and thunderstorms .
It is a bit hit and miss but it must be stated there 's a risk there .
The weather will become increasingly unsettled , though it is going to be warm .
You could get heavy showers . "

“ In meditation , effort must be applied in a direction opposite to what we are used to .
Our ‘ effort ’ must be to relax ever more deeply .
We must ultimately release the tension from both our muscles and our thoughts .
When we relax so deeply that we are able to internalize the energy of the senses , the mind becomes focused and a tremendous flow of energy is awakened .
Meditation is a continuous process , and can be said to have three stages : relaxation , interiorization , and expansion . ” – John Novak , Lessons in Meditation .
Even if you do n’t practice meditation – or , like me , you try to but have no real understanding of the different kinds of meditation – chances are you probably have at least a working knowledge of meditation .
Meditation is a great way to relieve anxiety , manage stress , and focus your mind .
And , according to researchers at UCLA , meditation is also a way to build a bigger brain .
Using high - resolution magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to scan the brains of people who meditate and people who do n’t , researchers found that certain brain areas – specifically “ the hippocampus and areas within the orbito - frontal cortex , the thalamus and the inferior temporal gyrus ” – were significantly larger in people who meditate .
And , those bigger brain parts might actually play a role in long - term meditators ’ abilities to grab on to and maintain control of their mindfulness and emotions .
“ We know that people who consistently meditate have a singular ability to cultivate positive emotions , retain emotional stability and engage in mindful behavior , ” said Eileen Luders , lead author and a postdoctoral research fellow at the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging .
“ The observed differences in brain anatomy might give us a clue why meditators have these exceptional abilities . ”
Because these areas of the brain are closely linked to emotion , Luders said , “ these might be the neuronal underpinnings that give meditators ’ the outstanding ability to regulate their emotions and allow for well - adjusted responses to whatever life throws their way . ”
Kind of makes you think twice about scoffing at all those New Age , hippie - types , does n’t it ? 🙂
Fortunately , you do n’t have to drive around attending classes or spending money ( and creating waste ) on meditation - related products if you want to learn more about and start practicing meditation .
The appropriately titled How to Mediate website provides text and video instructions , and the Meditation Center provides a wealth of information about the basics and benefits of meditation .

While working at a horse riding camp several years ago , I spent a good twenty minutes explaining to a group , which consisted of twelve children and their young teacher , the importance of horse safety before walking behind a horse and being kicked in the head .
I recall only walking in a zigag back to the house with the muffled sounds of children screaming in the background before collapsing and waking up in hospital .
While I was there , with a fractured skull , the teacher bought me in a get well soon card signed by all the children so I asked her out but she said no .

During a work seminar of around forty people , we were handed out forms and asked to fill out a questionnaire on the horrific concept of smoke free working environments .
As I did not bring a pen to the seminar , I raised my hand and asked " Will we be provided with ... " and had a mental glitch where my brain forgot what a pen was called so , after several uncomfortable seconds of silence , added " ... writing implements ? " which caused the girl sitting next to me to giggle for several minutes .
During the lunch break and despite the fact I would have to sit next to her for another two hours , I asked her out but she said no .

Around the corner from my place is a 24 hour petrol station thing that I buy what little products I require that do n't come in a can ( milk ) and feed my car ( my car is very thirsty and is like having another child in that it is demanding , expensive and problematic .
It would be a pretty big child , and made of metal but that is not the point ) .
The point is that a girl started working there and I thought she was really nice but she would serve me and not speak or make eye contact so I asked her if she had a ' carfor ' ' and she asked me " what 's a carfor " to which I replied " driving around in when I am not paying ninety two dollars to feed it " and she laughed in a very strange manner and went back to what looked like counting in binary in her head .
After some small talk ( which on hindsight she may have taken as admonishing her on the poor choice of video's they sold ) , I asked her out but she said no .

Many years ago , while driving to Uni one morning , a girl driving a Ford Laser pulled up at the traffic lights next to me and I noticed she was wiping tears and looking quite angry .
After the lights turned green , she changed into my lane ahead of me and as there is nothing more attractive than angry and upset females , I came up with an ingenious plan : the next time she stopped at lights , I would ' accidently ' tap the back of her car then get out , talk , exchange numbers and then get married and have a pet dog .
As she was pulling to a stop , I edged forward but unfortunately she braked more suddenly than I had expected and I slammed into the back of her car hard enough to see her head flap around like a rag doll .
After pulling over , exchanging details and offering to drive her to the hospital for the cut on her forehead , I asked her out but she said no .

While I was walking down the centre of a popular shopping mall in the centre of the city , I noticed that a lot of people were looking at my shoes , then my face , then back to my shoes .
I figured that they were impressed with the pair of black Globe sneakers with white stitching I had bought the day before .
After spending an hour or so shopping , while waiting for the elevator to the car park , one girl in particular kept staring before shyly walking up to me and quietly pointing out that the underpants I had worn the day before and inadvertently left in my jeans had worked their way down one leg and were hanging out the bottom like a flag .
I was quite embarrassed and stated that they were not mine before realising that having another mans underpants hanging out the bottom of my jeans was probably worse so quickly admitted that " no , sorry that was a lie , they are my underpants " and she looked at me strangely before I asked her out but she said no .

While I was in a electronics store called Jaycar buying something with blinking lights , a girl approached and asked me a question concerning which network cable would be suitable for her needs .
Wanting to appear helpful , I found a large selection of cables and listed the benefits of each .
After she explained that the cable needed to be long enough to reach from her neighbours house to hers as her neighbour had offered to share their broadband , I laughed and told her that was the ' stupidest thing I have ever heard and did not know if the store had cables that long ' so she asked " Well , can I speak to someone else then ? " .
I looked blank before realising that I was wearing a blue shirt the same colour as the staff that worked there and the whole time I had been helping her she had assumed that I was an employee .
After explaining to her that I did not work there and denying that I had been pretending to do so , I asked her out but she said no .

Around the time I was twelve , my sister had really hot friends staying over .
I would dress in ninja gear and wriggle ' saving private ryan beach commando style ' into her bedroom and listen to their conversations .
Some were educational , most were inane .
A few months ago , I was standing in a cd store and a girl came up to me and said " Are you David ? " to which I replied " It depends " ( and immediately regretted as I knew that if she asked me ' depends on what ' , I had nothing ) .
The fear must have shown because she asked " Depends on what ? " and I replied like a retard " On whether it is on or off the record , I have been misquoted by you people before . " and she looked at me as if I was a retard before telling me that she had been a friend of my sisters and remembered me and then actually asked " Are you still annoying ? " so I asked her if she still " squeezed her nipples while thinking about kissing Michael Wilson " .
After a pretty long pause I asked her out but she said no .
Once again the newspaper headlines report a massive displacement crisis .
Images fill our television screens of people fleeing with their earthly belongings tied in bundles upon their back and of separated families , desperate to know the whereabouts of their relatives .
This time the displaced are fleeing counter - insurgency campaigns in Pakistan .
While I am not an expert on Pakistan , there are some lessons which have been painfully learned in other situations of large - scale displacement which may be applicable to planning an appropriate response .
1. People fleeing violence and who remain within the borders of their own countries are not refugees .
They are not ' internal refugees . '
They are internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) .
Even well - regarded media make the mistake of calling those displaced from their homes in North West Frontier Province and FATA refugees .
One of my colleagues jokes that it makes for easier headline - writing : ' refugees flee Swat ' is easier to fit into a headline banner than ' internally displaced persons flee Swat . '
But internally displaced persons are not refugees .
They are citizens of their countries .
They have rights and responsibilities that do n't vanish when they are displaced .
Just as African - American leaders protested the term ' Katrina refugees ' because those displaced by the hurricane were US citizens , so too those Pakistanis displaced within their country from the recent counter - insurgency operations are IDPs not refugees .
While there is no binding international law -- equivalent to the 1951 Convention on Refugees - which applies to IDPs , there are the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement which are derived from binding international law and provide clear guidance on protecting the human rights of those displaced by conflict and other factors .
2. Estimating the number of displaced - particularly IDPs - is always difficult and is often a politicized process .
When IDPs - or refugees , for that matter - live in camps , counting them is easier than when they are living with host families or dispersed in communities .
Sometimes governments have an interest in inflating the number of refugees as a way of generating international attention and assistance .
Sometimes governmental registration systems , set up in haste , are inaccurate .
For example , humanitarian workers have said that some of the Pakistani IDPs have been double - and triple - counted and that the estimates are 40 % higher than they should be .
[ 1 ]
Whether the numbers are 2 or 3 million ( on top of the 500,000 or so previously displaced ) , it is important not to fixate too closely on the numbers .
Rather it 's important to look at the needs of the population .
Given the on-going and planned counter - insurgency campaigns of the Pakistani government , the number of Pakistani IDPs is expected to increase in the coming months , perhaps to 4 million .
3 . The reports are that 80 - 90 % of the displaced are living with host families and friends or in communal buildings such as schools , rather than camps .
Pakistani infrastructure is strained - increased demands for health care , for sanitation , for water are taxing the capacity of local infrastructure in communities that have witnessed a rapid rise in population in a very short timeframe .
Many host families are stretching their already limited resources .
The UN refugee agency , UNHCR , reports that more and more people are moving from host communities to the camps , and is expanding camps to alleviate overcrowding .
[ 2 ]
Four camps are still receiving IDPs with 300 to 500 families arriving daily on average , and others are full .
[ 3 ]
People in camps are easier to assist than those living among urban populations and lodged with family and friends .
And a different kind of assistance is needed .
For example , ensuring health care for urban - area displaced means increasing the capacity of existing local health clinics rather than building clinics in IDP camps .
The overwhelming majority of IDPs surveyed ( 80 % ) in host communities in Mardan and Swabi districts of NWFP are facing diarrheal and other health problems after displacement .
[ 4 ]
In addition , the approaching monsoon season ( July ) stands to bring a surge in diseases at the same time that the UN is warning humanitarian aid , including medical supplies and drug stocks , [ 5 ] could run out without additional funding .
While it is natural for the UN and the international community to focus on the camps for which they have some responsibility , there are dangers in not supporting the local service providers and infrastructure .
President Asif Ali Zardari has called for the focus of IDP assistance to be extended to those outside of camps as well as to reconstruction .
The risk of host communities ' resentment against the IDPs is increased when they perceive that their own ability to access services is diminished by their presence .
While there is a great deal of research on refugee and ( to a lesser extent ) IDP camps , the subject of " host families " is the least - researched aspect of the displacement experience .
And frankly , it is more difficult to raise funds to support staffing - up a local Pakistani clinic than to raise money to build a new clinic for IDPs .
4 . This is an emergency situation where an immediate response is needed .
The Pakistani government 's capacity to respond to emergency situations is limited .
The Pakistani military seems to be taking the lead on the government side , but its involvement raises questions about the impact of this role on its military mission as well as on popular perceptions of the military 's engagement .
[ 6 ]
The UN and international NGOs have mobilized quickly , but the response is still slow in the face of the need .
There are both human and political consequences to a slow response .
We know that whenever there is a vacuum in the provision of assistance , a variety of groups rush to fill the gap .
In Lebanon , Hezbollah provided on - the - ground , rapid assistance to hundreds of families displaced by Israeli shelling in 2006 .
In Iraq , militia groups quickly developed humanitarian wings to assist people affected by the violence when the UN and international NGOs pulled out .
It is no surprise that there are reports of militant Pakistani groups moving in to the vacuum . [ 7 ]
At the same time , there are experienced Pakistani NGOs and a vibrant civil society that are willing and able to provide the necessary assistance .
Identifying and working with these groups could yield major dividends - not only in denying opportunities to radical groups - but also in supporting local NGOs that will continue to serve their communities .
The UN's $ 543 million appeal for immediate aid to Pakistan is critically underfunded , at only 26 % with $ 140 million in funds received - while only a further $ 43 million has been pledged .
[ 8 ]
The US government responded quickly to the IDP crisis with a pledge of $ 110 million - soon followed by an additional pledge of $ 200 million which has to be approved by Congress .
This is a very positive development and I am encouraged by President Obama 's insistence that more aid will be forthcoming in the longer term .
This is urgently needed .
But as important as the overall quantity of aid is the question of how it is delivered .
If the international community , led by the US , delivers aid quickly and appropriately , it could pay dividends in terms of both public perceptions ( now rabidly anti-American ) and in increased stability .
5 . In addition to the needs of the displaced , there are also needs of those who did not flee the fighting and have remained - for example in Swat some 40,000 did not flee , according to estimates by the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) . [ 9 ]
They also face a precarious situation and currently only the Pakistani military and the ICRC have access to them .
6 . In the immediate term , questions about humanitarian access , about civilian versus military aid delivery and about the role of insurgents will be tough to sort out .
We can already predict - based on experience in other situations - that the assistance provided will not be enough and coordination will be inadequate .
But these issues , difficult as they are , will be much easier than questions about the longer - term .
It is a fact of life that it is much easier to mobilize resources for an emergency than for longer - term recovery and reconstruction .
Perhaps the greatest weakness of the UN system is in the area now known as " early recovery " - or the transition from emergency relief to long - term development .
Development actors are generally slow to respond in the aftermath of a conflict .
In Pakistan , there is an opportunity to prove this traditional wisdom wrong .
For example , humanitarian and development actors could move quickly to intensify the work of the Early Recovery cluster and to plan with Pakistani counterparts for support to local capacity .
For example , education is generally not considered a lifesaving activity and is generally postponed until the situation is stabilized .
Indeed , funding shortfalls are impeding the extension of education services to children in host communities - and over 300,000 of them stand to be affected by IDPs sheltering in schools .
More and more schools are occupied by displaced families , and 60 percent of them in the Swat district have been destroyed according to the District Department of Education . [ 10 ]
But education is important for many families and there is an opportunity for the government to demonstrate its relevance to local populations which have been underserved for various reasons .
For example , presently some 96 % of women in SWAT are illiterate .
7 . While displacement can occur suddenly - in the case of Pakistan , reportedly two million people in the span of two weeks - it almost always takes much longer to resolve displacement .
Moreover , the longer people are displaced , the longer it takes for them to return or to find other solutions .
The expectation is that most of the displaced will return quickly to their homes once the insurgents have been defeated .
But there are troubling reports that while the Pakistani military is doing a good job of ' clearing ' the insurgents out , they are less successful at ' holding ' and are not yet involved in ' building . '
We do n't yet know the extent of civilian casualties and physical destruction of the homes or areas from which the IDPs come .
8. Returns need to be sustainable .
There are reports that some of the displaced who returned to their communities have left again because of insecurity .
There are also reports that the military has told IDPs that it is safe to return - when it is n't .
Army commanders have reportedly said that return to Mingora could begin June 17 , once water and electricity are restored .
[ 11 ]
Human Rights Watch and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines are reporting that landmines have been placed in the Swat Valley , including Mingora . [ 12 ]
A fundamental principle of international law is the right of IDPs to make informed and voluntary decisions as to whether or when to return .
It is in everyone 's interest for the IDPs to return quickly and for displacement not to become a protracted situation .
Under the Guiding Principles for Internal Displacement , there are three solutions for displacement : return to the communities of origin , settlement in the area to which they have been displaced and settlement in another part of the country .
The vast majority of those displaced by recent fighting want to go home .
But the longer they are displaced , the less likely it is that they will return .
If displacement lasts two or three years , for example , it is likely that many of the displaced will either settle where they are or move to other Pakistani communities and cities .
This has implications for the IDPs themselves , for the counterinsurgency campaigns ( it 's harder to clear , hold and build when the people are n't there ) , and larger social implications as displacement to urban areas creates new demands on the state .
9 . The displaced are not a homogeneous group .
Women and men have different needs and different resources .
As the majority of those in camps are women and children , this presents clear protection concerns as well as needs - including in terms of the organization of the camps , access to food and even to latrines - with cultural considerations also to be taken into account in the relief response . [ 13 ]
There are troubling reports of sexual and gender - based violence in the camps and reports , of women being confined to their sweltering tents by militant groups . [ 14 ]
Some fathers have left their families in camps while they go off to stay with a relative in a city or to try to earn some money by moving to areas where jobs might be found .
If displacement lasts very long , generational differences will come into play .
Typically parents and older relatives dream only of returning home ; but their children - particularly when exposed to urban life - usually develop different plans for the future .
From Lebanon to Colombia , we have seen that in protracted displacement situations , the children and adolescents do not want to return to their parents ' communities .
10 .
The way in which governments and the international community responds to displacement ( and to disasters generally ) has political consequences .
Think of the political fall - out from Katrina in the US or of Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar on the natural disaster front .
Think of Syria opening its borders to Iraqi refugees and Pakistan 's hospitality to Afghan refugees for more than 20 years .
These actions , often motivated by compassion and traditions of hospitality have long - term political consequences .
Aid itself becomes a resource to be contested ( and sometimes fought over ) or can be a resource for reconciliation . [ 15 ]
There are occasions when insurgent groups take advantage of displacement - occasions which Pakistan knows very well as a result of its decades - long experience with Afghan refugee camps .
It is in the interests of the Pakistani government and the international community for humanitarian assistance to be delivered swiftly , efficiently and impartially .
And it is in everyone 's interest - particularly those who have been displaced - for conditions to be created so that the IDPs can return to their homes in security and dignity as soon as possible .

Your Compiler Vanishes in A Puff of Logic
I can write a program in Java about twice as fast as as I can write the same program C or C++ , and I can bang out the same program in Python maybe twice again as fast as I can in Java .
In Python , you just get straight to the point and say what you mean by saying things like :
weekly = [ sum ( daily [ j : j+7 ] ) for j in range ( 0 , len( daily ) , 7 ) ]
In an ideal world , high - level languages like Python would replace all other programming languages .
In principle , a program written in a high - level language like Python should be able to execute faster than one written in a low - level language like C , because fewer of the implementation details are constrained by the programmer .
The less the programmer says , the more flexibility the compiler has to speed things up .
Of course , in reality high - level languages are much slower than low - level languages , so at Google we write most of our performance - sensitive code in C ++.
Even though we need to invest maybe four times as much effort .
But the PyPy guys have not given up the dream of fast high - level languages .
They are making progress on an epic project to make python - and all interpreted languages - speedier than C .
And they are doing it by sticking to their guns : instead of getting in the dirt and implementing a pile of low - level tricks , they are raising the level of abstraction to ever higher heights , writing their compiler , interpreters , profilers and jitters all in highly abstract python , and then applying the compiler to itself to make the final product .
Along the way , they have only needed to resort to one or two easily - explained dirty tricks .
PyPy 's progress on a tracing JIT for a python meta- interpreter are documented in a paper by Bolz , Cuni , Fijalkowski , and Rigo .
If you are into language technology , it is well worth a read .
Their project is akin to engineers who dare to build a ladder to the moon .
It seems improbable , but once they do it , it will change the world .
Someday we will all program in python .

SILVERSTONE , England -- Formula
One 's future was in turmoil Friday after Ferrari , McLaren and six other teams announced plans for a rival series following the collapse of heated negotiations with the sport 's organizers over a budget cap for next season .
The FIA , the sport 's governing body , responded by accusing the Formula One Teams Association of trying to dictate the rules of motorsport and intentionally triggering the biggest crisis to engulf F1 since the championship began in 1950 .
Friday , FIA said it would take legal action against Ferrari and other teams planning the breakaway
series .
" The actions of FOTA as a whole , and Ferrari in particular , amount to serious violations of law including willful
interference with contractual relations , direct breaches of Ferrari 's legal obligations and a grave violation of competition law , " FIA said in a statement .
" The FIA will be issuing legal proceedings without delay . "
Ferrari has participated since that inaugural series , but is now set to break away along with current championship leader Brawn GP , McLaren , Renault , Toyota , BMW Sauber , Red Bull Racing and Toro Rosso .
Bernie Ecclestone , who owns F1's commercial rights , said he was unsure whether FIA president Max Mosley could still resolve his dispute with the rebel teams .
Yes , that 's a self - serving comment .
But BianRosa 's assertion is supported by a survey by media consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates of about 1,300 Internet users between the ages of 18 and 44 , nearly 700 of whom use Vuze .
The survey , which Vuze released late Tuesday , included the following insights about the members of the company 's audience :
Vuze -- the company that 's trying to sell licensed , high - def videos to users of the BitTorrent file - sharing software -- has spent much of the past two years trying to persuade Hollywood that its users are customers , not thieves .
So far , however , the major studios have entrusted little to Vuze beyond movie trailers and other promotional videos .
Now Vuze is trying to prod Hollywood with some eye - opening data about its clientele 's buying habits and purchasing power : in addition to being copyright infringers , they spend a lot of money on movies and movie - watching gear .
Said Vuze CEO Gilles BianRosa , " Those users are actually Hollywood 's best customers . "
They buy 34 % more movie tickets , purchase 34 % more DVDs and rent 24 % more movies than the average Internet user .
They tend to have more and better equipment for consuming media , including home theaters and expensive computers with large screens .
They spend less time watching TV , more online , and far more watching downloaded or streaming video .
They 're not only early adopters , they 're more likely to share their opinions online , and with more people .
BianRosa said he talks frequently with studio executives , and a common attitude is that BitTorrent users are " never going to pay for anything " and " are basically at the heart of Hollywood 's problem right now . "
Rather than dismissing them , though , the survey shows that Hollywood should be trying to understand when and why they decide to buy content .
The data tells Hollywood that Vuze 's audience is ready for video delivered digitally and willing to spend heavily on programming and the means to consume it .
What it does n't reveal , at least not explicitly , is why those users buy DVDs but not the downloadable movies sold or rented by authorized outlets such as CinemaNow , iTunes or Amazon.com .
Naturally , BianRosa has a few guesses .
First , he said , the price demanded for downloadable movies is about the same as what it costs to buy or rent a physical DVD , yet the downloads do n't deliver as much value .
That 's true in part because the DRM used on the downloadable media creates " massive friction " for consumers , making those files less portable and harder to use than discs .
And the studios ' demand that online distributors pay anticipated royalties in advance cuts down on the availability of legitimate content by making it hard for many smaller outlets to get into the business , he said .
The studios ' pricing strategy is dictated to some degree by their concern about cannibalizing DVD sales , which have been a critical source of revenue .
But BianRosa asked , " How can there be cannibalization if there is n't distribution ? "
It 's not a question of trading analog dollars for digital dimes , as NBC Universal CEO Jeff Zucker famously put it , because the profit margins should be better online than they are in the physical world , BianRosa said .
Rather , the issue is whether Hollywood can afford not to be experimenting online with BitTorrent and other distribution platforms that millions of people are using .
The studios , he said , are " hoping for a model online that will magically emerge on its own , with all the problems resolved ... and then embrace it .
That 's just not the way it 's going to happen . "
Of course , it 's not fair to say the major studios are shunning the Internet just because they have n't been willing to license content to Vuze on BianRosa 's terms .
They 're doing some significant experiments online , particularly with television programs and advertiser - supported platforms such as Hulu ( which NBC Universal and News Corp. founded ) .
They 've gradually offered more movies for rent or purchase on the Net , and reduced the time lag between the DVD release and online availability .
But they 've not gone nearly as far as the music industry to enable fully stocked video - on - demand services online or provide the same quality and flexibility in downloadable media as they do in packaged products .
And neither the record labels nor the studios has made a credible attempt yet to compete head - to - head with bootlegged goods on the distribution platforms where piracy thrives .
Perhaps the Vuze survey will give Hollywood more incentive to court those users , rather than simply wishing they 'd go away .

After a few weeks of “ fits and starts ” , it appears that the CRB index and its underlying commodity components are in position to extend higher again .
An end - of - the - quarter weakening of the dollar index may well be the culprit here .
Despite a rather well received “ mini ” Treasury refunding last week , the greenback slid lower in the wake of rekindled references to the need for a new reserve currency by foreign holders of U.S. debt .
From a technical perspective , a bullish reverse Head & Shoulders pattern that targets a move up to the 292 area on the CRB index has been formed .
A much needed break above key “ neckline ” resistance at 245 and a subsequent “ retest ” of that level has already occurred as well , putting daily technical studies into a new bullish configuration .
The recent rise in commodity prices , of course , has helped to firm up a number of commodity - related stock valuations .
Last week ’s reversal in initial jobless claims , however , suggests that the rise in the CRB index may have less to do with an increase in final demand than with a decline in the dollar .
A week - long slide in interest rates on U.S. Treasuries also tended to diminish demand for the dollar .
Still , commodity prices have experienced a “ disconnect ” with the balance of actual “ supply and demand ” issues in the past … as witnessed by the rally in 2008 which reached its crescendo last July .
The current set - up for commodities is far from having anything resembling a fever pitch to it .
Instead , it resembles a market that has been base building and getting ready for a renewed advance .
It might be the anticipation of future demand that will tilt the balance toward commodity bullishness .

Last report from Reuters , which may have a stringer on the ground in Tegucigalpa .
CNN en español has coverage with some video , but does not seem to have a presence there at the moment and is covering events with help from a local station .
From Reuters :
Honduran soldiers detained leftist President Manuel Zelaya on Sunday in a constitutional crisis over his attempt to win re-election , government officials said .
[ snip ]
The president fired the armed forces chief of staff last week for refusing to help him organize an unofficial referendum on Sunday on allowing presidents to serve more than a single four - year term .
The impoverished Central American country had been politically stable since the end of military rule in the early 1980s , but Zelaya 's push to change the constitution to allow him another term has split the country 's institutions .
The Supreme Court last week came out against Zelaya and ordered him to reinstate fired military chief General Romeo Vasquez -- a move the president said amounted to a " coup " against him .
The pro-government TV channel on Sunday called on Zelaya supporters to gather in the capital to support the president , but then went off the air without explanation .
Phone calls to the presidential palace went unanswered .
It should be noted today 's vote was to be a non-binding referendum on whether to have a vote on whether to hold a constitutional convention to reform the constitution in November .
From what I can see , a number of institutions , including the Church , are strongly opposed .
Updates soon .
The combination of heavily - armed , poorly trained soldiers and pro-Zelaya protestors is extremely dangerous .
Apparently , people have been told to stay in their homes , but are not doing so .
Timeline of events this morning next .
Update 1 :
8:36 a.m. local time .
I am unable to access either the San Pedro Sula or Tegucigalpa newspaper .
That means my only source of information at the moment is CNN en español .
The organization of American States is holding an emergency meeting in Washington .
My understanding is that electricity has been cut in parts of Honduras , and some media interrupted .
The Honduran Congress may meet in emergency session later .
There has not been an official statement from a military authority so far .
CNN en español is interviewing people , who are denouncing the event as a coup .
The European Union and OAS have sharply condemned the coup .
Update 2 :
8:49 a.m. CNN reporting President Zelaya and his family have been safely taken to Costa Rica .
Update 3 :
9:07 a.m .
There are many more people in the street .
Protestors seem to be provoking the army .
Crowds are much larger and more animated .
This wo n't end well .
Here are two screen captures from CNN .
Update 4 :
9:20 a.m. President Zelaya is expected to speak soon from Costa Rica .
What happened this morning , according to the El Heraldo in Tegucigalpa :
09:07 am Protests .
Tanks pass through blockades erected by protestors in some streets in the capital .
08:54 am Militarized .
Army mobilizes in Tegucigalpa streets .
Government buildings under armed guard .
08:24 am Emergency .
Organization of American states calls an emergency meeting on Honduran crisis .
08:16 am Honduran Secretary of State Patricia Rodas detained .
08:05 am
Army confiscates electoral materials to be used in today 's election .
07:45 am Armed forces confirm the president was detained by order of the Honduran courts .
07:26 am Heavy military presence outside Presidential Residence .
07:24 am Communications media recommends the population stay in the homes and remain calm .
07:10 am Government chanel has beem removed from airways , as well as Channel 36 , which is affiliated with the presidency .
07:08 am

06:28 am Area around presidential residence militarized .
06:14 am Calm .
Update 5 :
9:39 a.m. Zelaya speaking by phone to CNN .
Says he was forced from his home at gunpoint in pajams , forced into a military vehicle , placed on a plane and flown to Costa Rica .
Shots were fired in the presidential residence .
He hid on the roof .
Arrived in Costa Rica in pajamas .
Will not recognize another government in Honduras .
Calls on other governments in region for support .
Update 6 :
9:52 a.m. Zelaya still speaking on CNN .
Calls on people to protest peacefully .
Seems to be issuing a veiled call for strikes .
Military says the presence of Venezuelan and Nicaraguan " elements " in the country was the reason for the Zelaya 's arrest , according to El Heraldo ( make of this what you will , it is completely unsourced by the newspaper ) :
The verification of the entrance of Nicaraguans and Venezuelans , for the purpose of backing President Zelaya in holding a referendum this Sunday , was another of the principal reasons that led the courts to order his arrest and the Armed Forces to comply with the order .
Reliable sources told El Heraldo there are confidential reports that the in the last three days people from the two countries entered at different points in the country for the purpose of backing Zelaya 's illegal actions .
The presence of foreign forces , authorized by the president , represented a violation of national sovereignty , the source said .
To prevent foreign subjects from causing a crisis of violence , the Armed Forces are currently monitoring the country , with all their forces , including land , air and naval forces .
As I say , this report is completely unsourced and highly suspect .
I mention it because it is the second justification being given by the military for the coup .
Update 7 :
10:19 a.m. OAS emergency meeting underway in Washington .
Was just interrupted by an announcement [ from the Venezuelan representative ] that diplomats from Cuba , Nicargua and Venezuela have been kidnapped and beaten in Honduras by masked gunmen .
As previously reported , the Honduran Ministery of Foreign Affairs has also been kidnapped .
Update 8 :
10:27 a.m. President Obama calls for respect of democratic norms .
Reuters .
" As the Organization of American States did on Friday , I call on all political and social actors in Honduras to respect democratic norms , the rule of law and the tenets of the Inter - American Democratic Charter , " Obama said in a statement .
" Any existing tensions and disputes must be resolved peacefully through dialogue free from any outside interference , " he said .
An administration official said Obama 's national security adviser , General Jim Jones , had briefed Obama on the situation in Honduras by telephone .
An interagency team was following the situation and would provide updates to Obama throughout the day .
Update 9 :
10:53 a.m .
La Prensa from San Pedro Sula reporting congressional president Roberto Micheletti will be named president of Honduras within the hour , by the congress .
Congress will order a curfew .
Update 10 :
11:02 a.m .
All local TV stations off the air , according to CNN .
CNN en español is also blocked , at least in Tegucigalpa , accordingn to the local reporter it is using .
Electricity is apparently still off .
Congressional president Roberto Micheletti has arrived at the presidential residence by helicopter to be sworn in as provisional president shortly .
I would expect a statement after he is sworn in .
Protestors burning tires in the streets .
The army has confiscated most of the referendum materials , on orders from the Honduran Supreme Court , but symbolic voting occurs at some voting stations .
Awaiting statement from the OAS , which continues to meet in Washington .
President Zelaya 's wife on phone with CNN .
She is in hiding in the " mountains " in Honduras .
Says there are orders to arrest her as well .
She was not taken to Costa Rica with her husband .
Says she has not been in contact with her husband so far .
Calls on Honduras to demonstrate peacefully and to show the world Honduras is a democratic country .
Calls on soldiers to lay down their guns .
Has not been in contact with her children .
Update 11 :
11:23 a.m. Zelaya in press conference with Costa Rican president , Nobel laureate Oscar Arias .
Arias condemns the coup .
Says it is a step backward for democracy in Honduras and Central America .
Says we thought democracy had been consolidated in the region to the extent that this could n't happen .
" We regret there are still people who applaud the idea of a coup just because they disagree with something .
It is unacceptable to interrupt the constitutional order . "
Says he hopes the entire hemisphere condemns the coup .
Update 12 :
11:38 a.m .
The mayor of San Pedro Sula has been detained by the armed forces for supporting the referendum , according to La Prensa .
Zelaya / Arias press conference still going on .
Zelaya says Honduras has " mafias " that try to run the government .
Says today 's situation is due to his removal of the head of Honduran joint chiefs , General Romeo Vazquez , last week .
Good news : there are no reports of deaths or injuries of protestors at this moment , although tear gas canisters have been fired .
Update 13 :
12:33 p.m. URGENT : Honduran Congress : Reading a letter supposedly written by Zelaya RENOUNCING the presidency .
This appears to be a forged letter .
Zelaya was quite clear in his previous statements in Costa Rica in which he adamantly affirmed he is still president of Honduras .
Waiting on response from President Zelaya .
We are now entering the opera bufa phase of the coup .
Violence will ensue shortly .
Update 14 :
12:40 p.m. President Zelaya in telephone conversation with CNN says that he has NOT resigned and has no intention of resigning .
" It is totally false . "
The question is whether the Honduran populace will know it 's false , since news media have been closed in Honduras and access to CNN has been cut .
Update 15 :
1:03 p.m .
At least 8 government ministers detained , including Minister of Foreign Affairs Patricia Rodas and presidential secretary Eduardo Enrique Reina , according to La Prensa .
Intestingly , this newspaper , which has been ardently opposed to the referendum , is reporting on its front page , " Congress Accepts Resignation of Mel Zelaya . "
There is no information on the front page that Zelaya is denying having resigned .
I mention this because it 's important to understand how the press frequently throws all professionalism to the winds in a crisis and will print blatant falsehoods .
With telephone service and electricity cut and local television and radio stations shut down , the military and its allies in the press now control all information in Honduras .
The people are effectively cut off .
The congress is expected to enact a curfew , which will force people from the streets shortly .
Update 16 :
1:34 p.m. El Heraldo from Tegucigalpa has received preliminary reports of two injuries of protestors .
Congress debating decree to make congressional president Roberto Micheletti the president of Honduras .
We knew this several hours ago , since it was orchestrated and announced previously .
The Supreme Court has affirmed that presidential elections scheduled for November will proceed as previously planned .
Update 17 :
2:23 p.m .
It 's official .
The congressional decree passed " unanimously " to accept the president 's " resignation " ( which did n't really happen ) , remove him from office for crimes against the constitution and install Roberto Micheletti as president .
The country is on " Cadena Nacional " which is like our Emergency Broadcast System , meaning all television and radio stations have to broadcast the government 's signal .
European Union statement earlier , as reported by theBBC :
The EU strongly condemns the arrest of the constitutional president of the Republic of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya , by the armed forces .
This is [ an ] unacceptable violation of constitutional order in Honduras .
The EU calls for the urgent release of President Zelaya and a swift return to constitutional normality .
CNN 's reporter is saying everything is calm on the streets of Tegucigalpa .
Flyovers by the Honduran airforce have ceased .
Update 18 :
3:49 p.m. Roberto Micheletti has now been sworn in as Honduras ' new president .
Here 's a picture :
It 's remarkable , when you think about it .
In a period of just over 2 hours , the Honduran congress removed a president from power and ( skipping over the vice - president in line of succession ) installed a new president .
All after forcibly removing the president and shipping him off to another country , while controlling all sources of information , limiting communication and disseminating misinformation about the president 's resignation .
Honduras now has one president who is recognized within the country and another president recognized by the rest of the world .
It will be interesting to see how this situation is resolved .
It 's not at all clear where the anger seen on the streets this morning has gone .
People may be at home watching soccer games , afraid to leave their homes or planning demonstrations for tomorrow .
Or this may be the end of it .
Update 19 :
4:55 p.m. The U.S. says it is working to ensure the safety of Zelaya and his family , according to the AP :
WASHINGTON — U.S. diplomats are working to ensure the safety of deposed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya and his family as they press for restoration of constitutional law and his presidency .
U.S. officials said Sunday evening they 've spoken with Zelaya since he was taken to Costa Rica by the forces that wrested him from power .
They also say the U.S. told Honduran military leaders and other power players there that the United States and other nations in the Americas would not support a coup .
They say Honduran military officials stopped taking their calls as the crisis unfolded .
Two senior administration officials briefed reporters on condition of anonymity , under ground rules set by the State Department .
President Zelaya has reportedly been flown to Nicaragua from Costa Rica on a plane loaned by Venezuela .
Nicaraguan President Ortega called for an emergency meeting of Central American leaders this evening in Managua .
I believe we are still awaiting the official statement from the Organization of American States , which is expected to be harsh .
Update 20 :
5:40 p.m . The " new president " of Honduras , Roberto Micheletti , has announced a curfew to take effect in Honduras at 6:00 [ correction , 7:00 ] p.m.
( As noted in earlier updates , the curfew was always going to be part of the package . )
Schools reportedly will be closed tomorrow .
CNN en español has had some oustanding commentary this afternoon , the best of which has come from a representative of the Carter Center ( as we all might expect ) .
He 's provided excellent analysis of the constitutional crisis .
The international situation is looking bleak for Honduras .
Today 's events will affect trade relations , aid agreements and , possibly , endanger its membership in the OAS .
( None of that came up in the congress ' 2 - hour debate on whether to procede with Zelaya 's destitution , come to think of it . )
Update 21 :
6:10 p.m. Mercosur has condemned the coup and said it will not recognize any Honduran authority besides Manuel Zelaya .
According to Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo :
The presidents in the Mercosur region ( Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay and Uruguay ) agree on a firm posture of condemnation of any event that endangers the constitutional order and the will of the Honduran people as expressed in free elections .
The OAS Permanent Council has apparently issued a multi-point condemnation and called for a meeting of the General Assembly next week , perhaps Tuesday .
I do n't think the full OAS declaration has been posted yet .
Here 's a summary :
Washington - The Organization of American States on Sunday condemned the coup in Honduras and said it would not recognize any government but that of ousted President Manuel Zelaya .
The international body 's Permanent Council called for the " immediate , safe and unconditional return " of Zelaya to his office in a resolution adopted at an emergency meeting at its Washington headquarters .
It called the coup " an unconstitutional alteration of the democratic order " and also condemned the reported detention of Foreign Affairs Minister Patricia Rodas and other government officials .
Update 22 :
6:48 p.m. I think this will be the last update .
Probably not much more will happen today , and I hope someone does a fresh diary tomorrow to continue the coverage .
I 'll conclude by posting a photo of President Zelaya as he appeared at his press conference in Costa Rica with Oscar Arias .
I debated about posting this because I do n't want to play into the Honduran military 's intent to strip Zelaya of all dignity by rousing him from his bed and forcing him out of the country wearing only a T - shirt .
I have been very pleased by the Obama administration 's response to this crisis , with its firm policy of non-interference and endorsement of a multi-lateral approach to work with other countries in the hemisphere to resolve the situation .
That is very different from what we saw in Venezuela under Bush , and worlds away from 1954 , when Jacobo Arbenz was forced to strip at the airport in Guatemala before going into exile , to be photographed by the Guatemalan press in his shorts .
There are strong historical echoes in this photograph , but this time the U.S. is on the side of democracy in the hemisphere .

A high - end Mississauga townhome development burst into flames last night , destroying at least 55 unoccupied homes and leaving a spectacular scene of rubble .
Another fire at the same location in February caused $ 1 million in losses and damaged six units .
This morning , the devastated remnants of the townhomes resembled Roman ruins – some front facades still standing and piles of brick and blackened beams still smouldering .
Emergency crews arrived at Burnhamthorpe Rd. E. and Ponytrail Dr. to find the fire raging out of control just before 11 p.m. , Peel Regional Police said .
Two Mississauga firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting last night 's blaze , Const .
Wayne Patterson said .
Dorothy Gdyczynski , who lives nearby , looked out her bedroom window last night to see a massive orange cloud .
She was one of hundreds of onlookers who gathered at the scene .
" They were just dousing the flames non -stop , " she said .
" It did n't seem like it was working , it was so intense . "
Park View Trail construction manager for Dunpar Homes Julien Diciano said the units were worth between $ 480,000 and $ 640,000 and owners were scheduled to move in in a few months .
In February six units at the same site burned down .
The cause of that blaze , Diciano said , was arson , and he suspects this fire was also deliberately set .
The fire 's cause is still under investigation , although Peel police said they have " no indication this is an arson . "
The Ontario Fire Marshal 's Office will attend the scene this morning .

There has been a startling increase in the number of women who are the perpetrators of domestic violence .
New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics figures show that over the past eight years , the number of women charged with domestic abuse has rocketed by 159 per cent .
In 2007 , 2,336 women fronted court on domestic violence charges , compared to around 800 in 1999 .
Preconceived ideas of gender roles have led a lot of people to believe it would be virtually impossible for a women to physically abuse a man .
But co-director of Men's Rights Agency Sue Price says it is exactly this stereotype that leads to battered men hiding in shame , fearful of being ridiculed , or even prosecuted .
" I 've had SAS soldiers in tears because the wife is a black belt karate expert and yet they know that if they even try to restrain her he might be charged with assault and domestic violence , " she said .
" It 's much harder for a man to actually admit that his wife is beating him up .
They seem to regard it as a shameful issue and a lot of police actually say to men ' What did you do to make your wife hit you ? ' or ' Ca n't you handle your missus ? '
" Those are things that seem shameful if a man can't keep his relationship on an even keel .
They take it to heart very seriously and for a lot of them , the last thought is for them to call the police to have their wives arrested , because after all she 's the mother of their children . "
Ms Price says it is a well - known fact that many abusive women resort to using weapons , or wait to catch their spouse unawares before they attack .
" We have so many reports of people having hot liquids poured over them in bed , glasses broken , men hit over the head from the back , attacked while they 're asleep , cut , burnt , " she said .
Despite the many domestic violence support services available to women victims , Ms Price says there is almost no practical and legal outreach for men .
" There 's been a lot of procrastination about the issue .
Yes there are refuges but if you try and access them you 'll find there 's not one place for a man and his children , " she said .
" Where do they move to when they 've got a violent wife ?
How do they protect their children when they 're in a violent household caused by a violent mother ?
" On the other side of the coin as well , there are no treatment programs for women who are violent .
There are no anger management programs .
There 's plenty for men , but not for women .
That 's of central need if we 're going to treat this issue properly . "
Funding fight
Ms Price believes the reason there are no services for male victims comes down to money and the monopoly women 's services have over it .
" Women 's groups are in total denial that women can be violent and they maintain that stand because they want to garner all the funding that 's available under the domestic violence legislation , " she said .
" They wo n't take it that a man can be a victim of domestic violence , they always portray the mantra that it 's always women who are victims and men who are perpetrators .
That 's clearly not true .
We 've known it for years but there 's been an absolute refusal to acknowledge it . "
She says this has helped contribute to the increase in women abusers and has called on other states to follow NSW and release their domestic abuse figures , which she believes would tell a similar story .
" If you keep telling people they can do this and get away with it they will do so .
It 's a little bit like the situation in Victoria where a women can now murder her husband with impunity , providing she claims she was a victim of domestic violence - and that 's after the fact , of course , " she said .
" Thirty per cent of applications I believe are made by men for protection under the domestic violence legislation and I think we'd have similar figures in Queensland , she said .
" It was up to nearly 20 per cent when I last accessed the figures in 1999 .
Since then we 've been prevented from seeing them . "
The Washington Post and Pro-Publica [ ed note : collaboration ! ] report that the White House counsel 's office has drafted an executive order authorizing -- or , rather , asserting , that the President has the inherent authority to detain certain classes of people indefinitely .
( Update : Ben LaBolt , an Obama spokesperson , flatly denied the report to me .
" There is no executive order .
There just is n't one . " )
For what it 's worth , administration officials say that the story seems to overwrite something that is common knowledge , that President Obama has n't decided on a course of action yet , and that the task force he appointed to figure out these issues is weeks away from presenting its recommendations to the White House .
It is not clear whether the draft executive order applies to detainees held at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan , or in camps in Iraq , or detainees collected in future operations , or even in cases where suspected terrorists are identified in non-contiguous countries .
I note , at 10:40 p.m. , the Washington Post has softened the story a bit , referring to the " drafting " in the present .
And the administration refuses to parse verb tenses with me -- is drafting , might draft -- those are still possible .
" Have drafted " is apparently untrue .
It 's true , of course , that elongated / indefinite detentions are on the table for a bunch of Guantanamo detainees ; that we know because the President said as much in his May 21 speech at the National Archive .
It would be prudent for the White House counsel 's office to draft language asserting the president 's authority .
When Obama decided to locate his Guantanamo detention authority in Congress 's 2002 force resolution for Afghanistan , he very plainly did not give up any implied powers that his branch possesses .
It would be quite a slap in the face to Congress were the President to unilaterally assert detention authority over Guantanamo detainees .
A senior Congressional aide e-mails to add :
" Even with an executive order , they still need the funding to be released before they can incarcerate any detainees in the United States .
None of the appropriations bills for fiscal year 2010 that are working their way through committee fund the closure as requested by the President .
And I expect that the DoD approps bill will present a debate over continuing to bar detainees from being incarcerated in the U.S. "
Don Stewart , chief spokesman for minority leader Mitch McConnell , points me to something the Kentuckian said on the floor of the Senate :
" An overwhelming bipartisan majority of the Congress disagreed with the administration 's request for $ 80 million from Congress for the purpose of closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay before the administration even has a place to put the detainees who are housed there , any plan for military commissions , or any articulated plan for indefinite detention . "

"
I think the administration still wants to work with Congress on a new policy .
I also know that time is of the essence .
Gitmo is going to shut down before a bunch of the trials have been completed -- or even begun .
Were are the detainees awaiting trial going to go ?
And under what authority will be they transferred ?
( My guesses : Guam , and Obama's . )

In 16 years as a professional boxer and mixed martial arts fighter , Marcus Davis has received stitches above his eyes 77 times .
The cuts have affected him : doctors have stopped fights , and his battered face , he says , has influenced judges ’ decisions .
So last summer , Davis , 35 , contacted a plastic surgeon in Las Vegas .
He wanted to make his skin less prone to cutting .
The surgeon , Dr. Frank Stile , burred down the bones around Davis ’s eye sockets .
He also removed scar tissue around his eyes and replaced it with collagen made from the skin of cadavers .
Now , at least in theory , when Davis takes a blow to the face , he will be less likely to bleed .
Medical researchers have not analyzed the procedure , and until they do , the American Society of Plastic Surgeons will not comment on its efficacy .
But Davis and several others swear by it .

Disney is n’t always the Happiest Place on Earth .
The parks sometimes harbor deep , dark secrets – and we ’re not talking the Haunted Mansion or the Tower of Terror .
Below are a few sinister secrets
Mickey does n’t want you to know about .
We 've all heard the rumors that no one has ever died at a Disney park because Disney has paid officials to refrain from declaring injured or ill people dead until they hit a hospital outside of Disney property .
But it 's not true .
There are several incidents where the victims were reported to have died at the scene .
Her friends noticed she was unconscious when the ride stopped , according to the BBC , and park medics immediately rushed to the scene .
There was nothing they could do , though , and she was pronounced dead by the time an ambulance could get there .
Photo from DLPInfo .
Both had stayed in the area when they were n't supposed to - the incident in ' 73 occurred when a boy and his brother decided to stay in the park after closing and the ' 83 incident happened when a boy capsized a rubber emergency raft he had stolen from a cast - only section of the park .
To this day , it 's not known how Dollie fell out of her car , but she did .
She fell to the track and was hit by another car , then caught under its wheels and dragged for a bit before the ride came to a stop .
She was pronounced dead at the scene due to massive head and chest injuries .
An employee named Debbi Stone was working as the hostess to the show one evening when her fellow cast members were alerted to the fact that she was missing .
Some reports say they noticed at some point during the evening ; other reports say a guest heard Debbi 's screams and immediately told cast members .
Either way , by the time she was found , Debbi had been crushed to death between a rotating theater wall and a permanent theater wall ; she definitely did n't make it to a hospital first .
Photo from Yesterland Even when people are n't dying at Disney , they want their mortal remains to be forever interred at the Happiest Place on Earth .
Disney does n't like to talk about it , obviously , but sometimes cast members spill the beans to inquiring reporters .
David Koenig , author of Mouse Tales : A Behind - the - Ears Look at Disneyland , says that A cast member told him that she had been working the ride when a group requested extra time on the ride to say a quick goodbye to a little boy who had died and loved the Haunted Mansion .
She agreed , but then spotted one of the guests emptying grey ash out onto the ride .
The ride was shut down so it could be cleaned up .
and the Los Angeles Times reports that the ride was shut down the same year when a group of people managed to leave a pile of ashes in the Captain 's Quarters section of the ride .
I ’ve done it , and I bet a lot of you have done it as well : pausing and rewinding and going frame - by - frame to catch hidden messages or images in certain Disney films .
Some of them are really there and some of them are just products of our active imaginations .
Here ’s the lowdown :
It ’s a scene where “ Prince Ali ” is trying to get up to Princess Jasmine ’s room to talk to her when he comes across her tiger , Rajah .
The tiger growls at him menacingly , and Aladdin says , “ C’mon … good kitty .
Take off and go ! ” while shooing the feline away with his turban .
The captioning supports this argument .
However , the line is whispered and not enunciated well , and in addition , it seems to be edited poorly .
Snopes http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/aladdin.asp says that the same bit of dialogue seems to have been inserted twice , so the whispered line is doubly garbled .
Because it was so close on the heels of The Little Mermaid controversy , people heard what they wanted to .
There were two issues that concerned the public : first , that artwork for the movie contained a phallic images as part of a castle in the background , and second , that the priest officiating over the wedding scene near the end of the movie seems to get an erection right in the middle of the ceremony .
Neither is true , according to Snopes .
The phallic image was unintentional and was not drawn in by a disgruntled employee who had recently gotten laid off ( the artist did n’t even work for Disney ) and the “ erection ” is actually the priest ’s knees .
And Disney fully admits it .
In fact , the image – which is a photograph , not an animated bit , and was clearly intentionally placed in the movie – was basically pointed out to the public by Disney themselves .
The image occurs so fast in two single , non-consecutive frames , that a viewer would have to know exactly where to pause the movie in order to even see it .
The movie was recalled in 1999 after Disney discovered the image was there ; they claimed it must have been inserted in post - production .
Photo from Snopes
There ’s a scene in the movie where Jessica and Eddie Valiant are thrown from a car , causing her dress to flip up very briefly .
It goes fast , but people who have slowed the movie to frame - by - frame say that the way the coloring was done suggests that mischievous animators may have drawn Jessica without any undergarments .
However , the coloring , which is darker than the rest of Jessica ’s skin , may also suggest underwear .
In the book Sabotage in the American Workplace , the artist who painted the piece says that Disney hired him to create a Great Gatsby - esque mural for the ballroom in the upscale hotel .
He decided to paint a Nazi in the background of the mural to “ comment on what was happening in the rest of the world while the Great Gatsbys where whittling away their hours with cocktails . ”

There are definitely more dark Disney tales – in fact , we could probably turn this into a series !

Google Announces First Utility Partners for New PowerMeter
May 20th , 2009 by Timothy B. Hurst
Google ’s plan to roll - out home energy monitoring systems took a step towards reality Tuesday when the company announced the first round of utility partners for its PowerMeter demand - side energy management software .
The pilot program for Google ’s foray into smart grid and energy management infrastructure will be available to select customers at a group of eight utilities that have installed — or are in the process of installing — smart meters .
With the move , Google will be making the company ’s first significant play in energy - use data , an entirely new dimension of consumer data for the company .
[ social_buttons ]
By having real - time information about home energy usage on a desktop ( running as a Google Gadget ) , those using the meter will be able to use their energy more efficiently , save money on their monthly bill , and be able to monitor / reduce household carbon emissions .
In the announcement at the Official Google Blog , Ed Lu , of Google ’s Engineering Team writes that the first partners include “ utilities with millions of customers as well as smaller ones .
They are rural and urban , privately held and municipally run .
Some are in the United States , others in Canada and India .
They all have one thing in common — a desire to serve their customers by providing access to detailed information that helps save energy and money . ”
For now , there are limited Google PowerMeter partners , but the company plans to expand their rollout later this year .
PowerMeter utility partners announced today Tuesday .
San Diego Gas & Electric® ( California )
TXU Energy ( Texas )
JEA ( Florida )
Reliance Energy ( India )
Wisconsin Public Service Corporation ( Wisconsin )
White River Valley Electric Cooperative ( Missouri )
Toronto Hydro–Electric System Limited ( Canada )
Glasgow EPB ( Kentucky )
Your utility not on the list ?
Do n’t fret .
Lu also indicates in the announcement that Google is looking to partner with more companies that can enable the implementation of the software .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
LONDON , June 3 ( Reuters ) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N has hired a crude tanker vessel to store gas oil off Malta 's coast , shipping sources said on Wednesday .
The U.S. investment bank declined to comment .
Storing any light , refined oil products in a crude oil tanker is unusual .
But one shipping source said the vessel , Front Queen , was a new very large crude carrier ( VLCC ) which had never had a cargo on board meaning that its tanks were clean and able to carry refined products .
The tanker was able to carry up to 2 million barrels of oil , the source said .
Separately , a shipping source said another new VLCC had been fixed to store gas oil off Malta ’s coast by a trading house .
VLCC freight rates have been depressed in recent months due to weak demand for crude , while clean tanker rates have enjoyed some gains partly due to arbitrage opportunities to ship products from Europe to the United States .
Some oil traders said that might have encouraged the companies to store gas oil in crude tankers .
A fall in oil demand this year has forced oil companies to store crude oil and middle distillates , mainly gas oil for heating and jet fuel , in tanks on land and tankers anchored at sea .
The bulk of middle distillates stored in tankers have been held in floating storage in Europe , where oil demand has been falling more sharply than the rest of the world and a steep contango on the futures market , or discounts on prompt contracts to longer - dated , has still been attracting inflows .
A study of P2P music exchanges to be revealed this week suggests that the ailing music business is shunning a lucrative lifeline by refusing to license the activity for money .
Entitled " The Long Tail of P2P " , the study by Will Page of performing rights society PRS For Music and Eric Garland of P2P research outfit Big Champagne will be aired at The Great Escape music convention tomorrow .
It 's a follow - up to Page 's study last year which helped debunk the myth of the " Long Tail " .
Page examined song purchases at a large online digital retail store , which showed that out of an inventory of 13 million songs , 10 million had never been downloaded , even once .
It suggested that the idea proposed by WiReD magazine editor Chris Anderson , who in 2004 urged that the future of business was digital retailers carrying larger inventories of slow - selling items was a Utopian fantasy .
The P2P networks are harder to quantify , but apparently show a similar pattern , where most of the action - and profit - is in the ' head ' .
Each Top 100 CD on on PirateBay averaged 58,000 downloads a week , for example .
Lady GaGa's
The Fame was downloaded 388,000 times in a week from PirateBay alone .
Like its predecessor , the new study also finds that downloads follow a log - normal , rather a Pareto ( or " power curve " ) distribution as Anderson envisaged .
The WiReD man had guessed the shape of the internet - and picked the wrong shape .
P2P swaps : where 's the action ?
The gap between bestsellers and the rest is widening , Page and Garland conclude , a pattern also seen with movie and TV consumption too .
The authors cite one knock - on effect for live music promoters , who say bands fourth of fifth on a bill are relatively worse off than they were ten years ago .
So much for the internet as the great leveller :
You literally got lost in the noise .
But why does popular taste follow this shape ?
For Andrew Bud , who worked on last year 's study , the answer is simple :
" An obvious answer is that it ’s through people chatting to each other and seeing the music talked about in the media .
That ’s what culture is .
So the fact we ’re seeing the log normal distribution here may point to the power of culture on people ’s choices .
Chris Anderson ’s hypothesis of a Pareto power law would be much more about random , individual choices – people alone with their computers .
So perhaps , this debate of ' thick versus fat ' is really about the power of culture in determining demand " .
Page says that once the nature of the digital market is understood , we can build businesses that reward composers and songwriters .
( Not something a concern for the Pirates ) .

There was n’t too much work done on the first day of filming for Robert Pattinson ’s new movie “ Remember Me ” in downtown Manhattan today , as cast and crew were doing their best to ward off the paparazzi and fans who turned up to see the dashing “ Twilight " hunk .
The handsome English actor did his best to act as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening , but the sheer number of his adoring followers that turned up to watch his every move must have come a great surprise .
If he needs to get any tips on how to ward off the female adoration he is receiving right now , he could do worse that ask his Irish co-star Pierce Brosnan for a few tips .
Brosnan , who is the 80’s played TV heartthrob Remington Steele and in the 90’s and early 00’s played 007 James Bond , knows what it is like to be the object of fan adulation .
Once the two get past that chat , they will have to get down to some serious work on this movie , which is being directed by Allen Coulter .
Pattinson , 23 , will play a young man whose brother has just committed suicide , a tragedy which causes the breakdown of his parents ’ marriage .
Brosnan will play Pattinson ’s father and Swedish actress Lena Olin will play his mother .
There 's reportedly good Thanksgiving news for turkey lovers : Contrary to popular belief , tryptophan in turkey does n't cause drowsiness .
In fact , scientists told National Geographic
News the substance could possibly aid in the treatment of depression and multiple sclerosis .
Purified tryptophan is a mild sleep - inducing agent and that probably led to the idea that foods containing heavy doses of the chemical cause drowsiness .
But tryptophan can't function well as part of a meal .
" Tryptophan is taken to the brain by an active transport system shared by a number of other amino acids and there 's competition among them -- like a crowd of people trying to get through a revolving door , " Simon Young , a neurochemist at McGill University in Montreal , Canada , told National Geographic News .
He said consuming tryptophan - rich foods may cause blood levels of the amino acid to rise , but not enough tryptophan will reach one 's brain to have a sedative affect .
And , scientists told NGN , turkey is n't even unusually high in tryptophan .
Many other foods , such as beef or soybeans , have higher concentrations .

The star was in Thailand working on his latest film at the time of his death Kill Bill star David Carradine did not commit suicide , said the doctor who oversaw a private autopsy on the actor .
Carradine was found naked in a wardrobe with a cord around his neck and other parts of his body in Bangkok on 4 June .
Forensic pathologist Dr Michael Baden concluded that the Kung Fu star died from asphyxiation .
The way the body was bound allowed him to rule out suicide .
" He did n't die of natural causes , and he did n't die of suicidal causes .
That leaves some kind of accidental death . "
Dr Baden , who fronts the US TV series Autopsy , was hired by Carradine 's family to conduct a second autopsy , following the one handled by the Thai authorities .
Police in Thailand said on 8 June that the results of the first autopsy were likely to follow within a month .
" The cause of death was asphyxiation , an inability to breathe , now why that happened is still what we 're working on , " Baden told the news agency Reuters .

Dr Baden did not rule out the possibility that the star died of accidental autoerotic asphyxiation .
Referring to the nature of the ligatures on Carradine 's body , he said the actor 's hands were above his head , and not behind his back as media reports had previously suggested .
The medical examiner said he was awaiting more information from Thai police to rule out the possibility that Carradine was killed by someone else .
He also wants to view security data from the Swissotel Nai Lert Park hotel where the actor died , to ensure no one was in the room with him at the time .
A representative for Carradine 's brothers said the family had no comment on preliminary results of the second autopsy .
Carradine was part of an acting dynasty which included his father , John Carradine , and brothers Bruce , Keith and Robert .
The star was best known for his role as Kwai Chang Caine in the 1970s TV series Kung Fu , which spawned sequels in the ' 80s and '90s .

AUGUSTA , Maine ( AP ) � Preliminary state data indicates that 68 of Maine 's 120 high schools will equip their students with Apple laptops under the state 's Learning Technology Initiative .
AUGUSTA , Maine ( AP ) � Preliminary state data indicates that 68 of Maine 's 120 high schools will equip their students with Apple laptops under the state 's Learning Technology Initiative .
The Kennebec Journal reported Friday that another 14 districts have yet to decide on laptops and six districts are awaiting word on whether they can use a pool of federal funds to pay for the equipment .
Maine Education Department spokesman David Connerty - Marin said the department expects to place an order for 60,000 laptops and then order additional machines as more districts make their decisions .
Information from The Kennebec Journal
Dennis Mahon , a longtime leader in the national White supremacy movement , and his brother have been arrested by federal agents in connection with the 2004 letter bombing of Don Logan , who is Black and at the time headed Scottsdale 's diversity office .
A federal grand jury indicted Mahon and his twin , Daniel Mahon , June 16 on charges of conspiracy to damage buildings and property by means of explosive .
Dennis Mahon was also charged with malicious damage of a building by means of explosives and distribution of information related to explosives .
The arrests cap a lengthy investigation that languished until last year , when federal officials revealed that new DNA bomb technology had revealed at least one suspect in the letter bombing , which also injured two other city workers .
Logan issued a written statement Thursday saying the arrests were welcome news .
" Although very excited about the arrest , we 're cognizant of the fact that this is the first step in the judicial process , " he said .
Logan has recovered from his severe injuries and now directs Glendale 's diversity programs .
The indictment alleges that the Mahon brothers taught others how to make a package pipe bomb using a 9 - volt battery , among other components .
It also alleges that they mailed books explaining the manufacture and use of improvised explosive devices .
Both were arrested Thursday outside Rockford , Ill .
Also charged in connection with the bombing was Robert Neil Joos of Missouri .
After a search of his 200 - acre property , Joos , 56 , was charged Thursday in U.S. District Court in Missouri with being a felon in possession of firearms .
Joos ' arrest stems from the Logan bombing investigation .
An undercover agent told authorities that Mahon described Joos as a " longtime white supremacist associate and an expert on weapons , explosives , bomb making and general survival skills , " according to court documents .
Authorities were scheduled to hold a briefing today in Phoenix to discuss the arrests and indictments .
Dennis Mahon is an outspoken racist who has long been cited by national organizations that monitor hate groups as a leader in the White separatist movement in the U.S. According to the Anti-Defamation League , the Mahon brothers have been active in White supremacist groups in several states in the Midwest and in Arizona since the 1980s .
Published reports say Dennis Mahon was once deported from Canada for his activities and that he has reached as far afield as Germany to recruit new members for the Ku Klux Klan .
The White Aryan Resistance , in which he has long had a leadership position , believes in a separate homeland for Whites .
After the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , which killed 168 people , Dennis Mahon boasted of knowing Timothy McVeigh , who was convicted in that bombing .
Although McVeigh was executed in 2001 for his role , Dennis Mahon defended him and vowed to espouse his cause .
During McVeigh 's trial , defense attorneys suggested Dennis Mahon and others linked to an Oklahoma White supremacist compound had discussed blowing up federal buildings .
Conspiracy theorists since have sought to tie Mahon to the Oklahoma City bombing .
In 2001 , Dennis Mahon tried to move his base of operations to Arizona , organizing racist allies in Gilbert and Kingman .
Though he met resistance from local religious and anti-hate groups , he continued operating in Arizona off and on and was in the state shortly before the bombing that injured Logan .
According to the indictment , Dennis Mahon called Scottsdale 's Office of Diversity and Dialogue on Sept. 26 , 2003 , and left a voice message saying that " the White Aryan Resistance is growing in Scottsdale .
There 's a few white people who are standing up . "
According to the ADL , Dennis Mahon was also in Phoenix in February 2004 to attend Aryan Fest .
Aryan Fest is a White - power music festival and gathering in Phoenix that was sponsored by Volksfront , a neo -Nazi group .
The event attracted members of the Ku Klux Klan , neo -Nazi skinheads and representatives from other extremist groups .
During conversations at Aryan Fest , Mahon reportedly promoted violent , terrorist activity , specifically " nuk[ing ] D.C. "
According to a news account of the event posted on ADL's Web site , Mahon stated , " You nuke D.C. , you 're going to wipe out most of the politicians , plus a couple million crack - head n- ggers .
. . .
It 's a win-win . . . .
And I think it 's the only way , I really do .
Terrorism works .
We did a lot of terrorism in Tulsa in the 1980s .
We put heads in the road , and people paid attention . "
During that same period , the indictment alleges , Dennis Mahon helped construct a bomb , disguised in a cardboard box made to appear as a parcel package that was delivered to Scottsdale 's Civic Center Library on Feb. 21 , 2004 .
It was addressed : Don Logan , Office of Diversity & Dialogue .
When Logan opened the box on Feb. 26 , 2004 , it exploded in his hands .
Two women were injured in the blast , but their injuries were minor .
Logan , however , was badly injured and later underwent surgery to repair his hands and arms .
For the most part , security measures Scottsdale put in place after the bombing remain , said Sgt. Mark Clark , a spokesman with the Scottsdale Police Department .
" It 's been five years of the investigation , and we 're very happy that it 's come to the point that the federal investigators have been able to make an arrest , " Clark said .
Why , hello !
Welcome to Re-Records !
This is my blog , and in this first post , I want to inform you all of my intentions .
I have a bit of an addiction .
I collect records .
I love the treasure hunting .
I love that moment when you walk into some tiny used bookstore and find a gently used copy of Pet Sounds for a dollar .
But , what I love more is the gems that I purchase out of curiosity .
The ones that , as soon as the needle hits the groove , you know you 've found something special .
These are the forgotten albums that fill in the blanks of popular music history .
These are the albums that , much like the tumultuous music business today , were overlooked due to poor promotion , unpopular production techniques or simply because they were n't released by the latest pop sensation .
I know there are copies of these albums , sitting on shelves around the world , still favorites of the original purchaser .
My goal with this blog is to uncover as many of these treasures as possible , and expose them to a …
OAKLAND , Calif . --
Long a poster child of high crime , Oakland is preparing to lay off nearly a fifth of its police force just as it has turned the corner on crime , part of a national trend in the recession .
This city of 400,000 said last month it would cut 140 officers from its 800 - strong police force , the department 's first - ever mass layoffs .
Dozens of hard - hit cities have done the same .
In May , Toledo , Ohio , laid off 11 % of its police force .
In Minnesota , seven city police departments have closed since March , and state officials say an additional nine departments are likely to close by year 's end .
The Oakland cuts , to take effect in September , come after the city spent the past five years building its police force to the highest number of officers it had ever seen .
The buildup is credited with helping to lower the city 's number of homicides by about 20 % and cut its violent crime by about 13 % over the past year .
To hang onto those gains , Oakland has tried for months to protect police from cutbacks .
Faced with an $ 83 million budget deficit , Oakland lawmakers instead closed City Hall one day a month , trimmed the city attorney 's budget 10 % , reduced Mayor Ron Dellums 's staff by 20 % and even grounded the police department 's helicopter , saving the city about $ 400,000 annually .

The TerreStar - 1 satellite had a launch mass of 6,910kg
The world 's biggest commercial telecommunications satellite has been put in orbit by an Ariane 5 rocket .
The TerreStar - 1 platform weighed just shy of seven tonnes at launch .
Built for TerreStar Networks , the spacecraft will provide voice , messaging and data connections to the North American market .
The satellite was so big it was the only passenger on Ariane which routinely carries double payloads from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana .
The heaviest commercial satellites in the past have been of the order of six - and - a - half - tonnes .
Blast - off was delayed because of stormy weather but eventually took place at 1452 local time ( 1752 GMT ) .

Advertisement Built by Space Systems / Loral , TerreStar - 1 has a huge deployable reflector antenna , measuring 18 m across .
It was stowed like an umbrella for launch and will be unfurled in the next couple of weeks in a procedure that should take about four hours .
TerreStar - 1 is the centrepiece of an integrated space and terrestrial service for which customers will use a smart phone - sized device .
This is a step - change from some of the bulky gear normally associated with satellite comms .
" It 's the first full - mode terrestrial / satellite handset , " TerreStar President Jeff Epstein told BBC News .
The handset is similar in size to everyday smartphones " It 's about the size of a Blackberry ' Curve ' .
It 's very small ; everything is internal : there are no external antennas .
" It will work on a terrestrial network as a normal cell phone would , and when you 're out of range or the network 's down for whatever reason , it will go to the satellite .
The whole premise of our business model is that to get wide adoption , you need a handset that is useable , not something that is huge . "
In the first instance , it is expected the primary users will be government , emergency responders , rural communities and commercial users .
Wednesday 's launch was the third of the year for Ariane .
On its previous outing , the rocket placed in orbit the Herschel and Planck space telescopes .
Their combined 1.9 bn - euro programme cost made the event the most valuable launch in the history of European space science .
Four more Ariane flights are planned this year .

( CNN ) -- Stumped on a tough decision ?
New Web sites are there to help .
Hunch , a site open to the public Monday , asks questions and helps people make decisions .
Hunch , a site that launches for the public Monday , will consider your quandary by getting to know you , asking you a series of questions and then spitting out three decisions .
Another site , Let Simon Decide , makes a similar attempt .
Caterina Fake , co-founder of the photo - sharing community Flickr , says she created Hunch not because people need help with emotional decisions but because it's too tough to find smart information online .
You often have to replicate someone else 's research , which is a waste , she said .
Tech bloggers seem to be pleased with the effort .
" For the most part , I was impressed , though it quickly became clear that Hunch is n't capable of magically making up your mind for you , " wrote Jason Kincaid , a reporter at TechCrunch , a technology blog .
He called the site " very clean and unintimidating . "
Fake spoke with CNN about decision making , her nerdy past and the power of collective knowledge .
The following is an edited transcript :
CNN : Where did you get the idea for Hunch ?
Fake :
It 's a user - generated content site similar to Flickr , but the unit is not a photograph but a decision .
And so it 's sort of a similar thing in that way .
We kind of built the system so people can contribute to it .
They can ask questions on there and suggest questions .
And then you sort of codify it into a decision tree .
CNN : So you 're answering questions about yourself ?
Fake :
Well , there are two components .
So you answer questions about yourself , and there 's a little module that says things like , " Alien abductions : real or fake ? "
And what [ Hunch ] does is , it then puts together a profile of you , a taste profile .
And then you can go into the system and ask it any question that 's in the system .
So it 's things like , " What HD - TV should I buy ? " or " Where should I go to college ? " or , you know , " Where should I eat in San Diego on a Saturday night ? "
It could be just about anything .
Once it kind of gets to know you , you can ask it questions , and then it gives an answer to you that it does n't give to anyone else .
CNN : What are the downsides ?
Fake :
It depends on what the decision is .
There is kind of an array of decisions that are too taste - oriented .
Like , no matter how well we know you , we 're not going to know that your backyard is like 25 feet by 10 feet , versus 10 feet by 10 feet [ for a person looking to buy a backyard grill ] .
You know what I 'm saying ?
There 's no system that can get to know that .
So what we try to do is narrow it down .
So we ask you questions about your aesthetics or your beliefs or your politics or your demographic .
CNN : What kind of decision - maker are you ?
Fake :
It 's really funny , because I think there 's a mistake that 's generally made with people asking about Hunch , and it's that it 's solving people 's emotional problems .
And it 's not .
It 's solving people 's informational problems .
I do n't have any problems making any decisions .
I 've never had any problem making decisions , but when I go to Google and I 'm looking for information , say , about trademarks .
I have to do all this research , and somebody has already done this research .
CNN : So you see Hunch as a kind of search engine , almost ?
Fake :
No , it 's not a search engine .
The feel of it is nothing like a search engine .
It 's something new .
CNN : How do you think collective knowledge online will change the way people live , or the way we interact with each other ?
Fake :
It 's like it's an amazing period in the history of the Internet just in that way .
...
We know more in the collective than we do in the individual .
It becomes even more amazing when you extend that out to people outside your social network .
Like , I do n't know anyone that has taken a yoga class in Romania .
But I 'm sure that if I ended up in Romania , and I wanted to sign up for a yoga class that somebody in the world would know three places to recommend me .
The information is out there in a sort of disorganized fashion .
...
These systems that are kind of growing up now -- and Hunch hopefully is among them -- are able to take this sort of collective knowledge and make it easy for people to use and easy for people to access .
CNN : Is there anything in your background that influences your belief in this collective knowledge idea ?
Fake : I was a nerdy little girl .
I played Dungeons and Dragons , and I had a little TRS - 80 computer .
It was really early on , I think it was , gosh , like 1994 when I first saw the Web , right ?
So I went online , and I saw these people uploading pictures of , like , their cats .
And I remember there was a video cam of ... the famous coffee pot at the IBM research center that uploaded every 5 minutes to show that the coffee pot was full or empty or whatever .
And so the Internet struck me as this incredible thing where anybody -- like anybody -- could publish anything , and then anybody anywhere else in the world could read it .
And I never got over that .
There was kind of this wonder , this sense of wonder that I had about this incredible culture of generosity on the Web -- of all these people sharing stuff with each other .
I 've always been so amazed by that .
I love that .
Like , I love that aspect of the Internet .
That 's the thing that always seemed like it was magic to me .
CNN : What are some cool Web sites that are flying under the radar right now ?
Fake :
Have you heard of Etsy ?
CNN : Yeah , is that where people buy and sell art ?
Fake : Yeah , it 's great .
I think it 's gonna be like the next eBay .
And I met those guys when they were really small .
I 've been helping those guys since it was three kids in a dorm room .
I love those guys .
It 's one of my favorite companies .
It has that same kind of ethic [ as Hunch ] : the power of the individual .
There are like these housewives in the Midwest who had no idea they could make a living making Christmas ornaments or whatever .
It 's just kind of an amazing thing that can only happen on the Internet .

Microsoft ’s Bing overtook Yahoo !
as the number two search engine in the United States and worldwide on Thursday ( 4th June ) according to our StatCounter Global Stats data .
Bing grabbed market share from Google .
“ It remains to be seen if Bing falls away after the initial novelty and promotion but at first sight it looks like Microsoft is on to a winner , ” commented Aodhan Cullen , CEO , StatCounter .
“ Steve Ballmer is quoted as saying that he wanted Microsoft to become the second biggest search engine within five years .
Following the breakdown in talks to acquire Yahoo !
at a cost of $ 40 bn it looks as if he may have just achieved that with Bing much sooner and a lot cheaper than anticipated . ”
Our analysis finds that in the US Bing leapfrogged Yahoo to take second place on 16.28 % .
Yahoo ! has 10.22 % .
Google still commands the US search engine market with 71.47 % .
Globally Bing at 5.62 % has taken a narrow lead over Yahoo ! ( 5.13 % ) .
Google worldwide retains 87.62 % of the market .
StatCounter Global Stats , a free online service which captures market share battles of search engines , browsers and operating systems including mobile , was launched in March this year .
The StatCounter Global Stats research data is based on four billion pageloads per month .

UPDATE 11 June 2009 :
While Bing has fallen back to third place behind Google and Yahoo !
it is winning market share for Microsoft against its two main rivals in the US and worldwide according to our latest analysis .
We analyzed search engine market share two weeks before and after the formal launch of Bing on May 28th ( 14th May to the 27th May and the 28th May to 10th June ) .
For the US market it found :
Google decreased from 78.68 % to 77.94 % ( - 0.74 % )
Yahoo decreased from 11.46 % to 10.76 % ( - 0.7 % )
Microsoft ( Bing , MSN Search and Live Search ) increased from 7.4 % to 9 % ( +1.6 % )
( See here and here )
“ It is too early to say what the long term result will be but this is a creditable performance by Bing , ” commented Aodhan Cullen , CEO StatCounter .
“ It remains to be seen what happens to Bing after user curiosity and the reported $ 100 m advertising budget runs out . ”
Worldwide , comparing the two weeks before and after the Bing launch , StatCounter reports a similar trend with Microsoft taking market share .
Google decreased from 89.81 % to 89.69 % ( - 0.12 % )
Yahoo decreased from 5.34 % to 5.1 % ( - 0.24 % )
Microsoft ( Bing , MSN Search and Live Search ) increased from 3.08 % to 3.5 % ( +0.42 % )

He recently weathered a firestorm over retention payments to A.I.G. executives made possible in part by language inserted in the administration ’s stimulus package at the Treasury Department ’s insistence .
And his new efforts to restart the financial industry suggest the same philosophy that guided Mr. Geithner ’s Fed years .
According to a recent report by the inspector general monitoring the bailout , Neil M. Barofsky , Mr. Geithner ’s plan to underwrite investors willing to buy the risky mortgage - backed securities still weighing down banks ’ books is a boon for private equity and hedge funds but exposes taxpayers to “ potential unfairness ” by shifting the burden to them .
The top echelon of the Treasury Department is a common destination for financiers , and Mr. Geithner has also recruited aides from Wall Street , some from firms that were at the heart of the crisis .
For instance , his chief of staff , Mark A. Patterson , is a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs , and one of his top counselors is Lewis S. Alexander , a former chief economist at Citigroup .
A bill sent recently by the Treasury to Capitol Hill would give the Obama administration extensive new powers to inject money into or seize systemically important firms in danger of failure .
It was drafted in large measure by Davis Polk & Wardwell , a law firm that represents many banks and the financial industry ’s lobbying group .
Mr. Geithner also hired Davis Polk to represent the New York Fed during the A.I.G. bailout .
Treasury officials say they inadvertently used a copy of Davis Polk ’s draft sent to them by the Federal Reserve as a template for their own bill , with the result that the proposed legislation Treasury sent to Capitol Hill bore the law firm ’s computer footprints .
And they point to several significant changes to that draft that “ better protect the taxpayer , ” in the words of Andrew Williams , a Treasury spokesman .
But others say important provisions in the original industry bill remain .
Most significant , the bill does not require that any government rescue of a troubled firm be done at the lowest possible cost , as is required by the F.D.I.C. when it takes over a failed bank .
Treasury officials said that is because they would use the rescue powers only in rare and extreme cases that might require flexibility .
Karen Shaw Petrou , managing director of the Washington research firm Federal Financial Analytics , said it essentially gives Treasury “ a blank check . ”
One year and two administrations into the bailout , Mr. Geithner is perhaps the single person most identified with the enormous checks the government has written .
At every turn , he is being second - guessed about the rescues ’ costs and results .
But he remains firm in his belief that failure to act would have been much more costly .
“ All financial crises are a fight over how much losses the government ultimately takes on , ” he said .
And every decision “ requires we balance how to achieve the most benefits in terms of improving confidence and the flow of credit at the least risk to taxpayers . ”
The combination of signs that the economy may have begun to recover and the arrival of spring has led to the overuse of a metaphor that could use a little pruning .
We ’re talking about those “ green shoots ” ( sometimes “ shoots of green ” ) that keep showing up in policymakers ’ speeches , economists ’ notes and , unfortunately , reporters ’ stories .
The following exchange should serve as a reminder to everyone involved that it ’s all been said before , and so much better .
BENJAMIN RAND : … There is no longer any margin for inflation , it has gone as far as it can .
You ’ve reached your limits on taxation , dependence on foreign energy is at a point of crisis , and , from where I see it , Mr. President , the so - called Free Enterprise System could be at the breaking point .
PRESIDENT : You do n’t think I should take that chance , huh ?
RAND : Absolutely not .
PRESIDENT : Do you agree with Ben , Mr. Gardiner ?
Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives ?
CHANCE : As long as the roots are not severed , all is well and all will be well in the garden .
PRESIDENT : … In the garden ?
CHANCE : That is correct .
In a garden , growth has its season .
There is spring and summer , but there is also fall and winter .
And then spring and summer again …
PRESIDENT : … Spring and summer …
Yes , I see …Fall and winter .
Yes , indeed .
RAND : I think what my most insightful friend is building up to , Mr. President , is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature , yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy .
CHANCE : Yes .
That is correct .
There will be growth in the spring .
The source , of course , is Being There , the 1979 movie ( based on the Jerzy Kosinski book of the same name ) where Peter Sellers plays a feeble - minded gardener named Chance .
Sometimes life imitates art – and we wish it did n’t .
For the last 20 years , Dr. George Tiller and I were close colleagues and friends , members of a too - small community of physicians who say aloud that we perform abortions .
Now he is gone , and I am furious .
But I refuse to let my anger become despair :
We must turn George ’s terrifying end into the beginning of a new era when doctors can save lives without risking their own .
George was killed because he was a family physician who had the skills to terminate a pregnancy after 25 weeks and was public about it .
He helped thousands of women in the most horrifying circumstances :
Some women had fetuses with malformations so severe they could not survive outside the womb ; others had cancers that would have killed them unless they ended their pregnancies .
And there were rape victims so young that it took months for them to recognize the signs of pregnancy .
Local police , state police , the FBI , the state government , the federal government -- they should have done more to protect George .
We all saw it coming .
Even though 36 years have passed since Roe vs.
Wade , a small group of people still wanted George dead .
These people started tormenting him back in the ‘ 70s , and they never stopped , egging each other on , calling him “ Tiller the killer , ” harassing his children at school , bombing his clinic , shooting him in both arms and , in recent months , planting crosses in his front lawn , KKK - style .

All that cruelty targeted at gentle George , a mentor to so many doctors and a hero to so many patients .
George knew that he might not die from natural causes .
In a group e-mail to friends and colleagues , including me , he once wrote that “ one should treasure his relationships with his co-travelers on the journey of life each moment and day , because they may be taken from you or you from them at any precise moment . ”
Since I heard about George ’s murder , I ’ve found myself staring at a coffee mug from his clinic .
On it is this list : Kindness , Courtesy , Justice , Love , Respect .
Despite the constant clamor outside his clinic , George delivered on that motto .
George had another motto too : “ trust women . ”
As he once told an interviewer , “ It is my fundamental philosophy that patients are emotionally , mentally , morally , spiritually and physically competent to struggle with complex health issues and come to decisions that are appropriate for them . ”
We can all pay tribute to George ’s legacy by treating abortion providers as physicians , not pariahs , and by explaining and openly supporting their work as doctors .
He knew that abortion is an integral part of women ’s healthcare .
When physicians are afraid to provide it , women die .
Wherever women ’s access to abortion is in danger , our government , our medical institutions and the public must step forward to protect it .
This might mean enforcing the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
Act and other laws on the books to safeguard abortion providers and their patients .
Or insisting on new legislation to ensure that doctors can practice medicine without getting assaulted .

A show of strength and support will give courage to doctors who have the training to provide abortions but are afraid to use it .
Long before George was taken from us , we providers worried about our shrinking ranks , watching colleagues retire without anyone taking over their practices .
We must erase fear as the reason young physicians wo n’t enter the field that George found so rewarding .
On top of the strenuous cases and the relentless harassment , George trained hundreds of doctors in abortion procedures .
We owe it to George to let them practice .

Python in Fifty Words
Aahz , a long standing member of the Python community , is manning a Python booth at the OSCON Conference .
With the help of the Python Advocacy mailing list he has come up with a description of Python in fifty words .
I thought it was pretty neat :
Python is a dynamic , object - oriented , and general - purpose programming language with extensive libraries .
Python 's clean syntax and testing frameworks encourage readable and maintainable code .
Python supports major operating systems , Java , .NET , and mobile / embedded devices .
Integration with C/C++ is straightforward .
Adopters include Google / YouTube , Philips , HP , EVE Online , and Industrial Light and Magic .
Fetching docstrings from objects : easy , right ?
( A painful exploration of the Python object model )
Extraordinarily simple introspection is one of the features that makes dynamic languages like Python such a joy to work with .
If you have code dealing with arbitrary objects and you want to discover and present information about those objects it is marvellously simple .
Alongside this Python has docstrings ; a simple way to associate usage documentation with just about any object .
This is invaluable when working with the interactive interpreter ; you can import and instantiate classes and get documentation on live objects by calling help ( instance.method ) .
These features , listing all members , fetching them by name and looking at the docstring , can also be used in live systems or in tools that automatically build documentation for libraries .
So just how easy is it to fetch the docstring from an arbitrary member on an arbitrary object ?
If you are going to handle all the corner cases of the Python type system then the answer is harder than you might think .
As I 've ended up writing code that does this ( more or less ) twice in the last week I 'll walk you through the nefarious pitfalls and lets see how many lines of code we end up with .
The arbitrary goal I 've set for this task is to write a function that when given an object returns a list of all members along with their docstrings .
Along the way we 'll learn far more about the Python object model than we wanted to know .
A naive first attempt looks like this :
def get_docstrings ( obj ) :
members = dir ( obj )
return [ ( member , getattr ( obj , member ) .
__doc__ ) for member in members ]
dir ( obj ) returns a list of all the member names of obj as strings .
getattr ( obj , member ) .
__doc__ fetches an individual attribute by name and gets its associated docstring .
In IronPython I can make this crash very easily :
>>> from System import ArgIterator >>> dir( ArgIterator ) Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... SystemError :
An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format .
( Ex ception from HRESULT : 0x8007000B )
Ha , bad IronPython I can already hear you chuckling .
Not so fast .
Since Python 2.6 and the introduction of the __dir__ protocol method we can easily suffer the same problem :
class UnDesirable ( object ) :
def __dir__ ( self ) :
raise Exception ( " Do n't dir me bro " )
>> > dir ( UnDesirable ( ) )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
. . .
Exception : Don ' t dir me bro
Ok , so we can catch this error and return an empty list .
def get_docstrings ( obj ) :
try :
members = dir ( obj )
except Exception :
members = [ ]
return [ ( member , getattr ( obj , member ) .
__doc__ ) for member in members ]
What 's next ?
What happens when we run this function on an instance of a class with properties ?
class Proper ( object ) :
@ property
def something ( self ) :
" Here be the docstring "
>> > get_docstrings ( Proper ( ) )
[ . . . ( ' something ' , None ) ]
When our code called getattr ( obj , ' something ' ) it actually triggered the property instead of fetching it as an object for us to look at .
Introspection that causes code execution is a bad thing ( tm ) - it could raise exceptions or have unpleasant side effects .
More to the point we do n't get the information we want .
The property descriptor for ' something ' lives on the class :
>>> getattr ( Proper , ' something ' ) < property object at 0x7e600 > >>> getattr( Proper , ' something ' ) .
__doc__
' Here be the docstring '
The problem is that although this works for things like methods and properties it does n't work for instance attributes .
Even worse , in IronPython this is no better than our previous solution because static properties are very common - fetching an attribute from a class can also cause arbitrary code execution .
Haha , bad IronPython again .
Well , thanks to the wonders of the descriptor protocol the same thing can happen in Python :
class descriptor ( object ) :
def __init__ ( self , function ) :
self .
func = function
self .
__doc__ = function .
__doc__
def __get__ ( self , instance , owner ) :
raise Exception ( " No one expects the descriptor protocol " )
class Harumph ( object ) :
@ descriptor
def something ( self ) :
" I still have n't found what I 'm looking for "
>> > getattr ( Harumph , ' something ' )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
. . .
Exception :
No one expects the descriptor protocol
The reason it is so tempting to use getattr is that it neatly handles finding exactly where attributes live .
Once we have decided we should n't use getattr we have to start understanding the way Python looks up attributes in more detail than we really wanted .
We 've already seen that although instance attributes live on the instance , to safely find things like properties and methods we need to look on the class .
Python objects have __dict__ attributes that act as namespaces for objects - they map the member names to the members .
We could rewrite our function to use it , first checking the instance and then the class :
def get_docstrings ( obj ) :
try :
members = dir ( obj )
except Exception :
members = [ ]
return [ ( member , get_doc ( obj , member ) ) for member in members ]
def get_doc ( obj , member ) :
if member in obj .
__dict__ :
return obj .
__dict__ [ member ] .
__doc__
return type ( obj ) .
__dict__ [ member ] .
__doc__
This works fine for some situations but is so full of holes it is hard to know where to start .
Let 's start with classes that use slots .
Classes that define a __slots__ member ( list of strings ) do n't have an instance dictionary ( a memory optimisation ) but have reserved slots for the instance members specified in the class .
Attempting to access instance .
__dict__ for objects like this will die with an attribute error .
Classes using slots will however have an entry in the class dictionary for each slot :
class Slotted ( object ) :
__slots__ = [ ' x ' ]
>> > slotty = Slotted ( )
>> > slotty .
__dict__
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
. . .
AttributeError : ' Slotted ' object has no attribute ' __dict__ '
>> > dir ( slotty )
[ . . . ' x ' ]
>> > slotty .
x
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
. . .
AttributeError : x
>> > type ( slotty ) . __dict__ [ ' x ' ]
< member ' x ' of ' Slotted ' objects >
These member slots do n't have a docstring but lets assume this is sufficient for our use case and handle it :
def get_docstrings ( obj ) :
try :
members = dir ( obj )
except Exception :
members = [ ]
return [ ( member , get_doc ( obj , member ) ) for member in members ]
def get_doc ( obj , member ) :
if hasattr ( obj , ' __dict__ ' ) and member in obj .
__dict__ :
return obj .
__dict__ [ member ] .
__doc__
return type ( obj ) .
__dict__ [ member ] .
__doc__
This gets us past one hurdle .
Let 's try our function on a the Proper class instead of an instance :
>>> get_docstrings ( Proper )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... KeyError : ' __class__'
Slightly obscure , but it turns out that the __class__ attribute of an object ( a pointer to its type ) is another descriptor and is inherited from object .
We do n't find it in the instance dictionary or the class dictionary .
In fact our code would have the same problem with any attribute inherited from a base class .
>>> object.__dict__[' __class__ ' ] < attribute ' __class__ ' of ' object ' objects > >>> descriptor = object.__dict__[' __class__ ' ] >>> descriptor.__get__( Proper ( ) , Proper ) < class ' __main__ .
Proper '>
To find an arbitrary attribute you need to not only look in the instance dictionary and the class dictionary , but also walk the inheritance hierarchy if the attribute lives on any of the base classes .
And what about multiple inheritance , oh god .
Thankfully this is n't as difficult a problem as it sounds .
Python classes define an __mro__ attribute ( the Method resolution order ) which even in the face of multiple inheritance returns a list of base classes you need to search - and in the right order too ( the order is important in case the method is defined on a base class and overridden in a sub-class ) .
We can rewrite our code to use this :
def get_doc ( obj , member ) :
if hasattr ( obj , ' __dict__ ' ) and member in obj .
__dict__ :
return obj .
__dict__ [ member ] .
__doc__
for entry in type ( obj ) .
__mro__ :
if member in entry .
__dict__ :
return entry .
__dict__ [ member ] .
__doc__
Let 's try it on a subclass of Proper :
class SubProper ( Proper ) :
pass
>> > get_docstrings ( SubProper ( ) )
[ . . . ( ' something ' , ' Here be the docstring ' ) ]
>> > get_docstrings ( SubProper )
[ . . . ( ' something ' , None ) ]
This works fine for instances but fails when we use it on the class object itself .
It turns out that we need to handle instances differently to classes .
For instances this code is perfectly correct : for entry in type ( obj ) .
__mro__ .
If we pass in an instance we need to check its class object and then all base classes .
For class objects its type is its metaclass .
This controls some of the behavior of the class but is n't where its members are defined .
We need to go straight to the bases classes .
This should do the trick :
def get_doc ( obj , member ) :
if hasattr ( obj , ' __dict__ ' ) and member in obj .
__dict__ :
return obj .
__dict__ [ member ] .
__doc__
if isinstance ( obj , type ) :
search_order = obj .
__mro__
else :
search_order = type ( obj ) .
__mro__
for entry in search_order :
if member in entry .
__dict__ :
return entry .
__dict__ [ member ] .
__doc__
>> > get_docstrings ( SubProper )
[ . . . ( ' something ' , ' Here be the docstring ' ) ]
Hooray , let 's see how it fares on a sub-class of an old style class :
class Base :
def something ( self ) :
" Here be dragons "
class Sub ( Base ) :
pass
>> > get_docstrings ( Sub )
[ . . . ( ' something ' , None ) ]
Ah , old style classes are n't instances of type .
Instead they 're instances of types .
ClassType , painfully they do n't have __mro__ which was introduced in Python 2.3 for new style classes .
We need a different strategy for handling old style classes - and thankfully this is already implemented for us in inspect.
getmro .
For new style classes this already uses __mro__ , so we can rewrite our code as :
import types
import inspect
def get_doc ( obj , member ) :
if hasattr ( obj , ' __dict__ ' ) and member in obj .
__dict__ :
return obj .
__dict__ [ member ] .
__doc__
if isinstance ( obj , ( type , types .
ClassType ) ) :
search_order = inspect .
getmro ( obj )
else :
search_order = inspect .
getmro ( type ( obj ) )
for entry in search_order :
if member in entry .
__dict__ :
return entry .
__dict__ [ member ] .
__doc__
>> > get_docstrings ( Sub )
[ . . . ( ' something ' , ' Here be dragons ' ) ]
>> > get_docstrings ( Sub ( ) )
[ . . . ( ' something ' , None ) ]
As you can see , we have fixed the problem for old style classes - but still have a problem with instances of old style classes .
The problem is that you can't do n't get the class of an old - style instance by calling type on it :
>>> class A : ... pass ... >>> a = A ( ) >>> type (a ) < type ' instance ' >
So this line was broken for some objects search_order = inspect.getmro(type(obj ) ) .
Instead you can access the class of any arbitrary object through its __class__ member :
>>> a.__class__ < class __main__ .A at 0x01D23780 >
If we make this change , then finally we have code that works for all these cases .
We have the additional burden in IronPython of a few ' magic ' attributes that IronPython sticks on for us ( like the ReferenceEquals method ) which can't be found in any of the base classes .
This code defaults to returning None if it fails to find a member , so it handles these gracefully .
Our full code for finding all docstrings for all members on an arbitrary object is 18 lines of code :
import types
import inspect
def get_doc ( obj , member ) :
if hasattr ( obj , ' __dict__ ' ) and member in obj .
__dict__ :
return obj .
__dict__ [ member ] .
__doc__
if isinstance ( obj , ( type , types .
ClassType ) ) :
search_order = inspect .
getmro ( obj )
else :
search_order = inspect .
getmro ( obj .
__class__ )
for entry in search_order :
if member in entry .
__dict__ :
return entry .
__dict__ [ member ] .
__doc__
def get_docstrings ( obj ) :
try :
members = dir ( obj )
except Exception :
members = [ ]
return [ ( member , get_doc ( obj , member ) ) for member in members ]
Even all this is n't bulletproof .
A class with slots can define a __getattr__ method that returns something for every attribute access .
This means that hasattr ( obj , ' __dict__ ' ) will return True and the code that follows may die .
A class or instance can override __bases__ and lie about its base classes .
It may even be possible to create a metaclass that uses __slots__ and then have classes ( instances of the metaclass ) without a dictionary ( breaking our code that accesses Klass.__dict__ ) .
Oh well , they 're obscure corner cases of obscure corner cases .
If you can think of any cases I 've missed , or ways of doing this more elegantly , then let me know in the comments !
Movable Python Goes Open Source
Movable Python is a portable distribution of Python for Windows .
It is capable of running from a USB stick and includes a mobile development environment .
People have successfully used it with Zope , Django and various other large Python frameworks .
Movable Python started back in 2006 , and for a long time I ran it as a commercial project with a small charge .
Some time ago I decided to release Movable Python as open source after making a certain number more sales ; with half the money from those sales going to the Python Software Foundation ( PSF ) and the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project .
Last year in anticipation of reaching the target I made the donations , which was followed by Stephen Ferg making a very generous donation to finalise the process .
After a slight delay Movable Python finally went open source , and after another delay I 'm actually announcing it !
The source code for building distributions , and prebuilt distributions for Python 2.2-2.5 are available for download from :
The code for the Movable Python GUI needs a bit of love .
Actually it needs throwing away and rewriting , but the core code is in pretty good shape with no outstanding bugs that I 'm aware of .
I do need to build a new distribution for Python 2.6 and see if building one for Python 3.0 is possible .
Another interesting part of the Movable Python project is Movable IDLE .
This is an entirely self - contained version of IDLE , along with the whole Python standard library .
This could be particularly useful for teaching environments .
It also needs updating , with distributions for Python 2.5 & 2.6 building and the dialog that pre-dates Movable Python going open source can be removed .
Monkey Patching , Static Methods and the Descriptor Protocol
In the Resolver One test framework we have a fairly elaborate mock system .
It emulates a .NET API from a commercial vendor which we do n't have installed on our test / development machines .
Most of the methods on a core part of this API are static methods .
Jonathan and I have spent a good chunk of this morning tracking down an obscure failure .
It 's one of those wonderful failures ; some test is passing but causing other tests later on to fail .
Great fun .
Some of our tests work by monkey patching parts of an API to test their interaction with other parts .
This is a fairly standard testing technique in Python , but where you are patching any global state ( class and module members ) you need to be very careful .
Even in the event of test failure you must restore the original members after the test completes .
Otherwise you get the kind of errors we were seeing .
The standard way of doing this is code that looks like this :
original = module .
something
module .
something = something_else
try :
do_something ( )
self .
assertTrue ( something _happened ( ) )
finally :
module .
something = original
This gets particularly painful if you patch several things and it is easy to get wrong .
To solve exactly this problem , and remove the boilerplate , we use a patch function ( which is also available in my Python mock module ) .
It reduces the snippet above to :
@ patch ( ' module.something ' , something_else )
def function ( ) :
do_something ( )
function ( )
self .
assertTrue ( something _happened ( ) )
So as we are doing this , it was particularly odd that we were seeing this error .
Eventually we tracked it down to the patching of a static method on our mock API .
Let me illustrate the problem :
>> > class Test ( object ) :
. . . @ staticmethod
. . . def test ( ) :
. . . print ' woozer '
. . .
>> >
Test . test ( )
woozer
>> > original =
Test .
test
>> > original
< function test at 0x70df0 >
>> >
Test .
test = original
>> >
Test . test ( )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in < module >
TypeError : unbound method test ( ) must be called with Test instance as first argument ( got nothing instead )
>> >
Fetching the static method and then setting it directly back on the class breaks it !
To understand why we need to understand how attributes are fetched in Python and a bit about the descriptor protocol .
When a method is created inside a class declaration it is a normal function stored inside the class dictionary .
Python functions have a __get__ method ( part of the descriptor protocol ) which controls how they are fetched as attributes from classes and instances .
When a method is fetched from an instance what you get is a bound method - effectively the original function bound to the instance which is passed in as the first argument ( self ) .
When a method is fetched from the class itself what you actually get is an unbound method ( in Python 2. X only - unbound methods have gone in Python 3 ) .
This is often used when calling up to base classes in overridden methods :
class SubClass ( BaseClass ) :
def method ( self ) :
BaseClass .
method ( self )
Static methods are called without self as the first argument .
Functions wrapped in staticmethod exhibit different behaviour when fetched from the class - the underlying function is returned directly .
So in our monkeypatching scenario , when the static method is fetched we get a function .
Attaching a function back to the class ( when the original is restored ) turns it into an unbound method next time it is fetched .
It has lost its ' staticmethod 'ness .
A solution is to do this instead :
>> > class Test ( object ) :
. . . @ staticmethod
. . . def test ( ) :
. . . print ' fritch '
. . .
>> >
Test . test ( )
fritch
>> > original = Test .
__dict__ [ ' test ' ]
>> > original
< staticmethod object at 0x74710 >
>> >
Test .
test = original
>> >
Test . test ( )
fritch
By accessing the class dictionary we get the static method descriptor which is safe to set back onto the class .
There is slight drawback to this approach .
Instances of classes that use __slots__ do n't have a dictionary - so we either need to fallback to the normal attribute lookup in this case or treat patching classes differently from patching instances .
Normally this is n't an issue because unless it is a singleton it is n't so important to unpatch instances .
HOWTO : Using the Wing Python IDE with IronPython
A common question amongst new IronPython users is Which IDE is best for IronPython ?
One common suggestion , which .NET developers gravitate towards naturally , is IronPython Studio .
This is an example of extending Visual Studio through the VSx shell , and in my opinion not really suitable for pain - free use .
You can read some of my thoughts on it in this IronPython - URLs blog entry .
As IronPython code is just Python code any good Python IDE will do , however they rarely feature good integration with IronPython .
Fortunately there are a large range of tools that can be plugged into any extensible editor .
My favourite IDE is the Wing IDE , not least because of it has the best autocomplete ( intellisense ) of any Python IDE I 've used .
It achieves this by statically analysing Python code and inferring the types .
This does n't work with .NET types because they do n't have Python source code ...
This HOWTO shows ' how to ' enable autocomplete for the .NET types in Wing , plus using the scripting API to add commands like executing the current file with IronPython :
Updated : Embedding IronPython in C# Silverlight Applications Article
IronPython has been designed to make it easy to embed in .NET applications .
With code evaluated and executed at runtime it opens up all sorts of possibilities for user scripting of applications , storing rules as text that can be created and modified at runtime and so on .
Hosting IronPython in Silverlight is slightly different from desktop .NET applications .
Although the hosting API is the same there is some initial configuration that needs to be done .
I 've updated my article on the topic to include the configuration needed for IronPython code to import from other Python files contained in the xap file , plus adding references to the standard .
NET / Silverlight assemblies so that the hosted code does n't need to manually call clr .

بعد از سخنان هاشمی رفسنجانی در خطبه‌ها ی
نماز جمعه تهران که در آن خواهان بازگ رداندن اعتماد عمومی به جامعه شده بود، محمد خاتمی، رئیس دولت اصلاحات، با اشاره به این سخنان، مراجعه به آرای عمومی و برگزاری یک رفراندوم سالم را بهترین راه برای خروج از بحران کنونی دانست .
دکتر محسن سازگارا، مدیر مرکز تحقیقات ایران معاصر در واشنگتن، می‌گوید، طرح موضوع رفراندوم در شرایط کنونی درس ت نیست و مردم را از مسیر اصلی منحرف می‌کند .
او می‌گوید، مردم یک خواست مشخص دارند و آن برگزاری دوباره انتخابات ریاست جمهوری تحت نظارت سازمان‌های بی‌طرف و غیردولتی است. به نظر وی، پیش کشیدن بحث رفراندوم می‌تواند به انحراف مسیر خواست‌های مردم منجر شود .
محسن سازگارا که خود چهار سال قبل، طرح به رفراندوم گذاشتن قانون اساسی جمهوری اسلامی ایران را طرح کرد، می‌گوید : « در شرای ط کنونی بحث همه‌پرسی می‌تواند به برداشت‌های گوناگون بیانجامد و مثلا هم‌فکران من در چهار سال پیش بگویند منظور از این رفراندوم، برگزاری همه‌پرسی قانون اساسی است در حالی که در شرایط کنونی خواست مردم ایران این چیزها نیست و آ نان مشخصا به دنبال رای خود هستند » .
وی با اشاره به سخنان روز دوشنبیه آیت‌الله خامنه‌ای که بار دیگر تایید انتخابات و نپذیرفتن وجود بحران در حاکمیت بود، می‌گوید، متاسفانه آقای خامنه‌ا ی
نشان داد که هنوز صدای ملت را نشنیده است .
سازگارا که از بنیانگذاران اولیه سپاه پاسداران ایران است، با توجه به یک دهه حضور خود در حاکمیت جمهوری اسلامی، می‌گوید، متاسفانه آن عقلانی ت لازم برای تن دادن به خواست مردم هنوز در حاکمیت موجود نیست، هرچند وی پیرو ز
نهایی این میدان را مردم ایران می‌داند .
دویچه‌وله : آقای سازگارا، آقای خاتمی پیشنهاد کرده‌ که برای برون‌رفت از بحران فعلی به آرای مردم رجوع شود و یک رفراندوم برگزار شود .
ظاهرا مرجع‌شان هم اصل ۱۱۰ قانون اساسی است. آیا آن اصل مطابق با شرایط کنونی ایران است و می‌شود الان این شرایط را به رفراندوم گذاشت ؟
محسن سازگارا : این راه حل خوبی نیست.
صحبت از رفراندوم کردن، به میان آوردن لغتی است که فقط نوعی استعداد ب دفهمی دارد و ممکن است « هرکس ی
از ظن خود شد یار من » بشود .
ب نابر اصول قانون اساسی، رفراندوم احتیاج به مصوبه‌ی دوسوم وکلای مجلس و امضای رهبری دارد .
و این طرح بهرحال در گمرک مجلس و رهبری گیر می‌کند .
ولی اصولا مردم یک شعار محوری دارند که به نظر من اصلا از این شعار نباید تکان خورد و عدول کرد .
این شعار محوری این است که مردم می‌گویند : ما رأی داده‌ایم ، رای ما کو؟ و حاضریم ده دفعه‌ی دیگر هم بیاییم رأی بدهیم، اما دیگر نه زیر نظارت وزارت کشور و شورای نگهبانی که نشان دادند لیاقت برگزار ی انتخابات سالم را ندارند، بلکه زیر نظر سازمان‌های مستقل و متعلق به مردم؛ ولی آرام آرام و صلح‌آمیز حاضریم ده بار دیگر هم بیاییم رأی بدهیم و رئیس جمهور را انتخاب بکنیم .
آقای موسوی به دلیل رأی اکثریت و به دلیل میلیونها نفری که به خیابان آمدند، رئیس جمهور قانونی کشور است.
پیشاپیش این رفراندوم برای غیرمشروع دانستن این حکومت کودتاچ ی انجام شده است .
بنابراین به نظر من بهتر است که آقای خاتمی و روحانیون مبارز لغت‌های جدیدی را مطرح نکنند ، برای این که در اینجا استعداد ب دفهمی و تشتت آراء وجود دارد .
ممکن است کسی مثل من، که چهارسال پیش می‌گفتم رفراندوم در مورد قانون اساسی هم بیآیم و بگویم بله، رفراندوم منظور این است، یا دیگرانی هم منظورهای دیگری را مطرح کنند .
به نظر من نباید از روی شعار محوری جنبش مردم تکان خورد که می‌گویند رأی من را پس بده و حاضریم تجدید انتخابات بکنیم، و
نباید الان چیز دیگری را مطرح کرد .
به نظر می‌رسد این پیشنهاد جدید آقای خاتمی به بخشی از صحبت‌های آقای رفسنجانی در نمازجمعه برمی‌گردد که گفتند طرف‌های مختلف بیایند، صحبت بکنند و در نهایت مردم تصمیم خودشان را بگیرند .
آیا شما هم این برداشت را از سخنان آقای هاشمی دارید ؟
بهترین مکانیسمی که بوسیله‌ی آن می‌شود فهمید مردم چه می‌خواهند، مکانیسم رأی و رأی‌گیری است.
ما دعوایمان سر صندوق رأی است و آشتی‌مان هم از صندوق رأی درمی‌آید .
رأی مردم باید اصالت داشته باشد و رأی مردم است که حرف اول و آخر را می‌زند .
رأی مردم در مکانیسمی به نام انتخابات ریاست جمهوری متبلور بوده و خودش را نشان داده است .
ب نابراین ، وقتی ما خواهان رأی مردم هستیم و حاکمیت صندوق رأی، الان که دعوا بر سر همین صندوق رأی انجام شده است، بهترین کار این است که همین حرفی را تکرار کنیم که مردم پایش کشته دادند و می‌گویند .
یعنی راهی که آقای رفسنجانی هم می‌گوید تا اعتماد به مردم برگردد، این است که یک انتخابات سالم برگزار بشود .
یک انتخابات بی‌غل و غش و بی‌تقلب و بدون کتک و شکنجه و زندان و کودتای نظامی و آدمکشی و دستگیری و اینها انجام بشود .
دویچه‌وله : بعد از این سکوت طولانی که آقای رفسنجانی داشتند، این طور به نظر می‌رسید که ممکن است ایشان هماهنگی‌هایی با رده‌‌های بالا ی
نظام کرده باشند .
ولی روز دوشنبه آقای خامنه‌ای یکبار دیگر تأکید کرد که انتخابات سالم بوده و هر فردی با هر موقعیتی، اگر بخواهد جامعه را به سمت ناامنی سوق بدهد، از نظر ملت ایران انسان منفوری است. در حقیقت این‌گونه القاء کردند که حاکمیت از استحکام کامل برخوردار است و هیچ گونه ناامنی‌ای آن را تهدید نمی‌کند .
آیا آقای رفسنجانی واقعا مقابل شخص اول مملکت قدعلم کرده است ؟
اولا که به نظر من طبق همین تعریف ،
نفر اول منفوربودن ، شخص آقای خامنه‌ای است، برای این که ایشان جامعه را ناامن کرده است .
چه کسی گفته است شب انتخابات با اسلحه بریزند ستاد رقبای انتخاباتی را بگیرند؟ چه کسی گفته است با اسلحه بریزند خبرنگارها را دستگیر کنند، روزنامه‌ها را ببندند ،
اس ام اس را قطع کنند، خبرنگارهای خارجی را بیرون کنند و مردم را در خیابان بکشند؟ عامل اصلی ناامنی و منفور بودن در مقابل ملت ایران، شخص آقای خامنه‌ای، پسر ایشان و دارودسته‌ی ماجراجو ی
اندکی در سپاه پاسداران است که علیه رأی مردم دست به کودتای نظامی زده‌اند .
دماغ آقای خامنه‌ای هنوز باد دارد و ایشان دو کشیده‌ی دیگر از این ملت طلب دارد .
اگر این دو کشیده را بخورد، دیگر این جور برای مردم گردن کلفت ی نمی‌کند و این جور خط و نشان نمی‌کشد .
ایشان
نشان داده است که هنوز صدای مردم را نشنیده و حاضر هم نیست بشنود .
البته با شناختی که من از آقای خامنه‌ای دارم ، ایشان جرأت این کارها را نداشت و هنوز هم ندارد .
ایشان آلت فعل پسرش شده و دارودسته‌ای که برایش جلوه می‌دهند که اعلیحضرت قدر قدرتی است که آن بالا نشسته است، غاف ل
از این که تمام بخش سالم‌و صادق‌ جمهوری اسلامی به صدا درآمده، به فغان درآمده و از اینکه این طور این حکومت و ارکانش را در مقابل مردم قرار داده‌اند ، ناراضی‌ است. به نظر من، این صحبت امروز آقای خامنه‌ا ی
نشان داده است که این یکماه ایشان نخواست صدای ملت را بشنود و دچار وهم و خیال قدرقدرتی‌ست .
ایشان اگر دو کشیده‌ی دیگر از مردم بخورد، به نظر من حالش جا میآید ،
از خواب بیدار می‌شود و دیگر از این حرفها نمی‌زند .
من جواب سوالم را به درستی نگرفتم .
سوال من این بود که با توجه به سخنان اخیر آقای رفسنجانی و سخنان روز دوشنبه‌ی آیت‌الله خامنه‌ای و با توجه به این که در عید مبعث هم برخلاف همیشه آقای رفسنجانی به جای اینکه به دیدن شخص اول مملکت برود و با آیت‌الله خامنه‌ای دیدار بکند، به مشهد رفته، آیا این دو نفر الان دیگر کاملا در مقابل هم ایستاده‌اند ؟
بله !
یعنی در صحبت روز جمعه‌،‌آقای رفسنجانی به روشنی سعی کرد نشان بدهد که میزان، رأی ملت است که این حرف را آقای خمینی هم می‌زد .
سعی کرد به آقای خامنه‌ای هم حالی بکند که حتا پیغمبر خدا هم به حضرت علی که امام اول شیعیان هم هست، می‌گفت اگر مردم تو را قبول نداشته باشند، نمی‌توانی حکومت بکنی .
آقای رفسنجانی در واقع به در می‌گفت که دیوار بشنود .
ایشان حرفش در واقع به آقای خامنه‌ای بود که وقتی مردم قبول نداشته باشند، شما نمی‌توانید ادعا بکنی که حکومت‌ات مشروع است .
این یک مقابله‌ی کاملا جدی است که نه در سطح حرف‌های آقای رفسنجانی و نظریاتی که ایشان می‌گوید، بلکه در سطح متفکرین و علمای اسلامی به طور جد مطرح است و واقعا نظریات امثال آقای مصباح یزدی و شیخ محمد یزدی که معتقدند ولایت فقیه مشروعیتش را از آسمان آورده و
نه از مردم، بسیار قلیل و
اندک و کم فروغ است، حتا در بین علمای حوزه‌ .
شما به عنوان کسی که سالهای نه چندان کمی را در داخل این حاکمیت بودید، فکر می‌کنید در این مقابله کدام طرف واقعا پیرو ز
نهایی خواهد بود ؟
حق با ملت است. در همان سالها در دهه‌ ی اول انقلاب که من افتان و خیزان در داخل حکومت بودم، در همان دوره هم تصور امثال همه‌ی ما این بود که اساس با ملت است و این ملت است که حرف آخر را می‌زند .
آقای خمینی هم حداقل در حرف بارها تأکید می‌کرد که میزان رأی ملت است و خودش هم سعی می‌کرد جایی بایستد که مردم ایستاده‌اند .
آیا الان این میزان از خردگرایی و عقلانیت در حاکمیت وجود دارد که به خواست مردم تن بدهد ؟
حرفهای روز دوشنبه‌ی آقای خامنه‌ا ی
نشان داده است که فعلا هنوز ایشان این عقلانیت را ندارد .
ب نابراین نخیر !
یعنی آقای خامنه‌ای، آقای احمدی‌نژاد، آقای مصباح یزدی که تئوریسین‌شان است و آقای مجتبی خامنه‌ای و آن چند نفر معدودی در سپاه مثل آقای طائب و دیگرانی که دورشان را گرفته‌اند ،
اینها رو به یک ملت اسلحه کشیده‌اند و
نشان داده‌اند که فعلا این عقلانیت را ندارند .

Stars Young and Old
Credit & Copyright : Roth Ritter ( Dark Atmospheres )
Explanation : Galactic or open star clusters are relatively young .
These swarms of stars are born near the plane of the Milky Way , but their numbers steadily dwindle as cluster members are strewn through the Galaxy by gravitational interactions .
This bright open cluster , known as M46 , is around 300 million years young and still contains a few hundred stars within its span of 30 light - years or so .
Located about 5,000 light - years away toward the constellation Puppis , M46 also seems to contain a contradiction to its youthful status .
In the lovely starscape , the colorful , circular patch just below the center of M46 ( also inset at upper left ) is the planetary nebula NGC 2438 .
Planetary nebulae are a brief , final phase in the life of a solar - type star a few billion years old whose central reservoir of hydrogen fuel has been exhausted .
In fact , old NGC 2438 is estimated to be only 3,000 light - years distant and moves at a different speed than M46 cluster members .
It likely represents a foreground object , only by chance appearing along our line - of - sight to young M46 .
( Or " Why the solution has been obvious from the start . " )
If my hypothesis is correct , that Perl 5's current development process is unsustainable , in part because synchronizing dual - lived Perl 5 modules with the core is a fool 's game , there 's one obvious way to get Perl 5 on regular release schedule and add important features that just about every other serious programming language supports .
Most of the pieces are already in place .
The success of the CPAN and its ecosystem already demonstrates that this strategy can work , as does the presence of virtual dependencies in packaging systems for free operating system distributions .
The idea is n't new at all , but you may not have heard it expressed this way : to solve ( some of ) Perl 5's maintenance problems with coordinating the stable release schedule of dozens of modules and distributions maintained outside of the core , stop coordinating the stable release schedules of dozens of modules and distributions maintained outside of the core .
Remove dual - lived modules from the core .
( Update : Leave those modules necessary to bootstrap a full CPAN installer , of course . )
What replaces them ?
If the underling premise of modern Perl and enlightened Perl is correct -- that the world 's best and most effective Perl programmers take full advantage of the CPAN to make up for missing language features , to improve their productivity , and because solving a problem once and for all and sharing it is the ultimate expression of laziness , impatience , and hubris -- then the problem in the Perl world is that we do n't do this enough .
To bring up a repeated example , releasing software regularly can be difficult .
The best way I know to make it easy to release software every month is to release it every month .
If it 's difficult to release your software every month , you have a strong motivation to make it easy .
The Perl world has n't made it sufficiently easy to find , install , maintain , and upgrade non -core code .
Projects such as local : : lib , CP5.6.2AN , and CPAN Testers go a long way .
They do n't provide everything , but the tools and knowledge are present to add the next few necessary features .
Please note that all of these features depend on CPAN remaining an uploading service and a mirroring / distribution service .
CPAN itself does n't need to change .
CPAN works just fine for these purposes : especially as its simplicity has allowed a solar system of related services and tools to form around the shining star that is the CPAN distribution service .
The benefit of removing modules from the core are simple and compelling :
There is less code for p5p to maintain .
Releases of modules can occur on their own schedules ; releases of the core can occur on its own schedule .
Bug reports , feature requests , and patches will not as easily get lost in the cracks between the maintainer 's preferred communications medium and the p5 p list .
Crufty old modules superseded long ago by something more decent will lose whatever patina they had from their " Of course they 're core modules !
This means we should use them ! " status .
Places of work which refuse to vet or install non-core modules will be revealed as the soul - sucking portals of hate that they are and all right - minded people will ignore them .
( The final reason is conjecture , but very satisfying to imagine . )
For this to work , the Perl community must :
Produce a graph of modules and their dependencies in a form consumable by other services .
David Cantrell 's CPAN Deps ( link not provided in deference to his bandwidth and CPU resources ) is a great start .
Exploit the CPAN testing reports to identify potential changes in leaf nodes of the graph due to upedge changes .
Revise the testing strategy ( and its reporting ) to alert upedge authors of the effects of changes on downedge authors and vice versa .
Publish metadata on the best - possible recommendation of versions for modules along a graph edge .
That is , if you want to install Catalyst on FreeBSD 7.0 , you may want Scalar : : Util x.y , Test : : Simple x.y , and Moose x.y .
Given this metadata , provide a single , installable ( source ) tarball which bundles all of the nodes of a graph edge .
This is all feasible , if the Perl community has the will to do so .
Some may object that the final two steps may occasionally fail .
That 's right .
You can't solve that problem -- not completely .
You can try , but you will fail .
That does n't mean you should n't try .
It only means that you 're a fool for designing a process that can't cope with the occasional upgrade glitch .
Others may object that this does not address the education or the advocacy problem of teaching Perl novices to look for these bundles or system administrations that they 're hateful little trolls unless they support these bundles on their system .
Nor does it address the technical problem that occasionally plagues installing CPAN modules .
Those are solutions for a different post .
One final objection is " What 's the point ? " or " The Perl 5 release schedule works for me ! " or " But you ought to support these bundles for eight to ten years . "
Those are fine opinions , if wrong , for one simple reason .
The right way to write better software is never to go more slowly .
Note : Every week , SE intern Chichi Wang will be discussing some aspect of Asian cookery , with an emphasis on the traditional , underappreciated , or misunderstood elements thereof .
" While I 'm amenable to the idea that somewhere out there , someone is baking one mean lasagna with tofu layered in the middle , I 'm willing to bet that the best tofu dishes are the traditional ones . "
I have a sneaking suspicion about the state of tofu in this country .
I suspect that too many people are using tofu in the same way that they would a raw brined cheese like feta , sprinkled sparsely in salads , or like plain white yogurt in a smoothie .
In the homes of well - meaning friends who know of my love of soy , I 've been served baked tofu , desiccated like jerky and then slathered in dark soy sauce .
And too many times I 've been witness to a friend mixing it haphazardly into scrambled eggs to in order to boost the nutritional content of the dish .
I would like to say that these practices are merely exceptions , but over the years my sample group has only grown larger and confirmed my initial suspicions .
This informal fact - finding mission has arisen largely out of my incessant need to know what other people are eating and cooking for themselves .
I am the person at the dinner party who asks if I can take a look inside your refrigerator and your cupboards ; if given the chance , I will steer any conversation towards the topic of what you do n't like to eat .
It 's a strange perversion , I know , to be so nosy about these things , but I like to think that over the years I 've developed a certain finesse in my approach .
This past weekend , for instance , I had the happy occasion to spend the Fourth of July with a former professor of mine whose parents live on Long Island .
It was a relaxing day , filled with the sort of interesting , wonderfully desultory conversations that used to take place during his office hours .
Skillfully maneuvering the talk towards the topic of food , I asked my professor how he used tofu at home .
" Well , " he began , " sometimes I 'll cut it up and toss it in a salad with olives and tomatoes , with maybe a little feta as well .
And it 's good crumbled in lasagna , I suppose . "
A silence followed as I struggled to find the right words to express my confusion .
" And I do n't like the soft tofu , only the firm , " he added .
This is my favorite professor , the man I trusted to guide me through my studies and the reason I can put together a decent essay .
He 's erudite , inquisitive , and the type of person who likes to talk about the foundations of knowledge ... and he puts tofu in his lasagna .
So what am I trying to say here ?
Certainly , I want to express my disapproval over putting tofu in traditional Italian meals , but I do n't want to go as far as saying that tofu can never be used in Western applications of cooking .
Cuisines are shaped by ever - evolving influences , and sometimes it takes the clash of two very different traditions to produce a truly novel dish .
Yet in all my tofu-eating years , I 've never been as happy eating tofu as I am when the recipe is firmly anchored in one particular Asian cuisine , be it Chinese , Japanese , or Korean .
Under the fiery heat of a wok , a Chinese preparation of tofu can be rapid yet flavorful ; the tofu is enriched by the taste of the protein or vegetables in the stir - fry , yet it retains the flavor of soy .
Both the Chinese and the Japanese offer a dizzying array of soy and tofu products , some of which are reconstituted in water and others that are used to great effect in simmered dishes .
And when I have a cold , there 's nothing more soothing than my own pot of silken Korean tofu , simmered in a spicy broth .
The soup is a tiny cauldron of bubbling soup and tofu , thickened at the very end with a raw egg cracked directly into the bowl .
So while I 'm amenable to the idea that somewhere out there , someone is baking one mean lasagna with tofu layered in the middle , I 'm willing to bet that the best tofu dishes are the traditional ones .
Dengaku , a Japanese method in which a miso - laden sauce is brushed onto various grilled foods , is traditionally used to treat cotton tofu , the firm type favored by my professor and many others .

June 2008 Esoteric A - 100 Integrated Amplifier by Uday Reddy
" A special performance by a special piece of audio equipment . "
Review Summary Sound
Where to begin ?
" Right away , I noticed that all recordings , regardless of genre , had increased warmth to them .
Regardless of whether the recording came from the studio or was live , the ebb and flow of the music was so natural that it was as if I had been transported to the musical event and the musicians were performing in front of me . "
" While treble and midrange reproduction were excellent , bass reproduction was simply outstanding . "
" Despite being a modestly powered integrated , the A - 100 was not at all shy about rocking out . "
" This was one dead - quiet integrated amp ! " Features
" The A - 100 is rated at 45 Wpc , has two 12AT7 , four 12AU7 and four KT88 vacuum tubes , and uses a number of proprietary features to facilitate its stated goal , one of the most important being the variable self - bias system .
This advanced active biasing circuit is stated to compensate in active fashion for the bias voltage supplied to the output stage , making the A - 100 the ultimate in ' set it and forget it ' technology and your volt / ohm meter obsolete . "
Use " Theres one additional RCA input for use if the A - 100 is paired with a preamplifier or a digital source with its own volume control .
A switch below the inputs allows for switching between line in and direct in . "
Value " I have to admit that the A - 100 simply sounds better than my Jeff Rowland Concentra , and in ways that a solid - state integrated amp should beat one that uses tubes .
Of course , there is an immense difference in price , but I admit that it 's easy to hear why the A - 100 costs so much more than the Concentra . "
Tubes versus solid state :
This age - old debate wont end anytime soon .
Nor should it .
Each technology has its pros and cons , and the choice of either one or the other , like most things , is up to the person making it .
What about me ?
Initially , when I was first putting together my current system , I was leaning toward buying a tube or hybrid integrated amplifier , but I ended up buying a Jeff Rowland Concentra because I wanted the power , reliability and bass control of a solid - state amplifier while still enjoying the benefits of the tube - like sound that Jeff Rowlands products are famous for .
Not having to deal with tube biasing and tube replacement certainly made the decision easier .
Besides , knowing my own inclinations , I would have gotten into tube rolling , and therein surely lies the path to madness .
Given all of this , why then am I reviewing an almost - $ 20,000 tube integrated amp ?
Curiosity , mostly .
When I bought my Concentra , I only compared it to other solid - state integrateds and this review would give me an opportunity to compare and contrast , to determine what , if anything , Id given up in terms of tonal beauty and resolution .
My previous experiences with tube integrated amps were a mixed bag ; push - pull designs were generally enjoyable , but SETs were too euphonically rich for my tastes with a sound that made it seem that the notes themselves were covered in some sort of syrupy sonic goo .
The A - 100 ( $ 19,000 USD ) is from Esoterics MSW Amplifier Series , a new product line from Esoterics Master Sound Works , which has the stated goal of reproducing the intricacies and sonic beauty contained on the master tape .
The A -100 is rated at 45 Wpc , has two 12AT7 , four 12AU7 and four KT88 vacuum tubes , and uses a number of proprietary features to facilitate its stated goal , one of the most important being the variable self - bias system .
This advanced active biasing circuit is stated to compensate in active fashion for the bias voltage supplied to the output stage , making the A - 100 the ultimate in " set it and forget it " technology and your volt / ohm meter obsolete .
Other features include a zero voltage control system that acts to stabilize the cathode follower DC output level , keeping stable the operation of the directly coupled circuit components .
Additionally , the A - 100 also has custom output transformers , and all stages , apart from the KT88 stages , are powered by fully stabilized power supplies .
Frequency response is quoted as 20 Hz - 60k Hz .
The signal - to - noise ratio is said to be greater than 98dB .
The A -100 is one massive and robustly designed component .
The outer panels are of thick , non-resonant aerospace - grade aluminum .
The chassis is extremely rigid , with the power supply and the transformers residing in the center of the chassis , surrounded by the circuitry to ensure isolation from vibration and resonance .
The three self - leveling isolation feet on the bottom panel of the amp further aid in control of vibration .
Monolithic yet handsome in a chunky sort of way , the A - 100 takes up a lot of real estate .
Although its footprint is similar to my Concentras , its almost twice as high and twice as heavy .
Dimensionally , the A - 100 measures 15 1/16 " W x 9 7/8 " H x 19 1/16 " D and weighs in at 88 pounds .
There are no rack - mounting handles , and although I was able to lift the A - 100 out of its box with a quick clean and jerk , I wouldnt recommend it .
Get a buddy to help you .
A centrally placed motorized volume knob dominates the subtly sculpted front panel .
Above this are five buttons for choosing among three single - ended RCA inputs and one balanced XLR input , plus one button for muting .
Below the volume knob is the power button , which initially glows red when the A - 100 is powering up but then glows blue once the amplifier section is up to its proper operating temperature .
The same pleasing blue color indicates which input button is in use and also if the muting is on .
The A -100 is equipped with a protection circuit that activates if its driven into overload .
When the protection circuit has been activated , the power button glows red until the amp is switched off and allowed to recover .
Despite driving the amp at high output levels , not once did the protection circuit activate for me .
The last item on the front panel is a sensor for the supplied remote control , which allows for input selection , muting and volume control .
The remote is illuminated and is also compatible with Esoterics digital integrated amplifiers and can control the functions of the company 's disc players , with the exception of the P - 01/ D- 01 transport and DAC .
The rear panel has three WBT RCA inputs and one XLR input for use with line - level sources .
Theres one additional RCA input for use if the A - 100 is paired with a preamplifier or a digital source with its own volume control .
A switch below the inputs allows for switching between line in and direct in .
Although my Wadia 830 CD player has a digital volume control , Ive never used it , and since I didnt have an audiophile - grade RCA - terminated interconnect handy , I wasnt able to assess this particular feature .
Connection to the speakers is via one of three pairs of vertically arrayed , gold - plated , plastic - shrouded WBT Nextgen binding posts , which are suitable for bare wire , spade lugs , and banana plugs .
The middle and lower posts are for connecting speakers rated as a 4 - ohm load and the upper and lower posts are for connecting 8 - ohm ( and higher ) speakers .
Ive heard others complain about these posts , but for the life of me I cant understand why .
They were very easy to use , with my spade lugs slotting right in , with a snug fit once the post was tightened .
The post can be tightened manually with no need for a post wrench and theres no risk of over - tightening .
Too bad all amps dont come equipped with them .
Although the left lower corner of the A - 100's rear panel has a rhodium - plated socket for an aftermarket power cord , Esoteric recommends using the supplied power cord , stating that use of other power cords may result in fire or electric shock .
The last item on the rear panel is a bias switch at the top for setting the bias current for the KT88 output tubes .
There are two modes -- A and B , with B being the standard setting .
According to Esoteric , the A mode has a slightly reduced bias voltage , which may result in a slightly finer sound with enhanced detail suitable for classical music , but in non-blind and blind testing , I could not appreciate any difference between the two settings and left the amp in B mode for the duration of the review .
The top panel fastens to the sides of the chassis with recessed hex bolts and is vented on the top surface and the sides .
The complement of tubes can be seen glowing faintly within , but even though the top panel is removable , the tubes are not to be replaced by the user ( no tube rolling ! ) , as special measurements are necessary to adjust the tubes .
Standing over the amp , I could feel the heat radiating out of the top , but despite prolonged use of the A - 100 , even at high output levels , its top plate never became too hot to touch , nor did my listening room become too warm .
Warm and fuzzy -- not After unpacking the A - 100 , I immediately connected my source and speakers .
I was eager to hear how it all sounded , and as soon as the power button light began to glow blue , I started my listening .
I was a bit too eager , I guess , as the sound at first was thin and pinched and the soundstage was compressed .
After a half an hour had elapsed and the amp had a chance to really warm up , I began to listen again with much better results and no further change in the quality of sound , despite the A - 100's not having been broken in prior to my receiving it .

This was one dead - quiet integrated amp !
Whenever I connect a new amp into my system , I like to turn up the volume with no source playing in order to see at what level the hiss will be audible from my listening position .
I turned the A - 100 waaaaay up and was unable to detect any hiss at all until I nearly hit the maximum volume .
Wow !
Right away , I noticed that all recordings , regardless of genre , had increased warmth to them .
Not surprising , you say .
What was surprising , though , was on how many different levels this warmth had an effect on the music .
Regardless of whether the recording came from the studio or was live , the ebb and flow of the music was so natural that it was as if I had been transported to the musical event and the musicians were performing in front of me .
The soundstage was so wide and deep that it overcame the limitations of my current ( and much compromised ) listening room .
More than anything , this warmth added a dimension to the music that allowed an accurate , physical re-creation of the venue that Ive never experienced before .
Im a sucker for a great jazz piano trio , but the upper registers of some of these recordings can sometimes sound hard .
The added warmth that the A - 100 brought to piano went a long way to ameliorating that effect .
On Keith Jarretts My Foolish Heart [ ECM 2021 / 22 ] , this quality was superbly demonstrated , as Jarrett displayed a delicate touch on the title track , with his right hand conveying the quiet elegance of the tune .
If you re thinking that this warmth burnished the tone so much that fine detail was obscured and the treble and midrange were colored , think again .
Sonic images were holographic and finely rendered with the blackest of backgrounds , and even familiar recordings had previously subtle elements that were more fully revealed .
The soft brush strokes that James Cobb employed on " Blue in Green " from Miles Daviss seminal Kind of Blue [ Columbia / Legacy CK64935 ] sounded crisp and snappy , with no masking of detail .
No doubt the low noise floor of the A - 100 contributed to this sonic realism .
Acoustic music , particularly jazz and classical , is usually well engineered and recorded , but amplified music , especially pop and rock 'n ' roll can be hit or miss -- mostly miss .
One exceptionally fine recording , Govt Mules eponymous debut record [ Relativity 88561-1515 - 2 ] , was recorded mostly in the studio with minimal overdubbing , and the A - 100 allowed the band 's brand of spooky , gothic , blues - inflected rock to flow through my speakers with all its intensity intact .
Soundstage width was superb , with sonic images so stable that I felt as if I was in the studio with the band .
Despite being a modestly powered integrated , the A - 100 was not at all shy about rocking out .
On the Govt Mule disc and Peter Framptons Frampton Comes Alive [ A& M 069 490 563-2 ] , I was able to drive my speakers to almost concert level with commensurate visceral impact and no sense of strain .
The A -100 had a seemingly endless reserve of power and never felt as if it was going to run out of juice , even though its rated power output was under 50 watts .
While treble and midrange reproduction were excellent , bass reproduction was simply outstanding .
One weakness of tube - powered amps has been soft or flabby bass .
The A -100 disproved that notion convincingly with solid control of my speakers woofers .
On the King Crimson Songbook Volume One by the Crimson Jazz Trio [ Voiceprint VP373CD ] , both bass guitar and bass drum were forceful and didnt get lost in the mix .
On " 21st Century Schizoid Man , " Tim Landers  fretless bass lines were tight , tuneful and resonant with such deep extension that they recalibrated my expectations of the bass reproduction that my Wilson Audio Sophia loudspeakers were capable of .
Bass drums can often be subtle , with the exception of those heard in solos , but on " Schizoid , " Ian Wallaces bass drum had the kind of taut , punchy , propulsive surge that so rarely is achieved .
And so it went with my listening , the A - 100 not only contradicting its tube - based circuitry but also readjusting my understanding of my system and reproduction as a whole .
This was a special performance by a special piece of audio equipment .
Tubes vs. tube - like solid state
In some ways the A - 100 and my Jeff Rowland Concentra ( $ 5600 when available ) are evenly matched .
Both deliver their power -- 100 Wpc in the Concentra 's case -- with ease and no sense of strain .
With both integrated amps , the treble is grain - free and the midrange is free from colorations .
Where its absolutely no contest , however , is the A - 100s dead - quiet noise floor , superior bass control and -- damn -- that magical vacuum - tube warmth that makes the music seem more alive .
Ive always felt the Concentra was a fairly neutral - sounding integrated with a slight bias to warmth and , compared to others that Ive heard , this is an accurate assessment .
But in comparison to the A - 100 , it sounds more tonally cool .
Some may argue that the A - 100s warmth is an artifact that adds coloration to the sound , but in listening to it , Ive come to the conclusion that this warmth returns a vital aspect of the music -- its soul .
While I am still somewhat ambivalent about tubes -- adding them to my life , that is -- I have to admit that the A - 100 simply sounds better than my Jeff Rowland Concentra , and in ways that a solid - state integrated amp should beat one that uses tubes .
Of course , there is an immense difference in price , but I admit that it 's easy to hear why the A - 100 costs so much more than the Concentra .
Im gonna miss her For me , the Esoteric A - 100 was a perception - altering , paradigm - shifting component .
When I first began putting together my system , I spent as much money as I could possibly afford , confident that I would have to spend considerably more money for only incremental improvement in resolution and overall sound quality .
Was I ever wrong -- except for the money part .
No , I havent had a crisis of confidence , and I m not about to start tossing out components and starting from scratch , but , believe me , the A - 100 is so good that if I had the scratch , I d certainly consider buying it .
But at almost $ 20,000 , the A - 100 is like that smart , funny , vivacious and beautiful woman across the room -- out of reach for most .
As for Esoterics stated goal of capturing the beauty on the master tape , Id say its " mission accomplished " with the A - 100 .

Yahoo will do perfectly fine even if it does n't strike any type of deal with Microsoft , Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz said Wednesday .
There is excessive interest in whether the two companies will partner , and although some benefits could come from a tie - up , Yahoo will succeed regardless , she said .
" Yahoo does n't have to do anything with Microsoft about anything , " she said , speaking at the Bank of America and Merrill Lynch 2009 U.S. Technology Conference .
" Yahoo has a bright , bright future , probably cleaner and simpler without even thinking of any Microsoft connections , " said Bartz , who answered questions from a financial analyst and from people in the audience .
" We 'd be better off if we had never heard the word Microsoft , " Bartz added .
Speculation about mergers or other deals started after Microsoft 's unsolicited acquisition offer early in 2008 .
Bartz answered several questions about Yahoo and Microsoft , and acknowledged that a search partnership would help Yahoo better compete against Google by providing more scale and reducing some operating costs .
She also said that it would be a good idea for Yahoo to buy Microsoft 's Internet unit , or parts of it , but that such a deal would never pass antitrust review in the U.S. , particularly if it involved Yahoo acquiring Microsoft 's webmail and instant messaging services .
Bartz also indicated that Microsoft 's strategy on the Internet is very different from Yahoo's .
Microsoft has " Google envy " and feels pressured to put up a stronger fight in the Internet market in order to curb Google 's " money machine , " which allows Google to make advances against Microsoft in office and communication software , she said .
Yahoo , on the other hand , is entirely focused on the Internet .
Google 's dominance in search is due more to its strong brand in the space , which has created a habit among users , and to the scale it has amassed , than to technical superiority , she said .
Yahoo's search result relevance is better than Google 's , she said .
About 98 percent of queries on Yahoo's search engine are made by people who are already on a Yahoo site , so the key to growing the company 's search usage is to attract more people to Yahoo Web properties , she said .
Yahoo is n't a search company , but rather a broader provider of useful online services and content , she added .
After five months as CEO , Bartz is exhilarated and excited about the future of the company , which she said had been held back by a management structure that made it difficult to act quickly .
" Anything you can do in three steps , Yahoo does it in 22 , " she said .
The argument that Yahoo missed the boat on social networking and video is flawed because both areas are still in their infancy , and Yahoo approaches them differently by attempting to use those technologies in the context of its Web sites .
Thus , Yahoo's interest is to enrich existing services with video and social features rather than go head - to - head against Facebook or Twitter in social networking or YouTube and Hulu in video sharing and broadcasting .
While Yahoo does a good job assisting chief marketing officers with the creative part of their advertising campaigns , it is horrible at making it easy for marketers to purchase ads , she said .
" We have to take a lot of that friction out " of buying online ads , she said .
Another key area for Yahoo is mobile , and the emphasis now is on attracting users .
" Monetization is the last thing on my mind .
I want the audience .
You get the audience and you get the money , " she said .
T he ending was anticlimactic .
On Monday evening , just as Canadians were sitting down to dinner , Parliament quietly enacted one of Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's most controversial pieces of legislation .
The Liberals joined forces with the Conservatives to pass Canada 's first mandatory minimum jail sentences for individuals convicted of drug dealing .
The vote was lopsided : 195 to 54 .
But it was a superficial consensus .
MPs approved the bill without any empirical evidence that harsh sentencing laws reduce drug crime .
They endorsed the policy without any estimate of how much it will cost to jail thousands of marijuana growers and street pushers .
They changed the law without any plan to contain the spread of AIDS , hepatitis C and other drug - related diseases in the prison system .
The Liberals dared not look soft on crime .
The New Democrats and Bloc Québécois were outnumbered .
It was a classic case of polls trumping facts .
Justice Minister Rob Nicholson admitted as much last month when he appeared before the Commons justice committee .
Challenged to provide proof from any country in the world that mandatory jail time deters drug use or improves public safety , he responded : " I can tell you , there is support for this bill from many ordinary Canadians who are quite concerned about drug abuse . "
He is right about that .
Surveys consistently show that 70 to 75 per cent of Canadians support mandatory prison sentences for drug dealers .
But he was n't asked how popular the policy was .
He was asked for concrete information and he provided none : no research documenting the benefits of harsh drug sentencing laws , no jurisdiction where they 'd cut crime .
In fact , most studies – including two by the federal justice department in the last seven years – have concluded that mandatory minimum sentences do n't work .
Most experts , including 13 of the 16 who appeared before the committee , recommended that the government scrap the policy .
New York state , which pioneered mandatory sentencing for drug crimes in 1973 , has decided to repeal its tough penalties .
Michigan , Connecticut , Iowa , Kansas , Louisiana , New Jersey and North Carolina are rethinking their mandatory minimum drug sentences .
Yet Ottawa is embarking on its own war on drugs .
Under the newly amended Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , judges will be required to impose the following sentences :
A minimum prison term of one year for selling marijuana as part of an organized criminal gang or when a weapon is involved .
A minimum of two years in jail for selling hard drugs such as cocaine , heroin or methamphetamine to young people .
A minimum of six months behind bars for growing five to 200 marijuana plants without a licence and two years for cultivating at least 500 plants .
According to these rules , a high - school student who got hooked on crystal meth and became a supplier would face two years in jail .
A single mom who grew a few cannabis plants to supplement her income could be incarcerated for six months .
The bill does give judges some latitude to divert non-violent offenders with substance abuse problems to one of six national drug treatment courts .
But most drug dealers will simply be locked up .
The government has not explained why it is heading down the same expensive path the Americans are now abandoning .
It has not shown how jailing drug pushers for a year or two will choke off supply lines or weaken the criminal gangs .
And it has n't told Canadians what will happen when prison - hardened traffickers return to their communities .
In all likelihood , Harper wo n't pay a political price .
By the time taxpayers realize his policy is ineffective and unaffordable , he will have moved on .

Carol Goar 's column appears Monday , Wednesday and Friday .

THAT First 100 Days hoopla seems like a century ago .
The countless report cards it engendered are already obsolete .
The real story begins now .
With Iran , universal health care , energy reform and the economic recovery all on the line , the still - new , still - popular president ’s true tests are about to come .
Here ’s one thing Barack Obama does not have to worry about : the opposition .
Approval ratings for Republicans hit an all - time low last week in both the New York Times / CBS News and Wall Street Journal / NBC News polls .
That ’s what happens when a party ’s most creative innovations are novel twists on old - fashioned sex scandals .
Just when you thought the G.O.P. could never match the high bar set by Larry Craig ’s men ’s room toe - tapping , along came Senator John Ensign of Nevada , an ostentatiously pious born - again Christian whose ecumenical outreach drove him to engineer political jobs for his mistress , her cuckolded husband and the couple ’s son .
At least it can no longer be said that the Republicans have no plan for putting Americans back to work .
But as ever , the lack of an adversary with gravitas is a double - edged sword for Obama .
It tempts him to be cocky and to coast .
That ’s a rare flaw in a president whose temperament , smarts and judgment remain impressive .
Yet it is not insignificant .
Though we do n’t know how Obama will fare on all the challenges he faces this summer , last week ’s big rollout of his financial reform package was a big punt , an accommodation to the status quo .
Given that the economy remains the country ’s paramount concern  and that all new polling finds that most Americans still think it ’s dire  this timid response was a lost opportunity .
It violated the Rahm Emanuel dictum that “ you never want a serious crisis to go to waste ” and could yet prompt a serious political backlash .
A tip - off to what was coming appeared in a Washington Post op - ed article that the administration ’s two financial gurus , Lawrence Summers and Timothy Geithner , wrote to preview their plan .
“ Some people will say that this is not the time to debate the future of financial regulation , that this debate should wait until the crisis is fully behind us , ” they wrote by way of congratulating themselves on taking charge .
Afrika , a peaceful safari - type game available exclusively for the PlayStation 3 , is finally making its way over to North America this coming August .
But it wo n’t be exactly the same game as the one that was released back in August of last year .
When Afrika was released in Asia , as importers are well aware it already had an English language track .
When asked if this new version is going to use the same language track , Natsume ’s Vice President of Operations Graham Markay had this to say :
“ … Afrika carries three licenses and it ’s going to carry three licenses in the US which are National Geographic , Sony cameras , and Suzuki automobiles .
Those three licenses are in the game so National Geographic was involved with the Japanese and Asian release …
We ’re just tweaking lines here and there .
Were trying to make a few modifications to the game to fit the US market better . ”
So it ’ll have effectively the same language and equipment .
Okay , so what about actual modifications to the core game ?
“ First and foremost there is going to be a trophy system , which was n’t in the Asian release or Japanese release .
There have been other suggestions from us and other parties .
So , we ’ve been working with Rhino Soft and Sony now to tweak it .
Obviously , that ’s not the final version out there so we ’re trying to see what we can do to help make it a touch better . ”
Yes , trophies will be in this title !
What does this mean for importers ?
Who knows .
If an update for the Asian version is announced , expect to see it here !
In the meantime , look out for this game when it hits store shelves in August !

BUFFALO , N.Y. , June 30 ( UPI ) -- U.S. researchers find a placebo effect , not in children taking the medication for attention deficit - hyperactive disorder , but in the adults in their lives .
The review of existing studies evaluating whether placebos produce significant changes in children with ADHD -- published in the Journal of Development & Behavioral Pediatrics -- suggests teachers , parents and other adults tend to view and treat more favorably children who they think are receiving medication , whether or not medication is actually involved .

The University at Buffalo researchers define a placebo effect as a positive change in symptoms or behavior when a patient receives a " fake " medication or procedure .
Belief in the medicine may become the medicine .
" We speculate that the perception that a child is receiving ADHD medication may bring about a shift in attitude in a teacher or caregiver .
They may have a more positive view of the child , which could create a better relationship , " review leader Daniel Waschbusch says in a statement .
" If teachers treat children more positively if they think they are on medication , that is a good thing .
But if the child 's medication is increased because caregivers think it is effective , that may not be a good thing . "
Every crisis comes to an end — and , bleak as things seem now , the current economic crisis too shall pass .
But no crisis , especially one of this severity , recedes without leaving a legacy .
And among this one ’s legacies will be a worldwide battle over ideas — over what kind of economic system is likely to deliver the greatest benefit to the most people .
Nowhere is that battle raging more hotly than in the Third World , among the 80 percent of the world ’s population that lives in Asia , Latin America , and Africa , 1.4 billion of whom subsist on less than $ 1.25 a day .
In America , calling someone a socialist may be nothing more than a cheap shot .
In much of the world , however , the battle between capitalism and socialism — or at least something that many Americans would label as socialism — still rages .
While there may be no winners in the current economic crisis , there are losers , and among the big losers is support for American - style capitalism .
This has consequences we ’ll be living with for a long time to come .

The fall of the Berlin Wall , in 1989 , marked the end of Communism as a viable idea .
Yes , the problems with Communism had been manifest for decades .
But after 1989 it was hard for anyone to say a word in its defense .
For a while , it seemed that the defeat of Communism meant the sure victory of capitalism , particularly in its American form .
Francis Fukuyama went as far as to proclaim “ the end of history , ” defining democratic market capitalism as the final stage of social development , and declaring that all humanity was now heading in this direction .
In truth , historians will mark the 20 years since 1989 as the short period of American triumphalism .
With the collapse of great banks and financial houses , and the ensuing economic turmoil and chaotic attempts at rescue , that period is over .
So , too , is the debate over “ market fundamentalism , ” the notion that unfettered markets , all by themselves , can ensure economic prosperity and growth .
Today only the deluded would argue that markets are self - correcting or that we can rely on the self - interested behavior of market participants to guarantee that everything works honestly and properly .
The economic debate takes on particular potency in the developing world .
Although we in the West tend to forget , 190 years ago one - third of the world ’s gross domestic product was in China .
But then , rather suddenly , colonial exploitation and unfair trade agreements , combined with a technological revolution in Europe and America , left the developing countries far behind , to the point where , by 1950 , China ’s economy constituted less than 5 percent of the world ’s G.D.P .
In the mid–19th century the United Kingdom and France actually waged a war to open China to global trade .
This was the Second Opium War , so named because the West had little of value to sell to China other than drugs , which it had been dumping into Chinese markets , with the collateral effect of causing widespread addiction .
It was an early attempt by the West to correct a balance - of - payments problem .

Because Bristol ’s own philosophy seems , at minimum , tentative , it ’s hard to tell whether she believes that cheerleading for abstinence should be coupled with education about birth control methods .
She and Levi used condoms , except when they did n’t .
Her mom has said in the past that she opposes “ explicit ” sex education , which kind of sounds like ... sex education .
And while encouraging kids to wait is obviously fine , the evidence is pretty clear that abstinence education is worse than useless .
Texas , where virtually all the schools teach abstinence and abstinence alone , is a teen pregnancy disaster zone .
“ It ’s had one of the highest rates for as long as I can remember , ” said David Wiley , a professor of health education at Texas State University .
Bristol appeared Wednesday at Event to Prevent , a teen town hall , during which she said very little except to assure her audience that having a baby is no picnic .
( “ You have so much responsibility .
It ’s just hard work all the time . ” )
It ’s hard not to suspect that for her , being the anti-pregnancy ambassador is just a good excuse to get out of Wasilla .
But where were her parents ?
Her mom ought to know by now that the only way to protect your family from becoming tabloid fodder is to make it clear to the media that the kids are absolutely , totally off limits .
You ca n’t put them on network TV one day and then complain the next when a reporter asks whether the baby ’s other grandmother is still facing drug charges .
“ We contacted the governor ’s office , and the next thing we knew Todd Palin was on the phone and said Bristol wanted to talk , ” Cole said , explaining how his ambassador had been recruited .
And indeed , there was Todd , beaming as his beautiful daughter stood in front of about 50 shrieking photographers , smiling a fixed smile .
We have seen so many bad plans about breaching the public - private divide lately .

You could probably get 51 percent of the voters to say they would rather have Vlad the Impaler than David Paterson .
Or at least 30 . )
But when a teenager goes out on this kind of mission , you have to wonder where her parents ’ heads were .

Transit Service Shrinking ?
Get Ready for the Rise of the Dollar Van .
Dollar Van Demos , the unlikely union of transportation needs and musical dreams that has entranced New York bloggers , is giving private transit operators in Brooklyn and Queens some of the best press they ’ve ever received .
But that is n’t the only reason it ’s worth taking a fresh look at dollar vans .
If the state legislature ca n’t avert the MTA ’s doomsday scenario , the vans may soon see a surge in ridership — perhaps big enough to launch a few recording careers .
Dollar vans are the unmarked and often unregulated 15 - passenger vehicles that cruise Flatbush and Utica Avenues in Brooklyn , Jamaica Avenue in Queens , and other outer - borough thoroughfares picking up bus passengers and commuters .
Service cuts and fare hikes would make their routes increasingly attractive to transit riders .
While that ’s a convenient fail - safe for residents of the transit - poor neighborhoods that dollar vans serve , it ’s problematic for the MTA and potentially dangerous for passengers .
It stands to reason that many dollar van trips ( now priced at $ 1.50 or $ 2.00 ) would be New York City Transit trips if riders were satisfied with the level of service provided by area buses , so some trips lost to dollar vans not only represent dissatisfied transit customers , but also lost fare - box revenue at a time when the MTA needs every cent .
Furthermore , because many dollar vans are unlicensed and unregulated , and thus uninsured to operate as livery vehicles , passengers can expect little recourse in the event of a crash and little consistency from van to van and driver to driver .
Both the NYPD and the TLC are responsible for oversight of dollar vans but enforcement that would prevent illegal vans from operating and legal vans from poaching MTA passengers from bus stops has been spotty at best , according to City Council Transportation Chair John Liu .
The 63rd Precinct , which covers Mill Basin and Marine Park in Brooklyn — neighborhoods favored by dollar van drivers looking to avoid traffic on Flatbush Avenue — issued 49 moving violation tickets and 48 TLC tickets to the operators of legal dollar vans and impounded 25 illegal vans between June and October of 2008 .
Still , that ’s just a drop in the bucket .
In 1999 , the New York Times estimated that there were between 2400 and 5000 dollar vans operating in New York City , a number that has no doubt fluctuated in recent years , but still represents a sizable fleet of private transit vehicles .
With commuters tightening their belts and MTA fare hikes and service cuts potentially on the way , this number may very well skyrocket , and what has long been a cottage industry loose and nimble enough to launch gimmicks like Dollar Van Demos could become an increasingly crucial part of the transportation network , for better and for worse .
For obvious reasons , it ’s refreshing to see the steps that a small , privately owned transportation company will take to draw and please passengers .
But for equally obvious reasons , it ’s alarming to think that transit riders may have to rely more and more on an unregulated industry to get around their city .

Britain's first ' Safe Text ' street has been created complete with padded lampposts to protect millions of mobile phone users from getting hurt in street accidents while walking and texting .
Around one in ten careless Brits has suffered a " walk 'n text " street injury in the past year through collisions with lampposts , bins and other pedestrians .
The 6.6 million accidents have caused injuries ranging from mild knocks and embarrassing cuts and bruises through to broken noses , cheekbones and even a fractured skull .
Scroll down for more ...
Collision course : Padding around a lamppost in Brick Lane , London .
The move is part of the ' safe text ' drive to cut the number of phone users injured in street accidents
Almost two thirds - 62 per cent - of Brits concentrate so hard while texting that they lose their peripheral vision , researchers found .
Given the apparent dangers of " unprotected text " , over a quarter of Brits - 27 per cent - are in favour of creating a ' mobile motorway ' on Britain 's pavements .
Texters could follow a brightly coloured line , which which would act like a cycle lane , steering them away from obstacles .
And 44 per cent of those surveyed wanted pads placed on lampposts to protect them while texting .
The study found that busy city streets were the worst for " walk 'n text " accidents .
The research showed that Brick Lane in East London was the top spot for texting injuries .
Now Brick Lane has been made
the country 's first “ Safe Text ” street ,
with brightly coloured padding ,
similar to that used on rugby posts ,
placed on lamp posts to test if it
helps protect dozy mobile users .
If the trial is successful , the idea
could be rolled out to other London
blackspots , including Charing Cross
Road , Old Bond Street , Oxford Street
and Church Street , Stoke Newington .
Across London , it is claimed there
were more than 68,000 such
accidents last year , with victims ' injuries
ranging from minor bruises to
fractured skulls .
The blame was placed on the large
amount of street furniture such as
lamp posts and bins and a growing
number of pedestrians attracted by
the area 's curry houses and bars .
The survey , by text information
company 118.com , revealed 44 per
cent of mobile users backed the idea
of the padding to save themselves
from injury and mild
embarrassment .
Other suggestions included
“ mobile motorways ” , like cycle lanes ,
giving people a brightly coloured
line to follow to stay out of danger .
William Ostrom of 118.com said :
“ The study found Brick Lane was the
worst for a combination of reasons .
It
has a very high concentration of lamp
posts , signs and bins in a small area .
Added to the pedestrian footfall and
the number of drinking
establishments , it 's a hot spot for accidents . ”
Britain's 48 million mobile users together send 4.7 million texts an hour .
Campaign groups blamed growing
levels of street “ clutter ” , such as
lamp posts , bins and recycling points .
Tony Armstrong , chief executive of
Living Streets , said : “ Britain 's streets
are becoming increasingly like
obstacle courses .
We were surprised by the
scale of accidents but know from
our members that cluttered streets
continue to cause daily danger . ”

Just because a vehicle has a high riding stance and all - wheel drive , that does n't qualify it as an off - roader .
That 's why when BMW introduced the X5 it was labeled as a " Sports Activity Vehicle " not an SUV .
BMW designed the X5 knowing full well that the majority of largely suburban SUV buyers never even think about going off - road .
Unfortunately , it appears that one driver , who evidently rented this X5 in Istanbul , never got that message .
The purely on - road high performance tires \did n't clue him in that driving to the beach should not include driving past the beach and directly into the water .
Prompted by his female companion , the driver went a bit too far .
The results were easily predicable and the video after the jump shows clearly why the X5 ( and most of its ilk ) belong on - road only .

SAN FRANCISCO  Booming video game sales are masking a serious concern for game makers : their economic model is in peril .
Game companies are taking in more money , but , in many cases , not profits .
The market has expanded greatly , with more women and older gamers playing .
People are playing on consoles , computers , cellphones and hand - held gadgets .
But a proliferation of free or low - cost games on the Web and for phones limits how much the major game publishers can raise prices .
It also diverts attention from the game consoles , like the PlayStation 3 from Sony and the Xbox 360 from Microsoft .
“ The model as it exists is dying , ” said Mike McGarvey , former chief executive of Eidos and now an executive with OnLive , which delivers games from the Internet .
He said consumers were looking at games for consoles and saying , “ This is too expensive and there are too many choices . ”
Industry sales grew 19 percent in 2008 compared with a year earlier , the kind of sales growth that would thrill many industries during a deep recession .
And yet the list of money - losing companies includes top names in gaming : Electronic Arts , Take - Two Interactive and THQ .
Dozens of smaller game studios selling games for download and the mom-and - pop companies offering ad - supported “ casual games ” on the Web are still trying to figure out how to turn their millions of players into profitable customers .

In the Los Angeles Times earlier this year , Mark Dow , a freelance journalist , wrote : “ The first I heard about rituals of sexual humiliation in prison had nothing to do with Abu Ghraib . ”
For the past decade , Dow has been exposing and uncovering the prisoner abuse that takes place right here in the United States , inside the nation ’s federal immigration prisons .
In his new book , American Gulag : Inside U.S. Immigration Prisons , Dow describes the network of immigration detention centers and details the abuses that take place in them , and the efforts by government officials to conceal what is happening .
In the 1980s , the Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) began an aggressive policy of detaining certain political refugees and other undocumented aliens .
Many of these prisoners are “ criminal aliens , ” immigrants who have already served prison terms and are waiting to be deported .
Others are merely seeking asylum , such as the thousands of Haitian “ boat people ” who were detained en masse during the Reagan years .
Overall , about 200,000 people are detained annually .
Since September 11 , immigration policy has become more stringent still , targeting Arab , Muslim , and South Asian foreign nationals .
The prisons themselves are often gruesome .
Detainees — many of whom have committed no crime — are often subjected to beating , humiliation , sexual assault , isolation , and verbal abuse .
The guards themselves are often unprepared for the environment .
One officer , after being convicted for repeatedly kicking and punching an inmate , told Dow , “ It was a situation I had never been in … I reacted … I do n’t know what happened . ”
Almost as disturbing is the veil of secrecy surrounding the detention centers .
In his investigations , Dow was often prevented from interviewing prisoners , accessing medical records , and looking at immigration guidelines .
Dow also found that INS — which has now been folded into Homeland Security — answers to no one .
It often eschews formal regulations .
There are no monitors or independent watchdogs around .
Most of what we know about these prisons comes from a handful of journalists , working tirelessly to “ make public what the INS tries to hide . ”
Dow recently spoke by phone with MotherJones.com about some of the disturbing facts he ’s uncovered about America ’s immigration prisons .
What follows is an edited transcript of that conversation .
MotherJones.com : Describe the typical process an immigrant will go through after being picked up by immigration .
Mark Dow : Unfortunately there ’s not always a typical process .
If you look at the flow chart included in the Office of the Inspector General ’s report about immigration , it is not straightforward at all .
This makes it incredibly difficult to track these detainees .
But as far as people I ’ve written about , first you have immigrants who come into airports without proper documentation .
If that person is allowed to pursue political asylum , then they go into detention .
Of the 23,000 “ administrative detainees ” in detention , asylum seekers make up about 10 to 13 percent .
We do n’t know the exact number because the immigration service has n’t provided any numbers , in spite of a statutory requirement that they do so .
Second , a person with , say , a visa overstay can be picked up by an immigration agent and taken to detention — either an immigration detention center or a contracted jail .
And then you have people with some kind of criminal conviction who are picked up .
Since the late 1980s , the immigration service has been tracking non-citizens in the criminal justice system .
So once an immigrant completes a prison sentence , he or she can be turned over to the immigration service .
Let me add that a lot of people picked up in this way were never sentenced to jail time , because they had minor convictions , but these immigrants can still be subject to detention and deportation .
MJ.com :
What happens then ?
Can those immigrants with criminal records be held indefinitely ?
MD : Indefinitely is a loaded word .
In a general sense any immigrant detainee is subject to indefinite detention , without a release date .
The immigration service has the authority to detain someone in order to deport him or her .
Now technically , this person is not being held as punishment .
Technically .
In practice things are very different .
What happens if someone to be deported and no one will take that person ?
This is a situation we ’ve seen with Cambodians , Vietnamese , Laotians , Libyans , Iraqis , Cubans …
There was an important Supreme Court case in 2001 — Zadvydas vs. Davis — where the court ruled that the immigration service cannot detain someone indefinitely simply because it is unable to deport that person .
Well , it seems clear that the government is not complying with the Zadvydas decision .
I say that partially because of reports I ’ve seen from attorneys around the country .
Likewise , a report from the GAO in May 2004 notes that there are problems in tracking whether the immigration service is actually in compliance .
The agency also uses legal technicalities to exploit the law .
I spoke to a Mariel Cuban prisoner who served about 2 years in California state prison and was then held for twenty years by the INS because the Cuban government would not take him back .
Well , the INS was able to hold him by citing an “ entry fiction , ” saying that he had not legally entered the country , even though Mariel Cubans have been here for a quarter century .
MJ.com :
So who ’s making sure that these agencies comply with the law ?
Well there ’s the big question of what makes the immigration agency accountable .
The GAO report seems to suggest that the agency itself make improvements to ensure compliance with the law .
Likewise , a similar report from the Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) , criticizing treatment of post - 9/11 detainees in Brooklyn , suggested that the Bureau of Prisons police itself .
Even though the same Bureau withheld evidence from the OIG about allegations against correctional officers .
Obviously that ’s not going to work .
So we need some kind of oversight from outside Homeland Security .
We need someone , some sort of ombudsman , who reviews every case in detention and makes sure people are detained lawfully and then monitors the treatment of all these people .
MJ.com :
How much access do detainees usually get with the outside world , especially in terms of legal representation ?
MD : Another improvement that can be made to the system is that all immigration detainees should be appointed legal counsel .
The detainees are not entitled to government - appointed counsel , although they can have lawyers if they can get them .
One of the problems , however , is that being a detainee makes it really hard to get a lawyer .
Typically the prisoners can only make collect phone calls from jail , and a lawyer ’s office will rarely accept collect calls from an unknown person .
And remember that immigration officials can move detainees at will , typically in the middle of the night , from jail to jail around the country .
They can be moved to rural areas without an immigration bar , without lawyers who will work on pro bono immigration cases .
At one point the American Bar Association tried to enact a standard to prevent such transfers , and not surprisingly , the INS refused .
MJ.com : How widespread is the prisoner abuse in immigration prisons ?
MD : I do n’t have statistics , but I ’ve talked to many prisoners and jailers , and visited a number of detention centers .
In my experience , extreme forms of physical abuse are common , and not just aberrations .
It seems to be something that grows naturally out of the ways in which prisons are run .
That was made most clear to me in a conversation with a warden in Louisiana , who described what it ’s like for a 20 - something - year - old guard with minimal training to suddenly be in a dorm room with a bunch of angry prisoners who do n’t want to be there .
It sets up a certain atmosphere .
And both prisoners and correctional officers have emphasized to me that , although dramatic beatings or sexual humiliation are more likely to make the newspaper , there ’s a daily degradation and dehumanization that ’s part of prison and has nothing to do with any kind of sentence .
That is often what makes life really unbearable .
MJ.com :
What role do you think racism plays in the way the detainees are handled ?
MD : I think automatically of two pre-9/11 stories .
One of them involves a Palestinian who was beaten by INS officials in California and told that it was in retaliation for the Beirut bombing .
Another is an allegation by India Sikhs who were taunted as terrorists .
It ’s also worth noting that Nigerians in are subjected to a lot of targeted abuse , because they tend to know what their rights are , and tend to speak English , which is a dangerous combination as far as immigration officers are concerned .
I do n’t think the INS invents this stuff ; it ’s part of the culture of enforcement .
When you have control over a person and part of the reason for that control is what that person is , in this case , an “ alien ” , then a lot of masks come off .
But at times immigration policy has helped to spearhead those prejudices by making them official .
One of the things I saw happening over and over again was that the prejudices that existed at the policy level in Washington get played out on the ground .
Years ago at the Krome detention center in Florida , I heard about detention officers who were ridiculing Haitian women for coming to America because they only wanted more food .
But these officers were basically mimicking the federal policy against Haitians , which said these people were not entitled to political asylum because they were only economic migrants .
MJ.com :
What about detainees who call attention to their conditions , or try to contact the media ?
Are they singled out for retribution by prison officials ?
MD : That is extremely common .
This particular prison system is extremely repressive , and the system retaliates against prisoners who attempt to contact the media , or against those who go on nonviolent hunger strikes .
That retaliation can include everything from beatings to transferring prisoners to isolated jails away from their families and attorneys .
This is an important example of the unchecked and arbitrary authority that the immigration agency has .
In my book I describe a Palestinian who is transferred from jail to jail , and the immigration service is trying hard to keep him from contacting the media , which he ’s very good at doing .
Eventually the guy gets released , and as a condition of his release , INS told him he could not speak to the media about his case .
If he did , they would lock him back up .
The thing is , none of this has anything to do with immigration .
Forbidding someone from talking about his or her case to the media has nothing to do with any argument about borders or national security .
It ’s simply the result of excessive authority and an obsession with secrecy .
MJ.com :
Do you see any way to change this system , this culture ?
MD : There have been calls for monitoring prisons and jails and detention centers .
This is good , but I think it ’s important to realize that that ’s never going to happen from on high .
Local communities and activists around the country need to go to their immigration offices and go to their local jails and begin discussions about setting up some sort of monitoring .
Independent surprise monitoring is probably the only thing that will protect immigration officials and correctional officers from this sort of thing .
MJ.com : How , in your experience , do detainees cope with their situation , in your experience ?
MD : You know , it varied widely .
But it ’s an interesting question because it helps me to remember that even though we ’re talking about the repression of this immigration prison system , we ’re really talking about people and human beings on both sides .
I think about conversations I had with particular people who were detained .
Some people get extremely depressed ; they just close themselves down and develop a kind of desperation .
That desperation often takes the form of just going over and over the procedural details of their cases with anyone who will listen .
In other cases there ’s a kind of hopelessness that develops from the utter isolation of being a prisoner .
Prisoners might develop unrealistic hopes about what an article in the paper or a court decision might do for them .
Other detainees became extremely angry — I remember a woman from Uganda who was indignant that all these immigration officials thought that , just because she was from Africa , she was uneducated , which she certainly was n’t .
I talked to other people who were extremely clear - eyed and realistic about what anyone could do for them .
I ’m thinking of a long - term Mariel Cuban detainee who just said , “ Look , you ’re going to leave here and you ’re going to write about this and that ’s fine , but we have nowhere to go . ”
And he was just stating reality as clearly as he could .
As time went by and I heard from different prisoners , I was very moved by ones who would write and simply wanted to do what they could to let people know about what was going on .
As one prisoner said to me , “ America ’s a big country , and someone will do something if you let people know ”
MJ.com
In your investigations you ran across a number of attempts by INS officials to stonewall media inquiries .
Do you think this is a function of bureaucratic inefficiency , or is it an actual , concerted effort by the department to conceal what is going on ?
I think it ’s a combination .
The immigration service has long had a culture of secrecy , which was mostly discovered after 9/11 .
Robert Kahn , who wrote a book entitled “ Other People ’s Blood , ” about immigration detention during the Reagan years , described holding a particular document in his hands while discussing it with an INS official who was denying the existence of that document .
It ’s almost a bizarre parody of government secrecy .
But at the same time it ’s important to realize that there ’s very intentional disinformation within immigration service and now coming from Homeland security in terms of immigration detention .
MJ.com :
How widespread within the bureaucracy of the system is the awareness of what ’s going on ?
MD : Let me tell a story that should give a sense of how much awareness there is .
In my book I describe a hunger strike by Egyptian detainees held in Alabama .
The local jailers had gone to the district court for what ’s known as a “ force feed ” order .
Several high - ranking Justice Department litigators got involved , and around this time a newsletter emerged , which came from the Office of Immigration Litigation .
In one of the articles , Paul Kovac wrote that an alien ’s constitutional status in this country might be something that the government can use when an alien detainee challenges his or her treatment in detention .
This is astonishing , and disturbing , because it tells me that high - ranking Justice Department officials know about the treatment of these detainees , but instead of trying to do something about the conditions , they ’re looking for a way to justify those conditions .
MJ.com :
You mentioned that after 9/11 there was pressure by the Justice Department to look like they were doing something , by rounding as many people as they could find .
MD : Yeah .
I quote from a letter from FBI agent Colleen Rowley .
This letter has an amazing little paragraph in it where she expresses concern over the pressure from FBI offices to round up Arabs in order to fill the detention centers .
Likewise , Ashcroft repeatedly used the term “ terrorist ” to describe the people who were being detained , when he was certainly in a position to know that they were not terrorists .
MJ.com
How has the increasingly common use of private prisons affected things ?
MD : It has certainly added to the invulnerability of the agency .
The use of private prison companies provides another level of deniability , a theory with which immigration officials familiar with the system have agreed .
I ’ll also mention that the Correctional Corporation of America , which contracts with the U.S. government to run a lot of immigration detention centers , has warned its shareholders of the dangers of public scrutiny .
So that attitude dovetails very nicely with INS operations .
MJ.com :
In what ways do you think the media could cover the subject better or more incisively ?
MD : Here ’s one .
My book was criticized recently for spending too much time describing the runaround I would get from immigration officials .
And I can understand in terms of journalism that you just want to focus on the story and not the process .
But at a certain point it became important to me to describe the ways in which the people running the detention system tried to keep it hidden .
An INS official tells me that i ca n’t interview one of its prisoners because of the orange or yellow alert but call back in a few weeks and i call back but now i’m not allowed to interview the prisoner because of the detention standards and so i say what do you mean ?
What detention standards ?
And I ’m told to put my question in writing , and months go by , and the answer never comes .
I can understand how those details might not be what people want to read , but I want people to understand how the system operates with such a lack of accountability and remains so secretive .
Also , in my book I quote a Fox News commentator who criticizes post - 9/11 media coverage of immigrations detentions , saying that the liberal media was running “ sob story cookie cutter ” pieces .
I actually agree with this commentator — the liberal media is perhaps too invested in these isolated human interest stories .
But if you begin to link them altogether , you realize there ’s a pattern here .
None of this is an accident .
There are 23,000 people in this system , and no one seems to know about it .
