A baby has had an amazing escape after his pushchair rolled off a station platform and under a train in Australia .
The train had slowed right down as it pulled into the station and the six - month - old baby suffered only a bump to his head .
CCTV of the incident was released to local media .
It shows the pram rolling off the platform while the baby 's mother looks on in horror .
Victoria state Police Sergeant Michael Ferwerda called the incident a ' lucky escape ' and said people should be cautious in train stations .

" Ninety - five percent of the dealers are working for less than minimum wage . " ( Melanie Dunea )
If drug dealers make so much money , how come they still live with their moms ?
Sudhir Venkatesh is a Columbia University sociologist who spent years in the housing projects of Chicago documenting criminal gangs and the drug trade .
He addresses that question and others in his new book Gang Leader for a Day and in an interview with U.S. News .
Excerpts :
Is n't dealing good money ?
Ninety - five percent of the dealers are working for less than minimum wage .
The money they are holding belongs to their leaders — the 5 percent who might be pulling in more than $ 100,000 per year .
So , most of the members have little choice but to live at home with their families or with their relatives .
Why does Mom let them live at home ?
Dealers are contributing to the household and giving money to parents who can't get their own money .
It 's not just the kids who can't find a well - paying job .
We tend to think that there are two types of people in the inner city — those that do follow the law and those that do n't .
But gang members are also sons , daughters , nieces , and nephews .
Do gangs have institutional memories ?
Many street gangs publish their own literature — an actual handbook — and share myths through stories .
The gang members that I was dealing with were hearing stories from the 1960s , when gangs fought for more city services for their neighborhoods ; they documented police abuse and were more politically active .
They did n't deal drugs .
How old are gang members ?
There are two groups .
The younger members are quick to use violence and are more interested in status and prestige .
The older members are the men who are just trying to find ways to make money .
They just want to put food on their tables and stop the younger ones from disturbing the economics of the gang and ruining the drug business .
Most gangs have a rule which requires that all the young members stay in school .
Does that work ?
There was a school strike in Chicago , and the older members were worried that the younger members would start shooting and disrupt the drug trade .
So , I taught an impromptu class for several of the gang members .
But since I had no real authority , the class turned into a little red - light district — they were selling drugs , trafficking prostitutes , and drinking beer in my classroom at 10 o'clock in the morning .
Many of the gang members seem to have serious chips on their shoulders .
A sociologist would say it 's natural for young men to have a persecution complex .
What is unusual in the inner city is that there are not folks who are maturing out of that psychological dilemma .
There 's an idea that there are forces out there that are preventing them from succeeding , something that is reinforced when they look around and see only examples of people failing to make it .
Are gang members healthy , physically ?
There is significant exposure to lead and asbestos and extremely poor nutrition .
One of the most jaw - dropping experiences I continue to have is to walk into a grocery store in the inner city .
There 's a lack of fresh food , decent food .
How many drug dealers use drugs ?
Most of the hard - core drug users are older .
The gang succeeds in keeping its own members off drugs .
All drugs ?
There 's lots of alcoholism and marijuana use but not the hard narcotics — heroin , cocaine .
People who are high can't operate the drug economy , but it 's also a status issue .
The gang does n't want to be seen as the lowest members of the society , which are the chronically addicted — prostitutes , crackheads .
But are n't they preying on the lower rungs ?
There 's a perverted Robin Hood myth at play .
According to the theory , the gang returns the money to the community in the form of philanthropy .
They 'll send money to the local YMCA to help buy equipment , clean up a park , escort older members of the community to buy groceries or run errands .
But one has to question if that 's a justification for the violence and other problems they bring to their neighbors .
Do you find it depressing to go back to the projects ?
Two years ago , when he spoke at the Value Investing Congress , David Einhorn said Lehman was in deep trouble .
Turned out it was a good call .
Today he gave another keynote at the conference in which he argued the policies of the administration have put us on a very dangerous path , one which has encouraged him to buy physical gold as insurance against sovereign default (s ) .
Here ’s a pdf of the speech .
A few highlights below .
On Bernanke and Geithner :
Presently , Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner have become the quintessential short - term decision makers .
They explicitly “ do whatever it takes ” to “ solve one problem at a time ” and deal with the unintended consequences later .
It is too soon for history to evaluate their work , because there has n’t been time for the unintended consequences of the “ do whatever it takes ” decision - making to materialize .
On too big to fail and the true lesson of Lehman :
The proper way to deal with too - big - to - fail , or too inter- connected to fail , is to make sure that no institution is too big or inter-connected to fail .
The test ought to be that no institution should ever be of individual importance such that if we were faced with its demise the government would be forced to intervene .
The real solution is to break up anything that fails that test .
The lesson of Lehman should not be that the government should have prevented its failure .
The lesson of Lehman should be that Lehman should not have existed at a scale that allowed it to jeopardize the financial system .
And the same logic applies to AIG , Fannie , Freddie , Bear Stearns , Citigroup and a couple dozen others .
The administration talks tough about TBTF , but has made very clear they are n’t willing to make policy choices to do anything to proactively break them up .
It was very telling when , in a keynote at the Economist ’s Buttonwood Gathering , Larry Summers said too - big - to - fail means too - big - not - to - be- regulated .
The correct thing to have said , the correct policy that needs to be worked out so that we avoid a re-run of last year ’s crisis is “ too big to fail is too big to exist . ”
But do n’t take my word for it , take Alan Greenspan’s .
On CDS ( bold mine ) :
I think that trying to make safer CDS is like trying to make safer asbestos .
How many real businesses have to fail before policy makers decide to simply ban them ?
On arguments that the lesson of 1937 - 8 is not to withdraw stimulus too soon :
An alternative lesson from the double dip the economy took in 1938 is that the GDP created by massive fiscal stimulus is artificial .
So whenever it is eventually removed , there will be significant economic fall out .
Our choice may be either to maintain large annual deficits until our creditors refuse to finance them or tolerate another leg down in our economy by accepting some measure of fiscal discipline .
Channeling Stephen
“ There - is - no - exit ” Roach :
As we sit here today , the Federal Reserve is propping up the bond market , buying long - dated assets with printed money .
It can not turn around and sell what it has just bought .
There is a basic rule of liquidity .
It is n’t the same for everyone .
If you own 10,000 shares of Greenlight Re , you have a liquid investment .
However , if I own 5 million shares it is not liquid to me , because of both the size of the position and the signal my selling would send to the market .
For this reason , the Fed cannot sell its Treasuries or Agencies without destroying the market .
This means that it will be challenged to shrink the monetary base if inflation actually turns up …. …. The Fed could reach the point where it perceives doing whatever it takes requires it to become the buyer of Treasuries of first and last resort .
On his gold thesis :
I have seen many people debate whether gold is a bet on inflation or deflation .
As I see it , it is neither .
Gold does well when monetary and fiscal policies are poor and does poorly when they appear sensible .
Gold did very well during the Great Depression when FDR debased the currency .
It did well again in the money printing 1970s , but collapsed in response to Paul Volcker ’s austerity .
It ultimately made a bottom around 2001 when the excitement about our future budget surpluses peaked …. …. When I watch Chairman Bernanke , Secretary Geithner and Mr. Summers on TV , read speeches written by the Fed Governors , observe the “ stimulus ” black hole , and think about our short - termism and lack of fiscal discipline and political will , my instinct is to want to short the dollar .
But then I look at the other major currencies .
The Euro , the Yen , and the British Pound might be worse .
So , I conclude that picking one these currencies is like choosing my favorite dental procedure .
And I decide holding gold is better than holding cash , especially now , where both earn no yield .
He ’s also buying long - dated options on interest rates using derivatives :
Along these same lines , we have bought long - dated options on much higher U.S. and Japanese interest rates .
The options in Japan are particularly cheap because the historical volatility is so low .
I prefer options to simply shorting government bonds , because there remains a possibility of a further government bond rally in response to the economy rolling over again .
With options , I can clearly limit how much I am willing to lose , while creating a lot of leverage to a possible rate spiral .
There ’s much more in the speech .

If Senate Republicans went to China , they would be lined against a wall and shot .
This partially explains why the Chinese have come out of the recession and the Americans have n't .
Our lead story features Pennsylvanian John Moyer visiting Disney World with his grandchildren .
They were touring in Toontown when they met Minnie Mouse .
While John posed for a picture with Minnie , he fondled her fake mouse boobs and patted her butt .
He did it in front of his grandkids , but at an angle they could not see .
After the family walked away , Minnie notified her boss and he notified the Disney Police .
They used the newly installed surveillance system [ the cameras disguised as mouse ears ] to arrest the hapless groper .
Last week , he went on trial and was just sentenced to two days in jail , 180 days probation , and 50 hours of community service -- all of which he must do before he can head home to Pennsylvania .
At the trial , the defense attorney argued .
" It does n't matter she was grabbed .
She 's just a mouse . "
The prosecutor countered .
" It 's not just a mouse .
It 's a person ...
It 's not OK to go to the diner and pinch a waitress ' butt anymore , and it's not OK to go to a theme park and pinch a character 's butt . "
The defense attorney stressed the incident happened in front of many people , none of whom thought anything was wrong .
Also , Minnie did n't say anything !
The prosecutor answered that since Disney actors are fired for breaking character , she was terrified of losing her job .
John William Moyer , 60 , of Cressona , Penn. , left , wipes the ink from his hands after he was convicted and sentenced Tuesday of misdemeanor battery charge for groping of a woman playing Minnie Mouse at Walt Disney World .

Duracell vs Energizer was one of the headlining tech fights of the ' 80s , as Walkmanseseses chewed through cell after cell .
Today , a better match up is the one between their rechargeable batteries .
Advertisement
The Energizer AA batteries are rated at 2200 mAh and the Duracells at 2000 mAh ( that 's milliampere - hours , a measurement of energy charge ) .
But the Duracells last a lot longer .
I tested using an ICON LED flashlight , this solid aluminum model with high and low settings — the high setting killing a standard battery in about 3 hours .
Through several trials using different cells , the Energizer lasted 2 to 3.5 hours , while the Duracells took anywhere from 5 to 6.5 hours to drain .
Not an insignificant discrepancy , and contrary to the respective charge ratings on each .
Advertisement
The Duracell family of rechargeable batteries also come precharged out of the package , so that 's very convenient .
They 've also got USB ports for charging USB gadgets .
Both companies offer car and 15 minute chargers .
The Duracell Mobile charger is my favorite simply because it has a car adapter and a wall adapter , and can charge 4 AA batteries or any USB device from those sources .
( It does not do 15 minute charges , however , but I 'd rather buy extras and have them ready to go . )
The only real drawback is that it can't charge D cells and 9V batteries like the giant sized Energizer family charger can .
Both kinds of batteries are NiMH .
Duracell claims their batteries will hold their charge for a year in storage , while Energizer claims only 6 months .
Frills aside , the bottom line here is battery life , and Duracell has a lot more of it than Energizer .

We 're at a truly fascinating crossroads in modern economic times .
Financial theory as we have come to know it will be changed forever based the recent actions of Ben Bernanke and global central bankers .
Millions of textbooks will be rewritten in the coming 10 years and careers will either flourish or die on the back of the actions of these bankers .
Those in favor of Bernanke 's legendary helicopter drop are celebrating a 6 month rally in equities , but a vital piece of the recovery puzzle remains missing .
While Bernanke and Co. fire up the printing presses , and the banks sell the recovery hook line and sinker to the investing public , we continue to see very weak consumer trends .
As we sit on the one year anniversary of the demise of Lehman Brothers it 's most appropriate to ask what we have achieved over the last few months and years in regards to policy action .
Many say we avoided the second great depression and praise Bernanke for his innovative and swift actions .
Others ( myself included ) believe we have simply kicked the can down the road and foresee an end to Bernanke 's career that very much mirrors Mr. Greenspan's .
As we noted back in August , Bernanke 's real report card is less than impressive :
4 million lost jobs
4.6 percentage point surge in the unemployment rate
20 % decline in the S&P 500
30 % plunge in house values
A 3.5 % reduction in real GDP per capita
11 % decline in the trade - weighed dollar
109 failed banks ( almost matching the total from the prior 13 years combined )
If you think about the cause of the credit crisis ( excessive debt , excessive leverage and a banking sector that is too large and too powerful ) and what we have solved in the last year it 's actually quite apparent that we have n't solved any of the structural problems that actually caused the crisis .
The debt in this country is still extraordinary , leverage is making a comeback and the banks have grown larger in what has to be the most incredible power grab in modern economic times .
Meanwhile , Bernanke is like the doctor who keeps the cancer patient on life support , but can't for the life of him , figure out how to extract the cancer and create a healthy self sustaining life .
The system still has the cancer , but the recent shot of Demerol has the patient feeling better .
50 % better .
At the heart of this problem is the consumer .
The bankers will tell you that our long - term structural problems reside in the banks ( which is why they needed our help in the first place , remember ? ) , but in reality this is a consumer driven problem .
And the problems confronting the consumer are many .
Unfortunately for Bernanke these are long - term structural problems that ca n’t be fixed with a printing press and a helicopter .
The consumer continues to struggle under the weight of high debts , stagnant wages and massive job losses .
The latest consumer credit report , however , showed that the deleveraging in the private sector is actually picking up steam :
Meanwhile , for the bankers , it is business as usual .
We can be certain that Christmas 2009 will be disappointing for everyone 's children in the United States except for those whose parents are employees of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan - record bonuses are coming .
Unfortunately for the Fed and Bernanke you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink .
Lending is a two sided coin and as consumers continue to tighten their purse strings they simply are n't borrowing at a rate that the government would like to see .
This throws quite a wrench in Bernanke ’s reflation plans .
Much to Ben Bernanke 's dismay the velocity of money simply is n't budging .
You can drop money from a helicopter , but if there is no one to borrow it then your hopes for a credit driven recovery become very dim .
Even the incentives such as the cash for clunkers program prove to be having little positive impact on borrowing and overall retail sales as investors simply reallocate spending money .
It will be interesting to see what sort of impact this program has on long - term spending .
The early signs from the back to school season are nothing to cheer about .
It looks like mom and dad bought a new car , but decided junior did n’t need the textbooks for school .
The near - term positives of the government stimulus appear fine in theory , but are only compounding our long - term problems .
The U.S. government is borrowing money to help debt - laden consumers borrow money to purchase an asset they likely do n't need .
The sheer stupidity behind such a government program is literally mindboggling .
Meanwhile , in return for their generous bailout money , the bankers continue to jam taxpayers with higher credit card rates and more stringent lending standards .
BNP elaborates :
One reason consumers may not be responding expansionary Fed policy is that lending standards continue to tighten and terms are expensive .
Spreads between the rates charged on auto loans and Treasuries remain elevated , although it is worth noting that auto loan rates are available only through May .
However that is not likely the whole story , consumers have lost tremendous amounts of wealth and income and face continued uncertainty about job security .
It is worth noting that amongst all of the green shoots in housing and manufacturing , consumer spending overall has remained very subdued .
Unlike the labor market , consumer spending does not tend to lag the cycle , but help lead it so we continue to believe a subdued recovery seems likely .
Many have already crowned Bernanke as the next " Maestro " ( sounds familiar , right ? ) , but we will not know whether Bernanke succeeded for many years .
Ignore the talking heads who tell you that Bernanke saved the global economy .
The same mistake was made by many back in the 90's when Greenspan tried to print his way out of trouble .
Thus far , all we know is that Bernanke has whipped out the same exact cheap money playbook that Mr. Greenspan always turned to .
The curse of cheap money has been felt by everyone over the course of the last 30 years as we promote an unstable and deeply harmful boom bust cycle :
David Rosenberg of Gluskin
Sheff said it best :
All the growth we are seeing globally this year is due to fiscal stimulus ; not just here in Canada and the U.S. , but also in Korea , China , the U.K. , and Continental Europe too .
For 2010 , the government ’s share of global growth , by our estimates , will be 80 % .
In other words , there are still very few signs that organic private sector activity is stirring .
For a Keynesian , government stimulus is necessary , but the question for an investor is the multiple one attaches to a global economy that is still relying on a defibrillator .
The problem is that governments do not create income or wealth , and today ’s stimulus is really a future tax liability .
Curiously , that future tax liability is likely going to pose a roadblock for the return to a “ normalized ” $ 80 operating EPS estimate that strategists are now starting to pen in for 2011 .
Albert Edwards of SocGen foresees a continuation of the deleveraging cycle that will be carried on the back of consumers :
The problem is that after the boom there will be a bust .
The issue now is one of deleveraging and the deflation that is starting to unfold .
The problem is that Bernanke is a slave to Milton Friedman ’s view of the Great Depression ( at Friedman ’s 90th birthday Bernanke promised that the Fed would never allow another Great Depression to occur ) .
The Australian economist Steve Keen ’s observation that “ Bernanke ’s dilemma is that he is living in a Minskian world while perceiving it though Friedmanite eyes explains his actions to date .
It also explains why he will fail .
Will Bernanke succeed using the same cheap money game plan that Greenspan used ?
Perhaps in the short - term , but in the long - term it 's likely that Edwards is indeed correct .
We are simply promoting a boom bust cycle that is built on no real organic strength as is evidenced in recent consumer trends .
As Anna Schwartz said , we are fighting " the last war " and she is deeply concerned that we have lost it .
The Fed has vowed to print our way out of this mess while allowing mistakes to go unpunished .
The long - term bulls are dancing in the streets in recent weeks despite stock prices that are still 20 % off their highs , 10 % unemployment , a dead consumer and housing prices that are 30 % off their highs .
Do n’t lose sight of the forest for the trees here .
This is n’t a sprint we ’re experiencing ; it is likely to be a marathon .
They say history has a way of repeating itself and this movie looks like one I ’ve seen one too many times during the Greenspan era… .
The best thing that might result from all of this is that Ben and company actually are fighting the “ last war ” .
Rather , the “ last war ” we allow them to so foolishly start … .
Unfortunately for the rest of us , that likely means we have more booms and more busts ahead of us .
Editor 's note : Dr. Otis Brawley is chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society and a practicing oncologist .
He is CNNhealth.com 's Conditions expert and answers viewer questions regularly on CNN.com Live .
Dr. Otis Brawley says open - mindedness has helped advance traditional medicine .
( CNN ) --
This week , the comedic actress Suzanne Somers is promoting her newly released book , which espouses the virtues of alternative medicine and , more important , explains why one should avoid conventional medicine .
She is a wonderful actress , and I wish she would stick to her first chosen profession .
I know some people will hear her message , follow her advice because of her celebrity status and be harmed .
Her medical advice may even cause death .
She joins the list of celebrities who have advocated alternative and complementary treatments for disease and non-proven conventional medicine .
I have spent much of my professional career documenting disparities in outcome , higher mortality and more suffering among minorities , poor people and even the uninsured middle class who have limited or no access to conventional medicine , the therapies Somers criticizes .
Mind you , I am not critical of the concept of alternative and complementary medicine .
When used wisely , it can be useful .
Indeed , open - mindedness to other ideas is how we advance conventional medicine .
Today , conventional medicine has the extract of a tree bark called aspirin or the root of a plant called vincristine because of observations from those who practiced non-conventional medicine .
My problem is with some and not all of the advocates of alternative and complementary medicine .
My problem is with those who reject the scientific method .
Some actually do not reject the scientific method .
They seem not to even realize that there is such a thing to reject .
' Larry King Live ' Suzanne Somers talks to Larry King about her medical nightmares .
Friday , 9 p.m. ET see full schedule »
Some well - meaning advocates for complementary and alternative therapies are against any rigorous evaluation of these therapies .
This allows for quackery .
The sophisticated 21st - century snake oil salesmen can make a tremendous profit selling their phony " cures " when there is no adequate assessment by medical peers .
True , there have been some abuses and misdeeds in conventional medicine , and some conventional practitioners offer conventional therapy in unproven ways .
I have been very hard on those who abuse conventional medicine .
When practiced as it should be , conventional medicine assesses itself and corrects itself when it is wrong .
In the 1980s and early 1990s , many in oncology advocated high - dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant for locally advanced breast cancer .
Ultimately , rigorous scientific assessment showed this approach to be wrong .
Time and time again , we in conventional medicine have , through a process of continuous examination , stopped doing something that did not work or modified a treatment such that it worked better .
Peer review is a central tenet of conventional medicine .
In conventional medicine , one must allow experts in ones field to independently review one 's data .
The fact that a few patients give testimonial to a treatment is not adequate evidence of benefit .
Because malignant disease can vary so widely from person to person , randomized controlled phase 3 trials comparing two treatments are often needed to demonstrate that a treatment works .
Watch a clip of Somers and Brawley on " Larry King Live " »
Alternative therapies to complement conventional medicine can be useful when done to alleviate a side effect of medicine or discomfort caused by the disease .
Such therapies are obviously effective if the patient feels better .
These therapies must be discussed with the conventional physician , as they can be devastating when not disclosed to the physician .
Some seemingly innocuous alternative treatments can be harmful .
The anti-HIV drug DDI is inactivated when taken with high doses of vitamin C. Some HIV patients who secretly took high - dose vitamin C as a complementary therapy with DDI harmed themselves .
While conventional medicine is by no means perfect , and those who practice it are often flawed , the wise use of proven conventional therapy is responsible for a tremendous decrease in the mortality rate ( risk of death ) over the past century .
I encourage all patients who choose to use alternative and complementary medicine to discuss it with their conventional physician .
Remember , some therapies that are label - alternative and complementary can be reasonable and helpful .
Some can be harmful .

Dennis Jensen says the cause of climate change is still in dispute and has attacked environmentalists as " anti-democratic alarmists " .
Dr Jensen , who has spoken out previously on the issue , has also called for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) to be disbanded .
His comments come as the Coalition struggles with internal division on climate change policy .
In a speech to open the Australian Environment Foundation 's annual conference in Canberra today , Dr Jensen said the question of whether climate change was caused by human activity was still up for debate .
" It will come as no surprise that I am sceptical on the anthropogenic component of climate change , " he said .
" Climate change is real - the liability of humans in questionable . "
Dr Jensen criticised the climate change science and accused the environmental movement of wanting to overthrow democracy .
" While the gap between climate observations and model projection outputs continue to diverge , the ardour and shrill character of the alarmists increases , " he said .
Dr Jensen 's attack comes as the Coalition begins negotiations with the Government over its emissions trading scheme , an issue which has threatened Malcolm Turnbull 's leadership in recent weeks .
On Sunday Mr Turnbull won the support of the party room to push for changes to the scheme but Dr Jensen has lashed out at the use of emissions trading schemes .
" Another reason for my concern is that embarking on setting a price on carbon dioxide is effectively putting a tax on everything and will give the control freaks a level of control on all human enterprise within a nation not seen in democratic history , " he said .
Dr Jensen is one of several Western Australian MPs who have urged the Coalition to reject an emissions trading scheme .
The Australian Environment Foundation 's website has a link to a petition which opposes the Government 's scheme .

Malik Miah , San Francisco BySan Francisco
October 11 , 2009 —
The heat is on the administration of US President Barack Obama .
The energised conservative base has taken over town hall meetings on health care .
There are “ birthers ” ( those who claim Obama is not a US citizen and ineligible to be president ) , “ deathers ” ( those who claim Obama ’s health care reform is a plan to kill old people ) and just pure haters .
Obama has been personally attacked as a racist , socialist , communist , Stalinist , fascist , Nazi , Pol Potist , foreigner and every other name the right finds in its vocabulary .
When Obama led the US delegation to Copenhagen to get his home town of Chicago the 2016 Olympics — and failed — he was attacked as “ out of touch ” by the right .
When Chicago was knocked out in the first round of voting , the right gleefully cheered !
The “ country first ” crowd forgot that a Chicago Olympics would be in the United States , not “ Obama Land ” .
Two weeks later the Nobel Prize for Peace was given to a surprised Obama .
Again the conservatives attacked Obama saying his “ peace prize ” would deepen polarisation in the country .
It was as though Obama arranged the award .
The world , of course , sees Obama ’s move away from the unilateralism of the Bush - Cheney regime as a step forward even though Obama continues Bush ’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Senior citizens are panicked by accusations that Obama ’s attempt to bring about near universal heath coverage as a threat to their own — government - run — Medicare program .
Some veterans under a single - payer Veteran Administration program are complaining that “ socialism ” is behind Obama ’s health plans .
Tinge of racism
Former US President Jimmy Carter called these right - wing attacks “ predominantly racist ” in nature .
Since the base of the Republican Party is strongest in the old Confederate states of the Deep South — Carter is a former governor of Georgia — he tends to know what he ’s talking about .
Others reject this , claiming that former US President George W. Bush was demonised too .
But no previous president was ever attacked because of his race and had lawsuits filed asserting he was not born as a US citizen .
Obama , for his part , has downplayed the issue , quipping to a late - night TV host , “ I was Black before the election " when a majority of Americans elected him as president .
Of course , as the first US president who is African American , Barack Obama has had to play down his race even when discussing racism and discrimination -- while never denying that history .
His July speech to the 100th anniversary convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , the nation ’s oldest civil rights organisation , was a strong defence of the civil rights movement and pointed to the United States ’ long history of slavery and racism .
Yet the speech was barely covered by the mainstream media , which has a habit of downplaying the issue of race except when it is used as a slander by the right .
The shrill attacks on Obama by the right have a strong tinge of racism .
It is not just a repeat of the Clinton years or when other “ centrist Democrats ” have come under assault .
The United States ’ long history of racism — and institutional discrimination is the hardest to uproot — and the refusal of the government to ever apologise or reject that past of slavery and legal segregation shows the deep - rooted problem of race in US politics .
( It is typical of the ruling elite to say the past is the past , we must look forward . )
The issues the right is using to attack Obama is the deep world recession and the current debate about health care and insurance industry reform , and weaving in race to play off white anxieties .
Van Jones and ACORN
The viciousness of the rightwing forces is most evident when the demagogues go after Black activists like Van Jones of San Francisco .
Jones was forced out of his environmental advisory job for the White House in September after being attacked for derogatory comments about Republicans , and signing a petition in 2004 questioning why the September 11 terrorist attack took place .
The community organising group ACORN ( Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ) was targeted by the Republicans in 2008 for its voter registration efforts in poor communities .
Slanders and lies of voter fraud were played up by the right and then picked up by the mainstream media .
The right has been after ACORN , even falsely claiming Obama worked for the group .
One would think ACORN had committed torture and other crimes against humanity .
The assault led to ACORN ’s entrapment by conservative activists in September that caused most liberals to drop their support for the organisation .
Congress , banks and others that had been working with ACORN on housing and voter issues broke ties , and Congress , including most Democrats , voted to “ defund ” the organisation in September .
Formed in 1970 in Little Rock , Arkansas , ACORN has registered more than 1 million poor , mostly African American , voters over the years .
It has helped thousands facing mortgage foreclosures .
Neither Van Jones nor ACORN have ever been convicted of crimes like those committed by the war contractors such as the private security firm BlackWater that is still in the employ of the State Department and Pentagon .
Yet most liberals quickly capitulated to the right instead of standing against these smears and attacks .
What ’s common — and outrageous — about these slanders is the failure of the Obama administration and mainstream liberal allies to stand up for those being demonised .
The real crime of Van Jones was not his comments , but his history of militant activism .
ACORN ’s rap sheet is that it fights for the poor .
Roots of anger
It is important to recognise that the superheated attacks on Obama are not primarily due to conscious , thought - out Klan - type bigotry .
An undercurrent of deep racism does exist because of institutional racism , yet it would be a mistake to read all the anti-government supporters as racists .
The main issue motivating the anger is the “ liberal agenda ” ( support for more government intervention ) promoted by Obama and most liberals .
For some 30 years , Republicans , beginning with former US President Ronald Reagan and the Democrats afterwards , have denounced “ big government ” .
The ideological shift to the right on this issue allows the conservative extremists to confuse most Americans , particularly whites , to believe the government is the problem .
( Many middle - class minorities hold the same view of government . )
There is a fundamental difference , however , between right and left populism .
Rightist critics of capitalist inequities see the government , independent of class , as the real enemy , stealing hard - earned money from working people to redistribute to the undeserving and shiftless poor ( read : undocumented immigrants , Blacks and Latinos ) .
That demagoguery taps into the bigotry of an extreme white racist minority — a smaller proportion of US society than ever in history .
The Republicans in 2008 also used the race card and called Obama “ the other ” and “ paling around with terrorists ” .
But it did n’t work .
The bulk of opposition is aimed at the greed and corporate welfare programs ( millions to Wall Street and corporate America ) as the working class suffers home foreclosures and loss of jobs .
The right has been able to tie Wall Street and fear of government together , and seize centrestage .
At the infamous town hall meetings in August , the so - called non-profit conservative foundations ( e.g. Freedom Works ) effectively tapped the misguided anti-government sentiment .
They were able to mobilise many white working and middle - class Americans to attend these meetings .
The theme at all the events was simple : “ Stop a government takeover ” of everything .
Fox News , owned by Australian - born billionaire Rupert Murdoch , has been a promoter of the “ tea party ” revolt , including a large September 12 march on Washington .
Glenn Beck , a Fox talk show host with a best - selling book , summarises this sentiment as “ Wall Street owns our government .
Our government and these gigantic corporations have merged ” .
Michael Moore ’s new movie , Capitalism : A Love Story , hits on many of the same populist themes .
Moore — an ardent and genuine liberal —- directs his criticism at both the Republicans and Democrats .
He fingers all those who have been bought and paid for by the banks , insurance companies , drug cartels and other wealthy corporate types .
The difference is that Moore sees government playing a positive role in health care and for society as a whole .
Recognising the contradictions
Another source of white anxiety ( a ``circling the wagons ’’ mentality ) is the changing demographics of the US .
The trend is not new but in times of economic uncertainty it becomes an easy target of rightist demagogues .
In 1970 whites made up 87.5 per cent of the US population .
Some 30 years later in 2000 whites were 77.5 per cent of the population and the percentage decline continues as the African - American , Latino and Asian - American populations grow .
The African - American population in 2000 was 36.7 million and the Latino population was 44.3 million .
In 1969 there were 9.6 million residents who were foreign born .
In 2006 the figure had rose to 37 million .
By 2050 whites will fall below 50 per cent .
The conservatives take these statistics and twist them ( classic scare - mongering ) to warn white Americans that they are “ losing their country ” .
It is a “ fact ” to older whites that to be an American means to be white with a Eurocentric outlook .
Everyone else is a hyphenated American .
The Obama election showed how much that view of the world is an outdated assumption .
The younger generations reject that narrow - minded pre-civil rights attitude about race and who is an American .
Most young whites see Americans as an ethnic rainbow — based primarily on citizenship .
Unfortunately , the left has failed to effectively tap the “ middle - class ” anger and focus it against the system and push for progressive causes .
The reason is because the left itself is divided , between the socialist left and the much larger liberal left .
The liberal left basically looks to the Democratic Party to lead the fightback and have responded meekly to the organised right ’s campaign against universal health care , women ’s rights , gay rights and many other issues of concern to Blacks and other minorities , and to society as a whole .
Liberalism versus left populism
The ideology of left liberalism ( historically and today ) cannot stand up to conservative extremism .
Liberalism , like conservatism , supports the free market system and the “ right ” of Wall Street to make a decent profit .
Liberalism , philosophically , supports a “ fairer ” market system .
It is very difficult to build left - wing populism that concedes the “ goodness ” of capitalism .
Genuine leftwing populism cannot be rooted in liberal ideology .
Left - wing ( or socialist ) populism must be based on the working class , the labour and progressive forces , seeking to take control of the economy , the government and crucial institutions for the good of society as a whole .
The illusions in Obama and his neoliberal - centrist ideology and philosophy have made the once energised liberal left ( when Bush was in power ) take a wait and see approach to how the legislative process plays out , conceding the streets and town hall meetings to the right .
While there continue to be important protests against the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , demanding immediate withdrawal , and supporting single payer healthcare , much of the effort is lobbying and hoping that Congress will stand up to the right .
The weakness of labour and the lack of a viable independent third political party make it difficult to provide a political alternative to the Democrats .
The impasse of Obama 's brand of liberalism is not a surprise .
He ’s doing basically what he promised to do — protect and defend the interests of the US political and economic system and its imperial foreign policy .
A leftwing populist movement marching for its issues and against the right is well overdue .
Unless that begins to develop , the rightist forces , including those with incipient fascist ideology , will continue to make political gains no matter how nutty their “ birthers ” and “ deathers ” views may seem .
History teaches us the perils of underestimating reactionary forces .
Trying to understand the complex workings of a biological cell by teasing out the function of every molecule within it is a daunting task .
But by making synthetic cells that include just a few chemical processes , researchers can study cellular machinery one manageable piece at a time .
A new paper * from researchers at Yale University and the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) describes a highly simplified model cell that not only sheds light on the way certain real cells generate electric voltages , but also acts as a tiny battery that could offer a practical alternative to conventional solid - state energy - generating devices .
Each synthetic cell built by NIST engineer David LaVan and his colleagues has a droplet of a water - based solution containing a salt -- potassium and chloride ions -- enclosed within a wall made of a lipid , a molecule with one end that is attracted to water molecules while the other end repels them .
When two of these " cells " come into contact , the water - repelling lipid ends that form their outsides touch , creating a stable double bilayer that separates the two cells ' interiors , just as actual cell membranes do .
If the researchers only did that much , nothing interesting would happen , but they also inserted into the bilayer a modified form of a protein , alpha - hemolysin , made by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus .
These embedded proteins create pores that act as channels for ions , mimicking the pores in a biological cell .
" This preferentially allows either positive or negative ions to pass through the bilayer and creates a voltage across it , " LaVan says .
" We can harness this voltage to generate electric current . "
If the solutions in the two cells start with different salt concentrations , then poking thin metal electrodes into the droplets creates a small battery : electrons will flow through a circuit connected to the electrodes , counterbalancing the ion flow through the channels .
As this happens , the ion concentrations in the droplets eventually equalize as the system discharges its electric potential .
Building synthetic versions of complex real cells -- such as those that enable an electric eel to zap its prey -- is far too difficult a task for now , says LaVan .
So the researchers instead created this far simpler system whose performance they could understand in terms a handful of basic properties , including the size of the droplets , the concentration of the aqueous solutions , and the number of ion channels in the barrier between the two cells .
A tiny battery with two droplets , each containing just 200 nanoliters of solution , could deliver electricity for almost 10 minutes .
A bigger system , with a total volume of almost 11 microliters , lasted more than four hours .
In terms of the energy it can deliver for a given volume , the biological battery is only about one - twentieth as effective as a conventional lead - acid battery .
But in its ability to convert chemical into electrical energy , the synthetic cell has an efficiency of about 10 per cent , which compares well with solid - state devices that generate electricity from heat , light , or mechanical stress -- so that synthetic cells may one day take their place in the nanotechnology toolbox .

Last month the American Community Survey detailed the painful 2008 year for American households .
This is a comprehensive survey looking at multiple financial , economic , and social characteristics of Americans .
What we find is that the average American is having a tougher time maintaining a hold on the middle class dream .
This is n’t a revelation but it does help us determine what to expect in the next few years .
The American family in fact over the past decade has maintained the illusion of middle class living by going deeper into debt because of stagnant wages .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve allowed this to occur by injecting liquidity and creating a credit market that had no brakes .
In the latest data , the median American household brings in $ 52,000 per year .
Let us break down this data :
Using Texas or any state with no income tax is a good starting point because it puts us at the higher end of the take home pay bracket .
Some states like California have state income taxes reaching up to 10 percent .
However , this allows us to see how much actual take home pay the average American family is working with .
By looking at the above it looks like people have roughly $ 3,400 a month for all additional expenses .
Keep in mind that we are also not putting money away in any retirement accounts or paying for health insurance and that can add a large line item .
Let us see how the average family spends money :
So let us use these estimates with the monthly take home to get an idea of what people are working with :
From here you can understand why the current recession is hurting so deeply .
Take for example the housing expense .
The current median home price in the U.S. is $ 174,000 .
So if the family above with the median income went to purchase this median priced home , how much are they looking to spend ?
Let us assume they buy the home via a FHA insured loan requiring only 3.5 percent down :
Down payment : $ 6,009
Mortgage : $ 167,910 ( at 5.5 percent 30 year fixed )
PI : $ 953
On the surface this may seem okay .
But we are not including taxes and insurance above .
If you include taxes and insurance , let us assume this family buys in Texas , the taxes with insurance can range from 2.5 to 3 percent of the purchase price of the home :
Insurance and Taxes : $ 362 per month
Total monthly housing payment : $ 1,315
The median family in the U.S. spends $ 1,165 per month on housing .
This may not seem like a big difference but we are looking at an 11 percent difference for the biggest line item here .
That is why housing in many parts of the country is still having trouble .
Americans have become more price conscious in a time with 17 percent unemployment and underemployment .
The transportation item in the budget above is also high .
Spending nearly $ 600 a month Americans have become more reluctant to buy expensive autos .
This number looks to include one car payment and fuel cost for the average family with two cars .
Assuming a $ 300 car payment and $ 300 in insurance and fuel cost per month , many families are now unable to purchase a new car that averages close to $ 30,000 .
That is why the government found it necessary to offer a program like cash for clunkers to get people buying .
But that program has run out of steam :
Source : Calculated Risk
It is obvious what occurred above .
Sales for autos were front loaded into August and fell off when the cash for clunkers program wore off .
We can expect a similar thing to happen for home sales that have benefited from the $ 8,000 tax credit .
What is largely missed in all of this is the actual money Americans have in their wallet .
That money comes from working and with unemployment rising , more and more people are having less and less money to spend .
With no job or hours being cut , Americans are all feeling this recession including those who are working :
The above gives a better perspective on the new consumption era .
Even those that are working are having shorter work weeks .
This is happening from less overtime and also employees who are furloughed .
These people are still considered fully employed yet their wages do not reflect a fully employed work schedule .
So when we break down the above budget and see what is happening it is clear that Americans are going to permanently shift their spending habits short of us going back to the bubble peak days .
Not by choice this change is occurring , but by economic force .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are targeting the dollar so we can expect imported good prices to increase in the next few years ( short of the dollar becoming strong again ) .
It is a new era for the middle class dream .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
At 678 , California has the nation 's largest death row population , yet the state has not executed anyone in four years .
A poll of 500 police chiefs found the death penalty ranked last among their priorities for reducing violent crime .
But it spends more than $ 130 million a year on its capital punishment system -- housing and prosecuting inmates and coping with an appellate system that has kept some convicted killers waiting for an execution date since the late 1970s .
This is according to a new report that concludes that states are wasting millions on an inefficient death penalty system , diverting scarce funds from other anti-crime and law enforcement programs .
" Thirty - five states still retain the death penalty , but fewer and fewer executions are taking place every year , " said Richard Dieter , executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center .
" But the overall death row population has remained relatively steady .
At a time of budget shortfalls nationwide , the death penalty is turning into an expensive form of life without parole . "
His group commissioned the study released Tuesday .
A privately conducted poll of 500 police chiefs released with the report found the death penalty ranked last among their priorities for reducing violent crime .
Only 1 percent found it to the best way to achieve that goal .
Adding police officers ranked first .
The death row population in 2007 , the most - recent statistic available from the Justice Department , was 3,220 .
It was at 2,250 two decades ago , but the numbers have not grown significantly since 2000 .
Forty executions have occurred so far in 2009 in 10 states , all by lethal injection .
That total is up from 37 for all of last year , but less than half of the high of 98 , from 10 years ago .
The Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976 .
Ohio recently suspended lethal injections after corrections officials were forced to cancel the execution of Romell Broom last month , when a suitable vein could not be found after two hours of trying .
Virginia plans a Nov. 10 execution for John Allen Muhammad , the so - called Beltway Sniper , convicted of randomly killing 10 people in 2002 with a high - powered rifle .
The Death Penalty Information Center study found that death penalty costs can average $ 10 million more per year per state than life sentences .
Increased costs include higher security needs and guaranteed access to an often lengthy pardon and appellate process .
The group is an information resource on capital punishment , and opposes its application as unworkable , inefficient and prone to mistakes .
Florida , where two men have been put to death this year , spends an average of $ 24 million per execution .
That average has remained consistent since 2005 , according to the Death Penalty Information Center .
Do n't Miss Willingham juror no longer sure of his guilt in Texas case
Many death penalty proponents say part of the problem is that states have added unnecessary , time - consuming delays , and have been reluctant to carry out the death penalty that their own legislatures have enacted .
They say states should carry out the wishes of judges and juries that weighed evidence and imposed death on the worst murderers .
Death penalty supporters acknowledge that states outside the South have been reluctant to impose the punishment , even in the face of rising big - city crime rates .
" I think we need to build support for the death penalty and need to impose it more regularly where it is warranted , " Kent Scheidegger , legal director of the Sacramento , California - based Criminal Justice Legal Foundation told CNN earlier this year .
Having the death penalty can offer powerful incentives in plea bargaining , Scheidegger said , and could provide states with large savings in trial and incarceration costs .
His group conducted a study earlier this year comparing murder cases resolved by guilty plea with those that went to trial .
In states with the death penalty , the average county obtained sentences of at least 20 years in almost 51 percent of cases in which the defendant was charged with murder and convicted of murder or voluntary manslaughter .
Those sentences were reached through a guilty plea in about 19 percent of the cases .
In states without the death penalty , sentences of at least 20 years were obtained in 40 percent of those cases , but only 5 percent were guilty pleas , about one - quarter of the number in the death penalty states .
That study relied on U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics data from 33 large urban counties .
One example cited by Scheidegger of the plea bargaining effect involved Shaun Earl Arender .
He confessed this year to the sexual assault and murder of 6 - year - old Hanna Mack in Texas , and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in return for avoiding the death penalty .
Texas consistently leads the nation with the most executions .
Eleven state legislatures have considered repealing the death penalty this year .
New Mexico has banned it , and Maryland has narrowed the criteria under which it can be used .
Kansas , New Hampshire and the U.S. military are the only jurisdictions that have death penalty laws but have not conducted any executions since 1976 .
Lethal injection is used in the vast majority of executions , but electrocution , the gas chamber , hanging and firing squad remain as alternative methods .

In a flurry of announcements on Tuesday ahead of the holiday shopping season , the companies introduced new phones , wireless carrier partnerships and efforts to boost the availability of new applications for the phones .
The moves underscore the extent to which the smartphone market has emerged as a prime battleground encompassing a variety of technology businesses and one of the few markets experiencing rapid growth in a rough economic environment .
“ Everyone wants to build up and bolster their smartphone portfolio , because that ’s what drives more dollars for the carrier and that ’s where the market is going , ” said Avian Securities analyst Matthew Thornton .
Google , the world ’s largest Internet search company , said it was teaming up with Verizon Wireless to co-develop multiple phones based on its Android operating system .
They plan to bring two phones to market this year , and Verizon Wireless CEO Lowell McAdam said the partnership could result in the introduction of multiple devices per year going forward .
The partnership with Verizon Wireless , a venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc , is a boost for Google ’s efforts to gain a foothold in the smartphone market .
It caps a string of Android phone announcements , including Motorola Inc ’s recent introduction of the Cliq phone and HTC ’s Hero phone , slated for U.S. release next week .
Google does not charge a licensing fee for Android but hopes to benefit by serving highly targeted mobile ads to users .
Microsoft , whose software is used in the majority of the world ’s PCs , unveiled on Tuesday a new version of its smartphone software , Windows Mobile 6.5 , and promised more than 30 new devices with the software would be available in more than 20 countries by year ’s end .
According to research firm IDC , smartphones running Microsoft software accounted for 11 percent of the worldwide market in the first half of 2009 , compared to 11.7 percent share for Apple ’s iPhone and 19.9 percent share for Research in Motion ’s Blackberry .
Nokia ’s Symbian operating system had the largest share with 46.4 percent share .
IPHONE THE ONE TO BEAT
But analysts say that Apple ’s iPhone , despite its modest share of the market , is the product to beat .
“ It may not be reflected in the numbers , but everyone is playing catch - up ” with Apple , said C.L. King analyst Lawrence Harris .
In addition to the technological innovations ushered in by the iPhone , such as its multi- touch screen , Harris said that Apple is the clear leader when it comes to the software apps created by third - party developers to work with a smartphone .
Apple has 85,000 apps available through its iPhone Apps store .
“ The fact that a particular app is available can help drive the purchasing decision , ” said Harris .
In a sign of how critical apps have become in the smartphone race , Microsoft also announced the launch of a new marketplace for Windows Mobile applications .
And Palm announced it was making its “ WebOS ” smartphone software more open for outside developers to create applications .
Google said there are more than 10,000 free and paid apps available for Android smartphones .
Verizon Wireless and Google sought to play up the open nature of Android apps compared to the tight control that Apple exercises over its software .
The first Android phones from Verizon Wireless will support the Google Voice software application , which allows consumers to make low - priced international calls and which Apple has yet to approve for its iPhone .
“ You either have an open device or not .
This will be open and we expect to bring that application to market when we bring the first device out , ” said Verizon ’s McAdam , referring to Google Voice .
Google has said that Apple rejected Google Voice , while Apple contends it is still evaluating the software , in a high - profile spat that has attracted the attention of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission .
On Tuesday , AT&T Inc , which has the exclusive rights to the iPhone in the U.S. , said it will allow third - party Internet telephone calls to be on the iPhone using AT&T ’s third generation network , reversing a previous position to ban such calls due to revenue concerns .

They 're being molested by the sodomites .
I can tell you so many stories about people that I know being molested and recruited by the sodomites .
They recruit through rape .

Because each sodomite recruits far more than one other sodomite because his whole life is about recruiting other sodomites , his whole life is about violating and hurting people and molesting 'em .
The French legislature today passed into law a second version of the ultra - controversial HADOPI " three strikes " law that targets illegal Internet file - swappers .
The revised proposal does address the concerns of the " Sages " who sit on France 's Constitutional Council who objected to the first version of the law , but it does little to mollify critics .
Internet disconnections of up to a year can be ordered by a single judge in a " streamlined " proceeding , while Internet users who fail to " secure " their connections can also be punished if other people use those connections to exchange copyrighted material .
The National Assembly passed HADOPI 2 today by a margin of 285 - 225 ; the Senate has already passed the legislation .
After HADOPI 1 passed earlier this year , the Constitutional Council objected on the groups that such severe penalties had to be overseen by a judge , not merely the new HADOPI administrative authority .
HADOPI 2 addresses these complaints by adopting a quick process overseen by one judge when disconnections become an issue .
La Quadrature du Net , a French digital rights group , continues to protest the changes .
In their reading of the bill , HADOPI 2's new judicial procedure — " so far restricted to only a few categories of simple litigation such as traffic regulation — fails to guarantee the right to a fair trial .
It does not include any contradictory debate or public hearing ; the ruling is made without any prior judicial investigation . "
HADOPI 2 also preserves an earlier attempt to outlaw the " open WiFi defense " under which an accused file - sharer simply makes clear that anyone could have used his connection .
Under the new law , all Internet users must keep their connections " secure " and are responsible for what happens on them .
While the new judicial oversight may placate both the Constitutional Council and the European Parliament — groups that have each objected to a purely administrative process — opponents of the law plan another appeal to the Council on further constitutional grounds .

Road repair equipment in AM fog • click to embiggenToday was the day for Leica to announce / reveal their newest digital cameras , to include their new flagship rangefinder M9 ( 18 mp full frame sensor ) .
And so it has come to pass and it can be yours for $ 9,000 US .
On a certain photo blog / site there has been much to do about how this camera , although expensive , actually represents good dollar value because Leicas go for big bucks on the used market .
Assuming that you can come up with the price of entry ( which does not include a lens like , say , the Leica 24 mm f/1.4 Summilux - M Aspherical Manual Focus Lens , which will set you back a cool $ 5,995 US ) , this may indeed be true .
On the other hand , in the digital camera world this may indeed NOT be true .
A quick check for a used Leica M8 body - Leica 's most recent digital rangefinder flagship - on ebay revealed that they can be had for up to 40 % less than they sell for new .
Considering that the M8 has n't been around for very long , that 's a very hefty depreciation for a Leica camera .
That may be due , in part , to the fact the M8 had some ... ahhh ... " problems " which hopefully got fixed this time around , but ....
There is absolutely no guarantee that a Leica digital camera will hold its value better - as a % of original purchase price - than any other manufacturer 's digital cameras will .
As we all know , " flagship " digital cameras come and go seemingly with the wind , at least with the winds of digital change , that is .
All that said , here 's what I 'm waiting for - I 'm dreading the day , and it 's probably coming soon , that Olympus will be introducing their next " flagship " .
Even though they have declared that 12 mp is enough , they have stated that their intent is to concentrate upon improving things like dynamic range , noise , resolution and the like - things that matter much more than more mp when it comes to IQ .
Good for them .
These are things that with noticeable improvement would motivate me to " upgrade " to a new flagship model , but ...
These improvements are obtained by improving a camera 's sensor and internal processing software , not the camera body .
Sooooo .... when is a camera maker going to design a body with an interchangeable sensor capability ?
Now , I 'm not asking for a user - changeable sensor - I 'd be more than happy to separate myself from a camera body for long enough to have the sensor changed by an authorized repair facility .
No problem .
My Olympus E - 3 has superb build quality - it can probably last a " lifetime " like , say , the 2 Nikon film camera bodies sitting on a shelf ( right within arm 's reach of where I am sitting ) , but , unlike the Nikons , which can keep on making pictures until all the film runs out , my E - 3 is destined to become a superbly built paperweight in fairly short order ( by film camera standards ) .
Operating under the assumption that the current sensor in my camera can be replaced if it were to be damaged or become defective in some manner , how difficult can it be to design the body so that the next generation sensor - along with a software upgrade - can be inserted ?
Seriously , how hard can that be ?
SAFETY NOTE :
NEVER PLACE dry ice into a closed container such as a soda bottle .
The bottle can explode with a loud bang , damaging your eardrums .
Loose plastic , such as the bottle cap , may fly off , damaging someone 's eyes .
THIS HAS HAPPENED ! ( VIDEO ) DON'T DO IT !
What 's Dry Ice ?
Dry ice is frozen Carbon Dioxide , or CO 2 , which is a gas under standard temperature and pressure conditions .
The atmosphere contains about .035 % of this gas .
CO 2 is a greenhouse gas , which means it absorbs light at infrared wavelengths .
An increase in the concentration of this gas would , some scientists believe , cause an increase in the atmosphere 's average temperature .
The high concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere of the planet Venus is said to contribute to that planet 's high average temperature .
At normal atmospheric pressure on this planet , frozen CO 2 does n't melt into a liquid , but rather evaporates directly into its gaseous form .
Hence the name dry ice .
This process is called sublimation .
All of the experiments below rely on this property of dry ice .
1 pound of dry ice , when it sublimates ( turns to gas ) will produce 250 liters of gas at atmospheric pressure , enough to fill 125 2 - liter bottles .
That 's a lot of gas !
Getting Dry Ice
Dry ice is commonly available from ice dealers in two forms : flat square slabs a few inches thick and about eight inches on a side ; or cylinders about half an inch in diameter and from a half to 2 ½ inches long .
The price for ten pounds is around six dollars .
If you buy less than this you will pay about a dollar per pound .
Storing and Transporting Dry Ice
Dry ice continuously sublimates as heat enters it from its surroundings .
The CO 2 gas that evolves must be vented from the container .
Do not seal dry ice into a container except as detailed below , because an explosive bursting of the container can result .
A Styrofoam ( polystyrene foam ) ice chest with a loose fitting lid makes a good container for transporting dry ice .
Handling Dry Ice
Due to its extremely cold temperature ( - 78.5 oC , or - 109.3 oF ) , dry ice can cause damage to the skin if handled .
Use tongs or insulating gloves when handling dry ice .
It is also important when crushing or grinding the solid not to get any of the dust into your eyes .
Wear protective goggles .
Popping Film Cans
A fun ( and often wild ) activity vividly demonstrates the sublimation process .
Place a piece of dry ice into a plastic 35 mm film container - the kind that has the snap - on cap .
Then wait .
The cap will pop off , and sometimes fly several meters .
The clear Fuji brand containers shoot farther than the gray and black Kodak type .
Warn anyone performing this experiment not to aim for anyone 's eyes .
Inflate A Balloon
Grab an uninflated balloon and force the neck open with the index and middle fingers of both hands , stretching the balloon open .
This will allow a partner to drop in one or more pellets of dry ice .
Tie the balloon closed .
Set aside , and observe for awhile .
Better yet , drop the balloon into a pond or swimming pool .
This will help supply heat to the dry ice .
At first , the balloon will sink , but soon , as it begins to inflate , it will rise to the surface .
If you manage to put enough dry ice into the balloon , it will eventually reach the bursting point .
Again , this is lots of fun if the balloon is in a pool .
Sound Lens Using a Balloon
A balloon full of CO 2 gas can act as a sound lens , because sound travels more slowly in CO 2 than it does in air , Just as light travels more slowly in glass than in air or vacuum .
Do not use a balloon for this if it is over - inflated , or if it contains remaining pieces of dry ice , because the balloon could burst , causing temporary or even permanent deafness .
Hold the balloon about a foot from your ear , and listen for faint sounds , such as a radio turned low , a ticking clock or a distant conversation , to appear louder .
Hero's Engine
Using a push pin , or a straight pin held in pliers , poke two holes into opposite sides of a film can , near the bottom .
The holes should be off - center , like pinwheel rockets .
Tie a loop in a length of thread .
The loop should fit loosely over the cap of the film can , so that when you loop it over the cap , and snap the cap onto the can , you can hold the can by the remaining length of thread .
Place a small piece of dry ice into the can .
Then quickly add some warm water , and close the lid , with the thread attached .
Lift the can by the thread , and watch what happens .
Singing Spoon
Hold a warm spoon by its handle , and press itfirmly against a chunk of dry ice .
The spoon will scream loudly as the heat of the spoon causes the dry ice to instantly turn to gas where the two make contact .
The pressure of this gas pushes the spoon away from the dry ice , and without contact , the dry ice stops sublimating .
The spoon falls back into contact again , and the cycle repeats .
This all happens so quickly that the spoon vibrates , causing the singing sound you hear .
Fog Effects
When you place dry ice into some warm or hot water , clouds of white fog are created .
This white fog is not the CO 2 gas , but rather it is condensed water vapor , mixed in with the invisible CO 2 .
The extreme cold causes the water vapor to condense into clouds .
The fog is heavy , being carried by the CO 2 , and will settle to the bottom of a container , and can be poured .
You can produce enough ground - hugging fog to fill a medium sized room with a pound or so of dry ice .
Do not allow anyone to lay down in this fog , or allow babies or pets into it , as CO 2 gas does not support life .
Dry ice fog allows low powered laser beams to be seen ; see the laser experiments page for details .
Also , see our Fog Generator page .
Carbonation
Dry ice , being frozen CO 2 gas , can be used to carbonate water to create sparkling water .
Place some drinking water in a glass , and add some dry ice .
Allow it to bubble .
Water ice may form around the dry ice .
If this happens you can either leave it alone , or break it up with a spoon to help the process along .
When all of the dry ice is gone , taste the water that remains .
It should taste slightly carbonated .
I have n't tried to see what happens when you do this in a closed container , as I have n't yet determined what is a safe quantity of dry ice to add , that will carbonate the water yet not burst the container .
See safety note above .
So I would strongly caution you against doing this , unless you take the proper safety precautions , such as providing a secondary container ( a coffee can perhaps ? ) to catch any projected pieces of plastic soda bottle .
Also , cover your ears or use earplugs , just in case the container bursts .
Do n't do the experiment in a glass container !
If you do this experiment , take careful data , and email me the results .
I 'd be interested in what you find out !

What would have happened if Simon de Montfort had failed and the Crown of Aragon had continued its northern expansion ?
What would have happened if the Castilian and Portuguese counties had n't survived ?
What if the Sami people had had their own country ?
Or if the Austrians had avoided being robbed Tyrol by the Italians ?
Or if Bavaria had refused to be a part of the German Empire during the XIX century ?
Or if ...?
When reading history , there are many occasions where one asks himself questions like this and speculates about the changes those would bring to a political map .
For years , I 've accumulated many of these ideas ( some are mine , others I 've picked up from other people 's comments , wether they were talking out of their asses or not ) , and I 've decided to redraw the political map of Europe cramming as many of those as I could .
Afterwards , I constructed all the necessary points of divergence to explain the existing differences .
It must be noted that the following map is historically impossible , that the ideas " written into " it can be even contradictory , and fluctuate beween the grounded historical demands ( which could actually happen , should there be the political will ) and outright crazy and inviable assertions , and , finally , that some points of divergence are better constructed than others ( because I know some areas / ages of European history better than others ) .
Do not forget this is a simple theoretical exercise , and I do n't advocate or support any of the ideas present here ( although I do like some of them ) .
Note : when mousing over the map , the image will be replaced with a map of current Europe ; clicking on it will bring a higher resolution version of this alternate Europe .
This alternate Europe differs from the real one due to the following changes :
English expansionism made the different neighboring kingdoms and fiefdoms form a military alliance to stop it ; as centuries passed , the Celtic League ( formed by Scotland , Ireland , Man , Wales , Kernow and Britain ) has become a cohesive federation , considered for many intents and purposes to be a single nation ( although Britain is somewhat isolated and its main peril is France , not England ) .
It 's one of the three West Catholic Countries , so the other two ( Leon and the Pyrenaic Kingdom ) are its natural allies .
The Kingdoms of Portugal and Castille were unable to remain independent for long , and ended up reabsorbed by Leon , the hegemonic local kingdom .
Since the early XIII century , this was the only one in charge of the Reconquista ( as Aragon was focused on its northward expansion ) and ended up occupying the rest of the Iberian Peninsula .
Occitania suffered dearly the Albigensian Crusade and French abuses .
When Peter II of Aragon annihilated Simon de Montfort , his victory and popularity allowed him to expand his transpyrenaic lands , keeping in check French expansionism .
The Pyrenaic Kingdom was formed by uniting into a single entity the Crown of Aragon , the Kingdom of Navarre ( handed over to King James I after Sancho VII died without a heir , as agreed by the Treaty of Tudela ) and almost all of the lands that formed Occitania .
Since the late XIV century , relations with the neighboring Leon are optimal , as the ( progressively fewer ) frictions between the governments of Toledo and Figueres are quickly mediated and solved by the Peñíscola Pope ; it goes without saying that both countries are close allies .
The attempt to end the Western Schism took an unexpected turn : the Council of Constance deposed John XXII , Gregory XII and Benedict XIII ( who had refused to acknowledge the council and therefore rebuffed any of its decisions ) ; at first , this was accepted by everybody , but the election of Celestine VI , German Emperor Sigismund 's puppet , was rejected by the leonese , navarre and aragonese .
After their demands were not listened , the iberian kingdoms switched their allegiance back to Benedict XIII ; he quickly excommunicated Rome and moved the papal residency from Avignon to Peñíscola , where he could be better protected .
A few weeks later , during a new war against England , loyal to Rome , all the kingdoms in the Celtic League also swore allegiance to Peñíscola .
The Peñíscola Papal State corresponds to the homonym city , ceded to this effect by Aragon in 1420 .
Today , the defense of this city ‑state is jointly held by Leon and the Pyrenaic Kingdom .
Up to the present , relations with the Roman Catholic Church are cold and tense ( on the other hand , relations with the Orthodox Church are much warmer , although they 're inevitably distant ) ; Occidental Catholic countries suffered discrimination and isolation from Central Europe , but this was compensated by the 1481 discovery of the West Indies ( the Neoiberian continent ) , carved up between leonese , celts and pyrenaics ( which , in spite of being more of a mediterranean country , were able to take advantage of the opportunities opened up by their atlantic allies ) .
Currently , West Catholics worldwide outnumber Roman Catholics .
Wars in Scandinavia never reached any conclusive results , because neither Denmark , Norway nor Sweden had any distinct advantage over the others .
Sweden never conquered Botuslän , Halland , Scania and Bornholm , although it did manage to avoid a union between Denmark and Norway .
Further north , the Sami organized themselves as a nation , keeping all their lands and slightly expanding them .
Their alliance with their finn cousins allowed the latter to form a stronger country , that kept both Sweden and Russia in line , managing at the same time to retain all of Karelia .
In 1860 , Switzerland passed a law forbiding its citizens to serve as mercenaries abroad , but the Sicilian ambassador skillfuly brokered a deal with the government , creating an exception for his kingdom .
When Garibaldi first attacked Sicily , he was defeated and killed .
The later events in the north and the difficult conquest of the Roman Papal States postponed italian ambitions in the south ; finally , Italy was forced to give up in 1880 its alleged rights over Sicily , as the latter had signed a military alliance with the Pyrenaic Kingdom .
Although at first the Bavarian king supported the german unification process , he was worried about the cultural and religious differences between the protestant north and the roman catholic south .
Finally , after extremely hard negotiations between Ludwig II , Wilhem I and Franz Joseph I , it was agreed in 1871 to reduce the scope of the Kleindeutsche Lösung , creating two new german states : Germany ( sometimes called North Germany ) , led by Prussia , and Bavaria ‑Württemberg ( nowadays known as Bavaria ) , formed by the southern german states .
Luxembourg , constantly threatened by France , ended up joining Germany .
During the years immediately after the creation of the Two Germanies , an extremely shrewd propaganda campaign managed to convince most Swiss Germans that a union with Bavaria would be a good thing , so most German cantons joined it .
After this abandonment , the Helvetic Confederation was dissolved ; French cantons joined France , Italian cantons were annexed by Italy and the remaining German cantons ( Graubünden , Saint Gallen , Appenzell Innerrhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden ) along with the Romansh areas joined Austria ( the latter ones actually feared for their language and cultural identity if they became part of Italy ) .
Liechtenstein , now entirely surrounded by Austria , accepted the inevitable annexation some time later .
After surviving two murder attempts in a single day , Archduke Franz Ferdinand understood that the Austro ‑Hungarian Empire was n't viable the way it was organized .
After ascending to the throne in 1916 , he quickly adopted Aurel Popovici 's proposal of transforming the empire into a federation of monoethnic states ( the " United States of Greater Austria " ) , and implemented it , disregarding the Hungarian 's resistance and the imperial court 's reluctance , which feared the empire would break apart .
Indeed , said federation had a short life and was soon dissolved ; some of its members are still independent states , while the others joined other countries .
The Kingdom of Austria kept , in general , all the german ‑speaking contiguous territories .
Hungary was forced to give up most of its lands , as those corresponded to other ethnical groups .
Almost all of the Hungarian population was left within the country 's new borders .
German Bohemia and German Moravia voted to join North Germany .
Bohemia and Slovakia formed independent states that survive until today .
West Galicia : independent until it joined the recently liberated Poland .
East Galicia : independent until it joined the recently liberated Ukraine ( nowadays Rutenia ) .
Trentino : independent until its annexation by Italy .
Trieste : ceded by Austria to Italy in the Treaty of Reus .
Transylvania and Székely : according to the Treaty of Reus , both were to be independent states that would n't seek union with , respectively , Romania and Hungary .
None of the involved parties kept its word and the end result was a large hungarian enclave in the middle of Romania , which causes tensions between both countries until today .
Vojvodina was carved up between Serbia and Hungary .
Croatia y Slovenia joined Serbia to form the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( later Yugoslavia ) .
Franz Ferdinand paid a steep price for the empire 's dismemberment : at first he was the king of each state within the federation , but in less than a year he had lost all but four titles ( king of Austria , Hungary , Bohemia and Slovakia ) .
Romania and Transylvania 's unification led to a revolt in Hungary , which ended with the creation of the Hungarian Republic in 1923 .
This was used as an excuse to also depose Franz Ferdinand in Austria , who was replaced by his nephew Karl I ; on the other hand , Bohemia and Slovakia kept their loyalty ; Franz Ferdinand moved to Prague and ruled as king of both countries in personal union until his death in 1935 .
Even today , Franz Ferdinand is despised in Austria and Hungary , as they believe his reforms were too radical and escaped his control , destroying the empire and decimating Hungary .
On the other hand , in the neighboring slavic countries and in Romania , he 's widely respected , as they consider he solved a serious problem that could have ended in a huge bloodbath , and he can't be held responsible for the skirmishes and little wars in the years following the partition .
In 1916 , Greece attacked the Ottoman Empire to finish liberating Greek ‑populated lands ; they counted , once again , with Leon 's unrestrained military support , where this war was known as the " Final Reconquista Campaign in Europe " .
The war ended with a strong Greco ‑Leonese victory ; after its defeat , the Ottoman Empire fell into civil war , and several oppresed ethnic groups ( Arabs , Armenians , etcetera ) took advantage of it to declare independence ; Greece also exploited this situation to push the border even further east , to compensate — from their point of view — having had to give up their claims over territories such as Pontus and parts of Cappadocia ( provinces that were too far away for an effective military occupation ) and most of Western Thrace ( which was under dispute with Bulgaria , and ended up being divided between the two countries ) .
Nowadays , the Turkish Republic only spans part of the Anatolian Peninsula .
Proof of the Greek 's gratitude towards their allies is that in 1930 they renamed the city and province of Çanakkale ; instead of reinstating the old name for the area ( Dardanellia ) , they chose Lion ( " Λιοντάρι " in Greek , after " León " ) .
New symbols for the place where chosen as well , mixing the colors of the Greek flag with Leon 's coat of arms : the new coat of arms is blazoned as " Azure , four bars argent [ the Greek flag 's colors ] , a lion rampant purpure , armed and langued gules [ taken straight from Leon 's coat of arms , minus the crown ] . " ) , design that is also used on the new provincial flag .
During the Greek ‑Ottoman war , at a particular moment where it seemed Bulgaria would attack Greece ( due to their dispute over Western Thrace ) , Albania 's Prime Minister made the mistake of making grandstanding declarations , threatening to enter the war on the Ottoman Empire 's side ... just one day before numerous Leonese reinforcements reached Greece .
General Gregorio Pintos , the commanding officer , decided ( without consulting with anyone ) to invade Albania from the south ; in just five days he had taken almost all of Northern Epirus , thanks to the surprise factor in his initial attack , to the small reaction capability of the Albanese military forces ... and to the overjoyed cooperation of the local Greek population , who until then had been trying , unsuccessfully , to be part of Greece and not Albania .
During the two weeks following the invasion , General Pintos expelled the local Albanese population , who had to take refuge on the other side of the new border , and installed a provisional government for Northern Epirus , composed exclusively by Greek residents .
Once the zone was secured , he left one fourth of his forces to protect it from a potential counterattack and travelled with the rest to Thessaloniki .
Once there , the Greek military high command tried to reprehend General Pintos for his reckless actions , but he defended himself stating he had followed his orders ( disembark his forces in Igoumenitsa and take them to Thessaloniki ) and he had simply taken a scenic route .
Since his lightning campaign had scared the Bulgarians back to the negotiating table , nothing happened to the general .
Meanwhile , this embarrassing defeat forced the fall of the Albanese government and the collapse of the Principality of Albania .
By the time the Republic of Albania had risen , the loss of Northern Epirus was a fait accompli : there were almost no Albanese left there , and the remaining population had decided , by acclamation , to become a part of Greece ; the new Albanese government had no choice but to sign in 1921 a peace treaty with Greece and Leon that formally accepted the state of things .
The trauma this ... skirmish ... produced in the Albanese population was so bad that even today , all of the zoos in the country refuse to keep lions ( as well as Neoiberian big cats : cougars and jaguars ) .
The continuous social upheaval in Russia led to a civil war in 1918 .
Due to the central government 's weakness , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Ukraine and Byelorussia became independent ( although the latter one rejoined soon afterwards ) .
Fully aware that Russia would soon be knocking at their doors , Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania formed the Baltic Federation .
They 're currently under North Germany 's sphere of influence , something that has made German ‑Russian relations rather difficult ; this has had the side effect of allowing Poland to keep existing , filling the role of a buffer state .
During the ' 80s , internal divisions in Yugoslavia became so pronounced that a civil war seemed unavoidable .
However , during Holy Week in 1990 ( which that year coincided in both Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches ) the main extremist leaders on each side ( Milošević , Tuđman , Mladić , Gotovina , et cetera ) were eliminated with selective assassinations .
The surviving moderate politicians , frightened by this series of operations , were forced to negotiate a peaceful agreement .
In the end , Yugoslavia split up in four :
In the extreme north , Slovenia .
In the north and center , Croatia , formed by croatians and muslims .
In the south and center , Serbia .
In the southern coast , Montenegro ( integrated into Serbia ) .
In the southern coast , Montenegro ( integrated into Serbia ) .
In the extreme south , Macedonia .
Slovenian and Macedonian borders were well defined and ( except for a change to allow the former better access to the sea in the Istrian Peninsula ) did not pose any problems .
On the other hand , the border between Serbia and Croatia took months of difficult negotiations , but in the end an agreement was reached where both parties were reasonably unhappy .
Until this day , it 's unknown who was behind the " Bloody Holy Week " murders , although it 's safe to assume it was a group of high officials in the Yugoslavian Army , who decided to avoid a war by any means necessary .
The only captured killer , a Serbian called Mirko Princip , commited suicide before he could be interrogated .
In Ukraine , disputes in the result of the 2004 presidential election ended up in a civil war that split the country in two : the pro‑rusian southeastern half was annexed by Russia , while the northwestern segment ( pro Central Europe ) kept its independence ; a few weeks after the war , it changed its name to Rutenia to accentuate its distance from Russia .
After almost two centuries of indifferent cohabitation , Walloons and Flemish reached an agreement in 2007 to peacefully split up .
Wallonia approved joining France in a plebiscite , while Flanders joined Netherlands immediately .
Even the Beemers get into the hunting ...
I am ready to stand corrected , but I think this is historic .
The motion approved is particularly notable because a proffered soft - Zionist amendment attempting to introduce some spurious ' balance ' and ' moderation ' into the motion was defeated .
The motion condemns the attack on Gaza , calls for TUC support for the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions campaign , and is harshly critical of the racist Israeli trade union federation Histradut for having backed the Gaza aggression .
Given that previous efforts to raise the boycott issue within national trade unions have often been followed by retreat under sustained counterattacks and legal threats by Israel 's apologists , it is significant that the support for a boycott among trade unionists would appear to have increased .
This is undoubtedly a result of the criminal attack on Gaza earlier this year .
If this is actually implemented , it means the BDS campaign has real social weight behind it .
It also means that Zionists of all shades are about to throw a massive tantrum .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Authorities in the home city of British urban artist Banksy plan to become the first to allow a regular public vote on whether popular works of street graffiti should stay or be removed .
Graffiti art is seen on a building in the Stokes Croft area of Bristol , September 9 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Phil Noble
The move by Bristol council in the west of England follows a sell - out Banksy exhibition in the city that attracted 300,000 visitors and boosted the local economy by an estimated 10 million pounds ( $ 17 million ) .
Councilors are expected to formally adopt the policy in coming weeks , breaking ranks with other authorities in Britain that adopt a no-tolerance attitude to graffiti .
“ The policy we had inherited was basically scrub everything off unless ( the artists ) have got prior permission , ” said councilor Gary Hopkins , cabinet member for Environment and Community Safety .
Under the new policy , unsightly graffiti will still be removed swiftly , but the council will consult on murals or artwork “ deemed to make a positive contribution to the local environment ” and where the property owner has no objections .
Some street paintings will be put on a council website so the public can vote on their merits , said Hopkins .
“ Anything that is potentially regardable as art , that people might want to keep , we ’ll potentially put up on the website .
“ Some stuff , we would n’t really need to ask , for completely the opposite reason , because people love it . ”
The move has its origins in a debate in 2006 over whether a Banksy mural on the side of a Bristol sex health clinic should be allowed to stay .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
The witty image showed a naked man clinging to a window ledge while a besuited man looks out with a semi-clad woman lingering in the background , and was backed by 93 percent of those who took part in an online vote .
The decision on the Banksy mural set the stage for the change of policy , said Hopkins .
“ It was just ludicrous to spend council money scrubbing off works of art that people actually liked -- it was a tourist attraction . ”
Bristol has a long tradition of urban art , much of it centered on the run-down Stokes Croft area in the city center .
The side of one building in the district , formerly covered in scrawled aerosol signatures , or tags , has been transformed with a mural of a vast red wave in the style of 19th century Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai .
Local activist and street artist Chris Chalkley said such well - executed urban paintings actually improved the local environment and discouraged teenage graffiti .
“ It generates a sense of community and sense of pride and respect in the area , ” said Chalkley , chairman of community activist body the People ’s Republic of Stokes Croft .
And such regeneration can come cheap .
“ You can make a big change with a small pot of paint , ” he said .
The only expenditure for the red wave mural was the 300 pounds ’ worth of masonry paint used -- the artists worked for free .
Bristol ’s policy contrasts with other councils , such as Westminster in central London which last year ordered the Royal Mail to remove a Banksy mural from the side of a building .
The 7 - meter - high painting showed a police officer filming a small girl while she paints the words “ One nation under CCTV . ”
Westminster deputy leader Robert Davis said at the time : “ I take the view that this is graffiti and if you condone this then what is the difference between this and all the other graffiti you see scrawled across the city ? ”

EPISODE SYNOPSIS :
Could have happened , right ?
Israel is to return the bodies of 84 Palestinian fighters killed in Israel since 1967 .
The deal , reached following extensive negotiations between Israel and Palestinian leaders , was announced by Palestinian Authority Minister of Civil Affairs Hussein Ash - Sheikh to Maan News on Monday .
The bodies of 84 Palestinians killed in hostilities between Israel and Palestinian fighters since 1967 will be returned to the PA .
The bodies have until now been kept in Israel in what Israel calls ‘ enemy fighter cemeteries ’ .
Palestinian forensic experts are due to travel to the sites in order to identify the bodies which currently lie with no names , gravestone or other means of identification .
PA President Mahmoud Abbas will attend a farewell ceremony for the deceased before the bodies are returned to families .
In cases where the families are abroad the PA will arrange for their transfer .
Ynet claims that the transfer of the bodies is unlikely to be related to an exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit but an Israeli gesture ahead of Ramadan .
The cemeteries which the bodies are currently kept in are referred to as ‘ cemeteries of numbers ’ by Palestinians , referring to the numbers used to identify the grave plots .
Palestinians say the graves are often shallow and made of sand making them vulnerable to damage from weather .

Akira Live Action Movie Still Coming
| By
Earlier this summer it was reported that director Ruairi Robinson had left the live action adaptation of Akira , and that the project was dead .
Fans had been waiting for Akira to get off the ground for years .
Now , Collider.com is now reporting that Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby ( Iron Man , Children of Men ) are about to submit a script .
The project has been kept secret as they have been working on getting the script “ just right ” .
If Warner Bros. likes the script , they could go into production next year for a 2011 release .
The Warner Brothers execs are said to be excited about the ambitious project .
This could be good news because the scribes behind Children of Men and Iron Man are obviously talented at working with rich material .
Akira is no easy property to handle , the original 1986 anime was made by Katsuhiro Otomo based off the original 2,182 - page manga epic .
It should be interesting to see what they can come up with but CGI and film technique should allow for a incredible Akira to be produced .
Akira is a bit like a Japanese Road Warrior , although that ’s definitely selling it short .
Akira is largely responsible for the Anime invasion that hit the United States in the early 1990’s .
At the time it was called “ Japanimation ” which I must admit I thought had a much catchier name .
Should be an interesting movie project to keep an eye on .
The Ares 1 rocket programme is too expensive and too late , the report says A White House panel has suggested that Nasa should scrap its investment in the Ares 1 rocket and use commercial vehicles to launch astronauts instead .
The option has been put forward by a presidential advisory panel as part of a review of the US space programme .
The suggestions come just days before a test version of the Ares 1 is due to make a demonstration flight .
The review says the Ares 1 is too expensive to replace the space shuttle , and will be ready too late .
The review also suggests US policy shift away from Moon - focused initiatives for human space exploration towards other destinations .
Panel Chairman Norman Augustine said that astronauts could aim for a nearby asteroid or one of the moons of Mars , with the ultimate goal being a landing on the Red Planet .
Space taxis Nasa currently spends about half of its $ 18bn annual budget on human space exploration .
Some $ 8bn has already been invested in the agency 's post - shuttle plans , which go under the name of the Constellation programme .
These plans include the proposed Ares I rocket , its crew carrier called Orion , and a heavy - lift rocket known as Ares 5 .
The prototype Ares - 1X rocket is one of a number of demonstration vehicles which will lead eventually to the introduction of the Ares 1
But the panel said the rocket would not be ready to serve as a launcher for space station crews until 2017 , by which time the International Space Station might have been removed from orbit .
" The slippage has caused a mismatch between what Ares 1 is needed for and what it 's going to be able to do , " Mr Augustine said .
Private option
The panel puts forward the option of making greater use of the commercial sector to take astronauts to low - Earth orbit .
If private space taxis took over the ferrying of crews to and from the space station , the Augustine committee said , it would free the space agency to focus on more challenging projects such as getting humans out into the Solar System .
But the government would have to invest about $ 5bn in the private sector to help it develop , the advisory group added .
" It is very clear that no commercial entity could raise the risk capital to build a rocket and capsule and recover the costs in our lifetime , " Ed Crawley , a committee member and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said .
Nasa would be the anchor customer for the taxis , but rides could also be sold to other countries , scientists and to space tourists .

The defenders of supply - side economics have regaled conservatives with this slogan , “ deficits do n’t matter , ” from the late 1970 ’s until today .
As far as I can determine , this was the only idea to come out of the supply - side movement that was ever agreed to by the mainstream Keynesians and Chicago School economists .
They all agree : Federal deficits do n’t matter .
Someday , yes , but not yet .
Not now .
Do n’t worry .
Be happy .
According to a recent article by Dr. Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation , deficits do matter .
They are going to matter a whole lot more over the next decade .
They are going to matter to people who are dependent on the Federal government for handouts .
That is a large number of people .
He writes :
The Office of Management and Budget has released its annual mid-session review that updates the budget projections from this past May .
They show that this year , Washington will spend $ 30,958 per household , tax $ 17,576 per household , and borrow $ 13,392 per household .
Think about that .
For every American household — about a hundred million — the Federal government will spend $ 31,000 .
Wait a minute .
The typical American household makes about $ 46,000 a year .
Are we to believe that the Federal government will spend , in the name of the American people , $ 31,000 per household ?
That each household will be taxed — income taxes , Social Security taxes , corporate taxes , etc. — $ 17,000 ?
That is what the figures say .
Dividing $ 46,000 by $ 17,000 is 37 % .
Can that be possible ?
Add to this another $ 13,000 in debt .
That is what the government ’s statistics report .
Anyone who thinks an extra $ 13,000 in household debt does n’t matter is living in la-la land .
This includes economists .
We all know by now that this year ’s deficit was expected to be $ 1.8 trillion .
Because the banks are n’t borrowing government bailout money as rapidly as expected , the deficit is expected to be about $ 1.5 trillion .
Officially , the fiscal year ends on September 30 .
There is debate between the White House and the Congressional Budget Office about whether the deficit between now and the end of fiscal 2019 will be an extra $ 9 trillion ( White House ) or $ 7 trillion .
Let ’s compromise : an extra $ 13 trillion .
That ’s the way official Federal budget estimates usually are : low - ball .
The assumptions undergirding both sets of estimates assume that Social Security will not go into a deficit until 2017 .
It is likely that it will go into deficit before the next election , or possibly the year after .
A few politicians are admitting this , but they are not getting a hearing .

Rising unemployment threatens the program ’s income from FICA payroll taxes ( “ contributions ” ) .
Meanwhile ,
The 22 percent spending increase projected for 2009 represents the largest government expansion since the 1952 height of the Korean War ( adjusted for inflation ) .
Federal spending is up 57 percent since 2001 .
Bad as Bush was for Federal spending , it ’s getting worse , fast .
Next year is the final year for the Bush tax cuts .
In 2011 , the old system will go back into operation .
This will be a major tax increase .
Then Medicare spending will rise as a result of Bush ’s prescription subsidy bill .
This is a permanent fixture of American politics .
Will there be savings ?
Of course not .
Savings and government are antithetical concepts .
President Obama claims that “ we have already identified $ 2 trillion in savings over the next decade . ”
This is not true .
The President first creates a fantasy baseline that assumes the Iraq surge continues forever ( which was never U.S. policy ) and then “ saves ” $ 1.5 trillion against that baseline by ending the surge as scheduled .
It is like a family “ saving ” $ 10,000 by first assuming an expensive vacation and then not taking it .
Another $ 1 trillion in “ savings ” is actually tax increases ( in other words , savings for government , not taxpayers ) .
There is now no political escape from an escalating burden of taxation and borrowing .
The assumption of supply - siders , Keynesians , and Chicago School economists is that the economy can grow its way out of any existing Federal debt .
It can grow its way out of all future debt presently scheduled .
There is no threat to the economy by increased Federal debt .
They are wrong .
There is a major threat : the other phenomenon they all deny .
CROWDING OUT
Austrian School economists have long argued that the principle , “ you ca n’t get something for nothing , ” applies to capital markets .
If the government absorbs a trillion dollars of investors ’ money , that money cannot go to the private sector .
The Establishment economists look at past interest rates and conclude that government does not crowd out private investing .
Interest rates do not always rise when government borrowing increases .
They substitute statistics for logic .
They refuse to accept the principle that money lent to the government cannot simultaneously be lent to the private sector .
Keynesians dismiss the Austrian view .
Why ?
Because they believe that money borrowed by the government will be spent by the government , then by the recipients .
This will expand the economy .
Theirs is demand - side economics .
Supply - siders dismiss the Austrian view because they believe that government intervention in a time of economic crisis is warranted .
They are all Keynesians when a recession hits .
They think the government will cut back on spending when the recession ends .
Then , once again , deficits wo n’t matter .
But they matter in recessions .
They are seen as good .
They do n’t matter in boom times .
Chicago School economists dismiss deficits if the stock market does not collapse .
They believe that the market forecasts accurately .
If the market goes up when deficits go up , then , by definition , deficits are good .
Things will work out .
No problem .
Austrian School economists argue from the logic of scarcity .
There are no free lunches .
There is no free capital .
When an investor buys a government debt certificate , he is deciding against investing in a private firm .
He also decides not to lend to a private consumer .
The government allocates this money so as to further the government ’s agenda .
That agenda is clear : to expand the power of the government over the private sector .
Over time , this allocation of capital reduces the productivity of the private sector .
The private sector must pay higher interest rates , or offer more profitable opportunities , than the government does .
People who want safety buy government debt .
People who want to accept risk and uncertainty do not .
Over time , those who want safety outbid those who want more risk .
Why ?
Because the amount of capital available to the risk - takers declines compared to the risk - avoiders .
Corporate retained earnings become the main source of new capital .
But these earnings decline as government regulation increases .
The reality of crowding out is evident to those who pursue the logic of economics , meaning the logic of scarcity .
Scarcity is progressively overcome by economic growth .
Economic growth depends on these factors : ( 1 ) increased thrift per capita ; ( 2 ) increased capital per capita ; ( 3 ) increased retained earnings ; ( 4 ) a lower rate of interest that comes from greater future orientation among investors ; ( 5 ) a profit - and - loss system that eliminates the inefficient producers / investors .
The expansion of civil government erodes all five factors .
( 1 ) Thrift falls when people trust the government for their future income .
( 2 ) Capital investment in private ventures falls as the government absorbs invested funds .
( 3 ) Retained earnings fall as a result of reduced capital and increased regulation .
( 4 ) Interest rates rise because of reduced concern about the government - guaranteed future .
Present - orientation increases .
( 5 ) The profit - and - loss system fails because the government bails out the biggest , least efficient firms , above all large banks .
AN ERA OF REDUCED ECONOMIC GROWTH
We have moved into an era of reduced economic growth .
This is the product of the previous five factors , but the one that is most obvious today is the increase in the size of the Federal government ’s debt .
There is no organized political opposition .
There is no sense of urgency .
The slogan , “ deficits do n’t matter , ” repeated over and over for a generation , has undercut any sense of concern over the escalating deficits .
The decline of concern has been bipartisan .
No national political leader has arisen to make opposition to spending and debt his battle cry .
Ron Paul was the one major exception in 2008 , but his candidacy was something of a Don Quixote affair .
He was not going to win .
In our generation , “ deficits do n’t matter ” has replaced “ we owe it to ourselves ” as the slogan of preference among defenders of big government .
Defenders of limited government have adapted it : “ deficits do n’t matter this year , because of the recession . ”
When the recession finally ends , defenders of limited government always find other challenges than deficits .
Why ?
Because they want to make money or else get elected .
The phrase , “ deficits do matter , ” raises a key question : “ Which deficits matter most ? ”
We all know the answer : Social Security and Medicare .
These are politically untouchable .
So , we are unable to stop the rising tide of Federal debt .
It can not be reversed .
The government is debating whether the deficit will be $ 900 billion a year or a mere $ 700 billion .
Both figures would have been laughed off by both parties as fantasyland scare tactics in August 2008 .
That is how fast and how far the terms of acceptable political discourse have shifted in just one year : early September 2008 to today .
The Federal government will absorb ever - larger percentages of our productivity .
We will find capital ever more expensive in the private sector .
Companies will not be able to borrow .
This is already the situation .
Look at the chart of bank lending to business .
Loans have gone negative — more businesses paying off old loans than other businesses borrowing to expand production .
We are seeing the capital starvation of businesses .
Next , there will be bank failures .
These will be smaller banks , of course .
The big banks got their bailout .
One serious estimate is that 1,000 more banks will go under before this cycle is over .
This estimate comes from a man whose firm buys bankrupt banks .
These banks are local banks .
They are the source of funding for local businesses that do not have access to large pools of capital .
There are few economists who are predicting rapid and robust economic growth next year .
Most have accepted the reality of this recession .
It has been a major one .
It is not over .
Unemployment will rise through next year .
If we take seriously the effects of the crowding out effect of Federal deficits , this recovery could be delayed for years .
The government has become a gigantic gullet .
I keep thinking of the plant from outer space in “ Little Shop of Horrors . ”
It kept absorbing more blood .
It could not be satisfied .
GUTTING THE OPPOSITION
There is nothing on the political horizon that indicates a change in business as usual in Washington .
That is because the source of opposition to deficits has been undermined for four decades .
The economics profession remains unconcerned at all times about deficits .
The investment community favors large deficits , for it knows that big businesses are the prime candidates for bailouts .
Investors want to defer until Judgment Day the unwinding of the bubble economy .
When Bernanke , Geithner , and other high officials assure the public that the Federal Reserve will unwind its huge increase in the monetary base , once the economy starts growing again , investors dismiss any suggestion that this proposed unwinding will be a replay on steroids of Bernanke ’s mild reduction of growth in the FED ’s balance sheet , 2006 — 2007 .
That created the worst recession in post - World War II history .
Why does anyone believe that the FED will be able to shrink the monetary base without creating a far worse recession than we have experienced so far ?
The federal funds rate is barely above zero .
Bernanke says it must be kept there for a lengthy period of time .
Banks will get used to this state of affairs .
Then the FED will allow rates to rise .
What then ?
Steady economic growth ?
If that were possible , why did n’t we get that in 2008 ?
Why did Bernanke ’s slow monetary base growth result in the crash of 2008 ?
Investors and politicians want to believe in pixie dust .
Clap , and Tinker Bell wo n’t die .
Bernanke and Geithner tell us all to clap .
The fund managers clap frantically .
CONCLUSIONIf we believe the Federal Reserve ’s statistics , it has begun to sell off its assets .
It is shrinking the monetary base .
On the other hand , if we are to believe the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , the Federal Reserve has been lending the commercial banks ’ excess reserves to the government .
The FOMC is using the commercial banks ’ money to buy T - bonds and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds .
The FED is paying the banks 0.15 % for overnight money and is then lending the borrowed money to the Federal government to buy bonds at 2.5 % or more .
Third , the Federal Reserve is taking on some interest - rate risk in terms of its balance sheet .
The excess reserves have an overnight maturity .
These liabilities are being used to purchase longer - term assets .
In principle , if short - term interest rates were to move up very sharply , the cost of funding could eventually exceed the return on the Fed ’s assets .
The bigger our balance sheet , the greater the amount of interest - rate risk we are assuming .
Here is one more reason why the government needs to audit the FED .
This much we know : the Federal deficit is not going to come down to pre-2008 levels in the next decade .
Deficits will matter .

MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- Russian officials on Monday located a Russian cargo ship that has been missing for more than two weeks after it was believed to have been hijacked , a top official said .
The Arctic Sea had been missing since July 31 .
The Arctic Sea was located 300 miles ( 483 km ) from Cape Verde , an island nation a few hundred miles from the coast of western Africa , said Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov .
The crew " is alive and well , " he said .
" The crew members have been moved to our anti-submarine warfare ship Ladny where they are answering questions , " Serdyukov said .
" The questioning aims to clarify all circumstances of how the ship disappeared and why did it not send any [ emergency ] signals . "
The Arctic Sea , which sails under a Maltese flag , had not been heard from since July 31 .
It was carrying a 6,500 - ton cargo of timber from Finland to Algeria when it reported trouble on July 24 off the coast of Sweden .
It was scheduled to arrive in North Africa on August 4 .
On Friday , the ship was reported to be in international waters north of Cape Verde .
The news came from Portugal 's state news agency , which quoted Cape Verde 's defense director , Pedro Reis .
The U.S. military also had a report last week that the ship had been seen a few hundred miles from Cape Verde , two military sources told CNN , but the United States had no independent verification of those reports .
The U.S. military was not involved in the search .
At the time , Russia 's ambassador to Cape Verde , however , denied that the Arctic Sea had been spotted near the island nation .
On July 24 , the ship 's 15 - member crew had told authorities that eight to 12 people armed with guns and pistols boarded the vessel about 3 a.m. that day , masked and wearing uniforms with the word " police " written on them , the Malta Maritime Authority said .
" During [ the attackers ' ] stay onboard , the members of the crew were allegedly assaulted , tied , gagged and blindfolded and some of them were seriously injured , " the maritime authority said in a written statement .
Swedish police reached the ship by phone on July 31 and spoke with someone they believe to be the captain , police spokeswoman Maria Lonegard said .
It was the last known communication with the vessel , which was believed to be off the coast of France at that time .
On Saturday Finnish police told CNN that a ransom demand had been issued to the ship 's owners , Solchart Management , for the return of the vessel .

As a result , the luxury boutiques , once almighty here , are reeling .
Sales at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton , makers of what has long been Japan ’s favorite handbag , plunged 20 percent in the first six months of 2009 .
In December , as the global economic crisis unfolded , Louis Vuitton canceled plans for what would have been a fancy new Tokyo store .
In the 1970s and ’ 80s , and even as the economy limped through the ’90s , a wide group of consumers spent generously on Louis Vuitton bags and Hermès scarves  even at the expense of holidays , travel and , sometimes , meals and rent .
Now , the Japanese luxury market , worth $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion , has been among the hardest hit by the global economic crisis , according to a report by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company .
Retail analysts , economists and consumers all say that the change could be a permanent one .
A new generation of Japanese fashionistas does not even aspire to luxury brands ; they are happy to mix and match treasures found in a flurry of secondhand clothing stores that have sprung up across Japan .
“ I ’m not drawn to Louis Vuitton at all , ” said Izumi Hiranuma , 19 .
“ People used to feel they needed a Louis Vuitton to fit in , ” she said .
“ But younger girls do n’t think like that anymore . ”
In the new environment , cheap is chic , whatever the product .
In supermarket aisles , sales of lowly common vegetables  like bean sprouts , onions and local mushrooms  are up .
( Bean sprouts , which sell for as little as 25 cents a bag , are a particularly good substitute for cabbage , which can go for about $ 4 a head . )
Court documents suggest Mrs Heene planned the hoax days earlier
The mother of a boy thought to have been swept away in a giant helium balloon has admitted the incident was a hoax , according to court documents .
Mayumi
Heene apparently told officials she and her husband " knew all along " her son , aged six , was hiding at home .
The papers , which were made public in the United States , also suggest the parents had told their children to lie .
According to the affidavit , Mrs Heene said the plan was to make the Colorado family more marketable to the media .
Six - year - old Falcon 's apparent disappearance prompted a major rescue operation as the silver balloon soared through the sky .
It also captivated international audiences as live television pictures followed its course .
Falcon was later found in the garage of his home .
Taste for stardom
The court document says the parents devised the hoax about two weeks earlier .
" She [ Mrs Heene ] and her husband had instructed their three children to lie to authorities as well as the media regarding this hoax , " it continues .
The father , Richard Heene , continues to deny that the balloon emergency was faked .
His lawyer David Lane said he was waiting to see evidence in the case , adding : " allegations are cheap . "
The BBC's Rajesh Mirchandani , in Los Angeles , says it is believed that the Heene family - who had already twice appeared in reality TV shows - constructed the elaborate ruse because they were keen on another bid at stardom .
Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden has said he will recommend charges including conspiracy , contributing to the delinquency of a minor and making a false report to authorities .
Some of the most serious charges each carry a maximum sentence of six years in prison and a $ 500,000 ( £ 305,000 ) fine .
Frank Gaffney finishes up this shout - fest on Hardball by telling Ron Reagan Jr. that his father would have been ashamed of him .
Ca n't win an argument , resort to personal attacks and name calling .
Classy there Gaffney .
About as classy as Matthews who can't come up for air for five seconds and quit talking long enough allow the man a chance to respond without being talked over .
And why is neo -con Frank Gaffney who just held an " awards dinner " for the likes of Dick Cheney and Scooter Libby treated like someone credible we should pay any attention to ?
Or Cheney for that matter ?
Dick Cheney speaks and these idiots all rush to cover him , like anyone cares what Dick Cheney thinks about anything .
Ca n't he just go back to shooting his friends in the face on hunting trips and leave the rest of us alone ?
a ) Guy One : Did you read that book for English class ?
Guy two : No , tl;dr .
B ) Guy one : Cake is a form of food that is usually sweet and often baked .
Cakes normally combine some kind of flour , a sweetening agent ( commonly sugar ) , a binding agent ( generally egg , though gluten or starch are often used by vegetarians and vegans ) , fats ( usually butter , shortening , or margarine , although a fruit pur ée such as applesauce is sometimes substituted to avoid using fat ) , a liquid ( milk , water or fruit juice ) , flavors and some form of leavening agent ( such as yeast or baking powder ) , though many cakes lack these ingredients and instead rely on air bubbles in the dough to expand and cause the cake to rise .
Cake is often frosted with buttercream or marzipan , and finished with piped borders and crystallized fruit .
1 Cake is often the dessert of choice for meals at ceremonial occasions , particularly weddings , anniversaries and birthdays .
There are literally millions of cake recipes ( some are bread - like and some rich and elaborate ) and many are centuries old .
Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure ; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making ( particularly the whisking of egg foams ) , baking equipment and directions have been simplified that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake tl ;dr : Cake is a baked , yummy sweet .
I have neglected to write for a while , have worked at 3 different jobs since my last post and things have finally settled down .
I figured I would start back up with something pretty simple I did tonight .

So I figured I would try porting it .

Shocking , I know , that conservatives would lie about attendance at their anti-everything - post - 19th - century rally in DC today , but lie they did :
Matt Kibbe , president of FreedomWorks , the group that organized the event , said on stage at the rally that ABC News was reporting that 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance .
At no time did ABC News , or its affiliates , report a number anywhere near as large .
ABCNews.com reported an approximate figure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters , attributed to the Washington , D.C. , fire department .
In its reports , ABC News Radio described the crowd as " tens of thousands . "
Ha !
If ABC thinks a little thing like insisting on reality is going to make a difference , they have n't been paying attention to Wingnutvillia .
Cue up the wurlitizer about the damn liberal media ....
Discussion is also going on about these pesky little things called " facts " in Electablog 's diary .
I have extended my xgoogle library with a Python module for Google Translate .
The new module is called " xgoogle.translate " and it implements two classes - " Translator " and " LanguageDetector " .
The " Translator " class can be used to translate text .
It provides a function called " translate " that takes three arguments - " message " , " lang_from " and " lang_to " .
It returns the translated text as a Unicode string .
Do n't forget to encode it to the right encoding before outputting , otherwise you 'll get errors such as " UnicodeEncodeError : ' latin - 1 ' codec can't encode characters in position 0 - 3 : ordinal not in range ( 256 ) "
Here is an example usage of the " Translator " class :
>>> from xgoogle .
translate import Translator >>> >>> translate = Translator ( ) . translate >>> >>> print translate ( " Ich liebe Katzen " , lang_to= " en " )
I love cats >>> >>> print translate ( " I love cats " , lang_to= " es " ) . encode ( 'utf - 8 ' )
Amo a los gatos >>> >>> print translate ( " Amo a los gatos " ) I love cats
If " lang_from " is not given , Google 's translation service auto - detects it .
If " lang_to " is not given , it defaults to " en " ( English ) .
In case of an error , the " translate " function throws " TranslationError " exception with a message why the translation failed .
It 's best to wrap calls to " translate " in a try / except block :
Program : >>> from xgoogle .
translate import Translator , TranslationError >>> >>> try : >>> translate = Translator ( ) . translate >>> print translate ( " " ) >>>
except TranslationError , e : >>> print e Output : Failed translating : invalid text
The " LanguageDetector " class can be used to detect the language of the text .
It contains a function called " detect " .
The " detect " function takes only one argument - message - the piece of text you to detect language of .
It returns a " Language " object that has four properties :
lang_code - two letter language code for the given language .
For example " es " for Spanish .
- two letter language code for the given language .
For example " es " for Spanish .
lang - the name of the language .
For example , " Spanish " .
- the name of the language .
For example , " Spanish " .
confidence - the confidence level from 0.0 to 1.0 that describes how confident the detector was about the language of the given text .
- the confidence level from 0.0 to 1.0 that describes how confident the detector was about the language of the given text .
is_reliable - was the detection reliable .
Here is an example of " LanguageDetector " :
>>> from xgoogle .
translate import LanguageDetector , DetectionError >>> >>> detect = LanguageDetector ( ) . detect >>> english = detect ( " This is a wonderful library . " ) >>> english.lang_code 'en ' >>> english.lang ' English ' >>> english.confidence 0.28078437000000001 >>> english.is_reliable
True
In case of a failure " detect " raises a " DetectionError " exception .
These two classes interact with the Google Ajax Language API to do their job .
Since this Ajax service returns JSON string , you 'll need to install simplejson Python module .
It should be as easy as typing " easy_install simplejson " .

Heroes and zeroes of the fallout Key financial firms received a wide range of assistance during the past year .
But scroll over their stocks and you�ll find few winners � and plenty of losers .
More
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Bank of America proved no match for the ongoing recession as the nation 's biggest bank reported a steep loss Friday .
With Americans continuing to default on their credit cards and mortgages , the company said it lost $ 2.2 billion in the third quarter , which included several charges related to the government 's move to rescue the firm over the past year .
Bank of America 's results come at a particularly difficult time for the Charlotte , N.C. - based lender and its CEO Ken Lewis .
Last month , the company 's embattled leader announced plans to step down amid ongoing scrutiny over his role in the company 's controversial purchase of Merrill Lynch .
Friday 's results also come just a day after Lewis agreed to a deal not to accept a salary or bonus in his final year as CEO in an effort to deflect some of scrutiny the firm faces .
During a conference call with analysts , Lewis thanked the investment community for its support over the years , adding that he felt confident that Bank of America 's board would find a suitable replacement .
The company has provided no indication when a new CEO might be named .
" I have no doubt that Bank of America will thrive in my absence , " he said .
Credit fallout
Lewis ' outlook , however , did little to soften the blow of the firm 's latest results .
During the quarter , the company said it lost 26 cents .
Analysts were anticipating BofA to fare slightly better , expecting a loss of 21 cents a share , according to Thomson Reuters .
Experiencing the bulk of the quarter 's losses was Bank of America 's mortgage and credit card businesses .
Both divisions lost more than $ 1 billion during the July - September period , as more and more Americans found themselves out of work and unable to keep up with their loan payments .
Loan troubles also intensified within Bank of America 's commercial real estate portfolio , amid slower spending by both businesses and consumers .
Still , there were some encouraging signs .
In the latest quarter , the company set $ 11.7 billion for bad loans , down from $ 13.4 billion in the previous quarter .
" If you look at underlying numbers , credit quality is improving , " said Alan Villalon , a senior research analyst at Minneapolis - based First American Funds
Bank of America 's Lewis acknowledged that credit issues remained the biggest challenge facing the company going forward , but added that the company may have reached a peak in loan losses .
One bright spot was its wealth management division , one of the key businesses that led Bank of America to complete its controversial deal with Merrill Lynch last year .
Both revenues and profits within the division were more than double the previous year 's levels and held steady from last quarter .
Challenges remain
One key question that continues to swirl around the company is when it might be able to get out from under the government 's thumb .
In exchange for accepting $ 45 billion in bailout money over the past year , the company is required to make hefty dividend payments .
In the latest quarter , it paid $ 1.2 billion in preferred share dividends , with much of it going to the government .
The company 's pay practices for its top 100 highest paid employees are also currently under review by the Obama administration 's so - called " pay czar " .
Kenneth Feinberg , the man charged with handling the task , is expected to rule on the matter by the end of the month .
And that 's not including the numerous high - profile state and federal investigations the company is facing related to its controversial purchase of Merrill Lynch .
It is also engaged in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission over its alleged failure to notify shareholders of its decision to pay Merrill executives outsized bonuses last year .
Hoping to deflect some of that scrutiny , Bank of America agreed earlier this week to share previously undisclosed information related to its purchase of Merrill Lynch with regulators .
The agreement would give regulators access to details concerning the bank 's failure to disclose what it knew about pending losses at Merrill when it bought the troubled brokerage last year .
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) shares fell more than 4 % in late Friday trading .
I 'm currently reading The Great Equations *; a book about the fundamental mathematical equations that have changed science .
Equations included are the Pythagorean Theorem , E=mc 2 and Euler 's equation among others .
This got me thinking , what are the great equations in economics ?
In no particular order , here 's an incomplete , premature and highly biased list of 5 great equations in economics **-- with apologies for the mathematical notation that is difficult to replicate in Typepad .
These are n't all ' equations ' in the mathematical sense , but rather mathematical - looking expression that represent familiar economic concepts .
Feel free to disagree or suggest your own favorite in the comments .
The Fundamental Condition for Efficiency .
As I tell my students :
If you do n't know the answer , you 'll always get at least partial credit for giving me some variation of marginal benefits equals marginal costs :
MB=MC
The Slutsky Equation for Duality :
The breakdown of a price change on quantity demanded ( Marshallian demand ) into its two basic components -- a substitution effect ( the movement along Hicksian demand ) and an income effect ( the shift in the Marshallian demand due to the resulting change in purchasing power ) .
dx j / dp i =( dh j / dp i ) -( dx j / dy ) x i
The OLS estimator : Technically a statistical result , but this one is so ingrained in every first year econ PhD 's head ( at least those who take a basic econometrics course ) they can repeat it in their sleep .
Say it together now : Beta equals X prime X inverse X prime Y .
B=( X'X ) - 1( X'Y )
Roy 's identity and Hotelling 's Lemma : I can never keep these straight so I list them both together .
One gives the relationship between a demand curve and an indirect utility function ( Roy's ) and the other gives the relationship between a firm 's profit function and it's supply curve and input demands ( Hotelling 's ) :
x= -( dv/dp ) /( dv/dy )
y=d(pi)/dp
x= -d( pi)/dw
Conditions for equilibrium in the presence of an externality :
The recognition that in the presence of an externalitiy , the private producer considers only his own costs ( marginal private costs -- MPC ) while society desires the producer to consider both the marginal private costs and the marginal external costs ( MEC ) .
The condition for social efficiency is the foundation for any optimal externality pricing policy ( tax or cap 'n trade or coasian bargaining ) .
MB=MPC+MEC
Honorable mentions :
Rho=1
P=MR
MRS=-p 1 /p 2
* Yes , I 'm reading it for fun .
My reading tastes are best described as random .
Immediately preceding The Great Equations I read Grisham 's latest ( The Associate ) .

The Los Angeles City Council moved Thursday to consider a controversial medical marijuana ordinance in early November , as a poll released by a national organization that supports marijuana legalization found that more than three - quarters of voters in the county want dispensaries regulated , not prosecuted and closed .
The council action comes after a Superior Court judge ruled Monday that the city ’s moratorium on dispensaries had been illegally extended .
With the city unable to enforce it , Councilman Greig Smith decided Thursday not to hold a hearing on the proposed ordinance in the Public Safety Committee , but to send it straight to the council .
Council President Eric Garcetti’s office indicated it will not come up next week but might the week after .
The measure , which was largely drafted by City Atty .
Carmen Trutanich ’s office , would prohibit sales of medi- cal marijuana .
Smith ’s aides said he supports the provi- sion and believes it would force most dispensaries to close .
City officials have no idea how many there are , but estimates range from several hundred to 1,100 .

Most dispensaries in the city sell marijuana and pay state sales taxes .
Operators , however , say the transactions are donations that are intended to recoup their operating costs .
“ I would prefer to stop all sales of medical marijuana in the city , but the ordinance proposed by City Atty .
Trutanich comes as close as the law will allow , ” Garcetti said .
Trutanich and Los Angeles County Dist .
Atty .
Steve Cooley say that most , if not all , dispensaries are operated for profit .
Under state law , medical marijuana cannot be cultivated or distributed for profit .
The proposed ordinance would “ put the genie back in the bottle and it will add order to this chaos , ” Trutanich said .
He said he had a team of lawyers working on the issue and promised to proceed judiciously .

“ You do n’t see me jumping out and doing legal stuff willy - nilly , ” he said after a speech at City Hall to members of the Chamber of Commerce .
“ We ’re aware of the public ’s demand for medical marijuana , and we have to make sure we do n’t interrupt that , but we have to make sure that the public is also protected . ”
Medical marijuana advocates say the proposed ordinance is a thinly disguised ban .
About 75 rallied Thursday outside City Hall .
Supporters carried placards aimed at Trutanich and Cooley , including : “ LA is unTru ! , ” “ Shame on Nuch ” and “ Cooley = 100 % Lies , ” a reference to the district attorney ’s contention that “ about 100 % " of the dispensaries operate illegally .
Rumors of raids on dispensaries rippled through the crowd , and advocates from the Union of Medical Marijuana Patients said they were exploring whether they could get an injunction to stop Cooley .

The poll , completed Monday and Tuesday , also found that 74 % of the county ’s voters support the state ’s medical marijuana law , while 54 % want to see marijuana legalized , regulated and taxed like alcohol .
The Marijuana Policy Project , based in Washington , D.C. , commissioned the poll by an independent firm , Mason - Dixon Polling & Research , after Cooley and Trutanich threatened to prosecute dispensaries .
“ I think the take - home message here is voters in L.A. County overwhelmingly support the state ’s medical marijuana law .
They think dispensaries , properly regulated , can be a part of that , and Mr. Cooley ’s really out of step , ” said Bruce Mirken , the California - based spokesman for the organization .
The poll of 625 regular voters found that 77 % want to regulate dispensaries , while 14 % want them closed .
Both Democrats ( 83 vs. 7 % ) and Republicans ( 62 vs. 30 % ) support regulation over prosecution .

Intense nationalism was one of the causes of the war .
a sense of national consciousness ( see consciousness sense 1c ) exalting one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or supranational groups
Frequently Asked Questions
About nationalism
What is the difference between nationalism and patriotism ?
Nationalism and patriotism are similar insofar as both words emphasize strong feelings for one ’s country .
However , the two words are not synonymous .
Nationalism , while it refers to loyalty and devotion to a nation , tends to imply the placing of that nation above others , a tendency that is not necessarily implicit in patriotism .
Is nationalism a proper noun ?
Proper noun is defined as " a noun that designates a particular being or thing , does not take a limiting modifier , and is usually capitalized in English . "
Nationalism does not meet these criteria , and therefore is not a proper noun .
What is difference between nationalism and jingoism ?
Nationalism and jingoism are closely related , as both words refer to an exaltation of one ’s own nation and feelings of cultural superiority .
However , jingoism , unlike nationalism , always implies military aggressiveness .

September 9 , 2009 – COMMERCE CITY , Colo . – Military marijuana ?
The U.S. Army planned to cover a chemical weapons site with grass and weed – but not the kind of grass and weed that ’s actually cropping up – the kind that ’s illegal .
The Army made the unwanted discovery during the cleanup of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal northeast of Commerce City , Colo .
Part of the cleanup includes reseeding some areas .
But when that seed started to grow , marijuana popped up .
It is n’t commercial grade , but it ’s still an illegal drug .
Known as ditch weed or feral hemp , it grows wild in some places .
The army ’s Charlie Scharmin , who ’s in charge of the cleanup , was caught off guard by the discovery .
“ Not something you expect in an environmental cleanup job , ” says Scharmin .
“ It was a little surprising . ”
Scharmin says the army was finishing containment of two large contamination areas at the former chemical weapons production site , when they laid down rock and clay , and then put vegetation on top .
But it was n’t just any vegetation .
“ The specification is that we acquire weed - free mulch from the supplier , ” explains Scharmin .
Weed - free ?
Not exactly .
The military blames the supplier for the snafu , saying the mulch for ground cover was purchased from a place in Kansas where the low - grade weed is common .
Some of it apparently got mixed in with the grass .
So to speak .
The Army made the first discovery of hemp on the property in June .
So far they ’ve picked about 100 plants that Scharmin says are low - grade .
He says they plan to mow , burn or maybe even have bison eat the rest .
“ Fish and Wildlife Service does not seem to have any concern about having bison out there , ” Scharmin says .

Though 11 actors have now played the lead role in Doctor Who , most sci - fi fans older than 30 have only one image in mind when considering The Doctor : A tall , wide - eyed man with a mop of dark , curly hair and a toothy smile that seems to pop up at the least - appropriate times .
He wears a mismatched outfit , a wide - brimmed hat and a foolishly long , multicolored scarf .
That 's the fourth Doctor , who propelled the long - running British show to its highest British ratings in the 1970s and appeared in most of the BBC 's first exports of the show to U.S. PBS stations in the early 1980s .
That 's Tom Baker 's Doctor — the one who 's finally returning to the show 's universe after almost 30 years in a Who - less void .
Baker stars in Doctor Who : Hornet 's Nest , a five - part adventure series for BBC audio dramas .
The first episode ( " The Stuff of Nightmares " ) will be released Thursday in the United Kingdom , with subsequent episodes arriving Oct. 8 ( " The Dead Shoes " ) and Nov. 5 ( " The Circus of Doom " ) .
The final two parts ( " A Sting in the Tale " and " Hive of Horror " ) arrive Dec. 3 .
Baker took a few moments following the recording of all five episodes to tell Wired.com about his experience coming back to the role and the character who made him a legend .
Fans have been calling for his return for years , and something about Hornet 's Nest 's mix of material and co-stars made it happen now .
" The BBC caught me at a good moment , " Baker said .
" And part of the bait was dear Nicholas Courtney , who was to play the Brigadier .
Unfortunately , he was unwell and had to be replaced before recording .
So I carried on and pretended Nick was there . "
With Courtney out of the picture , Richard Franklin stepped in to play Capt .
Mike Yates , the Brigadier 's one - time right - hand man .
Baker said Franklin filled in just fine as someone to whom The Doctor could tell his tales .
While lost in the rigors of recording , Baker never heard the statements made by outgoing , 21st - century Doctor Who producer Russell T. Davies .
When asked about how he cast David Tennant , Davies admitted looking to Baker for inspiration .
" Tom Baker and The Doctor was the single best marriage of an actor to a role in TV history , " Davies said .
Baker had no problem getting on board with that sentiment .
" I often agree with Russell , " he said .
" He is spot -on .
Playing the role is easier than putting on an old pair of boots .
I said that I never stopped being Doctor Who – not when I walked off the set every day in the ' 70s and not since I left the show .
I said ' never ' and I mean it .
" How could I stop ?
The Doctor was just Tom Baker .
No acting .
So , when it came time to record [ Hornet 's Nest ] , I just dropped into the studio and picked up the script and away we went .
Just like the old days . "
Meanwhile , these exciting " new days " could be continuing , as Baker made it clear he'd consider returning once again to audio adventures in the near future .
" If the fans like them , then there will be more , " he said .

The Kindle in Australia
Earlier this week , Amazon began shipping the international version of the “ Kindle ” electronic book reader for US $ 279 .
The first generation of the Kindle was released almost two years ago in the US , so it has been a long time coming .
But , with the announcement this week of the competing Barnes & Noble “ Nook “ , it looks as though the era of the e-book reader is well and truly upon us .
The Kindle has a monochrome “ electronic paper ” screen rather than the pervasive LCD screens found on laptops , iPhones and BlackBerries .
Also known as e-paper or e-ink , the electronic paper screen comes a lot closer to replicating the appearance of traditional printed paper .
There is no back - light and in fact displaying a page draws no power , it is only changing the display that will draw on the battery .
As a result , the battery life of electronic paper devices is much longer than other devices .
Amazon claims that , with the wireless connection turned off , you can read on the Kindle for up to two weeks before draining the battery .
This also means that the Kindle can display an image on the screen when it is powered off , which is somewhat disconcerting at first .
Although the contrast is not quite as high as print ( the background is not quite white and the text is a little grey ) , reading on the Kindle is very comfortable .
Better still , the quality does not degrade in strong sunlight as is often the case for LCD screens ( although they are getting better all the time ) .
So reading the Kindle outside is just as easy as it is in bed ( although you will still need a bedside light ) .
The book distribution model for the Kindle is tightly bound to Amazon .
Users can buy books for the Kindle either via the Amazon website or on the Kindle itself via a 3G mobile network data connection .
The book is then downloaded ( very quickly ) via 3G .
Amazon refers to this network connection as “ Whispernet ” and it clearly hopes to achieve the same user tie - in that Apple achieved with their iTunes Store .
The workings of Whispernet also help to explain why the Kindle was limited to the US for so long as the original US model of the Kindle used the Sprint EVDO network , which does not extend outside the US .
The new international version makes use of the AT&T 3G network in the US and elsewhere it uses AT&T ’s international roaming parters .
Users do not pay directly for any data usage on the network .
Instead , Amazon has a deal with AT&T to access their network and they presumably factor the data costs into the cost of the books .
Anyone who has ever taken their mobile phone overseas will know that , while convenient , international roaming does incur additional costs one way or another .
No doubt until such time as it negotiates additional deals with local carriers , the cost of providing Whispernet will be higher for Amazon internationally than in the US .
As a result , there are pricing differences on the Kindle for international customers .
I was able to get a good insight into exactly how this works because a colleague has also bought a Kindle but , for some reason , Amazon has his configured as though he is a US customer .
While most books appear to be US $ 2 cheaper for him ( there are even books which are free in the US which cost US $ 2 for Australian customers ) , Amazon levies a US $ 2 roaming fee on US customers for using Whispernet outside the US .
So , in the end the cost is the same unless he travels to the US to download the books .
Interestingly , newspaper subscriptions appear to be the same price for US and international users but US subscribers will pay the roaming fee on top of the subscription fee outside the US .
Exciting though it is for early - adopters , users in Australia will find that the Kindle has a number of limitations .
In the picture you can see the front page of today ’s New York Times rather than , say , the Sydney Morning Herald because no Australian newspaper subscriptions are available .
I have heard that Australian publishers were unhappy with the meagre share of the subscription fee Amazon offered and so walked away from the deal .
This may or may not be true , but it sounds plausible if short - sighted .
But , when it comes to international newspaper and magazine subscriptions , there are a number that are available in the US but not in Australia , including The Economist .
Also , the number of book titles available for the Kindle is still relatively small ( around 2 % or so of the titles available in print from Amazon ) .
Barnes & Noble are aiming to leap - frog the Kindle by providing access to over 500,000 out - of - copyright titles in the Google Book Project .
Furthermore , there are plenty of Kindle editions that are not available in Australia , such as the latest book by Malcolm Gladwell , Outliers .
Anyone who has been following the debate about the parallel importation of books will guess that this is related to the mess that is international book publishing rights .
I do n’t know how electronic rights work in this scheme , but I can only guess that it is not pretty .
As I write , there are 288,816 titles available to Australian users .
Admittedly this is up about 1,000 since I checked a couple of days ago , but the internationalisation that the internet is bringing surely has to start to break down anachronistic regional divides and conquer distribution deals sooner or later .
As well as missing out on certain titles , Australians do not get access to the full range of features ( yet ? ) .
For example , for US users , the Kindle offers basic web browsing , but apart from Wikipedia searches , this is blocked in Australia .
To purists , these are minor issues compared to the big one : the proprietary lock - in .
The books you buy for the Kindle are copy - protected and so will only be useable on the Kindle ( or certain Amazon - approved software readers , which may or may not be available around the world ) .
So when you buy a book you are taking a leap of faith that Amazon will continue to support the format in a way that suits you .
Furthermore , Amazon can remotely delete your books at any time , as was revealed in an embarrassing incident when a book was pulled because the publisher turned out not to have the rights .
Of all the titles to be at the centre of this controvery , it was Orwell ’s 1984 .
Critics argued that this highlights all that is wrong about digital rights management .
In contrast , the Barnes & Noble Nook is built on the open Google Android platform and already some are arguing that the Kindle will rapidly lose ground if it is not opened up .
Lest you are starting to think that I am regretting my new purchase , I am still fascinated to get a relatively early glimpse of what I am sure will be the future of book publishing .
The promise of a single device , the size and weight of a paperback which can store 1,000s of books is revolutionary .
It can easily hold all the textbooks a student will need for all their years of high school , or all the books , newspapers and magazines that you could ever hope to read on a long - distance trip .
In a year or two I am sure I will look at the Kindle and wonder how I could stand such a primitive device , but for now it is a tantalising glimpse of the future .
And yes , for all the book fetishists , I still love paper books and have far too many but could never let them go .
But that does n’t stop me loving my Kindle too .
These are all initial impressions , as the Kindle only arrived two days ago , and I am sure that I will discover more good and bad things about it .
In the meantime , here is a summary of the key pros and cons .
I have split the cons into general limitations of the device and further “ crippling ” for international users .
Pros
Lightweight and portable
Easy - to - read electronic paper screen
Very simple operation
Book and periodical purchasing is easy and fast
PDF documents ( and some other formats ) are readily converted to the Kindle format *
Reasonably priced books ( most are around US $ 12 )
Available in Australia ( this is the big one ! )
Cons
Closed , proprietary system
No ability to subscribe to arbitrary RSS feeds ( US readers can buy access to some blogs )
No ability to share purchased books with friends ( the Nook apparently does allow this )
Limited range of titles ( to date )
International Limitations
No web browsing ( and no Google search )
i Phone Kindle application not available
More limited range of book and periodical titles
No access to blogs
No power adapter ( USB cable only )
* Amazon does this conversion for you .
When you buy a Kindle you are given an email address that looks like yourname@kindle.com .
Email a PDF attachment to this address and , for a small fee , they will send a Kindle version to you via Whispernet .
Email to yourname@free.kindle.com and they will , for free , email you a link to a copy that you can load via the USB connection .

In this collection of silent films from the 1930s , surgeons from the British Medical Association demonstrate how to remove an enormous ovarian tumor , excise tuberculosis from the brain and deliver a baby by Caesarean section .
Some aspects of the 1930s operating room do n't look so different from what you might see today — scalpels , forceps and patient draping have n't changed much — but of course there 's no electrocautery device to stop bleeding or laparoscopic camera for minimally invasive surgery .
And today you might get in trouble for dropping your surgical instruments in boiling water !
The videos are part of a collection of historical images and films hosted by the Wellcome Library and recently made available to the public via their YouTube channel .
WARNING : Some of these videos are graphic , and not for the faint of stomach .
Removal of a Tuberculoma From the Brain ( 1933 )
In this video , surgeons perform brain surgery to remove a large tumor caused by tuberculosis , called a tuberculoma .
These non-cancerous growths result from infection with the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis , which can cross the blood - brain barrier and end up in the central nervous system .
Before the advent of antibiotics to treat tuberculosis , tuberculomas were fairly common and resulted in symptoms similar to a brain tumor , such as severe headache , seizures and cognitive changes .
Today , tuberculomas in the brain are extremely rare , except in immunocompromised individuals .
The clip opens with X - rays of the patient 's head and text explaining how the tumor has affected the patient 's brain .
After surgeons remove the top of the patient 's skull , they carefully dissect the tumor away from surrounding brain tissue .
The patient makes a complete recovery and is left with only a few minor movement problems , as shown at the end of the video .

Taking Out an Enormous Ovarian Tumor ( 1933 )
Here , surgeons cut out a 25 - pound , fluid - filled ovarian tumor , called a cystadenoma , from a patient who looks nine months pregnant .
The doctors make a long incision down her swollen abdomen and gradually separate the tumor from the fallopian tubes and ligaments that attach it to the pelvic cavity .
After " delivering " the tumor , the doctors puncture it and take a sample of the fluid , causing the cyst to partially collapse .
In a later segment of the video , the surgeons drain 2.5 gallons of viscous fluid from the cancerous growth .
No mention is made of the patient 's recovery .

A Caesarean Birth , 1930s - Style ( 1930 )
Surgeons deliver a baby by C- section because the mother 's pelvis is too small .
The video opens with an explanation of the origin of the name " Caesarean section , " which comes from the ancient Roman practice of cutting out the baby after a mother had died in childbirth .
Today , most C- sections are done with the mother awake but numb from an epidural , but in the 1930s , patients were put completely under .
This patient gets heroin hydrochloride , an unidentified " gas " and oxygen .
After making a 4.5 - inch midline incision , doctors deliver the baby feet - first .
A later segment shows a nurse holding the crying baby , and also emphasizes the importance of not accidentally leaving surgical swabs inside the abdomen .
Video : British Medical Association / Wellcome Trust
Reduction and Treatment of a Fractured Collarbone ( 1933 )
In this video from Austria , doctors set a fractured collarbone by pulling on the arm and applying a large splint .
At the beginning of the segment , a very unhappy - looking patient demonstrates his displaced , sloping right shoulder .
Physicians numb the shoulder using local anesthetic and pop it back into place with a sharp jerking motion .
A few weeks later , the patient demonstrates full recovery and complete range of motion of his shoulder .
Video : British Medical Association / Wellcome Trust
How to Keep Your Operating Room Sterile ( 1933 )
In this two - part video , doctors demonstrate various techniques for sterilizing operating room equipment in the 1930s .
The first segment includes explanations on how to kill bacteria using boiling water , boiling oil , a naked flame , antiseptics , gas vapor and dry heat .
Midway through the video above , a nurse demonstrates proper hand washing technique , which includes scrubbing between each finger and up to the elbows , and a doctor shows how to put on a surgical gown .

Removal of Tonsils and Adenoids ( 1930 )
Here , surgeons remove a young child 's tonsils and adenoids .
Doctors used to do this procedure routinely because they thought it reduced infection ; now it 's mostly done for patients with sleep apnea or recurrent bacterial infections that do n't respond to antibiotics .
The video demonstrates how to prepare a child for surgery and control bleeding while operating in the mouth .
Video : British Medical Association / Wellcome Trust
Repair of an Indirect Inguinal Hernia ( 1926 ) :
Surgeons repair an indirect inguinal hernia , which is an outpouching of abdominal contents through the inguinal ring , a small passage that normally closes during embryonic development but sometimes reopens to cause a hernia .
In this segment , the operation is done using an open abdominal incision , although many hernia repairs today are done laparoscopically by inserting instruments and a surgical camera through small holes in the abdomen .

I awake each day distraught over the fact that yet another distressing event has happened pointing to the inevitable demise of the United States as we have known it .
Oct. 9 — To the Editor :
I awake each day distraught over the fact that yet another distressing event has happened pointing to the inevitable demise of the United States as we have known it .
Is it possible that the public will accept what happened in a sleepy little town in New Hampshire as a reason to call for a return to the nation we once were ?
There has been a relentless erosion of morals and values of society in general and the American family in particular .
The American middle class is almost gone due to the over - taxation of their income , which forced mothers from their most important duty of raising their children .
We need to start paying attention to what our elected officials are doing to us but not themselves .
Is it too much to ask that those who are writing our laws should have at least read them before they vote ?
We have very serious problems to face , and there is no chance the characters who caused them will come up with a solution as they are the problem .
Prior to the 2008 elections the media and most of our elected representatives laughed at Ron Paul and his conservative agenda and wholeheartedly supported Barack Obama .
Do you think we may have been sold the wrong agenda ?

Another person was wrongly convicted in Kentucky .
Yesterday Edwin Chandler became the ninth innocent person since 2000 helped by the Kentucky Innocence Project to have a conviction set aside in the state “ when Jefferson Circuit Judge Fred Cowan vacated the manslaughter and robbery charges against Chandler after prosecutors and police announced they had convicted the wrong man ” the Louisville Courier - Journal reports .
Chandler ’s vindication is another example of how unreliable the justice system can be , even when it tries hard to be fair .
You can watch Judge Cowan apologize to Chandler for the justice system ’s mistake and Chandler ’s comments here :
According to The Courier - Journal :
“ When Steve Schroering prosecuted Chandler in 1995 , he said he had no doubt that the right man went to prison .
“ It was never a case I had second thoughts about until this morning ” when Commonwealth ’s Attorney Dave Stengel called to tell him the conviction was being set aside .
Jurors in Chandler ’s trial never heard from an eye witness –who ’d left his contact information with the police–who said the wrong man was in custody .
In addition to the nine individuals wrongly convicted in Kentucky who were helped by the Kentucky Innocence Project , Larry Osborne was released from death row in 2002 after a jury in a second trial found him not guilty .
The high risk of making mistakes is reason enough to end the use of the death penalty in Kentucky .

Adjustable shocks are a great thing .
One minute you can be soft and absorbent over the rocks and trails , the next you can be cranked up to the max for high speed pre-running over the ruts and rocks .
As it turns out pre-running can be hard on a stock ignition system .
I found this out during a spring trip into the fern covered mountains when some high - speed pre-running fun shook a bug out of the ignition system of my 1978 Jeep CJ - 7 .
Several rounds of testing and troubleshooting yielded no cause and no fix for the ailing sparkless stock Ford Duraspark ignition system .
Before spending too much time on it , I decided it was time for an upgrade .
Enter the HEI .
Why an HEI ?
The AMC HEI distributors fits the AMC 290 , 304 , 343 , 360 , 390 , and 401 ci engines .
They also make them for the 6 cylinder engine as well .
They utilizing the durable and dependable High Energy Ignition ( HEI ) system pioneered by GM .
The HEI distributors incorporate easily found High Energy Ignition replacement parts .
They 're a durable 1 - piece design with the coil and module mounted internally for an easy 1 - wire hook - up .
Plus by eliminating the stock AMC ballast resistor , more ignition voltage results and you get improved spark that permits a bigger spark plug gap , resulting in more power and reduced plug fouling .
What is an HEI and how it compares to the stock Jeep CJ ignition system ?
When you look at a stock Jeep CJ - 7 ignition system , it consists of a few key components .
First the starter solenoid provides power .
You also have a coil , the distributor , a vacuum advance , a cap and rotor , below the cap and rotor , an induction coil and a star gear that tells the ignition module when to ground the coil , which in turn sends spark to the rotor and out to the spark plugs .
All of these main components are in different locations under the hood and a bunch of wires run back and forth to interconnect the components .
My Stock Ford Duraspark ignition system had a few minor upgrades .
An MSD Blaster Coil built for offroad abuse , a set of aftermarket spark plug wires , quality spark plugs and some new stock parts , those being a new cap and rotor , a new pickup coil under the cap , a new ignition module and solid , soldered wiring .
But something failed and to this day , I do n't know what it was even though I replaced and tested everything I could think of including all the wires that run back and forth between the components .
Of course I did n't pour a lot of time into troubleshooting the old system , I was soon to be acquiring an HEI setup to replace it anyway .
I did want to try to figure out what was wrong , just so I knew but gave up after one go around testing or swapping out each component with spares I had around .
The HEI ignition system is a bit different .
First , everything is contained within and on the distributor itself .
A single power supplying wire coming from your starter solenoid / ignition switch is all that is required .
Another wire runs from the distributor to your tachometer .
It 's simple and reliable .
With most HEI distributors , parts are readily available with lots of aftermarket options .
On the market there are a few sources for HEI ignition systems for the Jeep AMC 360 .
DUI makes a nice setup for a cost in the $ 400 + range .
I also found one made by CRT Performance for much less .
Proform Street / Strip also makes HEI Distributors for the AMC V8 engine .
Ultimately I bought one off of ebay from the seller qtip43 who converts GM Style HEI distributors to work with AMC / Jeep V8 engines 290-304-343-360-390-401 .
I also picked up a Set of HEI spark plug wires made by Live Wires .
Here 's the description of the HEI by the Ebay seller qtip43 of Sterling Heights , MI , United States .
He also has HEI - AMC / JEEP conversion Distributor for 232-258 inline 6 cyl. AMC / JEEP ( GM - STYLE ) HEI Distributor 290-401
AMC/JEEP distributor conversion for 290-304-343-360-390-401 .
Eliminate the original unreliable distributor with this 1 - wire hook up unit .
Features 50,000 volt built in coil , low saturation ignition module , and brass terminal cap .
Engine will run much smoother with added throttle response .
Unit uses easy to replace GM parts and HEI ignition wires .
Also has provision for tach hook up .
Each unit tested before shipped .
Add $ 15 for shipping .
Here 's a breakdown of the GM Style HEI Distributor that was installed on this AMC 360 Jeep engine .
Everything in the ignition system is contained within the HEI distributor .
All that is necessary is to supply 12 volts to the power plug located under the rectangle sticking out the side of the HEI Distributor .
Next to the 12 volt power plug is a place to plug in your tach .
Removing the cap from the distributor .
Below the top dust cover is the 50,000 volt coil .
Below the cap is the rotor .
The underside of the cap is similar to the stock cap .
Removing the rotor exposes the advance curve precision weights and springs .
Below the advance curve weights is the High - Performance low - saturation ignition control module .
Vacuum Advance unit .
Wire harness and capacitor
Below the advance curve weights is are inner and outer magnetic star ring .
Not sure about the exact naming of them but the inner star ring is attached to the distributor shaft and when the shaft spins , the points in the rings come within hundredths of an inch , telling the ignition module its time to ground the coil to produce a spark .
When compared to the stock magnetic trigger , this setup is much more precise .
Live Wires HEI Spark Plug Wires Distributor Gear ( in this case for the AMC V8 ) and oil pump slot at the base of the distributor shaft .
The HEI Replaces entirely this old , for the most part , stock ignition system : I also had a MSD Blaster Coil rated for Offroad with an epoxy core .
An old Motorcraft distributor , cap and rotor and all the guts of it .
In my case I had a few aftermarket parts mixed in including a set of MSD larger than stock wires , 8.5 m m I think they were .
The 2nd ( or third ? )
Motorcraft ignition module that I 've gone through .
When these fail , they fail without warning .
If you have one of these , it 's wise to carry a spare .
Below the cap is the rotor .
Simple and basic .
Removing the rotor exposes the induction coil , or magnetic trigger that has the job of detecting when the star gear on the distributor shaft passes .
This in turn tells the ignition module to ground the coil and create spark .
I 've had these fail where the Jeep would fire up but when the engine got warm , this coil would open up and not work .
the engine cooled ( or the coil cooled ) and it would fire again .
What a bitch it was to figure that one out .
I had a whole slew of these plugs .
4 or 5 of them with 2 or 3 wires each .
These created a maze of wiring running back and forth across the engine bay .
When I was troubleshooting , I had to check each wire for continuity and trace each wire through from one side to the other .
They 're all gone now .
2 wires with the HEI , 12 volts to the HEI and a wire from my tachometer to the HEI .
Vacuum Advance .
Here 's a better idea .

Borlaug received both praise ( " More than any other single person of this age , he has helped provide bread for a hungry world .
We have made this choice in the hope that providing bread will also give the world peace " , said the Nobel peace prize committee , while the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization declared him “ A towering scientist ” and a “ great benefactor of humankind ” ) from those impressed by the rise in agricultural productivity he engineered , and condemnation ( " Aside from Kissinger , probably the biggest killer of all to have got the peace prize was Norman Borlaug , whose " green revolution " wheat strains led to the death of peasants by the million " is a typical example from Alexander Cockburn at Counterpunch ) from those concerned by the impact of the introduction of industrial agriculture around the globe .
Borlaug did n't approve of the " green revolution " moniker , dubbing it " a miserable term " ( what he would have made of " The Agrichemical Revolutionary " is n't clear ) but his work has had a far - reaching impact on the course of human development .
Borlaug 's Life
Borlaug grew up on a farm in Iowa and then studied for a Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics at the University of Minnesota .
In 1944 , Borlaug took up an agricultural research position in Mexico as part of the Rockefeller Foundation project to help farmers modernise crop production , where he developed semi-dwarf , high - yield , disease - resistant wheat varieties over a period of 16 years .
The Foundation 's interest may not have been entirely altruistic - the Mexican government had nationalised the country 's oil supply in 1939 , to the dismay of the family 's " Standard Oil " company , and there were concerns that the country may align itself with Germany during the war .
Borlaug 's wheat breeding program produced semi- dwarf strains as the shorter stems enabled the plant to grow larger heads of grain without collapsing - with the extra growth prompted by the application of nitrogen fertiliser .
The strains developed by Borlaug were very successful - by 1963 , 95 % of Mexico 's wheat crops were products of the program .
That year , the country 's wheat harvest was 6 times larger than in 1944 , the year Borlaug arrived - Mexico had become self - sufficient in wheat production .
In the 1960's , Borlaug shifted to India , working on similar projects there to alleviate famine .
While the situation in India and Pakistan at the time was bleak ( Biologist and " Population Bomb " author Paul Ehrlich remarking " I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self - sufficient in food by 1971 " and " India could n't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980 " ) , Borlaug 's programs were successful - in Pakistan , wheat yields nearly doubled , from 4.6 million tons in 1965 to 7.3 million tons in 1970 .
In India , yields increased from 12.3 million tons in 1965 to 20.1 million tons in 1970 - by 1974 , India was self - sufficient in cereal production .
Borlaug did not appear to be interested in politics - he believed that the problems of hunger and poverty could be solved by increasing crop yields , and set out to do so by applying technology to plant science .
He often advocated increasing crop yields as a way of curbing deforestation - a methodology that came to be known as the " Borlaug hypothesis " ( increasing the productivity of agriculture on existing farmland can help control deforestation by reducing the demand for new farmland ) .
Borlaug was worried about the limited availability of farmland to expand food production further to meet increasing global demand - " we will have to double the world food supply by 2050 " he noted .
With around 85 % of future growth in food production having to come from land already in use , he recommended a multidisciplinary research approach - mainly through increasing crop immunity to large - scale diseases such as the rust fungus .
While Borlaug became ever more optimistic about further increasing crop yields , he did occasionally sound Malthusian style warnings about population growth , particularly in the 1970's - " future food - production increases will have to come from higher yields .
And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up , whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter .
Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong , the next century will experience sheer human misery that , on a numerical scale , will exceed the worst of everything that has come before " .
Over time Borlaug became convinced that we could feed the world adequately ( given projections that global population will eventually plateau at around 9.5 billion people ) , as long as the methods he recommended were adopted universally , stating in 2000 : " I now say that the world has the technology — either available or well advanced in the research pipeline — to feed on a sustainable basis a population of 10 billion people .
The more pertinent question today is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use this new technology ?
While the affluent nations can certainly afford to adopt ultra low - risk positions , and pay more for food produced by the so - called ' organic ' methods , the one billion chronically undernourished people of the low income , food - deficit nations cannot . "
Borlaug 's work earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 and ( amongst numerous other awards ) the 1977 US Presidential Medal of Freedom and the US Congressional Gold Medal in 2006 .
Criticisms of the Green Revolution
Borlaug's " green revolution " has been criticised for decades by a wide variety of different groups for all sorts of reasons - ranging from making farmers dependent on a range of industrial products to soil and aquifer depletion to creating a food production system that is dependent on a finite supply of fossil fuel based inputs .
One memorable description of this combined school of thought came from Zaid Hassan , who noted " there are so many criticisms around the current global food system that for a while I started wondering if in fact it had already collapsed and I was studying a post - apocalyptic food system " .
Input - intensive monoculture farming -
The primary criticism of " green revolution " style industrial agriculture is that it results in farmers becoming dependent on a range of industrial inputs - farming machinery , fertiliser , pesticides , irrigation equipment , seeds and even capital ( debt ) to purchase these inputs - often resulting in small scale farmers being pushed off the land ( particularly if they are unable to repay their debts during a bad season ) and resulting in large scale agribusinesses that produce monoculture crops that are prone to pests and diseases unless large amounts of pesicide are applied .
Critics from the developing world often note that the profits from this transformation seem to be reaped by multinational corporations like Monsanto , Dupont , Cargill and Archers Daniels Midland rather than the farmers growing the crops ( who often saw crop prices fall as yields increased ) - and that their national food security was now dependent on foreign suppliers .
Side effects of fertilisers and pesticides -
The side effects of large scale fertiliser and pesticide use are also pointed to by Borlaug 's critics , noting increased rates of cancer and other health problems in rural areas and damage to the ecosystems that these inputs drain into ( for example , the " dead zone " in the Gulf of Mexico ) .
Water and soil depletion -
As a result of modern irrigation practices , aquifers in places like India ( once Borlaug 's greatest triumph ) and the US midwest have become depleted .
Soil depletion is also a problem - since the 1880s almost half of the topsoil of the Great Plains of North America has disappeared .
Genetically modified crops -
The risks associated with genetically modified crops - the next frontier for increasing crop yields in the wake of the first green revolution , which Borlaug dubbed " The Gene Revolution " - remain hotly debated , with critics raising objections based on food safety issues , ecological concerns and economic concerns ( centering on the application of patents and intellectual property rights to engineered seeds ) .
Fossil fuel dependence -
The inputs for green revolution style industrial agriculture are almost entirely derived from fossil fuels .
Production of nitrogen fertiliser via the Haber process ( mostly in the form of anhydrous ammonia , ammonium nitrate , and urea ) consumes between 3 and 5 % of world natural gas production .
Farm machinery like tractors and irrigation pumps consume fuel , and tractor tyres and plastic irrigation pipes are made from petrochemicals , as are pesticides .
Writers like Richard Manning ( The Oil We Eat ) , Dale Allen Pfeiffer ( Eating Fossil Fuels ) and Glenn Morton ( The Connection Between Food Supply and Energy : What Is the Role of Oil Price ? ) have argued that the green revolution will prove unsustainable once we have passed their peak production point for fossil fuels .
Borlaug dismissed the claims of most critics .
Of environmental lobbyists he said , " some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of the earth , but many of them are elitists .
They 've never experienced the physical sensation of hunger .
They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or Brussels .
If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world , as I have for fifty years , they'd be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things " .
Borlaug was also indignant about arguments in favour of natural fertilisers like cow manure rather than inorganic fertilisers .
Using manure would require a massive expansion of the lands required for grazing the cattle , he said , and consume much of the extra grain that would be produced .
He claimed that such techniques could support no more than 4 billion people worldwide , well under the current global population of almost 7 billion .
This point is still being debated , with researchers at the University of Michigan and University of California claiming that organic farming techniques can indeed feed the world .
We can also increase food production by making better use of urban land ( something " guerilla gardeners " are fond of - and similar ideas are being put into practice by large scale tree planting programs in India ) .
Even if we do n't fully take the organic agriculture path , some of the objections based on fossil fuel depletion would seem to be solvable .
If we shift completely to renewable energy sources for power production , we can eliminate a large proportion of our natural gas and coal usage , freeing the remaining reserves for agricultural applications and extending the lifespan of green revolution techniques far out into the future .
Whether or not we choose to do so quickly enough remains to be seen .

Enriching Your Multimedia Experience With XBMC
Are you wondering how long you should wait before you buy a Media Center PC ?
Or you 're just dreaming to have your current computer transformed into a device that exactly resembles the one which docking at your friends ' living room running that pricey Windows Media Center without spending any money ?
Behold , here arrives XBMC Media Center , a free and complete media center software for all OS .
XBMC stands for “ Xbox Media Center “ .
This is a free and open source multimedia - player and entertainment hub software for all your digital media .
You might be wondering “ ok , this is supposed to run on PC right ?
( Well it better should , it appear in this articles for PC anyway ) .
But why is it named after Microsoft gaming console ? ”
Well here is the short story before we move on to our coverage of this free standout multimedia center .
XBMC Media Center was started out as a homebrew media - player software for original Xbox back in 2002 ( previously named as XBMP - Xbox Media Player ) .
As a homebrew , application that is typically created as a hobby by small group of individuals ( that is where ‘ homebrew ’ comes from ) and distributed freely , XBMC has been a successful substitution for original Microsoft Xbox dashboard ( official Xbox GUI ) that is also functioning as media player but with limited features .
After four years in development , XBMC celebrated point 2.0 release which marked another milestone due to more crazy features that are packed into the program such as RAR and ZIP archive support , iTunes 6.x DAAP support , and UPnP Clients for streaming .
These features seem like a superfluously too much if we consider that this is a multimedia player for a game console , a closed architecture system .
Now due to its popularity , XBMC has journeyed a long way to PC , the home of the Titans of multimedia center products that flood the market .
How does it fare with the more “ serious ” commercial products ?
In our opinion it does very , very well .
Here we reveal what XBMC can transform your computer into .
1 . User -Friendly Media Center
XBMC is easy to install , setup , personalize , and use .
Despite its simplistic , its user interface is beautiful not only in still but also in motion .
You can see the slide from one media window to another giving a smooth transition and image changing effect .
You can also choose from three available themes to better suite your taste ( available more to download ) .
Simplistic but beautiful , surely this combination makes underpowered computer seems to have a place in the world of multimedia center .
So what are you waiting for ?
Take your old system that is hiding a long time to make an appearance in your living room .
But make sure you have a decent graphic card .
2 . Full Multimedia Experience XBMC supports a wide array of audio , video , and picture file formats and codecs from virtually any source including USB flash drive , CD , DVD , and even network and online sources .
This wide support means that you can assure yourself that this application will eat easily any media you throw at it .
Have a DVD movie image under ISO / IMF file format , just browse it and XBMC will play it with no difficulty .
For playback , XBMC offer playlist playback , spectacular audio visualization , and picture slideshow .
Specialized for music , you can expect features like gaples , ReplayGain , cross fading , pre-amplification playback option , smart playlists , and chapter support .
And when opening pictures , features like panning / zooming and slideshow ( with “ Ken Burns Effect “ ) are available .
Comic
Book lover also do n’t hesitate the ability of XBMC to handles CBZ and CBR comic book archive files .
Including in this feature are view / read , browse , and zoom of your comic book pictures without ever need uncompressing them first .
For those Internet freaks , Xbox Media Center can download and stream Internet video and audio , play Podcasts and SHOUTcast , and last but not least discover and stream new music through Last . fm , among others .
3 . Powerful Media Management
For a true multimedia lover with piles of collection of media , a decent management system is truly needed .
Fortunately , XBMC is equipped with the same quality of multimedia organizer that is offered by commercial products .
For your video content , you can easily browse it according to genre , title , year , actors / artist , and so on .
In music division , similarly , XBMC ’s can read the information stored in the ID file meta tags , like title , artist , album , genre , and popularity while still allowing you to search under its Smart Playlists feature .
When taking the benefit of your broadband internet connection , XBMC can automatically download artworks , fan art , reviews on movies , or episodes information for TV shows .
At the beginning of this article we mentioned that XBMC is developed under open - source application label .
Maybe you think “ yes sure , it stands out at this very moment , but what about next year and so on ?
That will differentiate it with the commercial product with strong financial support . ”
But talking about longevity , maybe you forgot that we also mentioned that XBMC has started its appearance way back in 2002 and since then it has been developed significantly .
The fact that it has been brought to desktop computer under multiple OS is a proven longevity .
But to make sure you can sleep at night , we reveal that over 50 contributor developers are at works on XBMC , over 100 translators from various countries have expand its language capabilities .
From the community standpoint , XBMC have over 30,000 registered members .
Moreover from add - ons standpoint , XBMC uses two add - on engines .
The first is the one that has been took from the original Xbox version ( Phyton ) .
And the second is WindowXML application framework , the same one that has brought you widget in your Windows Vista sidebar .
With these two options , we will see many other add - ons appearing on the application .
So we guarantee it will hang with us much longer than you could ever think .
You can download XBMC at xbmc.org
WASHINGTON --
The introduction of K - 12 engineering education has the potential to improve student learning and achievement in science and mathematics , increase awareness about what engineers do and of engineering as a potential career , and boost students ' technological literacy , according to a new report from the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council .
The report examines the status and nature of efforts to teach engineering in U.S. schools .
" The problem solving , systems thinking , and teamwork aspects of engineering can benefit all students , whether or not they ever pursue an engineering career , " said Linda Katehi , chancellor of the University of California , Davis , and chair of the committee that wrote the report .
" A K - 12 education that does not include at least some exposure to engineering is a lost opportunity for students and for the nation . "
Engineering education at the K - 12 level should emphasize engineering design and a creative problem - solving process , the committee said .
It should include relevant concepts in mathematics , science , and technology , as well as support the development of skills many believe essential for the 21st century , including systems thinking , collaboration , and communication .
While science , technology , engineering , and mathematics instruction is collectively referred to as " STEM education , " the report finds that the engineering component is often absent in policy discussions and in the classroom .
In fact , engineering might be called the missing letter in STEM , the report says .
In preparing the report , the committee conducted an in - depth analysis of 15 K - 12 engineering curricula ; reviewed scientific literature related to learning engineering concepts and skills ; evaluated evidence on the impact of K - 12 engineering education initiatives ; and collected preliminary information about pre-collegiate engineering education programs in other countries .
The committee found that engineering education opportunities in K - 12 schools have expanded considerably in the past 15 years .
Since the early 1990s , the report estimates , about 6 million children have been exposed to some formal engineering coursework .
However , this number is still small compared with the overall number of students in K - 12 schools ( approximately 56 million in 2008 ) .
The committee noted that many challenges remain to expanding the availability and improving the quality of these programs , including the absence of content standards to guide development of instructional materials , limited pre-service education for engineering teachers , and structural and policy impediments to including this new subject in an already crowded school curriculum .
With these challenges in mind , the committee recommended that :
the National Science Foundation or U.S. Department of Education fund research to determine how science inquiry and mathematical reasoning can be connected to engineering design in curricula and professional development ;
foundations and federal agencies with an interest in K - 12 engineering education conduct long - term research to confirm and refine findings of studies of the impacts of engineering education ;
the American Society of Engineering Education begin a national dialogue on preparing K - 12 engineering teachers , and on the pros and cons of establishing a formal credentialing process ; and
philanthropic foundations or federal agencies with an interest in STEM education and school reform identify models of implementation for K - 12 engineering education that will work for different American school systems .
The committee also noted the importance of clarifying the meaning of " STEM literacy " and of developing curricula that would particularly appeal to groups typically underrepresented in engineering , such as girls , African Americans , and Hispanics .

Hakes designed these fascinating shoes with no sole .
The support is there , though , for the heel and ball of the foot , which forms a natural bridge between the two .
In the course of designing , he had tracing paper and masking tape on his foot , drew the patterns , and then used a scalpel to cut it off .
Thanks to Facebook , Flickr , Twitter , and a host of other social media services , people are more connected than ever .
But keeping up with all the tweets , posts , and status updates is n't easy , because they often come from a variety of social media sites .
So how do you connect the different services that keep you connected ?
How do you steer all of that stuff to one spot on the Web where it's a snap to manage ?
New tools called social media aggregators have risen to address that challenge .
Their goal : to provide you with one simple point of entry where you can keep track of the streams from any and all of the most popular social networking sites .
A bunch of social media aggregators ( or " life - streaming " tools , as they 're sometimes called ) have shown up in recent years , but some social media services do n't always do the job you need them to do .
Here ’s a look at the three that , in our estimation , fulfill the promise of social media aggregation most completely : Streamy , Flock , and FriendFeed .
Streamy
Streamy is a Web site designed to collect not just all of your favorite social media sites but also blogs and instant messaging tools , putting them into one self - contained dashboard .
The first time you log in to Streamy , you wo n’t see much of consequence -- that ’s because you need to link your services with Streamy first .
Click on the Setup link on the top left , and you ’ll see nine different services to choose from , ranging from Facebook and Twitter to Digg , Flickr , and even FriendFeed .
Unlike Flock and FriendFeed , Streamy does n’t pull all of your separate social sites into a single , aggregated river of social updates .
Instead it keeps each service in a separate “ tab , ” which you can access by clicking on the icon for each service .
The nice thing about this arrangement is that Streamy allows you to customize each service with advanced layouts and widgets to keep up with custom searches ( in Flickr or Twitter , for example ) or tagged photos or events ( in Facebook ) .
As such , Streamy does n’t merely act as a dashboard for all of your social media sites ; it also allows you to create a custom dashboard for every site , offering a heads - up view of what ’s going on at each individual site based on what ’s important to you .
Finally , Streamy makes it easy to post a status update to all of your sites in one fell swoop :
You simply click the ' What are you doing ? ' status box that ’s always visible on the right side of the page and tick the check box of each service where you want your update to post .
Flock
Unlike the other two tools discussed here , both of which are Web services , Flock is a desktop application .
In fact , Flock is a full - fledged Web browser , built from the same open - source code that powers the popular Firefox browser .
The difference between Firefox and Flock ?
Flock is a “ social Web browser , ” meaning that it ’s designed specifically to integrate seamlessly with over 20 social media sites , including Delicious , Facebook , Twitter , Flickr , MySpace , YouTube , and even your Gmail account ( see Flock ’s services tour for more details . )
Getting Flock up and running with your favorite services is simple .
The first time you open Flock , it will prompt you to log in to supported social sites .
Once you log in to a service , Flock can automatically add that service to your People sidebar ( click on the Remember Account drop - down ) .
This People sidebar is where Flock shines .
Each time you log in to a new supported account , that account appears in the People sidebar .
From there , you can click on any of the account icons to see each service individually , or you can click on the All button to see every status update from all of your services aggregated into one chronological feed .
You can even post updates to supported sites directly from the People sidebar .
If you have a particular affinity for Facebook , Flock ’s FlockCast feature can even post any action you undertake on one of your other social sites -- such as uploading new pictures to Flickr - - directly to your Facebook account .
The fact that Flock is a download has its pros and cons .
On the plus side , Flock does n’t require you to give the keys to your social media to just any old third - party Web site , and that helps to preserve your online security .
On the minus side , social media aggregation is just one aspect of Flock - - it 's a complete Web browser , and unless you want to switch your Web browsing duties over to Flock entirely , using Flock just for social media aggregation is a bit like carrying around an entire toolbox when all you use is one screwdriver .
( Some people wo n’t find that bothersome in the least . )
Also , since Flock is not Web - based , you can access your aggregated social media via Flock only on computers where you can download and install the application , meaning you ’ll be out of luck on most public and some work computers .
FriendFeed
FriendFeed was one of the first social media aggregators to hit the scene in a big way .
Founded by a handful of former Google employees , FriendFeed consolidates social updates from 58 services ( at the time of this writing ) , from Facebook and Twitter to Google Reader , Last.fm , and even Netflix ( letting your buddies know what movies you ’ve queued ) .
In stark contrast to the other two offerings compared here , which pull your friends ’ activity directly from your social sites into a centralized tool , FriendFeed focuses more on you , allowing you to pull all of your social output into one central location .
That is , rather than providing you with a single place to keep track your buddies ' output , the first thing FriendFeed does is provide your friends with a single place to keep track of you .
For example , FriendFeed can aggregate all of your tweets , Facebook status updates , and even posts from your blog , so rather than your trying to update all of your social sites every time you do something on the Web , your friends can just subscribe to your FriendFeed to see all of your updates in one place , no matter where you ’ve posted them .
As an added bonus , your friends do n’t have to go looking for you every time you start a new account somewhere , since presumably you ’d add any new social accounts to your FriendFeed .
FriendFeed is laid out a lot like Twitter , but instead of showing just tweets , it collects everything you do online ( or at least everything you do on a connected service ) .
If you really like the FriendFeed interface , you can post updates to FriendFeed and Twitter simultaneously from your home page .
As an added bonus , when you follow people on FriendFeed , you get access to all of their updates in real time -- you do n’t even have to refresh your browser .

Cocaine decisions … ”
 Frank Zappa , THE MAN FROM UTOPIA
You wo n’t enjoy ZARDOZ for the plot .
You wont ’ enjoy ZARDOZ for the acting or special effects .
The only way to enjoy ZARDOZ is to watch it and keep repeating to yourself , ‘ someone MADE this .
Someone MADE this ”
The way to enjoy it is to watch it and imagine how ZARDOZ went from being an idea to a script , to a full - scale production .
. . all the way to distributors and theaters , and no one thought to say , ‘ Ummmmm .. . . . no.’
Imagine a science - fiction film where the entire special effects budget was spent on cocaine .
Not just for the director and script - writer , but also enough cocaine to make the producer and studio heads COMPLETELY UNAWARE of the film ’s content .
That ’s the only way this film could possibly have been made .
On the other hand , I ’m sure this could be said of lots of films !
But what ’s unique about ZARDOZ is that manages to be simultaneously jaw - droppingly horrific and AT THE SAME TIME really boring and pretentious .
Just when you think that you ’re about to fall asleep , the director shows you something so absurd that you wake back up .
And you think to yourself , ‘ there ’s no way he can top this .
There ’s just no way . ’
And yet , he always does .
You ’ll say : “ Oh , there ’s a giant stone head flying around the sky , yelling in a reverb-y voice , ‘ THE GUN IS GOOD !
THE PENIS IS EVIL !
THE PENIS SHOOTS SEEDS TO PRODUCE THE HATED HUMANS !
WHILE THE GUN SHOOTS DEATH TO CLEANSE THE EARTH !’ and then the giant stone head vomits a huge cascade of rifles out of its mouth .
For three minutes .
he ca n’t top that . ”
Unless the next scene features a 40 - year - old James Bond , ( Sean Connery ) , as a barbarian , wearing nothing but bright red underoos and stowing away inside the stone head HIDING INSIDE A PILE OF WHEAT .
No , he ca n’t top that .
But wait , James Bond has been captured by asexual , immortal female scientists who are showing him scientific movies of female mud wrestling to make him pitch a tent in his red underoos .
Well , it ca n’t get any better than this , can it ?
Not unless Bond has to discover the ‘ evil underside ’ of this perfect , immortal utopia .
( I mean , what ’s an immortal utopia without a dark underside ?
Or an unthinkable price to pay ?
Or , say , secrets that man was not meant to know ?? )
Apparently the immortals are telepathic , and if they catch anyone thinking bad thoughts the transgressors are forced to age until they become senile .
These ‘ Renegades ’ are locked up in a greenhouse wearing tuxedos and forced to swingdance for eternity .
This is supposed to tell us that the Immortals are just as corrupted as the ‘ Brutals ’ that live outside the ‘ Vortex zone ’ .
But all it really tells us is where all the cocaine went in 1973 .
But , how do you top that ????
Well , you have to have Brutal Bond enslaved by the Immortals and forced to drag a rickshaw full of bread around , while being whipped by some guy that looks like Barry Manilow .
That alone would be enough to kick the ass of most other films .
But what makes this scene better than the scenes above is this : the bread is going to a warehouse full of Immortals who have become so bored with immortality that they ca n’t be bothered to move or react to anything .
Did I mention that this utopian paradise has a dark side ?
These people are called Capital - ‘A ’- Apathetics .
And Brutal Bond has to shove bread in their mouths .
Eventually his barbarian instinct takes over and he tries to have sex with an Apathetic woman , with Barry Manilow egging him on .
But when she does n’t try to escape , he gets mad and hurls her body across the room onto a pile of straw !!!!
Jesus .
Well , obviously the way you top that is to have a ‘ telepathic battle scene ’ ( did I mention that the Immortals are telepathic ? ) .
Where does this telepathic battle scene take place ?
At the dinner table , where the Immortals eat their usual meal of baguettes grown by the Brutals in their slave - labor camps .
But because this is science fiction , the baguettes are BRIGHT GREEN .
And one Immortal keeps yelling ‘ NO , I WON ’T GO INTO TYPE B MEDITATION WITH YOU !!
I WON ’T I WON’T !!’ and this sets off the battle .
But because , as I may have noted , ALL THE SPECIAL EFFECTS MONEY WAS SENT STRAIGHT TO COLUMBIA , they had to indicate the telepathy by having the dinner guests wave their fingers at the guy .
For five minutes .
While chanting ‘ renegade , RENEGAAADE !!!!’ and the guy ( who looks like Eric Idle in a Rennisance Fair costume ) jerks spastically and chokes on his green baguette - of - the - future .
Then one of the female scientists does some DNA testing on James Bond and confides to him that he ’s not a sub - human Brutal at all .
In fact , he ’s a mutant that ’s superior to the Immortals .
He was genetically engineered by the swing - dancing , senile , Renegade Immortals to have superpowers so he could come back and kill all of them .
Because humans were n’t designed to have immortality and they ’re all going insane anyway and want to kill themselves but can’t .
What with the Immortality and all .
So , to help him defeat the Non-Renegade Immortals , the science babes have to do a ‘ mind meld ’ type of thing where they telepathically teach Bond all their advanced knowledge .
But because of the lack of special effects , they have to indicate the ‘ mind meld ’ by having group sex with him .
While some hippy projects ‘ scientific ’ slides over their copulating bodies .
For ten minutes .
And Bond is still in his little red underoos with his hairy chest , and his little middle - aged man-teats .
So , how can anyone top this , you ask ?
Well , you can ’t .
I mean , the director tries .
He tries to be spectacular .
He reveals that the secret of the Immortals ’ power is an extraterrestrial computer called THE TABERNACLE that lives in this tiny golf ball , and has Barbarian Bond use his newly - discovered mutant superpowers to do psychic battle with the tabernacle and unlock its secrets .
( apparently battling a psychic alien computer looks a lot like running around a funhouse full of mirrors , in your underwear , looking really concerned ) .
But that scene can’t really compare with flying stone heads or scientific mud wrestling .
So he tries even harder .
. .
He stages a civil war among the Immortals .
The premise of the civil war is that half of the Immortals are pro-Bond and half are anti-Bond .
The anti-Bond forces think he ’s a Brutal barbarian and will bring chaos and destruction .
Actually , the pro-Bond forces think the same thing , but they ’re so fucking bored with immortality they think chaos and destruction are exciting .
So while Bond is turning from this Brutal barbarian into this enlightened superhuman mutant , the Immortals are busy turning from decadent rich people into savage warriors .
This is the ‘ irony ’ that ’s supposed to make this movie all ‘ existential ’ and ‘ philosophical ’ and ‘ not like an average sci - fi movie . ’
Somehow this movie is supposed to be an allegory for the utopian ’60s liberalism , or an allegory for man ’s freedom of choice , or something heavy like that .
But the ‘ civil war ’ is basically half a dozen transvestite Rennisance Fair refugees galloping around on horseback , yelling ‘ GET HIM !!’ while Superhuman Mutant Bond uses his new superpowers to awaken the Apathetics from their slumber and turn them into sexual zombies whose massive orgy blocks the path of the vengeful horseriders .
Which is of course totally absurd and disturbing , but somehow anticlimactic .
Eventually Superhuman Mutant Bond uses his superpowers to paralyze the anti-Bond forces .
The Pro-Bond forces are begging him to kill everyone , because that ’s what they genetically engineered him to do .
But the irony is ( did I mention this film is full of irony and it ’s supposed to be really heavy ?? ) the irony is , by this time he ’s so ‘ highly evolved ’ he ca n’t revert to his Brutal ways and commit cold - blooded murder .
Just when things look really bleak for all the suicidal Immortals , a further irony occurs : the rest of Bond ’s Brutal tribe , who have been absent for 90 % of the film , suddenly show up and kill everyone .
The end .
Huh ???
So , as completely jaw - droppingly fucked up as this film is , at least give it credit for killing everyone .
I mean , how many times have you watched a lame film and wished that a metorite would hit everyone , or the Plague would just strike everyone down , and you could leave the theater early ?
Well , this film actually does it .
“ Shit , this film is 6 hours long already , and no one can figure out the plot , and we ’re almost out of cocaine ! ! ”
“ Well , let ’s just kill everyone ! ” “ OK , cue barbarian horde ! ”
If the barbarian hordes could kill characters in OTHER films as well , then ZARDOZ would have a good excuse for having been made .
As it is , you should only watch it if you think I ’ve been making all this up .
Jesus .

Despite continued discussions about fundamental USD weakness , and the fine job the government is doing devaluating our currency , I can't help but seeing reasons to buy the USD .
My view does not rely on contradicting the thinking according to which excess liquidity and unbalanced budgets for the government and the consumer lead to weaker currency .
But I think that the amount of currency being " retired " with debt not being rolled and the velocity being null is partly countering the excessive printing .
Also , one need also to keep in mind that when it comes to currencies all is relative , and while the Fed and the Treasury department are certainly not acting with a strong USD in mind these days , other countries have embarked on a similar path .
Last but certainly not least , almost everybody is short USD .
Investors are long commodities as a placement AGAINST the value of the USD , and banks and governments around the world borrow in USD .
Germany and Austria have recently issued debt that is USD denominated , and they were soon immitated by ... Venezuela .
That to me is a sign the short - USD trade is ripe for a reversal , when basically even the biggest idiot in the house is short .
The ultimate pain trade would certainly be renewed USD strength .
Maybe if it happens the Fed will have the pleasure this time of bailing Venezuela with cross-currency swaps .
Having said all this I have been pointing out a turn when the EURUSD started trading above 1.47 .
We now have some very interesting elements graphically that confirm a turn may be in the works .
Weekly charts for the EURUSD and AUDUSD show how the market has come back to test the former bullish support as resistance , and so far has failed to reintegrate the channel .
GBPUSD has triggered a bearish H&S and a pull - back towards 1.615/1.618 should be sold .
Finally , USDJPY is posting today a bullish hammer on an intermediate bullish support , which adovcates for a correction towards at least 92.50 .
We will keep an eye on many other crosses as the situation evolves , but it seems technical indicators are starting to show a turn is a very real possibility .
Beware , because the number of people short USD out there is huge , and if the dollar index 's strength accelerates we could see a lot of stomping around the exit doors ...
Good luck trading ,
Nic

We ’ve covered overpopulation and its role in ecocide , and in turn in throwing us into tyranny , before on this blog .
It ’s worth also mentioning that our dominant paradigm does not permit us to think of solutions that involve limiting the rights of people like us , which is why we are paralyzed on global warming because we feel no sense of efficacy in making decisions when we are manipulated .
Even more , it ’s worth pointing out that population growth produces people who are less intelligent and healthy rather than more , guaranteeing a slow civilization decline .
These are the problems of overpopulation : too many people , and by definition for any species that breeds out of control , those people are of low intelligence .
It ’s nature ’s way of surviving a cataclysm : 1 % will survive , so create as many as you can so that 1 % is a high enough number .
Yet with technology in our hands , that can be a fatal path .
And now today , someone makes an even stronger statement :
Nina Fedoroff told the BBC One Planet programme that humans had exceeded the Earth ’s “ limits of sustainability ” .
Dr Fedoroff has been the science and technology advisor to the US secretary of state since 2007 , initially working with Condoleezza Rice .
Under the new Obama administration , she now advises Hillary Clinton .
“ We need to continue to decrease the growth rate of the global population ; the planet ca n’t support many more people , ” Dr Fedoroff said , stressing the need for humans to become much better at managing “ wild lands ” , and in particular water supplies .
Pressed on whether she thought the world population was simply too high , Dr Fedoroff replied : “ There are probably already too many people on the planet . ”
BBC
Among populations with above 100 IQ points as the average , population growth is already negative ; these populations have stabilized and are declining .
It ’s the under - 100s worldwide that are booming , even when they exist among populations of higher IQ .
Remember , it ’s not where you were born that determines your IQ ; it ’s who your ancestors were .
IQ can not be raised by education and is only marginally influenced by a first - world diet .
Our philosophy , humanism , prohibits us from sacrificing any individual for the collective good .
That ’s the conservative part of it .
That induces individuals to form giant mobs , or Crowds that demand increasing rights and “ equality , ” which translates in reality into the ability to tear down those above them and enforce equality .
It ’s not just socialism — our pretty scientific and academic terms mask an ugly part of our simian heritage , which is known simply by the term envy .
We do n’t want a universal land of plenty ; we want to destroy those who did better than us .
It seems to me conservatives and liberals alike fall prey to this , as do members of any philosophy .
It ’s only those who achieve a Zen - like ability to act for themselves yet with total selflessness who are immune , and those are rare .

* Wall Street Journal to soon charge for mobile news
* Nonsubscribers to pay $ 2/ week ; Subscribers pay $ 1/week
* Murdoch says advertising environment “ very much better ” ( Adds details about pricing , advertising and Hulu )
NEW YORK , Sept 15 ( Reuters ) - The Wall Street Journal soon will begin charging people to read the paper on mobile devices such as their BlackBerrys , the paper ’s owner Rupert Murdoch said on Tuesday .
The move , which News Corp NWSA.O CEO Murdoch announced at a Goldman Sachs conference in New York , is an attempt to find a new way for the business daily to make more money from an increasingly popular way for people to access their news .
The Journal will start charging for mobile access “ in one to two months , ” Murdoch said .
Under the plan , people who do not subscribe to the Journal would pay $ 2 a week for mobile access , and subscribers would pay $ 1 per week .
Subscribers to both the print and online version of the paper will get mobile for free .
Charging for mobile access is one of the boldest ways yet that a U.S. newspaper has tried to increase revenue , at a time when falling circulation and print advertising revenue is threatening the survival of many newspapers .
The Wall Street Journal is one of the few U.S. newspapers that has successfully charged for access to news on the Internet .
This year , many U.S. newspaper publishers have been debating different ways to get people to pay for news online .
It is unclear if any of them will work .
At the Goldman Sachs event , Murdoch said the environment for advertising is “ very much better ” than three or four months ago -- a view echoed by a number of other industry executives .
He added that the company was mulling options such as subscriptions and pay - per-view for Hulu , the popular online video destination founded by News Corp and NBC Universal , which is majority owned by General Electric .

Alberto Fujimori is already serving three concurrent prison sentences
Ex -Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has been sentenced to six years in jail for corruption by a court in Lima .
Fujimori , who is already serving prison sentences for crimes including ordering killings by security forces , was in court for a fourth and final trial .
The charges relate to a scandal which brought down his government in 2000 .
During the trial , Fujimori , 71 , admitted that he had illegally tapped the phones of journalists , businessmen and opposition politicians .
Fujimori , who led Peru from 1990 to 2000 , returned from exile in late 2007 to face a number of charges .
Abuse of power
In April this year , he was sentenced to 25 years in jail for ordering the security forces to carry out killings and kidnappings .
In July he was sentenced to a further seven - and - a - half years for embezzlement after being convicted by Peru's Supreme Court of giving $ 15 m ( £ 9.3 m ) in state funds to his spy chief , Vladimiro Montesinos .
He was already serving a six - year term after being found guilty in 2007 on separate charges of abuse of power .
In the latest case , Fujimori admitted to charges that through Montesinos he bugged and bribed opposition politicians , journalists and businessmen .
A series of videos leaked in 2000 , showing Montesinos handing over piles of cash to prominent opposition leaders and media figures , prompted him and Fujimori to flee the country .
Fujimori escaped to Japan , where his parents were born , and lived in exile there for seven years .
Montesinos is currently in jail , convicted on dozens of charges including drug - trafficking and selling guns to Colombian rebels .

Even as the Pakistan government , under US pressure , claimed to have placed Jamaat - ud - Dawah chief and 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed under house arrest , one of Pakistan most influential journalists has said it would take years for Islamabad to dismantle the Lashkar - e - Tayiba , and the Pakistani army is in no mood to do it .
Najam Sethi , editor - in - chief of Pakistan 's Daily Times and Friday Times , in an interaction at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars , said : " I have been to the Lashkar 's headquarters and it is the most formidably scary sight -- I mean , it is a nightmare frankly . "
" I do not want to tell you a long story , " he said , " but I got into trouble with the Lashkar , and they basically said they were going to get us .
So , we had to go and meet Hafiz Saeed to apologize . "
Sethi recalled , " Neither the government of the day nor the ISI  nobody -- was prepared to negotiate on our behalf .
They were not going to touch it .
They said , you guys go and make your peace .
The chief minister said , ' I am not in touch with them and the chief minister wanted to help me . "
" So , we had to find ways and means of getting in touch with these guys and go and apologize .
And , you know , that whole complex is built like the mosque in Medina ( in Saudi Arabia ) and the folk there are out of another world , " he said .
Sethi , said , " If 5,000 of these folk ( some have estimated the strength of the LeT upwards of 150,000 ) decide to come out tomorrow in defense , there would be no police -- nowhere in sight .
They could take over the city . "
Thus , in response to India 's demands as well as that of the US in endorsing India 's call in the wake of the LeT allegedly being responsible for the Mumbai attack that had been preceded by a number of terrorist attacks within India either directly or through proxies , Sethi said , " Lashkar has to be dealt with in terms of a long - term solution -- many steps -- part disbanding them and re-orienting them , partly bribing them , giving them jobs , partly crushing them and selectively picking up their leaders . "
He reiterated , " It is going to be a long , drawn - out process , dismantling the Lashkar .
It is not going to happen overnight . "
Thus , Sethi said with the Pakistani Army today stretched to its limits with deployments of the eastern border with India and the western border fighting the Taliban and helping the US in fighting the war on terror -- not to mention being bogged down in the Swat Valley -- the last thing it had in its mind was to close down and completely dismantle the LeT infrastructure on the urging of India and the US .
Earlier , the noted journalist who was recently awarded the 2009 Golden Pen of Freedom , speaking of Pakistan 's current challenges , said that President Asif Zardari 's first year in office had been a flop .
" Zardari has not done well in his first year .
He had made a lot of mistakes , some of which are still clinging to him , " he said .
Sethi said one of these mistakes was " riling the Pakistani army when Mumbai happened .
Zardari was keen to make amends with India and went overboard in a sense as far as the Army was concerning in trying to bring peace .
He said some things , which the army did not like . "
" And , then he tried to , in a sense , get a grip on the ISI , and the army did n't like that either and he had to beat a retreat on all these fronts .
So , his relationship with the army was a bit troubled from day one .
And , then of course , having gotten rid of ( former President , Pervez ) Musharraf , he had to rebuild a relationship with General Kayani and that is still work in progress . "
Sethi said , " The army has lot of question marks about Zardari 's ability to run the government and also to deal with the United States .
The Pakistani army thinks he is soft on the US and the Pakistani army would like to take a harder line vis-a - vis these negotiating positions on Afghanistan and the war on terror , and Zardari is more inclined to look at the money side of it . "
" He wants to put money into the budget , he wants money from the United States , he wants to get the economy moving , but the army has other priorities . "
Sethi said , however , " At the end of the day , if there is a replacement for Zardari , it will have to be Nawaz Sharif .
There is no mood in the country for an army take - over or for the army to come back .
That is not on at all . "
Divorce
It ’s important to be fully aware of your legal rights and options as you work through a divorce .
The longer a divorce takes , the more expensive it ’ll be .
Mistakes are easy to make when you ’re unfamiliar with the process .
The best thing you can do is let an experienced Orlando divorce attorney advocate on your behalf .
Our lawyers will handle every aspect of your contested or uncontested divorce .
We ’ll stand by your side from the moment you file until a judge formally dissolves your marriage .
We ’ll help you determine what ’s most important to you and fight to make sure that you get it .
Our goal is to do what ’s best for you and your family .
Modification of Order Court orders pertaining to custody or support are n’t set in stone .
You always have the option of asking a court to modify an order if circumstances change .
Maybe you lost your job and are n’t able to satisfy your alimony obligations .
Or , perhaps you do n’t think your kids are safe with your ex anymore .
Whatever the case , you do have the right to ask to change the terms of your family law court orders .
However , a judge will only agree to modify an order for good cause .
Having a lawyer on your side can make all the difference in the world .
Our Orlando family law attorneys will put together a strong argument and support it with the evidence necessary to get the result you want .
Child Support
When you ’re married , you do n’t have to think about which parent will pay to feed , clothe , house , and educate your kids .
That ’s just something you do together .
Things get more complicated when you and your spouse separate or get divorced .
If you have custody of the kids , you might also be entitled to financial assistance from the child ’s other parent .
Our attorneys will help you secure the financial support you need to take care of your children .
Parental Rights
You have certain rights as a parent .
In Florida , both parents are considered to have equal rights under the law .
It does n’t matter if you ’re married or not .
Unless your actions or behavior pose a threat to your child , those rights cannot be infringed .
Unfortunately , when parents disagree , kids can sometimes get caught in the middle .
Our attorneys are here to help you enforce your parental rights .
We ’ll help you establish or contest paternity .
We ’ll make sure that your custody plan is respected and that you are n’t kept from seeing your children .
Children deserve both of their parents , and we ’ll help you make that happen .
Enforcement Orders relating to issues like child custody , child support , and spousal support have to be respected and followed .
If your ex refuses to let you see your kids or has n’t fulfilled their financial support obligations , they ’ve violated a court order .
Fortunately , the law is on your side .
Our Orlando family law attorneys will help you enforce your lawful court orders , whether they ’re related to a divorce or not .
We can sit down and discuss the issue with your ex and their attorney , or we can petition the court to step in .
If necessary , we can ask a judge to hold your ex in contempt of court , which is a crime .
We can use the fact that your ex violated a family law order to your advantage .
Orders can be modified , often to your benefit , when your ex demonstrates that they are n’t interested in respecting the court .
Property Division Florida is an equitable division state , meaning that each spouse is entitled to a “ fair ” share of the marital assets .
Fair does n’t always mean equal .
Courts consider several factors when allocating assets and debts .
These can include your ability to earn , things you might have forfeited in your marriage , or a history of abuse .
Our Orlando property division lawyers will help you make sure that what ’s “ fair ” is decided on your terms .
Alternative Dispute Resolution Sometimes spouses just do n’t see eye to eye when getting a divorce .
Fortunately , there are tools available to help you navigate the process .
Our attorneys can stand by your side during mediation , litigate your case in private arbitration , or sit down to hash out a collaborative divorce .
Each process has its benefits and drawbacks , so it ’s important to understand each one clearly before making a decision .
We ’ll help you choose the dispute resolution process that ’s best suited for your particular case .
Recovery of Attorney Fees
Does your spouse have the ability to spend more money than you on a divorce ?
Are they making ridiculous claims and filing frivolous motions ?
Have they been abusive to you or your kids ?
If any of these are true , you might be able to force them to pay for your attorney fees .
There ’s no guarantee that a judge will order your spouse to cover the cost of your attorney .
However , it ’s something you should consider asking for if the divorce is unaffordable or your spouse has engaged in misconduct .
Our attorneys will do whatever we can to make it happen .
Domestic Violence Domestic violence and abuse are far too common .
Fortunately , there are ways to protect yourself if you or your family have been abused by someone you love .
Our attorneys are always here to help you during this difficult time .
We ’ll petition the court for an injunction , which can temporarily prevent your spouse from contacting or visiting you .
This can give you time to file for a divorce and get your family somewhere safe .
Do not hesitate to reach out to us for immediate assistance if you or your children have been abused .
Our Orlando legal team also has experience dealing with false domestic violence allegations .
Find out how we can assist you .
Prenuptial & Postnuptial Agreements Florida has some pretty strict divorce laws .
It ’s an equitable division state , meaning that you ’ll be awarded a “ fair ” share of the marital assets .
This could mean that you get much less ( or much more ) than your spouse when you split up .
It can be tough to have control over who gets what .
Fortunately , you can sidestep Florida divorce law if you have a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement .
Our attorneys can help you design a prenup or postnup that dictates how your property will be divided if you get divorced .
With a prenup or postnup , you can have a degree of control over your divorce and make sure that you walk away with what you really want .
Spousal Support Spousal support – or alimony – can be necessary to help you get back on your feet after a divorce .
Since you ’re ending your marriage , your spouse probably wo n’t just be willing to fork over money after you ’re divorced .
You ’ll need to convince a court that you need some financial assistance in the months or years after your marriage .
We ’ll help you persuade a judge to award you alimony after your divorce .
We ’ll point out that there ’s a huge disparity in income or that you gave up your job to take care of the family while you were married .
Our goal is to make sure that you ’re financially settled when you ’re on your own .
If you need help in Orlando , FL or Orange County , give us a call to begin your free consultation .
Child Custody
If you ’re getting a divorce , you ’ll have to figure out which parent will have custody of the kids , and when .
This tends to be one of the biggest challenges for divorcing couples .
Nothing is more important than your children .
It ’s essential to remember to put their interests and wellbeing above everything else .
Our law group will help you negotiate a custody arrangement that works for your entire family .
If you have concerns about your spouse ’s ability to take care of your children , our attorneys will make sure that they ’re protected .
Your children will be our first priority .
Contested Divorce
When you and your spouse disagree about anything – property division , custody , support – you ’ll have what is known as a contested divorce .
You ’ll have a contested divorce even if you agree about all of the terms … except one .
Contested divorces can be expensive and take a lot of time to resolve .
Why ?
Because a court wo n’t finalize a divorce until all of the terms are resolved .
This means you and your spouse have to find a way to agree on issues that are very close to your heart .
Our attorneys will help you work through your divorce and work hard to resolve any disputes that may prevent the process from moving forward .
We ’ll identify what you want to get out of your divorce and fight to make those terms a reality .
If necessary , we ’ll use tools like mediation and arbitration to help move discussions with your spouse move in the right direction .
We ’re skilled negotiators and will do everything we can to help you resolve your divorce disputes quickly and in your favor .
Uncontested Divorce
There are times when spouses get divorced and see eye - to - eye on everything .
You agree about how property should be divided and how custody of the kids should be arranged .
When this happens , its called an uncontested divorce .
An uncontested divorce tends to cost a lot less and can be finalized a lot quicker than a contested dispute .
Even though uncontested divorces are easier , it ’s still important to get the help of an attorney .
You need to make sure that your rights are protected and the terms are favorable for you .
Our attorneys will help you navigate the process as painlessly as possible .
Military Divorce Life in the military can be stressful and hard on a relationship .
Getting a divorce when one spouse is in the military can be incredibly complicated .
If you ’ve moved around a lot , you may not satisfy any residency requirements .
You may also have property all over the country , which can certainly complicate things .
If you have kids , it can be difficult to compromise and agree about where they should be raised after the divorce .
Our family law attorneys have decades of experience helping military families navigate the divorce process .
We understand how complicated your life is and will fight to make your divorce as straightforward as possible .
We ’ll work with you to resolve the matter quickly and do what ’s best for your family .
Crystal - clear waters and palm trees may help couples stave off divorce A state in north - east Malaysia says it will offer free second honeymoons to couples on the brink of divorce .
Ashaari Idris , a government official in Terengganu , said troubled couples would be allowed to spend two nights at one of the state 's scenic island resorts .
He said those who wished to take part would have to apply , undergo an interview and also commit to marital counselling .
He said the programme was aimed at building family ties .
" After marriage , some are unable to cope with the new challenges , " Mr Ashaari told the AFP news agency .
Couples faced issues like financial problems or difficulties with their in - laws , he said .
FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service " I want to strengthen family ties .
If a marriage breaks down , it will hurt the children and it will have serious implications on society , " he said .
The Muslim - majority state had already carried out a pilot project involving 25 couples , he said .
Not everyone in Malaysia is convinced though .
Professor Nurani Ottman of the University of Malaysia says that the situation reflects the increasing rates of divorce in the north - east of Malaysia .
" I do n't think this can be a significant contribution - the problem and context is far more serious and much deeper , " she says .
" It might cheer them up for about three weeks and after that they 'll probably go up to Thailand and get a quick divorce . "

Abstract
This document contains recommendations on how large Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) can manage the effects of large numbers of bot infected computers used by their subscribers via various remediation techniques .
At the time that this document was published , computers infected by bots and the users of those computers comprise a substantial number of users for large ISPs .
Those Internet users are exposed to risks such as loss of personal data , increased susceptibility to online fraud and / or phishing , and becoming an inadvertent participant in or component of an online crime , spam , and / or phishing network .
Mitigating the effects of and remediating the installations of bots affecting large numbers of Internet users will make it more difficult for botnets to operate and could reduce the level of online crime on the Internet in general and / or on a particular ISP 's network .

Such malicious bots shall generally be assumed to have been deployed without the permission or conscious understanding of a particular Internet user .
Thus , without a user 's knowledge , bots may transform the user 's computing device into a platform from which malicious activities are conducted .

With the introduction of P2P , HTTP and other resilient communication protocols along with the widespread adoption of encryption , bots are considerably more difficult to identify and isolate from typical network usage .
As a result increased reliance is being placed on anonmaly detection and behavioral analysis , both locally and remotely , to identify bots .

Internet - Draft Remediation of Bots in Large ISP Networks August 2009
This can present a major problem for an ISP for a number of reasons ( not to mention of course the problems created for users ) .
First , these bots can be used to send spam , in some cases very large volumes of spam .
This spam can result in extra cost for the ISPs in terms of wasted network , server , and / or personnel resources , among many other potential costs or side effects .
Such spam can also negatively affect the reputation of the ISP , their customers , and the email reputation of the IP address space used by the ISP ( often referred to simply as " IP reputation " ) .
In addition , these bots can act as platforms for directing , participating in , or otherwise conducting attacks on critical Internet infrastructure .
Bots are frequently used as part of concerted Distributed Denial of Service ( DDoS ) attacks for criminal , political or other motivations .
For example , bots have been used to attack Internet resources and infrastructure ranging from web sites , to email servers and DNS servers , as well as the critical Internet infrastructure of entire countries .
Motivations for such coordinated DDoS attacks can range from criminal extortion attempts through to online protesting and nationalistic fervor .
While any computing device can be infected with bots , the majority of bot infections affect the personal computers used by Internet end users .
As a result of the role of ISPs in providing IP connectivity , among many other services , to Internet users , these ISPs are in a unique position to be able to attempt to detect and observe bot nets operating in their networks .
Furthermore , ISPs may also be in a unique position to be able to communicate to Internet users which are their customers , when customers computers may have been determined to have been or possibly have been infected with one or more bots .
From an end user perspective , knowing that their computer has been infected with one or more bots is very important information .
Once they know this , they can take steps to remove the bot , protect themselves in the future , and resolve any problems which may stem from the bot infection .
Given that bots can drain the local computing and network resources , enable theft of personal information ( including personal financial information ) , enable the computer to be used from criminal activities ( that may result in the Internet user being legally culpable ) , destroy or leave the PC in an unrecoverable state via ' kill switch ' bot technologies , it is important to notify the user that they may be infected with a bot .
As a result , the intent of this document is to provide a guide to ISPs and other organizations for the remediation of these computers infected with bots , so as to reduce the size of bot nets and minimize the potential harm that bots can inflict upon Internet infrastructure generally , as well as on individual Internet users .
Efforts by ISPs Livingood , et al . Expires February 27 , 2010 [ Page 6 ]
Internet - Draft Remediation of Bots in Large ISP Networks August 2009 and other organizations could therefore , over time , reduce the pool of computers infected with bots on the Internet , which in turn could result in smaller bot nets with less capability for disruption .
4 . Important Notice of Limitations 5 .
Detection , Notification and Remediation 5.1 .
Detection of Bots Livingood , et al .
Expires February 27 , 2010 [ Page 7 ]
Internet - Draft Remediation of Bots in Large ISP Networks August 2009 privacy of the personally identifiable information of their customers .
The ISP also should not block legitimate traffic in the course of bot detection , and should instead employ detection methods , tools , and processes which seek to be non-disruptive , as well as being transparent to Internet users .
Detection methods , tools , and processes may include things such as analysis of specific network and / or application traffic flows ( such as traffic to an email server ) , analysis of aggregate network and / or application traffic data , data feeds received from other ISPs and organizations ( such as lists of the ISP 's IP addresses which have been reported to have sent spam ) , feedback from the ISP 's customers or other Internet users , as well as a wide variety of other possibilities .
It is likely that a combination of multiple bot detection data points will prove to be an effective approach in order to corroborate information of varying dependability or consistency , as well as to avoid or minimize the possibility of false positive identification of computers .
Detection should also , where possible and feasible , attempt to classify a bot in order to confirm that it is malicious in nature , estimate the variety and severity of threats it may pose ( such as spam bot , key - logging bot , file distribution bot , etc. ) , and to determine potential methods for eventual remediation .
However , given the dynamic nature of botnet management and the criminal incentives to seek quick financial rewards , botnets frequently update or change their core malicious capabilities .
As a consequence , botnets that are initially detected and classified by the ISP need to be continuously monitored and tracked in order to correctly identify the threat they pose at any particular point in time .
Detection is also time - sensitive .
If complex analysis is required and multiple confirmations are needed to confirm a bot is indeed present , then it is possible that the bot will do its damage ( to either the infected computer or a remotely targeted system ) before it can be stopped .
This may mean that an ISP may need to balance the desire or need to definitively classify and / or confirm a bot , which may take an extended period of time , with the ability to predict the strong likelihood of a bot in a very short period of time .
This also means that Internet users may benefit from the deployment of client - based software protections or other software tools , which can enable rapid performance of heuristically - based detection bot activity , such as the detection of a bot as it starts to communicate a bot net and execute some type of command .
Any bot detection systems should also be capable of learning and adapting , either via manual intervention or automatically , in order to cope with a rapidly evolving threat .
As noted above , detection methods , tools , and processes should ensure that privacy of customers ' personally identifiable information is Livingood , et al .
Expires February 27 , 2010 [ Page 8 ]
Internet - Draft Remediation of Bots in Large ISP Networks August 2009 maintained .
While bot detection methods , tools , and processes are similar to spam and virus defenses deployed by the ISP for the benefits of their customers ( and may be directly related to those defenses ) , attempts to detect bots should take into account the need of an ISP to take care to ensure that such personally identifiable information is properly protected .
Finally , depending upon the geographic region within which an ISP operates , certain methods relating to bot detection may need to be included in relevant terms of service documents or other documents which are available to the customers of a particular ISP .
There are several bot detection methods , tools , and processes that an ISP may choose to utilize , as noted in the list below .
It is important to note that the technical solutions available are relatively immature , and are likely to change over time , and to evolve rapidly in the coming years .
While these items are described in relation to ISPs , they may also be applicable to organizations operating other networks , such as campus networks and enterprise networks .
a .
Where legally permissible or otherwise an industry accepted practice in a particular market region , an ISP may in some manner " scan " their IP space in order to detect un - patched or otherwise vulnerable hosts .
This may provide the ISP with the opportunity to easily identify Internet users who appear to already be or are at great risk of being infected with a bot .
ISP 's should note that some types of port scanning may leave network services in a hung state or render them unusable due to common frailties , and that many modern firewall and host - based intrusion detection implementations may alert the Internet user to the scan .
As a result the scan may be interpreted as a malicious attack against the computer .
Vulnerability scanning has a higher probability of leaving accessible network services and applications in a damaged state and will often result in a higher probability of detection by the Internet user and subsequent interpretation as a targeted attack .
Depending upon the vulnerability being scanned , some automated methods of vulnerability checking may result in data being altered or created afresh on the Internet users computer which be a problem in many legal environments .
b.
An ISP may also communicate and share selected data , via feedback loops or other mechanisms , with various third parties .
Feedback loops are consistently formatted feeds of real - time ( or nearly real - time ) abuse reports offered by threat data clearinghouses , security alert organizations , other ISPs , and other organizations .
The data may include , but is not limited to , lists of the IP addresses computers which have or are likely to have a bot running , domain names or fully qualified domain names Livingood , et al .
Expires February 27 , 2010 [ Page 9 ]
Internet - Draft Remediation of Bots in Large ISP Networks August 2009 ( FQDNs ) known to host malware and / or be involved in the command and control of botnets , IP addresses know to host malware and / or be involved in the command and control of botnets , recently tested or discovered techniques or detecting or remediating bot infections , new threat vectors , and other relevant information .
Good examples of this include SNDS from Microsoft , XBL and PBL from Spamhaus and DSHIELD AS tool from SANS c. An ISP may use Netflow [ RFC3954 ] or other similar passive network monitoring to identify network anomalies that may be indicative of botnet attacks or bot communications .
For example , an ISP may be able to identify compromised hosts by identifying traffic destined to IP addresses associated with the command and control of botnets .
In addition , bots can be idenfied when a remote host is under distribute attack because computers participating in the attack will likely be infected by a bot .
d . An ISP may use DNS - based techniques to perform detection .
For example , a given classified bot may be known to query a specific list of domain names at specific times or on specific dates ( in the example of the so - called " Conficker " bot ) , often by matching DNS queries to a well known list of domains associated with malware .
In many cases such lists are distributed by or shared using third parties , such as threat data clearinghouses .
Alternative dynamic DNS based techniques may look for associations of domain names with known bad actor lists and networks with poor reputations , or heuristic techniques that rank the domain name based upon previously identified botnet usage and bot characteristics .
e. User complaints :
Because bot infected hosts are frequently used to send spam or participate in DDoS attacks , the ISP servicing those hosts will normally receive complaints about the malicious network traffic .
Those complaints may be sent to RFC2142 - specified [ RFC2142 ] role accounts , such as abuse@ or postmaster@ or to abuse or security addresses specified by the site as part of its WHOIS ( or other ) contact data .
f. ISPs may also discover likely bot infected hosts located at other sites ; when legally permissible or otherwise an industry accepted practice in a particular market region , it may be worthwhile for ISPs to share evidence relating to those compromised hosts with the relevant remote ISP , with security researchers , and with blocklist operators .
g. ISP 's may operate or subscribe to services that provide sinkholing or honeynet capabilities .
This enable the ISP to obtain realtime lists of bot infected computers as they attempt Livingood , et al .

Internet - Draft Remediation of Bots in Large ISP Networks August 2009 is that the user , their email client , and / or their email servers could determine or classify such a notification as spam , which could delete the message or otherwise file it in an email folder that the user may not check on a regular and / or timely basis .
Bot masters have also been known to impersonate the ISP or trusted sender and send fradulant emails to the users .
This technique of solical engineering often leads to new bot infestations .
Finally if the user 's email credentials are compromised , then a hacker and / or a bot could simply login to the user 's email account and delete the email before it is read by the user .

Walled Garden Notification Livingood , et al .
Expires February 27 , 2010 [ Page 12 ]
Internet - Draft Remediation of Bots in Large ISP Networks August 2009
While in many cases , the user is almost guaranteed to view the notification message and take any appropriate remediation actions , this approach poses can pose other challenges .
For example , it is not always the case that a user is actively using a computer that uses a web browser or which has a web browser actively running on it .
In one case , a user could be playing a game online , via the use of a dedicated , Internet - connected game console .
In another case , the user may not be using a computer with a web browser when they are placed in the walled garden and may instead be in the course of a telephone conversation , or may be expecting to receive a call , using a Voice Over IP ( VOIP ) device of some type .
As a result , the ISP may feel the need to maintain a potentially lengthy white list of domains which are not subject to the typical restrictions of a walled garden , which could well prove to be an onerous task , from an operational perspective .
The ISP has several options to determine when to let the user out of the walled garden .
One approach may be to let the user determine when to exit .
This option is suggested when the purpose of the walled garden is to notify users and provide information on remediation only , particularly since notification is not a guarantee of successful remediation .
It could also be the case that , for whatever reason , the user makes the judgment that they cannot then take the time to remediate their computer and that other online activities which they would like to resume are more important .
Exit from the walled garden should involve require process to verify that it is indeed the user who is requesting exit from the walled garden and not the bot .
Once the user acknowledges the notification , then the user decides to either remediate and then exit the walled garden , or exit the walled garden without addressing the issue .
Another approach may be to enforce a stricter policy and require the user to clean the computer prior to permitting the user to exit the walled garden , though this may not be technically feasible depending upon the type of bot , obfuscation techniques employed by a bot , and / or a range of other factors .
Thus , the ISP may also need to support tools to scan the infected computer and determine whether it is still infected or rely on user judgment that the bot has been disabled or removed .
One challenge with this approach is that if the user has multiple computers sharing a single IP address , such as via a common home gateway device which performs Network Address Translation ( NAT ) , then the ISP may need to determine from user feedback or other means that all affected computers have been remediated , which may or may not be technically feasible .
A list of well known addresses for both operating system vendors and security vendors should be created .

Ignoring this problem is not really an option since your personal information is currently at risk .
Thus , bots need to be removed to protect your data and your personal information . "
It is also important to note that it may not be immediately apparent to the Internet user precisely which device has been or which multiple devices have been infected with a particular bot .
This is because of the user 's home - networking configurations and the growing prevalence of IP enabled devices within a household that now connect to the public Internet and / or Private IP networks .
The consequence of this for an ISP is that remediation advice may not ultimately be actionable by the Internet user .
For example , the Internet user may be operating a computer , a notebook , a video console and multimedia system on their personal network .
All of these device may connect to the Internet via a single gateway appliance .
Any of these devices can be infected with a bot through a number of vectors .
yet the remediation advice is likely to be quite different and may or may not be directly serviceable by the Internet user .
Diligence needs to be taken by the ISP in understanding the specific nature of the device that has been infected with a bot , and providing appropriate remediation advice .

The flow should also have the option for users to get professional assistance if they are unable to remove the bots themselves .
If purchasing third party assistance , then the user should be encouraged to pre-determine how much they are willing to pay for that help .
If the computer that is being remediated is old and can easily be replaced with a new , faster , larger and more reliable system for three or four hundred dollars , the it makes no sense to spend five or six hundred dollars to fix the old computer , for example .
On the other hand , if the customer has a brand new computer that cost several thousand dollars , it might make perfect sense to spend the money in attempting to remediate it .
5 . To continue , regardless of whether the user or a knowledgeable technical assistant is working on remediating the computer , their first task should be to determine which of multiple potentially - infected machines may be the one that needs attention ( in the common case of multiple computers in a home network ) .
Sometimes , as in cases where there is only a single directly - attached computer , or the user has been noticing problems with one of their computers , this can be easy .
Other times , it may be more difficult .
If the user is behind a home gateway / router , then the first task may be to ascertain which of the machines is infected .
In some cases the user may have to check all machines to identify the infected one .
6 . User surveys to solicit feedback on whether the notification and remediation process is effective and what recommended changes could be made in order to improve the ease , understandability , and effectiveness the remediation process .
7 . If the user is interested in reporting his or her computer 's bot infection to an applicable law enforcement authority , then the computer effectively becomes a cyber " crime scene " and should not be mitigated unless or until law enforcement has collected the necessary evidence .
For individuals in this situation , the ISP should refer them to local , state , federal , or other relevant computer crime offices .
( Note : Some " minor " incidents , even if highly traumatic to the user , may not be sufficiently serious for law enforcement to commit some of their limited resources to an investigation . )

TPM Reader SG ’s Lament …
This “ outrage ” over Obama speaking to schoolchildren is the last straw .
The Swiftboating — and that ’s what this is — of Obama must be dealt with .
For months we ’ve had a great time laughing and ridiculing the GOP as they ’ve spewed one ridiculous outrage after another at Obama .
We ’ve treated each successive charge as more absurd and laughable than the last , responding only with derisive sarcasm .
We howled with laughter at teabaggers after the stimulus only to have them brandish guns and become players at townhalls .
We rolled our eyes at Palin ’s Death Panels , only to have month long national discussion over whether Obama wants to kill grandma and now veterans .
Now we ’re going to discuss whether it ’s “ appropriate ” for the President to speak to schoolchildren ?
Really ?
Enough is enough .
Images of Obama as Hitler are now commonplace and , seemingly , unremarkable .
It has become customary and usual for senior GOP officials to make outrageous , disparaging ad hominem remarks about the President .
The crazy is becoming mainstream .
Obama is in a real , tangible way now being delegitimized as a person and a leader .
So my question is , when is the White House , the Democratic infrastructure and the progressive press / blogosphere going to stop laughing and start pushing back on this ?
Clearly , laughter and ridicule is not a sufficient response and is not working .
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) on Sunday continued his attack on Fox News conservative commentator Glenn Beck , saying he " does n't represent the Republican party . "
Graham last week criticized the outspoken host and commentator , and said Beck is " aligned with cynicism . "

On " Fox News Sunday , " Graham said he does not watch or listen to Beck .
" I ’m not saying he is bad for America , " he said .
" You can listen to him if you want to .
I choose not to . "
" He has a right to say what he wants to say , but at the end of the day it ’s not the kind of political analysis I buy into , " Graham said .

Police say the officer peeled the bag off Lopez 's forehead and placed him under arrest .
He has been charged with drug possession .
Police do not know whether Lopez has an attorney .
Authorities say the sweatband of a baseball cap is a frequent hiding place for drugs .

Social Security Disability Attorney San Diego
Are you disabled and unable to work ?
Is your condition expected to last for at least 12 months ?
If so , you may qualify for federal disability benefits .
The Social Security Administration ( SSA ) administers two federal disability programs : Social Security Disability Insurance ( SSDI ) , and Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) .
It is always a good first step to consult with an experienced disability attorney who can evaluate your circumstances and advise you which path is the right one for you .
The decision whether or not to apply for Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) or Social Security disability insurance ( SSDI ) benefits is a difficult one to make without the assistance of a professional who is experienced with the ins and outs .
Applying too early or in a circumstance where there has been insufficient treatment established can result not only in a denial of your claim but in a more difficult application process down the road should you , later on , need to apply once again .
Social Security Disability Insurance ( SSDI ) provides monthly cash disability payments to those who qualify .
Almost everyone that works pays FICA taxes , and if you have paid enough FICA taxes in your past jobs , then you are considered “ insured ” and may be eligible for SSDI if you have a qualifying claim .
In order to be qualified for these benefits , an employee must complete the application process through the SSA and meet both the earnings qualifications and the medical requirement .
In essence , the earnings requirement means the applicant has worked and contributed to the Social Security Disability system for a certain number of years .
Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) is a program that is designed to provide monthly cash disability payments to those that do not qualify for SSDI but are still disabled and unable to work .
Am I eligible to qualify and receive SSI ?

Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute is asking students to curb the sharing of cups after a group of students contracted the swine flu during a weekend of drinking games , according to Dr. Leslie Lawrence , medical director of the school 's health center .
" While it might seem fun over the weekend , it will not be enjoyable when you and your friends are sick and missing class or midterm examinations , " he wrote in a message distributed to RPI students and staff .
Thus far , RPI has seen one of the region 's highest number of swine flu cases among its student population , with 21 cases of influenza , including about 14 that are active .
Seven of those students are in campus isolation rooms and seven have returned home with their families .
Several staff and faculty have also been experienced flu - like symptoms and Lawrence said the cases are steadily growing .
The latest cases were tied to social events and a school football game , after which students were playing drinking games .
Lawrence cautioned students that alcohol does not kill the flu virus and said it was particularly important during social events to wash hands and avoid close contact , concepts that may seem foreign at a college keg party .
Lawrence also warned that students who fear being placed in isolation rooms , which include food service at the door and private bathrooms , should not avoid the campus health center .
He cited two cases where students had " unforeseen complications " as a result of their illness and were able to be treated quickly because they were being monitored by health staff .
Lawrence said the school expects to offer H1N1 vaccinations within the next few weeks .
Influenza already has hit most , if not all , of the Capital Region 's college campuses , ahead of the usual flu season .
A men's basketball player and football player were the first two University at Albany students to contract H1N1 virus , an athletic department spokesman confirmed last week though the school is only reporting one confirmed case .
Skidmore College has seen 41 students with flu - like symptoms since the school year began , including at least nine students in the past two weeks .
At Union College , there have been 29 flu cases among students , including six in the past two weeks .
The College of Saint Rose has also reported a few students with flu - like symptoms .
Colleges and universities in the Northeast saw some of the biggest surges in swine flu infection in recent weeks , according to the latest update from the American College Health Association .
In the week ending Oct. 2 , 6,326 new cases of students with influenza - like illnesses were reported , with nine hospitalizations , at 273 colleges representing more than 3.3 million students .
The association estimates that about 183,000 cases have occurred among approximately 18 million college students nationwide .

Microsoft researchers have unveiled an anti-hacking concept that can help track hackers or malicious content to origin servers .
The Host Tracker program ’s goal is to “ de - anonymize the Internet ” through the ability to host servers with 99 percent accuracy .
Host Tracker is designed to unmask would - be hackers who take advantage of anonymizing techniques by cross-referencing Internet protocol traffic data to identify the true origin .
Microsoft ’s representatives said the Host Tracker system relies on application - level events — in this case , Internet Explorer browser sessions — to automatically infer host - IP bindings .
Survivor , but he's now dealing with his own painful reality — being held in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day , the BOSTON  Richard Hatch may have won , but he's now dealing with his own painful reality — being held in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day , the American Civil Liberties Union said Monday .
The ACLU demanded Hatch 's release from Barnstable County jail on Cape Cod .
He was serving the rest of his sentence for failing to pay taxes on his $ 1 million prize for winning Survivor when he gave media interviews accusing a prosecutor of misconduct and said the judge in the case discriminated against him because he is gay .
Officials from the Federal Bureau of Prisons said two of the interviews were not authorized and sent him back to jail .
On Monday , the ACLU told U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton that Hatch has been held under " harsh " conditions for the last 28 days , allowed outside his cell only one hour a day to exercise or shower .
Attorney Michael Schneider said the decision to put Hatch in jail is a " clear - cut violation of his First Amendment rights . "
The move seemed aimed at getting back at Hatch for criticizing the government in the interviews , he said .
But Assistant U.S. Attorney Eve Piemonte - Stacey said Hatch was sent back to jail because he gave three media interviews when authorized to give only one .
" Prisons have rules , whether you are inside or outside or in a halfway house .
When a person violates those rules , there are ramifications , " she said .
" He 's not in federal custody for something that he said or something that he is . "
Piemonte - Stacey disputed the characterization of the conditions in the jail as " harsh . "
Hatch was placed in the segregation unit as any other inmate would be after arriving at the jail , she said .
He will be taken out of segregation soon , she said .
Hatch 's lawyers asked the judge to release Hatch outright or let him finish his period of home confinement , scheduled to end Oct.
7 . Schneider said the Bureau of Prisons has indicated that it may withhold 10 days of good time from Hatch , meaning he would not be released until Oct. 17 .
Traci Billingsley , a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons , said Hatch 's release date is still listed as Oct. 7 in the bureau 's computers .
She declined to comment further .
The judge did not immediately rule on the request to release Hatch .
He gave attorneys on both sides until Wednesday to submit additional legal briefs and said he would move " promptly " to issue a ruling .
Hatch granted three television interviews last month at his sister 's house in Newport , R.I. — to NBC 's Today show , NBC affiliate WJAR - TV in Cranston , R.I. , and the NBC - owned Access Hollywood .
Prison officials said they gave Hatch permission for the Today interview only .
Hatch 's lawyer said he believed the permission extended to all three NBC properties .

4) Helen Goddard ( aka Jazz Lady )
Extract : " A British musician and former secondary school music teacher who was convicted in September 2009 for sexual misconduct with a female pupil at her school . "
Reason for deletion : " Helen Goddard is only known for this one event , and we have a policy for this kind of case , which generally excludes biographies about such people .
The burst of news reports about this case has been fuelled by it being a lesbian affair , and Helen Goddard being blonde and photogenic , rather than any serious lasting significance of the case . "
Photo Gallery Using Giants to Celebrate Reunification
Berlin will hold its annual unification celebration this week .
But coming almost 20 years after the Wall fell , this year 's festival will be even grander than usual .
To highlight the importance of these anniversaries , the city is enlisting the aid of a French street theater troupe that turns junk into massive puppets .
Overview
9 Dragons is a game set in feudal Japan loosely based on historical facts .
Time wise it is set in or around the time of the Ming Dynasty .
There are 9 clans that each have a lost hero aka the 9 dragons .
This game has some level based questing with an emphasis based on grinding and grinding and grinding .
Game needs to be downloaded via an online client or you can get a " free " DVD by paying a shipping cost .
The Facts ( on a 5 point scale )
Graphics - 4
The Graphics of this game are better than average I would say ( especially for a free to play game ) .
There are times when you can see through a mountain or your character disappears .
I must say however that some of the views are simply breath taking .
This also game has fairly low graphical requirements to run the game which is good for those of us playing on older machines .
Replay Value - 2
Not only are the quests identical once you get of your starting area but the grind is never ending .
There are times when I found I had no quests in a particular area and I had to grind up 2 - 3 levels before I could open them up .
The mobs that you fight against do not vary much .
Once you have reached level 25 you have faced most of the different varieties of mobs with only their level and toughness changing .
Community - 1
I played this game for 4 solid hours one day and not a single person spoke to me or offered help .
I also asked for assistance on quests , grouping for grinding , and just general location information to no avail .
I did this on both my low level character and a level 52 character .
There seems to be good general information on the community forms located at the website but I judge a community based on what happens in game .
Much like all games there are exceptions to the rule I did run into one very helpful player another day that was about 10 levels above me and helped me find stuff for about 1.5 hours .
So thank you to Xyntha !
One thing that I find very unique about this game is the player based shops .
You can actually go to a common ground area and turn yourself into a shop and then go away and other player based characters will come up to you and can purchase your wares .
You must remain logged in but it's a great way to foster a player driven economy .
Mechanics - 2
The Mechanics of this game are somewhat difficult to understand .
There are certain abilities that can be up all the time , and other abilities that are on to enhance your auto attack based on the weapon you choose .
On top of all of that you have your casting spells that are broken into what type of a class you are .
On top of all that you have micro payments of real money you can use to buy acclaim coins that you can in turn use to purchase in game items that help you in your quest for a limited time only .
Feel - 2
The movement on this game is point and click with the mouse so it 's fairly easy to understand , however the locatorof the mouse on a 3D terrain that acts flat sometimes can be difficult to master .
The game is one grind after another .
The overall game play is awkward at times and if you do n't know you have to grind up a level or two to open up quests you may be wondering quite a bit .
There is some PvPish content available on a somewhat limited world even basis in which you fight NPC's with the help of your side and they do the same .
While the goal is to take out the other side 's NPC 's you can kill those of the other faction to help better your odds .
Personal Impressions
The first time I played this game was before I started playing WoW .
At that time the MMO community was very new and fresh to me so the game was exciting .
The game is not overall a BAD game .
Its just designed with a very specific gamer in mind ; the one who likes martial arts and loves to grind for hours on end with little to no rewards .
I am not a fan of the game and when I tried it again I was falling asleep at the keyboard
Getting started
1. Download the game client ( and then wait for patches to update )

The Gum Nebula
Credit & Copyright : Axel Mellinger
Explanation : Named for Australian astronomer Colin Stanley Gum ( 1924 -1960 ) , The Gum Nebula is so large and close it is actually hard to see .
In fact , we are only about 450 light - years from the front edge and 1,500 light - years from the back edge of this cosmic cloud of glowing hydrogen gas .
Covered in this 41 degree - wide mosaic of H - alpha images , the faint emission region is otherwise easy to lose against the background of Milky Way stars .
The complex nebula is thought to be a supernova remnant over a million years old , sprawling across the southern constellations Vela and Puppis .
Sliding your cursor over this spectacular wide field view will reveal the location of objects embedded in The Gum Nebula , including the Vela supernova remnant .
There would be no screaming at Rand Cardwell ’s meeting tonight , no histrionics , no playing to the cameras .
The atmosphere was PTA .
Garden Club .
Kiwanis .
Cardwell had called this second meeting of the local chapter of Oath Keepers , and on a recent Tuesday night about 16 of his fellow Tennesseans trickled into a suburban Town Hall community room .
Now they sat quietly around some folding tables , with all eyes on Cardwell , the chapter president .
Cardwell , a 48 - year - old laid - off aluminum plant worker , was new to this activism stuff , but he was n’t nervous .
He ’d led enough meetings back in his days as a Marine Corps sergeant .
The group who had answered his call was made up of men and women .
Some were just off work , while others were dressed in the casual garb of the retired and unemployed .
All were white , which was no surprise in this white - majority Appalachian county .
But they brought a diversity of worries .
Advertisement
Bobby May , 44 , a laid - off salesman , feared that the Obama administration would restrict his gun rights .
Ben Kazinec , 31 , an employee with Kraft Foods , had heard that the U.S. armed forces were training with foreign troops to respond to domestic emergencies .
“ I feel threatened by it , ” he said with an incongruous smile .
A woman who gave her name , and then retracted it , harbored doubts about the president ’s citizenship .
“ All right , ” Cardwell said , in a low , firm voice touched with his native mountain lilt .
“ Let ’s kick this thing off . ”
Advertisement
The first order of business was a recent report from the Southern Poverty Law Center , which called the Oath Keepers -- which claims more than 1,000 members nationwide -- a “ particularly worrisome example ” of a “ virulently antigovernment ‘ Patriot ’ movement ” that has been reinvigorated , in part , by the fact that the president is black .
The center documented angry videos that had been posted on the Oath Keepers website ; in one of them , a man called Obama an “ enemy of the state . ”
Cardwell betrayed only a hint of the exasperation that this line of criticism stirs in him .
Nothing , he said , could be further from the truth .
He served side by side in the Corps with African Americans .
One of his best friends is a black guy .
“ Our goal , ” he said , “ is to support and defend the Constitution , and that ’s where it begins and ends at .
. . .
We ’re not a hate group .
We ’re not a racist group .
We ’re not calling for armed revolt against the government . ”
Advertisement
Founded this year by Stewart Rhodes , a Yale - educated lawyer and former staffer of Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , the group calls itself nonpartisan and features on its website a 1776 quote from George Washington warning of an incipient moment that would determine whether Americans will be “ Freemen , or Slaves ; whether they are to have any property they can call their own ; whether their Houses , and Farms , are to be pillaged and destroyed . ”
“ Such a time , ” the site says , “ is near at hand again . ”
That kind of sentiment helps explain the disconnect that has come to define popular political discourse in Obama ’s first tumultuous year .
A vociferous group of Americans is warning that the country is not just headed in the wrong direction -- but over a cliff .
They are mainstream media commentators , like Fox News ’ Glenn Beck .
They are religious leaders , like “ Bible Answer Man ” Hank Hanegraaff , who told radio listeners last month that “ socialism and fascism ” were “ slipping quietly through the back door . ”
Advertisement
And they are everyday people like Rand Cardwell .
Other Americans , meanwhile , are struggling to understand the dire language that has erupted at town hall meetings , on talk radio and at anti-tax Tea Party protests .
Some fear that the rhetoric , with its emphasis on gun rights and harsh words for a black president , could be paving a path to tragedy .
To Cardwell , these fears are nonsense , though he concedes that the anti-Obama crowd contains some angry and even unsavory elements .
He says his opposition is rooted in deeply American values -- the same ones Obama acknowledged in his recent speech to Congress , when he noted “ our rugged individualism , our fierce defense of freedom and our healthy skepticism of government . ”
Advertisement
But as Cardwell watched federal power grow -- first under President George W. Bush -- that healthy skepticism has led him to conclude that now is the time to sound an alarm .
And that is why Cardwell found himself standing before hundreds at a July 4 Tea Party in Asheville , N.C. , two hours away from here , reading out Oath Keepers ’ “ Declaration of Orders We Will Not Obey . ”
Although Cardwell welcomes all concerned citizens to his meetings , the Oath Keepers ’ main message targets military and public safety personnel , active and inactive .
It reminds them that they swore allegiance to the Constitution , not to politicians or bureaucrats .
As such , they have the right to refuse orders they deem unlawful .
Cardwell barked them out at the Tea Party , to great applause :
They will not obey orders to disarm Americans or confiscate property , including food .
They will not help the government blockade American cities or confine Americans to concentration camps .
Nor will they assist foreign troops brought onto U.S. soil to “ maintain control . ”
Advertisement
Cardwell does n’t think the country is in immediate danger of having Obama - imposed concentration camps .
But he is haunted by a lesson he has drawn from reading history -- that bad things happen when government grows .
“ You might be going out on a limb saying , ‘ This is what ’s happening in the United States , ’ ” he said over coffee recently .
“ But let ’s go back to the German concentration camps , and the people who were saying , ‘ If we would have done something from the beginning , so many millions of lives would have been saved . ’ ”
There is a reasoned calm , even a gentleness , when Cardwell says such things .
He and his wife are Lutherans , but not regular churchgoers .
Gay rights do n’t get him very riled .
Legalized abortion he finds “ unsettling . ”
He admits that it bugs him when he calls somewhere , and has to press “ 1 " for English .
He ’s a gun owner , and he frets about Democrats ’ commitment to gun rights .
He takes in his share of Fox News and right - wing radio , but not uncritically :
He suspects Beck , who has fomented so much anti-Obama protest , to be a “ patriot for profit ” who is mostly in it for the book deals .
Advertisement
About 45 minutes before the chapter meeting , Cardwell had pulled his black Dodge pickup into the Town Hall parking lot .
He affixed a big vinyl Oath Keepers sign -- one he ’d paid for himself -- to the tailgate , and waited like a Realtor at an open house .
Cardwell had voted for Republican John McCain as the lesser of two evils .
But he does n’t see himself as much of a party man .
The individualist streak in him , he said , goes a long way to explaining his belief in limited government .
It is an outgrowth of the pioneering spirit that helped the Scots - Irish settle the rugged mountains of Tennessee -- a spirit , he said , of “ leave us the hell alone , we do n’t need your help . ”
For most of his life , he kept his opinions to himself .
He was too busy to get too involved in politics .
There were kids to raise , Little League to coach , and an education to be earned -- not just at college , where he received a two - year computer science degree , but in various jobs , from roofer to salesman to Marine Corps sniper .
He remembers feeling a vague sense of worry about NAFTA ’s effect on American manufacturing jobs .
A few years ago , at a Knoxville City Council meeting , he protested the city ’s plan to install cameras to monitor traffic at red lights .
Cardwell gave a little speech and handed one councilman a copy of Orwell ’s “ 1984 " -- to no avail .
Advertisement
His concerns began massing toward the end of the Bush administration .
There was warrantless wiretapping , the Patriot Act , and the 2005 Real ID Act -- the proposed law , currently in administrative limbo , that would establish national standards for driver ’s licenses .
But it was the Troubled Asset Relief Program , the multibillion - dollar bailout of the financial system launched under Bush in autumn 2008 , that compelled him to act .
Cardwell feared TARP would give government unprecedented sway over private sector companies .
“ That was the spike going into my forehead , ” he said .
“ Because our nation was already in huge debt .
The fact that you ’ve got the federal government that ’s going to take our tax dollars and give them to financial institutions violates the very principles our nation was founded on . ”
He called his congressman for the first time ever , and urged him to vote against TARP .
In November , Obama was swept into office .
Advertisement
In May , Cardwell was laid off from his control room job at the Alcoa plant .
In July , he was standing at the Tea Party podium , basking in applause .
--
He was pleased enough with the turnout tonight .
A few miles away , over at Knoxville City Hall , the council was discussing a new state law allowing gun permit holders to bring their weapons into parks .
Tennessee cities and counties have the right to opt out of the law , and Cardwell figured a number of his supporters were in the council chambers , arguing that the city should opt in .
Those who had come to the chapter meeting listened politely as he rattled off the items on his agenda .
Advertisement
He told the group he would be a featured speaker at Nashville ’s version of the then - upcoming Sept. 12 tax protests .
There was talk of carpooling and caravaning .
He told them that Oath Keepers was hoping to raise money to send 40,000 care packages to military personnel overseas .
He encouraged them to read the testimonials of the servicemen who had signed up on the Oath Keepers website .
He told them about an upcoming Tennessee appearance by one of the highest - profile Oath Keepers , former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack , described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a “ longtime militia hero ” who once collaborated on a book with Randy Weaver , the white separatist and target of the Ruby Ridge raid .
Mack has called the center ’s charges “ hate speech , ” and noted his admiration for Rosa Parks .
At the Tennessee meeting , Cardwell emphasized Mack ’s 1994 legal challenge to the Brady Act , which called for background checks on gun buyers .
Advertisement
He turned his laptop around and showed the group an Oath Keepers video .
The room swelled with music befitting a Hollywood epic as various images appeared -- Iwo Jima , a World War II beach landing , Revolutionary War soldiers .
Text flashed on the screen :
( italics ) " They Fought Fascism and Communism Over There .
Will we Suffer Fascism and Communism here ? ” ( end italics )
News footage from Hurricane Katrina followed .
TV reporters described people being kept in the Superdome by government authorities , and turned back as they tried to leave the city limits .
A New Orleans police officer said , “ We will take all weapons . ”
Later , as the meeting was about to adjourn , somebody said they should all pray for Cardwell ’s wife , Cathie .
Advertisement
A week earlier , Cathie Cardwell had a cancerous spot on one of her lungs removed .
On the day of the meeting , she was feeling nauseated .
So her daughter had driven her back to the hospital .
Rand would ’ve driven her under normal circumstances , but Cathie is worried about the country too and insisted he hold the meeting as promised .
The family ’s health insurance runs out at the one - year anniversary of his layoff from Alcoa .
He said he would keep looking for a new job with benefits .
But he wo n’t be looking for some big solution from Washington .
“ Socialized healthcare .
. . .
It ’s not the government ’s responsibility to ensure that I ’m insured . ”
Advertisement
As the meeting ended , the new Oath Keepers mingled for a few minutes in the parking lot , exchanging ideas and pleasantries .
Cardwell pulled the sign off his tailgate and roared off into the darkness , toward the hospital and his wife .

How much have your insurance premiums gone up since 1999 ?
More than 131 % ?
I seem to recall that the insurance industry keeps sending me letters every year , when they inform me that they ’ve increased my premiums by 25 % , that it ’s because of the increasing cost of medicine .
Now we find out that this is a lie .
Can the government go after them for fraud ?
I mean , with Max Baucus and his former staffers ’ permission , of course – they are , after all , in the pocket of Big Pharma .
The average cost of job - based family health insurance climbed 5 percent to $ 13,375 in 2009 , making this the 10th straight year that health care premiums have increased faster than workers ’ wages and overall inflation have .
Insurance costs have increased 131 percent since 1999 , when a year of family coverage cost about $ 5,791 , according to the 2009 Employer Health Benefits Survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust .
That supercharged growth rate far outpaces the 38 percent increase in wages and 28 percent growth of inflation over the same period .
My premiums have gone up around 300 % since 1999 , and my benefits did n’t go up a dime .
I still only get $ 1500 a year in prescription benefits ( even though I have the most expensive self - employed plan that CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield offers ) .
And now I find out that the increases appear to have all been outright robbery .
What is health care reform going to do specifically to stop these kind of practices from happening ?
Not to mention , unless the President ’s plan addresses the now - phony current “ cost ” of our health care premiums , we ’ll be locking in these outrageous rates forever .
It would have been so easy to put the insurance industry on the defensive in this debate .
Yet , oddly , they ’re the ones working out backroom deals with Max Baucus and the President himself , both Democrats .

Q . What have the events of the last few days done for the reputation of Formula 1 ?
Fernando Alonso : I do n't know .
I am not an expert of that .
I only know what is about me , and what is about this weekend - which is the only thing that really matters .
We want to do a good performance today , which from a driver point of view is the only thing that they ask you to do .
A good performance , and getting some results on Sunday afternoon - this is the way I am preparing for this race .
And nothing has been too distracting at the moment .
Q . Have you sat down and talked to Bob Bell and asked how things have changed , how strategy has changed without Pat ?
FA : No .
Everything is completely normal .
Pat is not here , and Flavio .
But there are other people who are doing a similar job .
So the team has no difference at all compared to any other race and there is no changes at all in approach to this weekend .
It is just that the media attention that is quite big , today , but hopefully for tomorrow and after tomorrow it will come to normal again and everything back to normal .
This is the past what happened , and now it is the present and the future .
Q . But you must have a personal feeling about it beyond just your job ?
FA : Well , to be clear , and probably to finish on what happened last year - because the next question will be about 2009 or if not we switch language .
I was in Paris to co-operate with the FIA , to help in the investigation with my team as well .
I am happy that everything is clear now , and I am happy also that it is clear I was not involved in the incident and had nothing in that matter .
It has been difficult times for the team maybe but that is the past - it was last week .
That is behind us and we move on , and let 's concentrate on this race , then next weekend in Japan , and life continues so it is time to get some results again .
The past is clear , it is right it is settled , and it is finished for us .
Q . You are in Flavio 's management team and the FIA will not give a superlicence to a driver who is related to that .
What is your situation there ?
Are you looking for a new manager ?
FA : It does n't change at all anything on me .
My manager was Luis Garcia [ Abad ] , who is here with me always .
And my manager next year will be Luis .
Q. Did you not suspect at any time after the race that something had had happened ?
Did it never cross your mind ?
FA : Never .
But we move on again from that incident .
Q . There have been a lot of comments saying that you must have known about it , and people think you must have known about it .
Does it annoy you when you read that sort of stuff ?
FA : I do n't read .
I am very lucky that I do n't read newspapers and I do n't read comments of the people .
I live in the present and I live in the real world .
Q . But what do you say to people who say you must have known about this ?
FA : Well , they can read what the FIA has issued - the resolution .
It is quite clear .
If it 's not understood there then they have a problem of reading .
Q . What uniform will you be wearing next year ?
FA : I do n't know .
That would be a good question to answer and hopefully I will know soon .
Q. How soon ?
FA : As soon as possible .
Q. Were you surprised that Pat Symonds was so involved in this affair ?
FA : Nothing to say .
Everyone will have his opinion and again , there is too much talk about last year .
I had to tell my feelings from last year .
As I said to you now it 's clear and it 's finally over and I 'm happy that it 's clear for everyone .
But again , there 's not much to say from me or from anyone .
I think it 's time to move on and at least me and the team will move on .
If you keep asking questions about last year sorry but I will not answer anymore .
Q. What are you expectations here ?
FA : The expectations are quite high for this track , to be honest , because we have been quick in Hungary , we 've been more or less quick in Monaco , and Singapore is a combination of these two tracks .
We really believe we can be competitive on this track .
We will put our maximum effort to do a good qualifying and then a good race and improve out best result so far , which has been fifth .
If we can be on the podium it will be great .
Here and in Japan we have high expectations so hopefully we can have a good weekend .
Q. Fernando , after Nelson was offered immunity and then Pat was offered immunity , does it make you feel like there was a witch - hunt just to get Flavio ?
FA : No comment .
Q . In Monza there was talk that certain engines were a lot more powerful than others .
Did you feel that Renault was at a disadvantage ?
FA : I think at Monza there were some talks , but we had the feeling from the last three or four grands prix that there are some engines that are performing very well , like Mercedes .
And we are happy with our engine .
I think we have quite a strong engine , maybe not as good as the Mercedes , but there are no complaints about our engine .
For sure it would be nice to have a little bit more .
Q . Why did KERS did not work as expected at the start in Monza ?
FA : The start was quite bad .
The first ten meters , releasing the clutch , there was too much slip , so we did n't move forward .
I actually lost one or two position in the first 50 meters of the start and then I pushed the button and recovered my original position .
Without KERS maybe I would have lost three or four positions at turn 1 and thanks to the KERS I kept my originally position , so it was a help , no doubt .
Q. Do you know who Witness X is ?
FA : Nothing to say .
Q. Will the performance of the car in the remaining races of the season influence your decision about where you are driving next year ?
FA : No. Nothing .
Q . So what are the factors that will make up your mind ?
FA : My mind is already set .
Q. Have you signed a contract ?
FA : No .
Q. Fernando , in the last two years you have been involved in two major scandals .
What does that take out of you as an individual ?
FA : Nothing .
Last year I was not involved and two years ago with McLaren we were all helping the FIA .
We were not involved , we were just helping the FIA .
As a superlicence holder we need to do it , so that 's all .
Q. Does n't it make you despair a little bit about your sport ?
Because we are talking about this and not racing .
FA : Yes , but this is everybody 's fault , from the drivers , from the teams , and from the sport itself .
There are more sports that are hit by scandals and sports that are more quiet .
And F1 is so big and so famous that anything that happens has a big repercussion .

My grandpa , Bill Hurst , was a journal writer his entire life .
His journal was quite simple .
He just kept a small notebook in the pocket of his pearl snap shirts and jotted down a short description of the things he did and the people he did it with .
This is something he did pretty much every day for his entire life .
He also kept extensive diaries of his time as a forest ranger in the Wasatch Range .
About 12 years ago , my grandpa took all these diaries and daily journal entries and began to write his memoir for his children and grandchildren .
The finished product was a 500 page behemoth filled with stories from my grandfather ’s life .
Here ’s just a few of the interesting things I learned from reading it :
My grandpa met my grandma by hitting on her while she worked as a telephone operator .
My grandpa helped pay for college by playing pool .
He worked as a sheep herder during the summers in high school and college .
He gives a very descriptive account on how castrating sheep is performed .
He did it just like this .
He has a scar from when he was hit by a car while racing his horse through the streets of his boyhood town .
The horse died .
As a boy , his family traveled by horse and buggy .
There ’s more .
Lots more .
But while the stories are interesting , what I found more interesting was the commentary my grandpa gave on different events in his life .
In these moments , he passed on some insights and lessons on what it means to be a man .
My grandpa ’s memoir is a treasure trove of knowledge and wisdom from a life well lived .
By writing his memoir , he guaranteed that his legacy will live on indefinitely .
But his life story would have been but a few pages long had he not kept a journal .
There are a myriad of other benefits to keeping a daily journal besides remembering what you ate five years ago .
So today ’s task is to start the journaling habit .
Great Men Keep Journals
In studying the lives of great men , I ’ve noticed a common trait : they were all consistent journal writers .
Now , I ’m not saying that their greatness is directly attributable to their journaling .
I ’m sure Captain Cook would still have been a bad ass even if he had n’t kept a diary .
But I figure , if great men like these thought it was important to keep a journal , maybe I should , too .
Heck , if it were n’t for their journals , we probably would n’t know much about their great lives and deeds .
Here ’s a short list of great men from history who kept journals :
Theodore Roosevelt
Thomas Jefferson
Charles Darwin
Benjamin Franklin
Lewis and Clark
Andrew Carnegie
Ralph Waldo Emerson
Captain Cook
Winston Churchill
Sir Edmund Hilary
Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton
Doogie Howser M.D
I could go on , but I think you get the idea .
Why Keep a Journal
Your children and grandchildren will want to read it .
I know it ’s hard to believe right now .
Your life probably seems quite ordinary and of little interest to anyone else .
And every generation believes that life will pretty much continue on like it is now .
When your great - grandpa was kicking it in the 1920 ’s , he thought to himself , “ Who would want to read about this new fangled radio or how I get my food out of an icebox ?
Phhht !
That ’s boring stuff ! ”
But it ’s not boring anymore ; to this generation , such a peak at the olden days is fascinating .
And so it is with you .
When your grandkids are talking to people via hologram , they are going to be absolutely fascinated by your impressions of those ancient things like the alta vista and cell phones .
And unfortunately , they ’re not going to be curious about it until they get into their 20’s , realize you ’re going to die , and start asking you questions .
Trust me , while you think that you ’ll be able to remember everything just as clearly in the future , you wo n’t .
Remember when you were a kid and you thought your experiences would be easily recalled at age 30 ?
Now what do you remember from those days besides that time a dog bit you in the face ?
As each year passes , the pixels of our memories burn out and the haze sets in .
By age 80 , you ’ll only remember the faintest outlines of the big things that happened to you .
But the stuff that ’s really interesting is often the little , seemingly mundane details of life .
What was a man ’s daily routine like in 2009 ?
Of course , the whipper snappers will ask you about the big stuff too : “ Where were you when you found out about the attacks on the World Trade Center ? ” and “ What did you think about the election of Barack Obama ? ”
Your journals will give them the answers they ’ll be looking for and will bring you closer .
And who knows ?
Maybe the whole world might be interested in your musings someday .
You may not think so now , but how many famous men knew that they would be famous before they actually burst onto the scene ?
And how many men were ignored in their lifetime , only to be celebrated after their death ?
It can bring you to your senses .
Have you ever struggled with a choice , thought about it long and hard , made a decision , but then some time later started to regret it ?
Have you ever gotten into a rut from which you ca n’t seem to find a way out ?
A journal can aid you in these dilemmas .
When you make a decision , you can write down all the reasons you have for coming to that conclusion .
Then , after times passes , and you start doubting that choice , you can look back , remind yourself of why you made that decision in the first place , and feel reassured in pressing on .
Or , it you ’re in a depressed funk and do n’t know how to extract yourself from it , you can look back through your journal to find the times when you were happiest .
Old journal entries can help you rediscover the kind of changes you need to make to get your life back on track .
Or you can look back at your journal and how you used to operate 5 years ago and think , “ Damn !
I never want to be that man again !
What was I thinking ? ” A journal is basically a chance for your past self to lend counsel to your present self .
Finally , simply writing about your feelings and frustrations helps you focus on what ’s really going on in your life and in your head , so that you can come up with a solution to your problems .
Journaling grants you immortality .
Think of the billions of people who have and will perish from the earth without leaving a trace of themselves behind .
They vanish into the ether , completely forgotten in the annals of history .
A journal helps make you immortal .
It is an tangible piece of evidence to leave behind that you were here !
That you lived and loved !
That there was such a person as Jared Matthews who lived in Austin , Texas who thought and breathed and died .
Journaling improves your health .
Several studies have shown that writing about traumatic or stressful events and your deepest feelings and emotions boosts your emotional and physical health and sense of well - being .

Especially as men , we often tend to keep things bottled up .
Journaling provides a excellent outlet to let go of those things that are bothering or worrying us .
How to Journal
Pick a medium .
If you ’ve never journaled or if you have previously , but fell off the wagon , the first thing you need to decide is what kind of journal you ’re going to keep .
There are basically two different types of journal mediums : analog and digital .
Analog journals , the paper and pen variety , are what we traditionally think of when we think of journals .
You can use something as basic as a spiral bound notebook and a Bic pen or something as fancy as a hand bound leather journal and a fountain pen .
Just do what works for you .
With the advent of computers , many people have gone digital with their journaling .
The digital world offers a plethora of options to record your daily happenings and thoughts .
Here ’s a list of possible desktop digital tools in which to keep your journal :
Word Processor .
Pretty basic .
Just open up MS Word or OpenOffice Writer and start clickity clackin’ away .

TextEditor / Notepad .
Just open up the text editor for your operating system , call the file “ journal.txt , ” and start writing .
Date each entry .
If you ’re using Notepad , here ’s a nifty little hack to automatically insert the date into your journal entry .

JDarkroom .
JDarkroom is a free Java - based text editor .
What makes it different from other text editors is that it takes up the entire screen for distraction free writing .
I ’ve used it before , and it ’s actually pretty nice .
It works on any platform .

OneNote .
Microsoft OneNote is a robust note taking program that can double as a journal .
Just create a notebook within OneNote for your journal and start writing .
With this program , you can easily drop photos and videos into your journal entries .
OneNote is only available for Windows .

Evernote .
Evernote is pretty much like Microsoft OneNote except 1 ) it ’s free , 2 ) it works on any platform , and 3 ) you can save and access entries on the internet easily , thus giving you access to your journal everyone you go .
I do n’t use Evernote for my journal , but I ’ve use it on a daily basis for notes and would definitely recommend it .
The internet provides several options for you to store your journal in the “ cloud ” and even share it with other people .
A few options :
Blogspot .
It ’s free and it gives you the option of keeping your journal private or sharing it with a few people .
In addition to writing text , you can easily include photos in your journal entries .
LiveJournal .
Pretty much the same as Blogspot .
It ’s free and you have the option of keeping it private or you can share with others .
WordPress.com
Out of all the blogging platforms , I prefer WordPress ( it ’s what we use for Art of Manliness ) .
You can get a free wordpress.com blog and start a journal with it .
Use Gmail as a journal .
This is an interesting idea .
Schedule a time .
Starting a journal is easy enough .
Sticking to it on a daily basis is more difficult .
If you want to make it a habit , just pick a time in your day for journal writing and make it a non-negotiable in your life .
I like doing it at night right before I go to bed .
It ’s a good way to decompress and review the day ’s events .
But some people prefer writing in the morning or jotting down thoughts throughout the day .
Just do what works for you .
Some days you might not have the energy or desire to write in your journal .
On those days , just write something .
It can be a sentence long .
It can simply be , “ I ’m not in the mood to write . ”
Just keep your commitment .
One of the most memorable journal entries I ’ve come across was written by TR on the day both his wife and mother died .
Instead of spending several pages outlining his grief , this is all it said :
What to Write About
This is where a lot of people get hung up on with journaling .
They feel like they do n’t have anything to write about so they end up not writing at all .
There are hundreds of books that give you “ suggestions ” of what to write about in your journal .
Usually they ’re cheesy and inane things like , “ If you were a cloud , what shape would you be . ”
Just write about your day .
No need to get fancy with those cute little journal prompts .
Some days might be pretty routine , but other days you might be feeling philosophical or have a problem that will require you to write more in - depth entries .
Just write what comes naturally to you on that day .
And as we mentioned above , while you might think your life is boring , your great grand kids wo n’t .
They ’ll be just as fascinated about you driving a car that runs on gasoline as you are about your great grandpa driving a horse and buggy .
If your life really is boring , perhaps keeping a journal will give you an incentive to take on more adventures so you have something to write about .
It ’s time to get started .
Your task today is to start a journal .
Pick your medium and begin .
If you already have a journal , but have n’t written in it in awhile , write an entry today .
And if you ’re one of those few consistent journalers out there , bully for you !
Keep up the good work and use today ’s journal entry to give yourself a pat on the back .
Tell us about what kind of journal you ’ll be using and your journaling tips and stories on the Community page .
LOS ANGELES — California is conducting a months - long investigation into audit logs inside the state 's electronic voting systems after reports of serious flaws with the logs — including the ability for an election official or someone else to delete votes without leaving an electronic trail .
The investigation is examining what the audit logs record and whether they can be easily altered or deleted , according to Secretary of State Debra Bowen .
The investigation stems from a serious problem discovered in January with voting systems made by Premier Election Solutions ( formerly Diebold Election Systems ) .
Investigators found that the tabulation software used with all of the company 's touchscreen and optical scan machines failed to record crucial events , including the act of someone deleting votes from the system on Election Day .
The logs also failed to record who performed an action on the system and listed some events with the wrong date and timestamps .
The investigation is just the latest critical look at e-voting machines , whose proprietary inner workings have led voting rights activists and computer scientists to question the integrity of the country 's voting processes .
The company 's software is used to count votes in more than 1,400 election jurisdictions in 31 states , including Maryland and Georgia , which use Premier / Diebold voting systems exclusively .
Bowen , appearing at an event Wednesday evening to discuss an open source voting project in development , told Threat Level that the state contracted with David Wagner , a computer scientist with the University of California at Berkeley , to investigate fully what the logs on the Premier / Diebold system , as well as every other voting system used in the state , do and do n't record .
Deputy Secretary of State Lowell Finley is currently examining a draft report of the investigation that is " as thick as you would imagine ( it would be ) , " said Bowen , who indicated that she has not yet read it herself .
Audit logs are required under federal voting - system guidelines , which are used to test and qualify voting systems for use in elections .
The logs are supposed to record changes and other events that occur on voting systems to ensure the integrity of elections and help determine what occurred in a system when something goes wrong .
But a Premier / Diebold representative admitted at a California hearing in March that none of the logs in its Global Election Management System ( GEMS ) – the software that tabulates votes – records significant events , such as when votes are intentionally or unintentionally deleted .
Justin Bales , general service manager for Premier / Diebold 's western region said that the GEMS logs had been the same since the software was first created more than a decade ago .
" We never ... intended for any malicious intent and not to log certain activities , " Bales said .
" It was just not in the initial program , but now we ’re taking a serious look at that . "
Bowen called the audit logs " useless " at the time and told Threat Level that her office would investigate the issue further and determine if audit logs in other voting systems – such as those made by Election Systems & Software , Sequoia Voting Systems and Hart InterCivic – had the same problems .
Bowen would n't discuss what steps the state might take if it turns out that all voting systems have the same audit log problems found in Premier 's system .
Threat Level uncovered problems with the GEMS logs in January after obtaining copies of logs through a public records request .
The state confirmed the problems in a report it released about a month later in which it also found that some versions of the GEMS software had a Clear button that allows anyone with access to the system to permanently delete certain audit logs " that would be essential to reconstruct operator actions during the vote - tallying process . "
Interest focused on the logs after election officials in Humboldt County , California , discovered that its GEMS tabulation software had randomly deleted a batch of 197 ballots in the days after the November 2008 presidential election .
Although a receipt printed from the state 's optical - scan machine clearly showed that the ballots had been scanned into the system , the ballots later disappeared from the tabulation totals .
The tabulation software 's audit logs showed no sign that the ballots had been deleted or had ever been in the system .
Threat Level discovered in August that Premier / Diebold quietly fixed the audit log problem in a new version of its GEMS software that was recently tested and certified for use .
The new version of the software does record such events as the deletion of votes , and includes other security safeguards that would prevent the system from operating if the event log were somehow shut down , according to iBeta Quality Assurance , the Colorado testing lab that examined the software for the federal government .
It ’s not known if Premier / Diebold has offered the more secure version of its tabulation software to election officials who purchased previous versions .
Diebold sold its Premier voting system division to Election Systems & Software in September .
A spokesman for ES&S said he would look into whether election officials have received an updated version of the software .

WASHINGTON  Seven months after taking office , Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. is reshaping the Justice Department ’s Civil Rights Division by pushing it back into some of the most important areas of American political life , including voting rights , housing , employment , bank lending practices and redistricting after the 2010 census .
As part of this shift , the Obama administration is planning a major revival of high - impact civil rights enforcement against policies , in areas ranging from housing to hiring , where statistics show that minorities fare disproportionately poorly .
President George W. Bush ’s appointees had discouraged such tactics , preferring to focus on individual cases in which there is evidence of intentional discrimination .
To bolster a unit that has been battered by heavy turnover and a scandal over politically tinged hiring under the Bush administration , the Obama White House has also proposed a hiring spree that would swell the ranks of several hundred civil rights lawyers with more than 50 additional lawyers , a significant increase for a relatively small but powerful division of the government .
The division is “ getting back to doing what it has traditionally done , ” Mr. Holder said in an interview .
“ But it ’s really only a start .
I think the wounds that were inflicted on this division were deep , and it will take some time for them to fully heal . ”
Today , Mormons think they must earn their own salvation .
But the Prophet Joseph Smith taught a different doctrine .
Smith taught that a whole family could be saved if the wife or daughter of the family was married to him .
One example of this is fourteen year - old Helen Mar Kimball , who Joseph Smith traded sex for the salvation of her entire family .
We have Helen 's own testimony of what 37 year - old Joseph Smith promised 14 year - old Helen Mar Kimball in order to make her his bride :
Helen wrote : " Having a great desire to be connected with the Prophet , Joseph , he ( my father ) offered me to him ; this I afterwards learned from the Prophet 's own mouth .
My father had but one Ewe Lamb , but willingly laid her upon the altar : how cruel this seemed to my mother whose heartstrings were already stretched until they were ready to snap asunder , for she had already taken Sarah Noon to wife and she thought she had made sufficient sacrifice but the Lord required more . " -
Helen Mar Whitney Journal , Helen Mar Autobiography , Womans Exponent , 1880 and recently reprinted in A Woman 's view In fact , Joseph Smith gave young Helen only 24 hours to decide on whether or not to marry him .
Of this , Helen wrote : " [ my father ] left me to reflect upon it for the next twenty four hours .
... I was sceptical - one minute believed , then doubted .
I thought of the love and tenderness that he felt for his only daughter , and I knew that he would not cast me off , and this was the only convincing proof
That I had of its being right . "
The next morning , Joseph Smith finally appeared himself to explain the " law of Celestial Marriage " and claim his teen bride .
In her memoir , Helen wrote , " After which he said to me , 'if you take this step , it will ensure your eternal salvation and exaltation and that of your father 's household and all of your kindred . '
This promise was so great that I willingly gave myself to purchase so glorious a reward .
" Helen also writes about her mother 's reaction to all of this : " None but God and his angels could see my mother 's bleeding heart - when Joseph asked her if she was willing , she replied ' If Helen is willing I have nothing more to say . "
" She had witnessed the sufferings of others , who were older and who better understood the step they were taking , and to see her child , who had yet seen her fifteenth summer , following the same thorny path , in her mind she saw the misery which was as sure to come as the sun was to rise and set ; but it was hidden from me . "
Helen thought her marriage to Joseph Smith was only dynastic .
But to her surprise , it was more .
Helen confided to a close friend in Nauvoo : " I would never have been sealed to Joseph had I known it was anything more than ceremony .
I was young , and they deceived me , by saying the salvation of our whole family depended on it . "

How would this restored doctrine work today , if the church still practiced it ?
I 've been using chef in production for a while now .
It saves me untold time and energy .
Without it , I could n't possibly manage our 15 + server cluster , in addition to writing and maintaining our code base .
As is often the case , however , removing one bottleneck exposed several more .
Currently , we use a set of custom rake tasks and capistrano recipes to launch ec2 instances and deploy our chef recipes .
For various reasons , this includes committing a sqlite database to a git repository .
The system works , but it is n't pretty .
Launching and configuring an instance , for example , requires several commands .
And , without a running application , things like auto - scaling are basically out of the question .
I began to see a real need for an always - running application to manage my infrastructure .
It would make everything easier , from launching instances to backing up EBS volumes .
Today , I 'm releasing an early alpha of that application .
conductor
Conductor is the beginnings of an infrastructure management application .
The version I 'm releasing today has a rather limited feature set .
But , the ground work is there .
So , most of the fancy stuff should be relatively easy to implement .
Right now , conductor is able to provision instances from ec2 and configure them with chef .
You provide a url to a git repository , which contains your cookbooks and some metadata .
Conductor will launch your instances and configure them with the cookbooks from that repository .
I 'm also releasing a basic rails stack that I 'll be maintaining .
I 'm hoping others will contribute stacks for other plaforms .
Currently , things are tightly coupled to the structure of standard web infrastructure .
Only two roles are supported : app , and mysql_master .
The next major item on my TODO list is to make the launching system far more flexible , so that conductor can be used to manage any kind of infrastructure .
I should get to this soon , since our infrastructure still is n't supported .
Roadmap
As much as I hate vaporware , the possibilities for conductor are exciting .
Your indulgence is appreciated :-) .
On - demand staging .
Clone the entire production environment , including databases in one click .
Terminate it when you 're done .
Pay for what you used .

Coordinated snapshotting of EBS volumes .
One of the problems with running EBS volumes in a RAID configuration is backups .
If you are snapshotting more than one drive at a time , you need some way to keep track of which sets of snapshots go together for recovery .
Even better , a central app can be smart enough to perform the recovery itself .
Follow Along
As I said , today 's release is early alpha .
But , I 'm going to be putting a lot of work in to this , because it 'll make my job a hell of a lot easier , and save us money .
So , follow along with the development by following the github project or subscribing to my blog .
If you want to try conductor out , there 's a ton of information in the README .
I 'll be hanging out in # conductorapp on freenode if you 're having trouble getting things running .
Wal - Mart was the victim of a serious security breach in 2005 and 2006 in which hackers targeted the development team in charge of the chain 's point - of - sale system and siphoned source code and other sensitive data to a computer in Eastern Europe , Wired.com has learned .
Internal documents reveal for the first time that the nation 's largest retailer was among the earliest targets of a wave of cyberattacks that went after the bank - card processing systems of brick - and - mortar stores around the United States beginning in 2005 .
The details of the breach , and the company 's challenges in reconstructing what happened , shed new light on the vulnerable state of retail security at the time , despite card - processing security standards that had been in place since 2001 .
In response to inquiries from Wired.com , the company acknowledged the hack attack , which it calls an " internal issue . "
Because no sensitive customer data was stolen , Wal - Mart had no obligation to disclose the breach publicly .
Wal - Mart had a number of security vulnerabilities at the time of the attack , according to internal security assessments seen by Wired.com , and acknowledged as genuine by Wal - Mart .
For example , at least four years ' worth of customer purchasing data , including names , card numbers and expiration dates , were housed on company networks in unencrypted form .
Wal - Mart says it was in the process of dramatically improving the security of its transaction data , and in 2006 began encrypting the credit card numbers and other customer information , and making other important security changes .
" Wal - Mart ... really made every effort to segregate the data , to make separate networks , to encrypt it fully from start to finish through the transmission , " says Wal - Mart 's Chief Privacy Officer Zoe Strickland .
" And not just in one area but across the different uses of credit card systems . "
Wal - Mart uncovered the breach in November 2006 , after a fortuitous server crash led administrators to a password - cracking tool that had been surreptitiously installed on one of its servers .
Wal - Mart 's initial probe traced the intrusion to a compromised VPN account , and from there to a computer in Minsk , Belarus .
The discovery set off an investigation that swept in outside security consultants and corporate attorneys to determine what the hackers had touched , and whether the company was required to report the intrusion , and to whom , the documents show .
Wal - Mart says it notified federal law enforcement agents , who were working on other ongoing investigations involving similar breaches .
At the time , attacks featuring a similar MO were occurring at TJX , Dave & Buster 's restaurants and other companies , which ultimately resulted in more than 100 million cards being compromised .
Albert Gonzalez , a 28 - year - old Miami man , pleaded guilty this month to carrying out many of those breaches with other hackers , and is facing unresolved charges for the remainders .
The Wal - Mart intrusion began unraveling on Nov. 5 , 2006 , when the company 's IT security group was brought in to investigate the server crash .
Wal - Mart has thousands of servers nationwide , and any one of them crashing would ordinarily be a routine event .
But this one raised a red flag .
Someone had installed L0 phtcrack , a password - cracking tool , onto the system , which crashed the server when the intruder tried to launch the program .
Investigators found that the tool had been installed remotely by someone using a generic network administrator account .
The intruder had reached the machine through a VPN account assigned to a former Wal - Mart worker in Canada , which administrators had failed to close after the worker left the company .
The day the server crashed , the intruder had been connected to Wal - Mart ’s network for about seven hours , originating from an IP address in Minsk , the documents show .
The security team disabled the compromised VPN account , but the intruder , who should have realized the jig was up , came back in through another account belonging to a different Canadian employee .
When that VPN account was closed , the intruder grabbed yet a third account while Wal - Mart workers were still scrambling to get a fix on the scope of the breach .
When Wal - Mart reviewed its VPN logs , it found that the activity had begun at least as early as June 2005 , according to memos written by Wal - Mart employees during the initial stage of the investigation .
The company 's server logs recorded only unsuccessful log - in attempts , not successful ones , frustrating a detailed analysis .
Wal - Mart declined to respond to questions about the initial date of the attack , the server logging or the conclusions it reached in its final report , which Wired.com has not seen .
Nonetheless , Wal - Mart 's security team was able to identify " over 800 machines that the attacker either tried to brute force or actually made a successful connection , " according to a Nov. 10 , 2006 e-mail summarizing the early investigation .
Many computers the hackers targeted belonged to company programmers , the documents show .
Wal - Mart at the time produced some of its own software , because the company could n’t find off - the - shelf applications that scaled to its size , according to a source who was involved with the investigation .
One team of programmers was tasked with coding the company ’s point - of - sale system for processing credit and debit card transactions .
This was the team the intruders targeted .
" They were n’t port scanning , they were n’t ping tracing , they were n’t groping blindly in the dark trying to find a nugget , " says the investigator .
" They knew what they were going for and they were all over it – point - of - sale . ”
The intruders ' interest in Wal - Mart 's point - of - sale system is consistent with large data breaches that occurred at other companies around the same time .
In the spring of 2005 , associates of TJX hacker Albert Gonzales hacked into the point - of - sale system of a Marshall 's clothing store in Minnesota .
The hackers pointed an antenna at the store to grab data as it streamed over the store 's vulnerable Wi-Fi network , then used the data to gain access to the central transaction database of TJX , Marshall 's parent company .
Similarly , in mid-2007 , Gonzalez 's gang gained access to point - of - sale servers at Dave & Buster 's restaurants and installed packet sniffers to siphon card data as it was transmitted to corporate computers and others for authorization .
According to court documents , the hackers '
MO included doing reconnaissance of retailers to determine the point - of - sale systems they used and map their network setups .
( There 's no evidence Wired.com has seen linking Gonzalez to the Wal - Mart breach . )
In the case of Wal - Mart , one of the documents that flew off to Minsk from a programmer 's machine was titled " POS Store Systems Technical Specifications TLOG Encryption and Financial Flows Draft 03/04/2006 " – essentially a flow chart that would have mapped out Wal - Mart ’s transaction process , the source says , from the moment a customer swipes his credit or debit card in a store ’s card reader , to the point the digital data crosses the network to be authenticated by a card issuer .
The hackers also stole or accessed files containing point - of - sale source code and executables , as well as additional proprietary documentation detailing the company ’s transaction processing network .
A partial list seen by Wired.com includes documentation on a company database , a file connected to a point - of - sale simulator , debugging files , a telnet capture , a bash history file and a sign - on log .
The documents show no evidence that files containing customer information were breached in the attack .
At the time Wal - Mart discovered the breach , it had been encrypting its transaction data for at least three months .
It began to do so after a security audit performed for the company in December 2005 found that customer data was poorly protected .
Wal - Mart commissioned the probe from security auditors at CyberTrust as part of its efforts to become compliant with Payment Card Industry ( PCI ) security standards that were established in 2001 .
Enforced by credit card issuer Visa , top - tier companies such as Wal - Mart were theoretically required to be in compliance with the standards by mid-2004 .
Wal - Mart says it received a number of deadline extensions .
CyberTrust examined networks at five Wal - Mart locations : three Wal - Mart stores in Missouri and Oklahoma , and two other Wal - Mart - owned businesses – a Sam ’s Club store in Missouri and a Neighborhood Market in Arkansas , according to a report the auditors wrote .
The assessment lasted six days , during which CyberTrust found numerous problems .
Each of the five stores , for example , housed complete backup copies of transaction logs on network - connected UNIX servers , which included at least four years ' worth of unencrypted credit card numbers , cardholder names and expiration dates from purchases at the stores .
The auditors also discovered that servers , transaction processing systems , and other network - connected devices handling sensitive information used the same usernames and passwords across every Wal - Mart store nationwide .
In some cases , the passwords could be easily guessed .
A hacker or malicious insider who compromised a point - of - sale controller or in - store card processor at one store , could “ access the same device at every Wal - Mart store nationwide , ” CyberTrust wrote .
Finally , CyberTrust found sensitive customer information stored unencrypted on pharmacy computers at four of the stores , including customer names , home addresses , Social Security numbers , genders , credit card numbers and expiration dates .
“ A long - term , undetected compromise of Wal - Mart RXP system could allow a virtually endless supply of customers ’ names , addresses , and Social Security numbers – the basic ingredients for identity theft , ” CyberTrust wrote in its report .
" Wal - Mart runs the risk of ... losing not only the sensitive information , but also their customers ’ hard earned trust , " the auditors added .
The report was dated Jan. 9 , 2006 , 10 months before Wal - Mart discovered the breach .
Strickland says the company took the report to heart and " put a massive amount of energy and expertise " into addressing the risks to customer data , and became certified as PCI - compliant in August 2006 by VeriSign .
After it discovered the breach in November 2006 , the company turned over memory dumps and at least 31 forensic images of machines and servers to Stroz Friedberg , a forensic investigations firm , for further analyses .
E-mails exchanged by team members eight days after the intrusion was detected show the company furiously searching firewall and intrusion detection logs for suspicious activity .
The e-mails also discuss shutting down the entire Nortel VPN network the intruder used , ordering RSA security tokens to authenticate users to the network , and increasing logging retention on servers .
On Nov. 16 , one team member sent an unencrypted e-mail update to other employees and was harshly rebuked by a senior security manager who warned them to communicate only through e/pop , a secure instant messaging system .
“ Guys .... time out here , ” he wrote .
“ What was the first thing I discussed in our meeting about communications protocol concerning this project ?
Get Epop up , installed , and running today ! ”
The company 's internal investigators found evidence potentially linking the attack to a suspected breach at a Wal - Mart division a year earlier .
The forensic trail showed that the machine in Belarus that breached Wal - Mart 's VPN had tried to log on to a machine belonging to Sam's Club , Wal - Mart 's membership store chain , in 2005 .
This finding was potentially significant , because Sam's Club had been suspected in 2005 of spilling credit card data in a breach .
Late that year , MasterCard and Visa informed Wal - Mart about a cluster of fraudulent charges on credit cards that had been used at Sam ’s Club gas stations .
A press release issued by Sam's Club at the time warned that intruders might have gained access to 600 cards used at the pumps between Sept. 21 and Oct. 2 , 2005 .
But the company assured consumers that “ the electronic systems and databases used inside its stores and for samsclub.com are not involved " and now says that after investigating the issue , it never found any evidence of a breach at its gas pumps or in its stores .
The company also says the Sam's Club investigation and the 2006 breach are not connected .
" The Sam 's Club matter has been closed for some time and is not related to the other matter you 're asking about , " said Wal - Mart spokeswoman Michelle Bradford .
Internal documents show that Sam's Club suffered the same types of vulnerabilities as the rest of Wal - Mart 's empire , and that logging was inadequate to completely rule out a breach .
An audit by VeriSign at the time found that Sam's Club 's firewall and intrusion - detection logs were configured to record only " spotty and inconsistent " data , and that operating systems lacked the latest security patches .
" The level of vulnerability identified . . . would leave these systems open to compromise from a number of different attacks , " wrote VeriSign in a report .
But " due to the level of logging enabled on these systems , which did not capture much information , it was not possible to determine if any of these vulnerabilities were attacked . "
In the report , which Wal - Mart submitted to the Federal Trade Commission in February 2006 , nine months before it discovered the breach in its main network , VeriSign concluded that although it had found no point of compromise in the Sam's Club system , the company 's logs did n't contain sufficient information " to identify or rule out a specific point of compromise . "
Wal - Mart says that the security issues raised in all of these reports have been addressed and that since the company became PCI compliant in August 2006 , it has been commissioning PCI audits every six months – twice the frequency required by PCI standards .
" Every item [ in the reports ] that had a PCI vulnerability was remediated , " says Strickland .
PCI certification does n't guarantee the security of bank card data – numerous companies that experienced serious bank card breaches in recent years were certified PCI compliant at the time they were breached .
There is no evidence , however , that Wal - Mart suffered a sizable breach of credit or debit card data from either Sam's Club in 2005 or from its main network in 2006 .

LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) - British physicist Stephen Hawking will step down from one of the most famous academic posts in the world this week .
Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking addresses a public meeting in Cape Town in this May 11 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Mike Hutchings / Files
The “ Brief History of Time ” author is scheduled to leave Cambridge University ’s Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics , a position that has been held by only 17 men including the father of physics Isaac Newton .
Holders of the post traditionally step down at the age of 67 , which Hawking reached in January .
Hawking has held the post at Cambridge ’s Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics ( DAMTP ) since 1979 , where he supervises PhD students .
It is often referred to as a “ chair ” .
He will take up a new role as Director of Research in the DAMTP , where he will continue to lead efforts in cosmology and gravitation .
He also remains the principal investigator for the COSMOS National Cosmology Supercomputer and will play an active role in the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology , which aims to advance understanding of the universe , the university said .
Hawking has a neuro muscular dystrophy that has progressed over the years and has left him almost completely paralysed .
He said in an emailed statement : “ This is an exciting time in cosmology with new observational results coming in thick and fast and large - scale terrestrial and satellite experiments underway . ”
“ With luck , we will soon be able to answer some of the ultimate questions about the Universe and our existence . ”
The “ Professorship of Mathematick ” was deeded in December 1663 at Cambridge University as a result of a gift from Henry Lucas , Member of Parliament for the university .
The university has not yet named Hawking ’s successor .
It ’s official .
The U.S. is no longer engaged in a “ war on terrorism . ”
Neither is it fighting “ jihadists ” or in a “ global war . ”
President Obama ’s top homeland security and counterterrorism official took all three terms off the table of acceptable words inside the White House during a speech Thursday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank .
“ The President does not describe this as a ‘ war on terrorism , ’ ” said John Brennan , head of the White House homeland security office , who outlined a “ new way of seeing ” the fight against terrorism .
The only terminology that Mr. Brennan said the administration is using is that the U.S. is “ at war with al Qaeda . ”
“ We are at war with al Qaeda , ” he said .
“ We are at war with its violent extremist allies who seek to carry on al Qaeda ’s murderous agenda . ”
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in March that the administration was not using the term “ war on terror ” but no specific directive had come from the White House itself .
Mr. Obama himself used the term “ war on terror ” on Jan. 23 , his fourth day as president , but has not used it since .
Mr. Brennan ’s speech was aimed at outlining ways in which the Obama administration intends to undermine the “ upstream ” factors that create an environment in which terrorists are bred .
The president ’s adviser talked about increasing aid to foreign governments for building up their militaries and social and democratic institutions , but provided few details about how the White House will do that .
He was specific about ways in which Mr. Obama believes words influence the way America prosecutes the fight against terrorism .
Mr. Brennan said that to say the U.S. is fighting “ jihadists ” is wrongheaded because it is using “ a legitimate term , ‘ jihad , ’ meaning to purify oneself or to wage a holy struggle for a moral goal ” which “ risks giving these murderers the religious legitimacy they desperately seek but in no way deserve . ”
“ Worse , it risks reinforcing the idea that the United States is somehow at war with Islam itself , ” Mr. Brennan said .
As for the “ war on terrorism , ” Mr. Brennan said the administration is not going to say that “ because ‘ terrorism ’ is but a tactic — a means to an end , which in al Qaedas case is global domination by an Islamic caliphate . ”
“ You can never fully defeat a tactic like terrorism any more than you can defeat the tactic of war itself , ” Mr. Brennan said .
He also said that to call the fight against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups — which he said remains “ a dynamic and evolving threat ” — should not be called “ a global war . ”
While Mr. Brennan acknowledged that al Qaeda and its affiliates are active in countries throughout the Middle East and Africa , he also said that “ portraying this as a ‘ global ’ war risks reinforcing the very image that al Qaeda seeks to project of itself — that it is a highly organized , global entity capable of replacing sovereign nations with a global caliphate . ”
The president ’s adviser said that in discussing counter terror operations , Mr. Obama “ has encouraged us to be even more aggressive , even more proactive , and even more innovative ” than they have been proposing .
But Mr. Brennan lamented “ inflammatory rhetoric , hyperbole , and intellectual narrowness ” surrounding the national security debate and said Mr. Obama has views that are “ nuanced , not simplistic ; practical , not ideological . ”
Juan Zarate , a former deputy national security adviser for counterterrorism to President George W. Bush , was in the audience and dismissed Mr. Brennan ’s speech as cosmetic in nature .
The focus on terminology , he said , is “ almost a nonissue . ”
“ It ’s a straw man .
The question is , how do you deal with the policy ? ” Mr. Zarate said .
Mr. Zarate also discounted Mr. Brennan ’s insistence that the Obama administration is not continuing Bush - era policies .
Mr. Brennan gave credit for al Qaeda ’s “ damaged ” capabilities only to front line military and intelligence personnel , while bashing the Bush administration for approving policies that green - lighted interrogation techniques such as waterboarding .
Mr. Brennan also said that under the Bush administration counterterrorism became too much of an emphasis and was “ defining ” and “ distorting ” U.S. foreign and national security policy .
But critics on the left and the right have pointed out that the Obama administration has continued such Bush - era policies as extroardinary rendition , drone attacks in Pakistan , an international and domestic surveillance program that remains cloaked in mystery , and the war in Afghanistan , where Mr. Obama has increased the number of U.S. troops and the military continues to house enemy combatants at Bagram Air Base .
In addition , the White House is still considering the practice of indefinite detention of terrorist suspects .
“ A challenge for John and the administration is to preserve the perception of a new approach while still continuing with counterterrorism strategies that have proven effective , ” said Mr. Zarate .

" Islamic finance has seen an incredible surge in popularity , based on stronger regulatory regimens and a better international understanding of its dynamics . "
Islamic banks are not authorized to invest in companies associated with tobacco , alcohol or gambling .
07 Sep 2009
Despite the global financial crisis , assets held by the 100 largest Islamic banks in the world raised by 66 percent in 2008 compared with previous year .
A study published by Asian Banker Research magazine says the assets of the Islamic banks increased to a total of $ 580 billion in 2008 -- up from $ 350 billion in 2007 .
This is while , the assets held by Asia 's 300 largest banks lifted by just 13.4 percent , the report says .
" Islamic finance has seen an incredible surge in popularity , based on stronger regulatory regimens and a better international understanding of its dynamics , " said Emmanuel Daniel , the magazine 's chief .
Islamic banking refers to a system of banking that is consistent with the principles of Islamic law .
Islamic law or Sharia prohibits the payment of fees for the renting of money ( Riba ) for specific terms , as well as investing in businesses that provide goods or services considered contrary to its principles ( Haraam ) .
Islamic banks are not authorized to invest in companies associated with tobacco , alcohol or gambling .
The report concludes that despite the current economic meltdown in the world " Islamic banks have continued to grow in prominence and size ” .
The report said Saudi Arabian lenders were more profitable among other banks with Al - Rajhi Bank netting the highest earnings of $ 1.74 billion , according to the report , and Iranian banks were the biggest players in the global Islamic banking system .
Iran holds seven out of the top 10 rankings and 12 out of the 100 top Islamic banks , the magazine said .
More than 40 percent of the total assets of the top 100 banks belong to Iranian banks , according to the report .

CHEMISTRY :
An Unrecognized Type of Chemical Bonding
Most scientists recognize covalent and ionic bonding to be the two types of chemical bonding between atoms .
Sason Shaik ( The Hebrew University of Jerusalem ) and coworkers have recently reviewed a third , and typically unrecognized , classification of chemical bonding .
This third classification is known as " charge - shift " bonding .
It is easy to envision it fundamentally transforming the way chemists view the architecture and properties of molecules , and consequently their reactivity .
A puzzle .
A bond in a molecule is typically considered to be ionic if there is a very unequal sharing of electrons between the bonded atoms .
Covalent bonds have more equal ( though not necessarily exactly equal ) sharing of electrons .
However , some molecular bonds defy classification as either ionic or covalent .
An example is the fluorine - fluorine bond .
Here , you have two atoms of the same identity .
The bond between them would be expected to be covalent .
However , it is not ; this bond shares some of the characteristics of an ionic bond , in that there is repulsion between the two atoms .
This and other experimental observations have left some chemists scratching their heads .
Certain theoretical predictions of the bonding between atoms have also yielded strange results .
Such results have occurred on occasion when chemists have attempted to calculate the energy of a bond that is expected to be covalent .
When one performs this calculation , including parameters important for covalent bonding , the result does not necessarily match similar calculations of bond energy when parameters that are important for ionic bonding are included as well .
It is clear that an unrecognized type of bonding is at work in such cases , which has come to be called charge - shift bonding .
Charge - shift bonding .
What is a charge - shift bond ?
Bonds that exhibit an exchange force will exhibit the charge - shift effect .
Atoms that are electronegative ( strong attraction for electrons ) , possess a lone pair of electrons ( two paired electrons in its valence shell ) , possess a tight positive charge , or molecules that are highly strained ( cyclopropane ) all exhibit an exchange force .
These are all conditions that compress molecular bonds .
Consequently , the energy of the bond increases beyond what may be predicted if it were simply an ionic or covalent bond .
It is more accurate to classify these bonds as charge - shift , one that clearly possesses both ionic and covalent character .
Implications .
Chemists do not yet know how to rigorously predict which bonds exhibit the charge - shift effect , because it is a relatively recent discovery .
Consequently , they are only beginning to learn how it affects molecular geometry and reactivity .
However , it is easy to envision that charge - shift bonding may have a previously unrecognized and important role in basic chemistry .
Even the issue of how atoms link together to form molecules , one that many scientists think was resolved long ago , has been reopened , reinforcing the fundamental scientific principle that no idea or observation is beyond question and revision .

Obama joins Netanyahu in shielding Israel from war crimes charges
By Jean Shaoul
19 October 2009
The United Nations Human Rights Council has endorsed a report into Israel ’s 22 - day assault on Gaza in December and January , accusing Israel of war crimes .
Israel ’s premier , Binyamin Netanyahu , predictably denounced the report as biased against Israel and unjust and insisted that he would not allow any Israeli officials to face trial for war crimes .
The Obama administration echoed Israel , calling the report unbalanced , and said that its adoption would damage the possibility of resuming talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
The talks are a necessary fig leaf for bringing the Arab regimes on side against Iran .
The report by South African Judge Richard Goldstone said the war was “ a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish , humiliate and terrorise a civilian population , radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself and to force upon it an ever - increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability . ”
It recommended that the UN Security Council demand that Israel conduct an investigation into the military ’s conduct , and that it refer the findings to the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) if it fails to do so within six months .
Some 1,400 Palestinians , the majority of them civilians , including 400 women and children were killed , at least 5,000 people injured , and 21,000 homes destroyed , as well as much of the vital infrastructure .
On the Israeli side only 13 people died , several as a result of “ friendly fire . ”
Goldstone also called on countries that are signatories to the 1949 Geneva Conventions to use their “ universal jurisdiction ” to search for and prosecute those responsible for war crimes .
With help from the White House , Netanyahu mounted an international campaign of bullying and intimidation to oppose the report , get the vote deferred until March and ensure that the Security Council — dominated by the US and the European powers that hold the power of veto — does not refer the case to the ICC .
Netanyahu demanded that Mahmoud Abbas , the nominal president of the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) — his term of office expired last January — oppose the report , with threats that he would call off talks with the Palestinians .
In reality , Netanyahu has made it abundantly clear that his government is not interested in reaching any agreement with the Palestinians .
He has refused to freeze settlement construction in the West Bank , and intends to continue building in East Jerusalem .
Just two weeks ago , Foreign Secretary Avigdor Lieberman said in a radio interview that there was no chance of achieving a settlement with the Palestinians any time soon , and anyone who thought otherwise “ does n’t understand the situation and is spreading delusions . ”
Israel also warned Abbas that it would refuse permission for a second cellular telephone company in the West Bank , a crucial issue to the PA and Palestinian commercial interests .
Israel has held up the delivery of essential telecommunications equipment at their ports and failed to deliver the radio frequency as agreed last year .
Without this , Wataniya Telecom , jointly funded by Qatari and Kuwaiti investment funds , which has already made a considerable investment in the project , has threatened to withdraw , forcing the PA to repay an estimated $ 300 million invested in licensing and infrastructure fees and $ 200 million in expenses .
This has precipitated a major crisis for Abbas .
Under intense pressure from Tel Aviv , Washington and Arab governments , he called for a postponement of a vote on the report — weakening his already tenuous position resulting from his subservience to Israel and his support for the repeated assaults on Hamas and Gaza .
According to Lieberman , the PA actually “ pressured Israel to go all the way ” in Operation Cast Lead last December .
Abbas ’s meeting a few weeks ago with President Barack Obama and Netanyahu , despite Israel ’s pointed refusal to halt settlement construction , discredited him even further .
His decision to prostrate himself once again before Israel has set off a chain of events that he is powerless to control .
The Palestinians were furious and came out onto the streets in protest .
Even elements within the PA and Fatah , Abbas ’s own party , spoke out against him in an effort to rescue their own abysmal reputations .
Bassam Khoury , the PA ’s economy minister , resigned and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad felt obliged to say , “ We must n’t give up the opportunity to go after those who committed war crimes during Israel ’s attack on the Gaza Strip . ”
Ahmed Jibril , head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , told Abbas to “ go home , ” and the council of Palestinian organisations in Europe called on him to resign .
Nabil Amr , a former Palestinian ambassador to Egypt and aide to Abbas , also criticised Abbas .
In response , the PA immediately withdrew its security forces protecting his Ramallah home .
A few years ago , Amr was seriously injured in an attempted assassination .
In Hamas - controlled Gaza , people threw shoes , a sign of profound contempt , at hundreds of posters branding Abbas a traitor .
For the first time , an Israeli Arab party , Balad , intervened in internal Palestinian politics and called for Abbas to be sacked .
Syria cancelled an official visit by Abbas to Damascus .
Abbas ’s attempt to backtrack on the vote was met with derision .
Netanyahu also demanded that Israel ’s allies fall in line .
When Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that Britain would abstain in Friday ’s vote , Netanyahu berated him on the telephone .
In the event , both Britain and France did not abstain : they simply absented themselves from the vote .
In an interview with the BBC , British Foreign Secretary David Miliband justified their position by saying that the British and French governments had been “ in the middle of detailed discussions with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel about three key issues — the establishment of an independent inquiry , humanitarian aid to Gaza and the restart of the peace process . ”
“ The vote was called in the middle of those discussions and we thought it right to continue with our work on the three fundamental issues so that could really contribute to a reversal of what is a dangerous spiral of trust and mistrust in the Middle East , ” he said .
The US led a block of just six nations voting against the report on the 47 - member council .
Three of these were east European states dependent upon Washington ’s goodwill .
Twenty - five voted in favour , 11 abstained .
After the vote , Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy wrote a joint letter to Netanyahu proclaiming their recognition of Israel ’s “ right to self - defence , ” but urging Israel to take a more conciliatory stance towards the Palestinians and Gaza so as not to upset relations in the Middle East .
They invited Netanyahu to come to Europe for talks .
They pleaded with Netanyahu to hold “ an independent and transparent investigation of the events in Gaza , whose results were shared with us , ” to “ facilitate increased access to Gaza , ” for a “ halt to settlement activity in occupied territories ” and “ negotiations on the basis of parameters recalled by President Obama in his speech to the UN . ”
Israel ’s destabilising of the PA comes at a time when there are mounting tensions between the Palestinians and Israeli extremists in East Jerusalem .
The PA has accused Israel of seeking to “ Judaise ” East Jerusalem , and of allowing right - wing zealots into the al - Aqsa mosque complex , known as Haram al - Sharif to Muslims and Temple Mount to Jews , while denying access to Muslims .
This was the flashpoint that sparked the Intifada in September 2000 .
Thirty people were injured in fighting between Palestinians and right - wing Israelis at the end of September .
Since then , there have been sporadic clashes as Palestinians feared that Israeli extremists were seeking to enter the complex .
Last Friday , Hamas called for a “ day of rage , ” while Fatah had called for a strike and peaceful protests in support of the mosque .
The Islamic Movement , a political organisation based in Israel , had urged Muslim citizens of Israel to flock to Jerusalem to “ defend al - Aqsa . ”
Israel deployed thousands of extra police and maintained their recent policy of allowing only female worshippers and men over the age of 50 into the mosque area .
While the Old City remained calm with many shops closed , violent clashes broke out between masked Palestinian youths and police in full riot gear in Ras al - Amoud , in East Jerusalem , and at the Qalandia checkpoint near the West Bank city of Ramallah .
Regulatory hearings on Internet traffic management practices held in windowless rooms in Gatineau , Quebec in the middle of summer are not likely candidates to attract much attention .
Yet , as my weekly technology column notes ( Toronto Star version , homepage version ) for seven days this month , hundreds of Canadians listened to webcasts of Internet service providers defend their previously secret practices while engaging in a robust debate on net neutrality .
The interest in the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission hearing may have caught the regulator off - guard ( the webcast traffic was , by a wide margin , its most ever for a hearing ) , but it was the testimony itself that was the greatest source of surprise .
The seven - day hearing was billed as a debate over whether rules are needed to govern ISP network management practices .
While many Internet users remain unaware of the issue , behind the scenes ISPs employ a variety of mechanisms to control the flow of traffic on their networks , with some restricting or throttling the speeds for some applications .
Those practices have proven highly contentious , with creator interests , technology companies , privacy rights organizations , and consumer groups all expressing fears that they may curtail innovation , invade user privacy , stifle competition , and create an uneven playing field for content distribution .
ISPs argue that such measures are essential to provide their subscribers with a good experience at an affordable price .
Days of testimony revealed the issue is far more complicated than the rhetoric might suggest .
First , there is a wide variation in the use of traffic management tools with a different approach for pretty much every major ISP .
Some throttle all the time ( Cogeco ) , some during large chunks of the day ( Bell ) , some only during congested periods ( Shaw ) , and some not at all ( Telus , Videotron ) .
Second , ISP disclosures are woefully inadequate .
For example , Rogers admitted that it charges tiered pricing for faster upload speeds but that all tiers are throttled to the same speed when using peer - to - peer applications .
In other words , subscribers to the Extreme service pay $ 59.99 per month and are promised fast upload speeds ( 1 Mbps ) but actually get the same upload speed as Express subscribers who pay $ 46.99 per month and are promised upload speeds at half that rate .
Third , notwithstanding the perception that network traffic is growing dramatically , the reality is that the rate of growth is actually slowing .
ISPs acknowledged the could cope with the growing demand through reasonable new investment in their networks .
Given all the competing evidence , what is the Commission likely to do ?
A four - pronged approach is possible .
First , it could adopt a test advocated by the Open Internet Coalition , a group of technology companies that includes Google , that permits traffic management practices so long as they further a pressing and substantial objective , are narrowly tailored to the objective , and are the least restrictive means of achieving the objective .
This test would give useful guidance to ISPs and ensure that there are appropriate limits on traffic management practices that have no clear correlation with network congestion .
Second , it can affirm the role of current law against leveraging network management for unfair advantage .
Third , the Commission can establish minimum disclosure requirements including information on traffic management practices such as time , targets , and the actual speeds consumers are likely to experience .
Fourth , it can dictate limits on the use of personal data that ISPs obtain from traffic management .
Alternatively , the Commission could decide to do nothing and simply retain the power to address complaints as they arise .
If so , significant political pushback is likely with political parties lining up in the fall in support of net neutrality legislation .
HAVANA , Cuba ( CNN ) -- Havana is ready and willing to start a dialogue with Washington , Cuban President Raul Castro said in a speech to parliament Saturday , but warned that political and regime change are not up for negotiation .
Raul Castro warns his critics there will not be any upcoming change in Cuba 's political philosophy .
" They did n't elect me president to restore capitalism in Cuba , nor to surrender the revolution , " Castro said to loud applause .
" I was elected to defend , maintain and continue perfecting socialism , not to destroy it . "
He added that those expecting political change after the death of former President Fidel Castro and his generation were " condemned to fail . "
Castro ceded the presidency to his younger brother , Raul , last year but has retained leadership of the Communist Party , the only legal political party in Cuba .
There has been speculation that the elder Castro will step down from that post as well at the next Communist Party Congress .
Fidel Castro , who had run Cuba since 1959 , has not appeared in public since abdominal surgery in 2006 .
Raul Castro's speech was given to a biannual session of the National Assembly and largely focused on Cuba 's economy .
Watch a report on the state of the Communist Party »
Castro called some of the measures taken by the Obama administration " positive , " but said , for Cuba , the main stumbling block remains the U.S. trade embargo , which has been in place in one form or another since 1960 .
Castro also repeated Cuba 's offer to " sustain a respectful dialogue between equals " with the United States .
The Obama administration , on the other hand , has insisted on signs of change from Cuba before he makes any more overtures .

More than 80 % of children under the age of five who have been hospitalised with swine flu had no underlying health problems , according to a Department of Health patient survey .
Almost half of those aged 16 - 44 who needed inpatient treatment for the infection had also been previously healthy , it was revealed today .
The figures underline the vulnerability of the very young and the dangers posed by the H1N1 virus .
The random sample of 192 patients showed that more than one in four patients admitted to hospital had asthma , more than 15 % had heart disease and more than 10 % had diabetes .
The survey was released as the Health Protection Agency reported 14,000 new cases of swine flu in England in the past week , up almost half on the previous week .
The rate of increase , however , has slowed marginally .
The outbreak appears to be more virulent in the north of England .
A total of 286 people are being treated in hospital , up from 218 last week .
The number of people in intensive care has also risen to 36 from 25 in the previous week .
Two more swine flu related deaths occurred last week in England , bringing the UK total to 84 , with 72 in England , nine in Scotland , two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales .
Since the start of term , 79 schools have suffered swine flu outbreaks , including 39 in Yorkshire and the Humber , 12 in the West Midlands and 12 in London .
" There is a steady rate of increase , but there is no sign of the explosive surge you can see in a pandemic , " the chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , said .
" There is still time for that to happen . "
The government hopes to begin vaccinating high - risk groups and frontline health workers against swine flu in the second half of October , depending on when batches of a GlaxoSmithKline vaccine are delivered .
Only children who fall within high risk groups – such as those with asthma or diabetes – are currently prioritised to receive the vaccine .
The number of beds in a specialist unit in Lecister for treating people with severe lung failure will be doubled from five to 10 .
The centre operates a procedure called extra corporeal membrane oxygenation ( Ecmo ) where blood is circulated outside the body and oxygen added artificially .
The Conservative health spokesman , Andrew Lansley , said : " As the government begins to roll out the swine flu vaccination programme for priority groups , the public needs to know [ if ] the government 's advisory committee on vaccines will also recommend [ on ] whether it would be beneficial for the wider population to be given the vaccine as well . "
Ultimately , the Senate passed H.R. 3357 yesterday , a bill that will restore funding to the Highway Trust Fund .
But first there were a slew of typically obstructionist , time - wasting Republican amendments that had to be voted down .
The rejected amendments came from three of the Senate 's most scandalous members , David Diapers Vitter ( R- LA ) , John Ensign ( R - The Family ) and Jeff Sessions ( KKK - AL ) .
The amendments were all defeated along party lines with DLC corporate whores Ben Nelson ( NE ) and Blanche Lincoln ( AR ) spending the day on the Dark Side of the aisle with their ideological soulmates .
In the end , the bill passed 79 - 17 , Nelson and Lincoln crossing back to the Democratic side they so rarely visit these days .
Needless to say , all of what passes for GOP leadership -- McConnell , Kyl , DeMint , Sessions , McCain , Thune -- voted no .
Over half the Republicans left them to stew and voted with the Democrats .
What the bill does is to add $ 7 billion to the Trust Fund , as well as ensuring the continued flow of federal aid to states unable to cover unemployment benefit costs , and bolstering a federal program offering low - interest housing loans -- all 3 of which were in danger of running out of money while Congress is on break .
More than four and a half million people would have been without unemployment benefits nationwide had the GOP been able to sabotage passage .
Conservatives opposed unemployment insurance when it was first proposed in 1932 and they still try to kill the concept whenever they can .
Ironically , unemployment insurance was first proposed by and enacted in the state of Wisconsin and today one of its most vicious enemies is right - wing corporate shill Paul Ryan from southeast Wisconsin .
The highway trust fund , made up of revenue from gasoline taxes brings in around $ 40 billion annually that the federal government spends each year on roads , bridges and transit projects .
With the general downturn in the economy , more fuel efficient vehicles .
and less driving , the fund 's balances have been declining recently and will go into the red sometime next month .
Had the Republicans been able to kill the bill , the result would be that federal payments to states for highway and transit projects , now made on a daily basis , would be strung out and made once a week or twice monthly .
The $ 7 billion would keep the fund solvent through Sept. 30 , the end of this fiscal year .
When the bill that passed yesterday in the Senate was voted on by the House the day before , every single Democrat and more than half the Republicans voted yes .
It passed 363 - 68 .
What kind of irresponsible lunatics voted know ?
Lot 's of Confederate anti-government extremists and fellow travelers in other states .
The Let - America - Fail crowd somehow feels their only shot at returning to power is if the country goes into crisis .
Who are these people ?

Courteney
Cox gives her male fans a reason to tune into her new TV show as she strips off for a sexy bubble bath .
The former Friends star peeled off for last night 's episode of new comedy series Cougar Town as her character Jules Cobb attempted to seduce her toyboy lover .
Looking years younger than her 45 years , Courteney shows off her toned and slim body as she tries to entice twentysomething Josh ( Nick Zano ) into bed .
Jules kicks off her seduction technique by appearing at the door in a tiny orange negligee before they share a romantic bubble bath together .
Wary of dating again after being married so long , Jules finally sleeps with Josh after making him wait 10 dates in the third episode , which was screened in the U.S. on Wednesday .
But she is horrified when he rates her bedroom skills as 6 out of 10 , and promptly throws him out on the street .
The new series , which started in the U.S. last month , stars Cox as a divorced single mother struggling to find love in a small Florida town .
Feeling out of touch , she ends up asking her 17 - year - old son Travis ( Dan Byrd ) for sex tips .
Finding all single men her own age are ' broken , gay or chasing young girls ' , Jules decides to date younger men , hence the title ' Cougar Town ' .
In somewhat questionable casting , the stunning , youthful - looking actress is a world away from the ageing , desperate cougar stereotypes .
When the pilot episode premiered last month , critics gave it mixed reviews , with many querying of Cox 's suitability as a ' cougar ' .
The mention of ‘ vintage lamps ’ usually brings to mind ornate metal lamps with elaborately embroidered shades .
Well , it is time to move on with the ones in this list .

Michael Moore Kills Capitalism With Kool - Aid
A friend recently invited me to a private screening of Michael Moore ’s new film Capitalism : A Love Story .
The September 16th invite not surprisingly leaned a certain direction :
“ [ Michael ]
Moore takes us into the homes of ordinary people whose lives have been turned upside down ; and he goes looking for explanations in Washington , DC and elsewhere .
What he finds are the all - too - familiar symptoms of a love affair gone astray : lies , abuse , betrayal and 14,000 jobs being lost every day .
Capitalism : A Love Story …is Michael Moore ’s ultimate quest to answer the question he ’s posed throughout his illustrious filmmaking career :
Who are we and why do we behave the way that we do ? ”
Considering Moore was going to be there for a Q&A after ( moderated by Arianna Huffington ) , I quickly signed on .
Now before painting a picture of Moore ’s new film let me be honest : my belief set is essentially libertarian ( ‘ Government out of my bedroom and my pocketbook ’ ) .
Not only do government solutions not excite me , they scare the living blank out of me .
Remember when George Bush declared , “ I ’ve abandoned free - market principles to save the free - market system …to make sure the economy does n’t collapse ” ?
He might as well of said , “ Hide your money , kids – ’ cause I ’m coming to take it ! ”
Oh sure , in theory I would like to see everyone with their own homestead , money in their pocket for regular shopping frenzies and no health worries despite eating at Burger King 24/7 , but arriving at those goals is not exactly doable unless government robs Peter to pay Paul and or starts up the printing press .
And that view of course puts me in opposition to Moore since he has no problem with government as his and our father figure .
That is his utopia .
He truly believes warehouses of Washington , DC - based federal workers remotely running our lives is the optimal plan .
He is an unapologetic socialist who really does n’t care why the poor are poor or the rich are rich , he just wants it fixed .
So not surprisingly , and with some generalization as I proffer this , Democrats like Moore and Republicans do n’t .
However , I was excited to see a ‘ mainstream ’ film that was backed by big Hollywood bucks conclude capitalism as ‘ evil . ’
Arguably the most successful documentarian ever , a man who has made untold millions of dollars , was going to legitimately make the case that there was an alternative to capitalism .
I sat down in a packed Mann ’s Bruin Theater in Westwood , CA eager to see how his vision could possibly flesh out .
Moore is a rather simple guy .
He is likable .
He sees the world as good guys ( people with no money ) and bad guys ( people with money ) .
His Flint , Michigan union worker upbringing is his worldview .
If you did not have that upbringing or if your life started less severe than his you are an evil capitalist .
If on the other hand you were a laid off factory worker with a sixth grade education you are the true hero .
I do n’t care one way or the other that he has that view and I am not knocking union workers , but Moore sees the world through a class warfare lens resulting in a certain agenda : force wealth to be spread amongst everyone regardless of effort .
Within minutes it was clear where Capitalism : A Love Story was headed .
The ‘ highlights ’ included :
We listen to heartbreaking stories of foreclosed families across America , but we do n’t learn why the foreclosures happened .
Did these people treat their homes as piggy banks ?
Were there refis on top of refis just to keep buying mall trinkets and other goodies with no respect to risk or logic ?
We do n’t find out .
We meet one family who was just foreclosed on so desperate for money that they were willing to accept $ 1,000 for cleaning out the house that they were just evicted from .
Was it sad ?
Yes .
But , should we end capitalism due to this one family in Peoria , IL ?
We are introduced to a guy whose company is called ‘ Condo Vultures ’ buying and selling foreclosed properties .
Since he acted like a used car salesman , the implication was that he was an evil capitalist .
However , Moore does n’t tell us if his buyers were ‘ working class ’ people making smart buying decisions after prices had dropped .
We listen to Catholic priests who denounce capitalism as an evil to be eradicated .
What they would put in its place and how would the new system work ?
The priests do n’t tell us .
We learn that Wal - Mart bought life insurance policies on many workers .
We are then told to feel outrage when Wal - Mart receives a large payout from an employee death while the families still struggle with bills .
I saw where Moore was heading here , but this was a reason to end capitalism ?
We hear a story from a commercial pilot so low on money that he has to use food stamps .
Moore points out that many pilots are making less than Taco Bell managers and then attributes a recent plane crash in Buffalo to underpaid pilots .
This one crash is extrapolated out as yet another reason to end capitalism .
I was pleasantly surprised at Moore ’s attempt at balance .
For example , he included :
A carpenter , while ply - wooding up a foreclosed home , says , “ If people pay their bills , they do n’t get thrown out . ”
A dressing down of Senator Chris Dodd ( D ) by name .
Moore calling out a top Democrat ?
He sure did .
He nailed him .
A lengthy dissertation on the evils of Goldman Sachs .
He rips Robert Rubin and Hank Paulson big time and I agree with him .
In fact , I said to myself , “ Moore you should have done your whole film on Goldman Sachs ! ”
Throughout the various stories and interviews he also weaves a conspiracy ( all Moore films do this ) .
The plot goes something like this : America won World War II and quickly dominated due to no competition ( Germany and Japan were destroyed ) .
We had great post - war success where everyone lived in union - like equality .
Jobs were plentiful and families were happy .
However , things start to go bad in the 1970s , and Moore uses a snippet of President Carter preaching about greed .
This clip was predictably building to Moore ’s big reason for all problems today : the Reagan revolution .
Moore sees Reagan entering the scene as a shill for corporate banking interests .
However , everyone is happy as the good times roll all the way through into Clinton times .
Moore does take subtle shots at President Clinton , but nails his right hand economic man Larry Summers directly as a primary reason for the banking collapse .
So , while Moore sees Japan and Germany today as socialistic winners where corporations benefit workers more than shareholders , he sees America sinking fast .
So is that it ?
That was the proof that capitalism is an evil to eliminate ?
Essentially , yes , that ’s Moore ’s proof .
What is his solution ?
Tugging on your idealistic heartstrings of course !
Moore ends his film with recently uncovered video of FDR talking to America on January 11 , 1944 .
Looking into the camera a weary FDR proposed what he called a second Bill of Rights – an economic Bill of Rights for all regardless of station , race , or creed that included :
The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation .
The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation .
The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living .
The right of every businessman , large and small , to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad .
The right of every family to a decent home .
The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health .
The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age , sickness , accident , and unemployment .
The right to a good education .
As FDR concluded and the film ended , I was shocked at the reaction .
The theater of 400 + stood and cheered wildly at FDR ’s 1944 proposal .
The questions running through my head were immediate :
How does one legislate words like “ useful ” , “ enough ” , “ recreation ” , “ adequate ” , “ decent ” , and “ good ” ?
Who decides all of this and to what degree ?
At past points in history to voice an opposition opinion in the middle of such a single - minded herd would have certainly been my physical demise !
Interestingly , during the Q&A Huffington and Moore discussed bank failure fears during the fall of 2008 .
They asked for a show of hands of how many people moved money around or attempted to protect against a bank failure .
I had the only hand that went up .
FDR ’s plan hauled out by Moore six decades after it was forgotten reminded me of another interchange – this one from the 1970s .
Then talk show master , the Oprah of his day , Phil Donahue was interviewing free market economist Milton Friedman and wanted to know if Friedman had ever had a moment of doubt about “ capitalism and whether greed ’s a good idea to run on ? ”
Friedman was quick in response , “ … is there some society you know that does n’t run on greed ?
You think Russia does n’t run on greed ?
You think China does n’t run on greed ?
The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests .
The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus .
Einstein did n’t construct his theory under order from a bureaucrat .
Henry Ford did n’t revolutionize the automobile industry that way .
In the only cases in which the masses have escaped from the kind of grinding poverty you ’re talking about , the only cases in recorded history are where they have had capitalism and largely free trade .
If you want to know where the masses are worst off , it ’s exactly in the kinds of societies that depart from that .
So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear : that there is no alternative way so far discovered of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system . ”
Donahue ( and the video of this on YouTube is classic ) then countered saying that capitalism rewards the ability to manipulate the system and not virtue .
Friedman was having none of it , “ And what does reward virtue ?
You think the communist commissar rewards virtue ?
… Do you think American presidents reward virtue ?
Do they choose their appointees on the basis of the virtue of the people appointed or on the basis of their political clout ?
Is it really true that political self - interest is nobler somehow than economic self - interest ?
… Just tell me where in the world you find these angels who are going to organize society for us ? ”
Friedman ’s logic was what I was remembering as a theater full of people cheered wildly for a second Bill of Rights .
How did this film crowd actually think FDR ’s 1944 vision could be executed ?
Frankly , it was clear to me at that moment capitalism was on shaky ground .
Starting with Bush ‘ abandoning ’ capitalism to bailouts for everyone to Obama gifting away the future – we seriously might be past the point of no return toward a socialization of America .
Figuring someone else must see the problems with this film , I started poking around the net for other views .
One critic declared that the value of Capitalism : A Love Story was not in the moviemaking , but in its message that hits you in the gut and makes you angry .
This film did not make me angry , but it did punch me in the gut .
The people in that theater with me were not bad people , including Moore .
They just seem to all have consumed a lethal dose of Kool - Aid !
And at the end of his Q&A Moore pushed the audience to understand that while they do n’t have the money , they do have the vote .
He implored them to use their vote to take money from one group to give it another group .
Did he really say that openly with no ambiguity ?
Yes , sadly .

The rapper , one of the world 's biggest hip - hop acts , faces one year in jail for attempted gun possession after DNA evidence was found to be admissible in court
Lil Wayne faces one year in jail after pleading guilty to gun possession yesterday .
The New Orleans rapper – one of the world 's biggest hip - hop acts – reversed his plea after " problematic " DNA evidence was found to be admissible in court .
The hearing yesterday ( 22 October ) did n't take long .
Beginning at 10 am and lasting just 20 minutes , the session saw Lil Wayne formally accept the district attorney 's plea deal , confirm to the judge he understood the terms , and concede that the type of gun he had illegally possessed was " a .40 - calibre semi-automatic " .
Leaving the New York courtroom in jeans , grey coat and a white T - shirt , Wayne – born Dwayne Carter – asked reporters , " What 's up ? "
What 's up were the charges dating from an incident in July 2007 , the night of Lil Wayne 's first headlining concert in New York .
NYPD pulled over the rapper 's tour bus at about 11:30 pm , at which point a Louis Vuitton bag was allegedly tossed from the bus .
It contained a handgun .
Lil Wayne was arrested that night for criminal possession of a weapon while another man was charged with criminal possession of marijuana .
Until this week Lil Wayne had pleaded not guilty to the charges , but on Tuesday his story changed , after a judge ruled that " miniscule " amounts of DNA found on the gun would be admissible in court .
Lil Wayne 's lawyer , Stacey Richman , described this DNA evidence as " problematic " .
By accepting the plea deal , the rapper has avoided a January 2010 trial where he would have faced up to three and a half years in jail .
Instead , Lil Wayne has pleaded guilty to " attempted " gun possession in the second degree and will be sentenced to one year in prison , the district attorney 's office said .
Assuming good behaviour , the rapper will only serve eight to 10 months .
Formal sentencing will not take place until February , however , and for the moment Lil Wayne is free on bail .
He is thought to have spent yesterday celebrating the first birthday of Dwayne Carter III , his eldest son .
According to lead prosecutor , Joan Illuzzi - Orbon , gun possession can take two forms : " actual possession " or " dominion and control " .
Whereas " actual possession " means someone owns and carries the gun , " dominion and control " means that the weapon is available for immediate use , such as on a tour bus .
" [ In this case ] we said it was dominion and control , " Illuzzi - Orbon told MTV News .
That is , Lil Wayne 's " attempted gun possession " plea is a concession that the gun might not have been in the rapper 's hand , but that it was on the bus and thus within his " control " .
" After ongoing negotiations , [ Lil Wayne ] opted to take the deal to take responsibility for the situation and I think it speaks of him that he's an individual with a strong constitution who took that responsibility , " Richman told reporters .
She said that the .40 - calibre gun had been purchased by the rapper 's manager , Cortez Bryant , who had a permit to carry it in Mississippi .
Lil Wayne is the second major rapper this year to be found guilty on weapons charges .
His past collaborator TI is currently serving a 366 - day sentence for attempting to buy unlicensed machine guns and silencers in 2007 .
Lil Wayne has much to do as he awaits his February court date .
The world is still waiting for his much - delayed " rock " album , Rebirth , as well as Tha Carter IV , his next hip - hop LP .
Both are expected before Christmas .
Then again , Lil Wayne has other legal issues to worry about : he faces trial in Arizona following a separate incident last year , when police found marijuana , cocaine , ecstasy and a handgun aboard the rapper 's tour bus .

Everyone ’s all excited about Portland playing host to Leverage — well , okay , not everyone but you know what I mean .
And , as such , there ’s all of this talk about PDX becoming little Hollywood or Trolleywood or Hippiewood or whatever .
But that ’s just one small segment of the Hollywood experience .
Anyone who knows
Hollywood knows that the real pomp and circumstance takes place on the venerable red carpet .
That ’s right , my friend .
Awards shows .
That ’s where it ’s at .
And guess what ?
Portland ’s got a part of that , too .
No , I ’m serious .
Portland - based Metal Toad Media is the magic behind emmys.com .
I sat down with Joaquin Lippincott and Sam Laroe to talk about their work with the Emmy folks and , basically , why Drupal ?
“ They ’re really pushing to get away from the brochureware , ” said Joaquin .
“ They ’d like to see the site as something that gets used all year long . ”
And Metal Toad has been working hard to get them there .
By incorporating video , adding Twitter streams , and pulling together some Drupal magic to make the sites more interactive .
Why Drupal ?
Well for one thing , Metal Toad is a Drupal shop .
And both Joaquin and Sam were quick to laud the extensibility of the platform and the strength of the Drupal community .
And then of course there ’s the big factor : Drupal was specified in the RFP for the project .
Which is seeming to become more common place for the open source content management system .
Drupal is making more and more appearances as the CMS for mainstream sites , Fast Company , Sony BMG — as in “ Yo Drupal , I ’m really happy for you and I ’m gonna let you finish but Beyonce has the best Website ever ” — and recovery.gov among them .
So it should really come as no surprise that Drupal is getting the call to handle projects like the Emmys site .
And with the burgeoning Portland Drupal community , it should come as no surprise that we ’ve got folks here working on it .
But the real test comes this Sunday .
When hundreds of thousands of users descend upon the site to figure out if HBO won all of the awards or just most of them .
As for you — you award show addict you — just bear in mind that while you ’re sitting there watching those TV stars accept statuettes on Sunday , some Portland folks will be babysitting the servers that are running the Emmys site — and helping the Emmys staff keep the up - to - date as quickly as possible .
And if they pull that off , that ’s an award in and of itself .
In fact , we might need to get a little red carpet of our own .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - Using taxpayer funds to keep out - of - work homeowners in their homes until they find another job is an option being looked at by some officials in the Obama administration , according to people familiar with government financial rescue programs .
At issue is an administration program that is employing $ 50 billion in taxpayer funds from the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program to help lenders modify mortgages for troubled homeowners .
Elizabeth Warren , chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel , which is a TARP watchdog group , and a gaggle of Pennsylvania groups representing troubled homeowners , are pressing the Treasury Department to consider using some federal TARP funds from the modification program to give government bridge loans to people who have recently lost their jobs .
The loans would not accrue interest until their income is restored .
The oversight panel argues in a recent report that the Treasury 's current mortgage modification program focuses its attention on the problem evident early in the financial crisis of people having sub - prime mortgages they can't afford .
Panel member Richard Neiman contends that the second wave of foreclosures is coming that is based more on loss of income and unemployment , as the crisis has emerged .
" The mortgage crisis may have begun with unaffordable sub - prime or exotic loans , but it has expanded to capture an increasing number of homeowners with traditional , prime loans as the recession lingers , " said Neiman .
Job losses rose to 9.8 % in September , driving the unemployment rate to a 26 - year high of 9.8 % .
Since the recession began in December , 2007 , 7.2 million jobs have been lost and the unemployment rate has doubled .
A survey of 44 professional forecasters released by the National Association for Business Economics on Monday found that unemployment is expected to remain high in 2010 .
How it works in Pennsylvania
The proposal to keep out - of - work homeowners in their homes , which was discussed at an oversight panel field hearing last month in Philadelphia , could be based on Pennsylvania 's Homeowners ' Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program .
With HEMAP , which was established in 1984 , Pennsylvania state officials provide a two or three - year loan to a jobless homeowner , depending on the individual 's finances and the economic situation .
Using that program , homeowners are not responsible for repaying the vast majority of the principle or any of the interest on the loan until he or she finds a job .
Specifically , a struggling homeowner participating in the Pennsylvania program , which has depleted resources , requires jobless homeowners pay a token $ 25 a month until they get another job and their gross income surpasses 35 % of their monthly housing costs , including mortgage and utility payments .
In some cases , when the household has some income , the payments would be made partly by the homeowner and partly by the state .
" What we 're recommending to the administration is that they give people this loan until they get back to work , " said John Dodds , director of the Philadelphia Unemployment Project .
" If you do n't deal with the people who lost their jobs , you are missing half of the problem and if these homes go into foreclosure it's bad for the broader economy and bad for neighborhoods , it 's hard to recover . "
According to people familiar with the Obama administration mortgage modification program , officials from the Housing and Urban Development agency have met with Pennsylvania officials responsible for the development of the HEMAP program to discuss whether the state program could be expanded nationally .
The presentation was met with a positive response from the HUD officials , they said .
A federal official familiar with the mortgage modification program said the meeting took place and " a range of options are being discussed to expand the mortgage modification program nationally . "
Meanwhile , Neiman said he plans to discuss the HEMAP program with key Treasury officials as well as HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan .
" I would propose that Treasury consider using TARP funds to fund existing or future state emergency mortgage assistance programs , " Neiman said .
Treasury spokeswoman Meg Reilly said the department continues to study further ways to help unemployed homeowners .
She added that the Treasury has taken " unprecedented steps " to help unemployed Americans , including the provision of 79 weeks of unemployment benefits , an additional $ 25 a week in benefits and a subsidy for COBRA health insurance .
She pointed out that the Treasury 's $ 50 billion modification program , known as the Home Affordable Modification Program , or HAMP , is open to the unemployed .
However , Dodds argues that even though the HAMP program is open to the jobless , it is not being used effectively to help the unemployed .
" It 's a real chaos with the mortgage companies trying to get HAMP going , " Dodds said .
He adds that , unlike the HAMP program , a federal loan approach to the jobless could help a large number of people in a short period of time .
It also solves the concerns of mortgage servicers who complain they will be sued by mortgage securities investors who argue that these lenders will file lawsuits against them for modifying mortgage payments , he said .
Irwin Trauss , attorney at the Philadelphia Legal Assistance Center , said the HEMAP program only provides loans to eligible unemployed , such as those who have lost their job through a layoff .
He said the loans would be a critical bridge for individuals that lose their jobs and are seeking employment , until they find new jobs .
Trauss said he envisioned that the loan could be completed in conjunction with a HAMP modification or on its own .
Congressional legislation
If Treasury chooses not to proceed with a HEMAP - type program , legislation under consideration on Capitol Hill could institute it .
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass. , has proposed a plan to use $ 2 billion of money repaid by TARP bank bailout recipients to fund state programs that provide " emergency mortgage relief payments " for the recently jobless or other struggling homeowners .
The $ 2 billion would go into an " Emergency Homeowners ' Relief Fund , " which would be used for that purpose .
Read the legislation
On the other side of Capitol Hill , Senate Banking subcommittee on Securities and Investment Chairman Jack Reed , D - R.I. , has introduced a similar bill that would allocate $ 6.5 billion to direct states to set up programs , including delayed interest loans , for troubled homeowners that are unemployed .
However , Dodds is hoping Treasury and HUD move forward on such a program right away rather than waiting for Congress to enact legislation .
" By the time 50 states set up 50 programs , we could be too far along into the wave of foreclosures , " Dodds said .

Have you heard the great news ?
The recession is over !
It �s true ; I saw it on TV .
Why fret about growing unemployment lines when banks are paying big - time bonuses again ?
Proof of the turn was apparently revealed by the 2nd quarter GDP figures that showed that the economy declined by only 1 % .
After four consecutive quarters of negative GDP , the green shoots now assume that growth will resume over the summer .
But before we pop the corks , it may be worthwhile to ask , �what really has changed , and what is responsible for our new lease on life ?�
In truth , because of the continued profligacy of the government and Federal Reserve , the imbalances that caused the current recession have actually worsened .
We are now in an even deeper hole than when the crisis began .
Rather than wrapping up a recession , we are actually sinking into a depression .
If things look better now , it �s just because we are in the eye of the storm .
We must remember that recessions inevitably follow periods of artificial growth .
During these booms , malinvestments are made which ultimately must be liquidated during the ensuing busts .
In short , mistakes made during booms are corrected during busts � and in the recent boom we made some real whoppers .
We borrowed and spent too much money , bought goods we couldn�t afford , built houses we couldn�t carry , and developed a service sector economy completely dependent on consumer credit and rising asset prices .
All the while , we allowed our industrial base to crumble and our infrastructure to decay .
In order to lay the foundation for real and lasting recovery , market forces must be allowed to repair the damage .
However , current policy is counterproductive to this end .
Trillions in stimulus dollars have kept the party going , but now what ?
How does deficit spending by the government address the problems that brought about the crash ?
It doesn�t ; it just delays and worsens the hangover � and we have to hope we don�t die of alcohol poisoning .
By interfering with the unpleasant forces of the recession , we simply trade short - term gain for long - term pain .
By propping up inefficient companies that should fail , we deprive more effective companies of the capital they need to grow .
By holding up over - valued asset prices , we prevent the prudent or less well - off from snatching them up and , in doing so , creating a new price equilibrium based upon reality .
By maintaining artificially low interest rates , we discourage the very savings that are so critical to capital formation and future economic growth .
In addition , the false economic signals the Fed sends the market prevent a more efficient re-allocation of resources from taking place and leads to even more bad economic decision being made .
By running such huge deficits , we further crowd - out private enterprise by making it harder for businesses to invest or hire .
The recently passed �cash for clunkers � program ( currently on - hold , as it ran out of funding in one week ) is a perfect example of how government policy can make the economy worse .
By incentivizing Americans to destroy fully paid - for cars so they can go deeper into debt buying brand new ones , the government weakens an already crippled economy .
The last thing we want to do is subsidize Americans to go deeper into debt by buying more stuff .
Don�t they realize that is precisely the behavior that got us into this mess ?
Think about it this way .
If your friend were in trouble because he had too much debt , would you encourage him to take on even more ?
Wouldn�t a real sign of progress be a reduction of debt , even if he had to cut back on his everyday expenses ?
What is true for an individual is also true for a collection of individuals , even if they call themselves a �government . �
If , as a country , we are even deeper into debt now than we were before , we are worse off .
Period .
The fact that the additional debt enabled better short - term GDP numbers is a long - term negative .
Since we have learned nothing from past mistakes , we are condemned to repeat them .
As if we have not already suffered enough as a consequence of the Bush / Greenspan stimulus , Obama / Bernanke are giving ever larger doses , which will prove lethal to any recovery .
The recession is over ; long live the depression !

How many false stories ?
At least five in last month
In its ongoing war with Fox News Channel , the White House has fired one over the bow .
At his press briefing Tuesday , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs was asked about President Obama ’s comment , “ I ’ve got one television station that is entirely devoted to attacking my administration . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ My question : Did he mean to say one television network , or was he informing this opinion , watching one station , a FOX network ? ” the reporter queried .
“ I think the President was clear in what he said , ” Gibbs replied .
“ And I think , based on your question , you understand the answer too . ”
“ How do you respond to criticism that the administration ’s posture towards FOX News constitutes some sort of bullying or chilling of speech ? ” the reporter returned .
“ We get questions throughout the day , seven days a week , about policies here at the White House , questions that you guys want answered , ” Obama ’s spokesman replied .
“ And our goal is to make sure that you have the facts as you do your job .
That ’s what we do for everybody .
“ Well , specifically , the comments by Anita Dunn about FOX not being a real news network ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I have watched many stories on that network that I ’ve found not to be true , ” Gibbs said , then moderated his answer .
“ I think everybody in this room has been likely on the other end of a phone conversation with me when I ’ve had issues with your stories .
I do n’t think that ’s new . ”
One of Fox ’s falsehoods appears above right .
The network has often identified Republican politicians in trouble as Democrats .
Pictured above is former Rep. Mark Foley ( R - FL ) , who engaged in lewd instant message conversations with a young male page .
Other
Fox falsehoods published in the last month alone include :

* Fox recently claimed that the founder of a gay student group was associated with a man-boy love organization .
* Fox made up a deficit claim when reporting on Obama ’s 2009 government budget .
* Fox made up facts about the costs of the Olympics .
* A Fox advertisement lied about the coverage of tea party protests on other television networks .
* Fox ’s Glenn Beck repeatedly lied about Obama policy “ czars . ”
Glenn Beck , Fox News ’ perennial hatchetman , challenged the White House on his show to name anything that was untrue .

Beck recently called President Obama a “ racist , ” sparking advertiser flight .
On his show , Beck installed a red phone for the White House to call him on and told them to “ correct anything on this program . ”
A New Zealand teenager tried to sell some sexy photographs of his mother on an internet auction site after the pair had an argument , a local newspaper reports .
The 18 - year - old student opened an auction for " five naked photos of my Mum " on the Trade Me site after being told to clear the family garage and sell any unwanted items on the site , the Herald on Sunday said .
Trade
Me pulled the auction the next day , but the student , identified only as Michael , was soon back trying to sell a series of eight - year - old " glamour " shots of his mother , including one of her in underwear .
His mother Jennifer , 44 , who did not want the family name published , told the paper she was " pretty annoyed " when she found out about the first set of photographs .
" He was quite naughty ...
I thought you cheeky little git , " she said .
But she was also annoyed that Trade
Me withdrew the second set of pictures , of which she approved .
" I insisted Michael show me first , the little bugger .
They are quite artistic .
There is nothing dodgy about them . "
" I wanted 50 per cent of the sale , but more than that I miss the nice comments . "
Trade
Me spokesman Jon Macdonald said both auctions were withdrawn because of " inappropriate " photos .
" We do n't really want to be the place where people list photos of their mums in their underwear , " he said .

I have been involved in a variety of interviews both at work and as part of the selection process in the town where I live .
Most people are prepared for questions about their background and qualifications .
But , at a whole lot of recent interviews that I have participated in , candidates looked like deer in the headlight when asked the question ( or a variation thereof ) ,
“ Tell me about something that you failed at and what you learned from it ”
A few people turn that question around and try to give themselves a back - handed compliment .
For example , one that I heard today was ,
“ I get very absorbed in things that I do and end up doing an excellent job at them ”
Really , why is this a failure ?
Ca n’t you get a better one ?
Folks , if you plan to go to an interview , please think about this in advance and have a good answer to this one .
In my mind , not being able to answer this question with a “ real failure ” and some “ real learnings ” is a disqualifier .
One thing that I firmly believe is that failure is a necessary by - product of showing initiative in just the same way as bugs are natural by - product of software development .
And , if someone has not made mistakes , then they probably have not shown any initiative .
And if they ca n’t recognize when they have made a mistake , that is scary too .
Finally , I have told people who have been in teams that I managed that it is perfectly fine to make a mistake ; go for it .
So long as it is legal , within company policy and in keeping with generally accepted norms of behavior , I would support them .
So , please feel free to make a mistake and fail , but please , try to be creative and not make the same mistake again and again .

WASHINGTON -- Though President Barack Obama dramatically disclosed the existence of a covert Iranian nuclear enrichment site in front of world leaders Friday , U.S. and some foreign spy services have been watching the site for years .
The underground site near the holy city of Qom is one that the U.S. , Britain and France " have followed for a few years , " said a senior administration official .

SECOND UPDATE : Apparently not .
President Bush has defended himself against allegations that he was personally involved in business practices that are at the heart of the scandal engulfing corporate America .
At a news conference in the White House , Mr Bush denounced criticism of his role as oil company director before he entered the political arena as " old style politics " .
He was speaking after former senior executives of WorldCom refused to testify at a congressional hearing on accounting fraud at the company .
People are going to attack me based on Harken , that 's nothing new
George W Bush
He looked ahead to a speech he is due to make in New York on Tuesday , in which he will give his considered view of what needs to be done to restore investor confidence .
He vowed to " vigorously pursue " executives who broke the law in an effort to restore people 's confidence in American business .
But he began by urging Congress to act quickly to pass legislation providing funds for homeland security and the military campaign against terrorism .
" Further delays are intolerable , " he said .
" Congress must act . "
Suspicions
Mr Bush is at pains to stress his personal investment in fighting corporate dirty dealings , not least because he is not alone in facing doubts about his probity .
His vice president , Dick Cheney , could be in hot water thanks to an investigation into accounting practices at oil firm Halliburton while Mr Cheney was in charge .
And Harvey Pitt , his choice to head the Securities and Exchange Commission - the main market regulator - is under fire from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress for being too close to the brokerages and companies he oversees .
Despite this , Mr Bush gave Mr Pitt his complete support .
" I support Harvey Pitt , " he said , pointing out that in confirmation hearings last year every single senator had voted in favour of his appointment .
" I think that meant that they though he was the right man for the job and I still think he is . "
Watchdog boost
Mr Bush said he believed the vast majority of corporate executives in the US were decent , honourable people , but a few had created the stains of recent months .
He promised to set out a plan to give more funding and more strength to the business watchdog , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .
His plan is likely to be similar to that proposed by Mr Pitt himself and a bill passed by the House of Representatives in April , rather than a harsher , Democrat - backed bill debated in the Senate on Monday .
Mr Bush was also pressed on his failure to disclose share details as director of Harken Energy Corporation .
He said those who were attacking him on this issue were politically motivated .
" People are going to attack me based on Harken , " he said .
" That 's nothing new ...
This is recycled stuff . "
The story had been fully looked into by the SEC and " there 's no case there , " he added .
SAN JOSE , Costa Rica — Dr. Orlando Morales is something of a celebrity at Costa Rica ’s University of Medical Science , sauntering through the halls in his white lab coat .
On a recent walk , students and faculty greeted him with “ Feliz cumpleanos , doctor . ”
He just turned 68 .
With the excitement of a young doctor fresh out of medical school , Morales ’ eyes light up when he observes the petri dishes that harvest “ celulas madre , ” or stem cells , from mice .
“ It ’s practically science fiction , ” Morales said of what he considers the medicine 's new miracle worker .
Morales is one of the firmest believers around in the power of stem cell treatments .
“ After a heart attack , they can begin to make new tissue .
In a gland , which for example has to make insulin , the cells begin to create insulin .
Nervous tissue , they regenerate it …
It ’s a panacea , ” he said .
An increasing number of foreigners are undergoing stem cell treatment in Costa Rica for ailments from bone fractures to multiple sclerosis .
Costa Rican doctors say they are providing these medical tourists with groundbreaking treatments .
But stem cell scientists in the U.S. accuse Costa Rica of offering false hope by pushing techniques that have not been scientifically proven .
Dr. Fabio Solano — who directs the stem cell institute at San Jose ’s CIMA Hospital , one of the country 's leading private hospitals — says his team has treated as many as 400 patients with procedures that involve stem cells .
Costa Rica has eschewed the contentious debate around stem cells by prohibiting work with human embryos and instead promoting research on what 's known as " adult " stem cells — derived from tissue including body fat and umbilical blood or tissue .
In Costa Rica , where Catholicism is the state religion , working with human embryos is out of the question .
Embryonic stem cells are considered a goldmine that could lead to treatment for any number of ailments .
Unlike adult stem cells , embryonic ones can evolve into any of more than 200 cell types .
And yet , Solano said , many " miracle " treatments have been accomlished with adult stem cells .
" We have demonstrated that adult stem cells are as good as embryonic . "
Success stories have grabbed media attention , with TV networks running stories like “ Paralyzed valley woman holds hope in Costa Rica treatment ” and “ Glenburn boy returns from Costa Rica after having adult stem cell therapy . ”
But the buzz has made doctors in the U.S. nervous .
“ The lay press is unfortunately replete with many overstatements and misconceptions about what can be accomplished in the short term by stem cell biology , ” said Dr. Jack Kessler , an expert in stem cell research at Northwestern University ’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago , Ill .
In March , President Barack Obama issued an executive order that lifted Bush - era restrictions on federal funding for stem cell research , but much of the treatment is still a long way off , experts say .
Meanwhile , Costa Rican legislators are putting the finishing touches on a law to promote and regulate adult stem cell research and treatment across a spectrum of diseases .
This could fuel further debate over techniques that U.S. doctors say have only produced anecdotal success — but it certainly wo n't stem the flow of stem cell medical tourism .
According to Solano , Americans already make up close to 90 percent of the stem cell patients at CIMA Hospital .
Kessler warned that clinics around the world are exploiting patients ' hopes by offering treatment that he calls a " placebo effect , " and has n't been proven to work .
“ There 's really little if any evidence at the present time — where we are with the current technology — that stem cell therapies are useful for disorders like spinal cord injury , stroke , Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis and some of the other things that are being treated with stem cells , ” Kessler said .
Determined to prove the experts wrong , Jennifer Blankenship , a 49 - year - old resident of Denver , Colo. , made her second visit to Costa Rica in August to treat MS .
Blankenship had looked around in the U.S. for stem cell treatment but could only find offers from university labs that “ wanted to charge $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 for me to be a guinea pig , ” she said .
Last month she underwent two weeks of treatment at CIMA Hospital for about $ 10,000 .
A December 2008 study by the journal Cell Stem Cell found that international stem cell treatment hovers around an average of $ 20,000 .
Blankenship said that within hours of her first IV injection , “ I started moving my left leg , which I had n’t moved for years . "
Following her second visit , she said , “ I ’m so excited , ” detailing what she described as further progress toward recovery .
Costa Rican doctors conducted liposuction to extract and transplant stem cells from her own fat tissue , as well as transplanted further cells derived from umbilical cords .
Blankenship said she was charged up with some 200 million stem cells .
“ I pictured them like little Pacmen , ” she joked .
After the trip , Blankenship says she took five steps , then nine .
She said : “ In the coming weeks , my physical therapist and I are going to my neurologist ’s office to show him how I can walk . ”
And once she can walk on her own again , she said , “ I ’d love to come to Costa Rica just for fun . ”
If you thought the executives at Goldman Sachs were the kings of backroom finance , think again .
Goldman Sachs , meet Saudi King Abdullah .
A new gambit by the oil - dealing kingdom would have Western oil guzzlers paying for using less oil .
Sounds like the opposite of reality , you say ?
The Saudis say it ’s the only way they ’ll be able to afford helping the fight against global warming .
ADVERTISEMENT
The New York Times frames the Saudi idea as , “ if wealthy countries reduce their oil consumption to combat global warming , they should pay compensation to oil producers . ”
Saudi climate negotiator , Mohammad al - Sabban , described the position as a “ make or break ” measure for the oil - heavy kingdom in the lead - up to global climate negotiations in Copenhagen .
In an email exchange with the times , al - Sabban said wealthy Western countries like the United States should help the Saudis with “ economic diversification ” by paying for oil they do n’t even use .
“ Assisting us as oil - exporting countries in achieving economic diversification is very crucial for us through foreign direct investments , technology transfer , insurance and funding , ” Sabban said in an e-mail .
“ It is a very serious trend that we need to follow and influence if we want to minimize its adverse impacts on our economies and our people , ” Sabban said in another e-mail to OPEC officials .
“ That does not mean we would like to obstruct any progress or that we do not want to join any international agreement .
We will do that if the deal is fair and equitable and does not transfer the burden to us . ”
The Saudi position is n’t new , but the shock over its position in the wake of record high oil prices and a global recession is .
ADVERTISEMENT
Environmentalists say the idea is ludicrous .
“ It is like the tobacco industry asking for compensation for lost revenues as a part of a settlement to address the health risks of smoking , ” Jake Schmidt , the international climate policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council , told the Times .
“ The worst of this racket is that they have held up progress on supporting adaptation funding for the most vulnerable for years because of this demand . ”
BEIJING  Diplomatic officials and rights groups in Britain are waging a campaign to save the life of a British man who has been sentenced to death for drug smuggling by a Chinese court despite apparent signs of mental illness .
If the sentence is carried out , consular officials say , he would be the first British citizen to be executed in China in recent memory .
Although China puts more people to death than all other nations combined , it rarely executes foreigners , who are generally treated more leniently by the criminal justice system .
Family members and associates of the man , Akmal Shaikh , 53 , say he was suffering from psychosis two years ago when he stepped off a plane in northwest China carrying a suitcase packed with nearly nine pounds of heroin .
According to those advocating on his behalf , Mr. Shaikh told the police he had come to China to become a pop star and that he had been handed the suitcase just before boarding the plane in Kyrgyzstan by a man who said he would make him famous .
The man , who promised he would follow on the next flight , never arrived .

When a haggard - looking Hank Paulson , Jr. , then Secretary of the Treasury , assured the American people last fall that the government ’s multibillion - dollar Troubled Asset Relief Program would n’t cost taxpayers a dime , he sounded confident .
“ This is an investment , not an expenditure , and there is no reason to expect this program will cost taxpayers anything , ” he said at the time .
Well , that was then .
Last week Neil Barofsky , one of the leading TARP watchdogs on Capitol Hill ( and a dead ringer for a young Richard Nixon ) , offered a far less rosy assessment of the largest bailout of its kind in American history .
“ It is extremely unlikely that the taxpayer will see a full return on its TARP investment , ” Barofsky testified to the Senate Committee on Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs .
Barofsky ’s thorny review comes as little surprise .
As the bailout ’s one - year anniversary looms , no one on Capitol Hill has put more pressure on the Treasury to beef up its oversight of the labyrinthine , taxpayer - funded TARP and ensure that taxpayer dollars went to good use .
Barofsky ’s official title is Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program ; in Washington argot , simply SIGTARP .
Since being sworn into office in December , Barofsky and his staff of 85 and counting have made life uncomfortable for their fellow tenants at 1801 L Street — the Treasury ’s TARP team — by repeatedly highlighting the department ’s utter lack of bailout oversight and failure to make banks say how they spent their rescue funds .
In congressional testimonies , lengthy quarterly reports , and media interviews , Barofsky has hammered these points home — but to no avail .
“ Really it ’s disappointing , ” he tells Mother Jones .
“ I think the expectation that they ’ve given so far just does n’t cut the mustard . ”
Following the money trail and complex , white - collar investigation are nothing new for Barofsky .
In his previous job , as an assistant US district attorney in New York , he prosecuted 50 leaders of the Columbian militia group FARC on narcotics charges and successfully argued one of the largest accounting fraud cases in history .
Barofsky ’s fraud case , against commodities broker Refco , even brought disgraced CEO Phillip Bennett to tears in the courtroom .
Barofsky also led the Mortgage Fraud investigation arm at the Southern District of New York , diving into the $ 55 trillion credit default swap industry and rooting out large - scale securities fraud .
“ He has the capacity and intellect to dig into things , and to exercise independent judgments .
Which is really lacking [ in the federal government ] in general , ” says Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla. ) , a leading voice on financial transparency in Congress .
The most visible products of Barofsky and the SIGTARP office ’s work are their quarterly TARP reports — equal parts road map and report card , with a refreshing lack of financial jargon and alphabet - soup bailoutspeak .
“ We shoot for readability so that taxpayers and members of Congress and members of the media can all understand the work we ’re doing , ” Barofsky told Mother Jones .
Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , chairman of the influential Finance Committee , calls the reports “ good as gold . ”
The Treasury maintains a somewhat chillier attitude .
The department continues to dodge Barofsky ’s request for increased accountability on the part of bailed - out banks ; only three recipients , AIG , Bank of America , and Citibank , have been required to produce such data , and doing so for the lion ’s share of beneficiaries would be meaningless , the Treasury insists .
( “ If it ’s meaningless for Bank A , ” Barofsky asks , “ why is it not meaningless for these other banks ? ” )
The Treasury ’s representatives also claim that the “ fungible nature of money ” makes it impossible to track the flow of dollars once they ’ve been disbursed — a point Barofsky niftily dismissed by simply asking the 650 or so bailout recipients what they did with their TARP money .
Every single one complied and , he says , “ went out of their way to give accurate responses . ”
SIGTARP posted the letters on its website in mid-August , and plans to analyze the data for an upcoming report .
Not that Barofsky ’s tenure has n’t had its hiccups .
In July , he told Congress that in a worst - case scenario , all of the federal government ’s support rolled together could ultimately cost $ 23.7 trillion — an unimaginably vast sum , larger than the entire US gross domestic product .
The figure threw Washington into a frenzy , with the bombastic Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) waxing biblical with the figure ( “ If you spent a million dollars a day going back to the birth of Christ , that would n’t even come close to just $ 1 trillion — $ 23.7 trillion is a staggering figure ” ) and the media running riot .
Yet some economists stood by Barofsky ’s estimation .
“ I think that number is an important number , ” says Simon Johnson , a professor at MIT ’s Sloan School of Management and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund .
“ It tells you what the range of outcomes are , and what you should suspect with a median outcome . ”
Barofsky , too , defends his figure .
“ The whole point of transparency is to give people the opportunity to make the argument they want to make off those numbers , ” he says .
More puzzling to him was the Treasury ’s public criticism of the figure considering it had ample time to review SIGTARP ’s report before publication and to submit critiques .
“ Some of their comments to the press were very telling , ” he concluded .
“ It shows a general response to this whole transparency project . ”
It also , notes Rep. Grayson , shows why Barofsky ’s SIGTARP is essential .
“ We need somebody like him doing this work , ” he says .
“ There ’s a huge amount of money that ’s sloshing around that needs to be tracked . ”
Keith Olbermann talks to Dan Savage about how dangerous the GOP 's strategy for the last thirty years of pandering to the religious right has been , and how they 're now left with the bat - shit crazy like Michelle Bachmann speaking for them .
Olbermann :
How do they twist the idea of say , just pick a figure out of a hat here that Jesus Christ and the golden rule , taking care of particularly the sick and turn this into opposition to health care ?
In a sense if they ’re trying to emulate Christ , if they ca n’t personally heal disease in passers - by , should they not be willing to help doctors to do so ?
Savage : I ’m sure they do n’t want to hear this from me because I ’m an avowed atheist but my dad was a Roman Catholic deacon and my mom was a minister and I went to the seminary and I was confirmed in the Catholic church .
I ’ve read the Bible backwards and forwards and there ’s a lot in there , a lot that Jesus had to say about taking care of the sick , housing the homeless , feeding the hungry , visiting , not executing the prisoner and nothing about capital gains tax cuts , nothing about denying health care coverage to American families and American children and nothing about this sort of insane opposition to a democratically elected president .
They really have hi-jacked Christianity and are giving it a bad name .
The reason we see spikes I think in more and more people who no longer associate themselves with any religious faith or belief is because now to say you ’re Christian in America means you are saying I am in the same boat , the same bat crap crazy boat with Michelle Bachmann .
And a lot of even nominal Christians do n’t want to say that any more or cultural Christians do n’t want to say that any more .
Olbermann :
Well strip the religion out of it and stick to the ethics of religion which is often very useful even to people who do n’t believe and we do n’t know if anybody who booed the late Senator Kennedy at the Schakowsky town hall belonged to the religious far right , but I mean I got heat for saying that Ronald Reagan is dead and he was a lousy president and I waited for four or five years until after he died to say it that bluntly just out of respect for the dead .
Have n’t the ethics of these folks , the religious and non-religious alike in the opposition just been all over the map ?
Savage :
Well when you have a party that claims to speak for god and claims that god is on its side the rhetoric heats up and the anger heats up .
This is not just a battle about ideas and positions and what ’s good for the country and bad for the country , it ’s a battle about what god wants and what god does n’t want and you ’re , it ’s easier to demagogue about your enemies and despise them than to humanize them in this really personal and vicious way .
I mean , the religious right is fomenting this kind of hatred in this country and at our peril .
I really do think that the Michelle Bachmanns of the world and the Glenn Becks of the world are actively and consciously or subconsciously just trying to get , I ’m just going to say it , trying to get the President killed .
That ’s why they ’re setting this up as a kill or be killed arguments .
He ’s going to kill your grandma , pull the plug on grandma , death panels that little children have to go in front of .
This kind of rhetoric , this paranoid style of the religious right from you know , Birchers to birthers does n’t usually end well and we somebody ’s got to put the brakes on it .
Unfortunately for the Republican party , there are no adults left in the room , there are only the Michelle Bachmanns and the Glenn Becks and the Rush Limbaughs running the show .
" ' She 's just so pretty .
She 's just so ... blond . '
A friend said , ' I heard that Jaycee Dugard story and I thought of your daughter . '
And they say , ' I 'd never do that with my kid : I would n't trust my kid with the street , ' " said Katie , a stay - at - home mother , who asked that her full identity be withheld to protect her children .
Katie , too , is tormented by the abduction monsters embedded in modern parenting .
Yet she wants to encourage her daughter 's independence .
" Somehow , walking to school has become a political act when it's this uncommon , " she said .
" Somebody has to be first . "
If you walk outside and see a naked man running down the street , cock flapping in the wind , you run with that man .
Because there 's some scary shit coming the other way .
Kids are the best , Apu .
You can teach them to hate the things you hate .
And they practically raise themselves , what with the Internet and all .
Via metafilter : a mom , Katie , decides to let her kid walk to school , a move so outrageous that the New York Times is compelled to write an article about it .
Any parent can sympathize :
But what if ... what ?
Be specific , put some thought into this : are you worried your daughter will cross paths with a Bad Man , or are you worried that your daughter is walking into a world where everyone is an opportunist ?
II .
One problem is that we are n't trusting of ourselves as parents .
Perhaps the older generations did n't know or care about their shortcomings , but we do , for sure .
Have we really done our jobs ?
Did we teach them enough about the complexities of human nature ?
It 's easy to say " do n't talk to strangers , " but how do you tell your kid to watch out for his otherwise good teacher ?
How do you tell them not to let a cop drive him home ?
( " Why would you ever tell him that ? "
A : Why would they ever drive him home ? )
It 's easier to hover .
Not a judgment , just an observation .
We probably all imagined that when we had kids of our own , we 'd teach them how to beat down a bully .
Well ?
I know we dreamed about how we'd teach our kids to escape from bad guys .
you ?
Did you teach them how to manipulate their attacker ?
Or did you leave them to the Wii ?
" Well there are just too many other important things - -"
Oh , you taught him French ?
Started him on push - ups early ?
Game theory ?
Kids do n't ask to be chaperoned ; they do n't ask to be forbidden from going " down the creek " and they sure as hell do n't ask for bike helmets .
That 's all chosen by the parents .
So the question really is , why do parents choose to do this ? :
I 'm not saying wefailures as parents ; I 'm saying we arewe are .
We are insecure that we have adequately prepared kids for life .
This insecurity prevents us from letting them experience life .
And thus they are actually unprepared , and thus we were right .
III .
" All this helicopter parenting is going to make kids grow up to be wusses .
" Maybe , but it 's interesting that most people who say this do n't have any kids of their own .
Parents might agree with the sentiment , but they 're still going to buy bike helmets .
Geezers may like telling stories of how they had to walk five miles to school in the snow , but I do n't know any geezers who would let their grandkids do that today .
Do you see that Katie , quoted above , is hiding her identity " to protect her children ? "
The world is much smaller .
Just like it 's easy to imagine calling a guy across the country on a whim , it 's not so crazy to imagine a guy buying a $ 100 LAX to NYC plane ticket for the possibility of free 9 year olds .
IV .
Question : have we squandered the nanoseconds we do spend with our kids by using it to teach themto judge people by how they look ?
Xanax yourself , Caps Lock .
We adultsfrequently judge people based on how they look , right or wrong .
So on the one hand we think we can identify the Bad Men , on the other hand we are aware that we have not taught our kids to do it .
So we have to do itthem .
Have we crippled kids , in the name of equanimity ?
That we do n't believe anyway ?
Maybe such politically incorrect heuristics are precisely what we should be teaching them , precisely because they have nothing else to go by ?
I know that not every 50 year old white man with a mustache is a pedophile .
You know what else I know ?
Run.
Heuristics are short cuts that save you from overthinking .
Sometimes you need handy , explicit rules so that thinking , education , logic , experience , and do n't make you do the wrong thing .
A joke by Dave Attell : " But not all bad men look like bad men ! "
I know , but maybe at least steel the kid againstidentifiable Bad Men ?
" But not everyone who looks bad is Bad ! "
So maybe the kid misses out on the gentle friendship of a mustached IT guy .
Oh well .
He can have a snow cone instead .
V. Our insecurity is not unfounded .
We barely spend real time with them at all , wethe time until they go to bed or college , whichever comes first .
And we 're certainly not anticipating the issues they 'll face in their future .
What did you tell them about the ethics of killing robot hookers ?
We do n't see our kids as total human beings , they are still mostly extensions of ourselves .
Since we 're not sure how well we 've prepared them , AND we fail to see their unique strengths because they did n't come from us , we just do n't know how they 'd react .
Will the kid really not be enticed by a guy with some candy / Playboys / pot ?
If he tries to grab a six year old and she runs , will she know how to get home ?
Or , and I can't believe I 'm writing this , if she 's 15 , will she remember to run ?
We 're not confident in how we 've trained our kids and so we do n't train them , reinforcing our insecurity .
Meanwhile , we do n't see that they 're growing up anyway .
Good point .
We 'd better monitor their internet use , then .
In an ongoing effort to evade malware detection , hackers have started to hide their ' command and control ' instructions in legitimate sites like Twitter and Google Groups -- and with limited fear of being discovered .
Recent Google Groups Trojan
News of a recent attack broke after security specialists at Symantec followed a Trojan horse programmed to visit a private " Google Groups " newsgroup called escape2sun .
After visiting the page , PCs were instructed to download encrypted instructions and software updates for malware .
Experts call these ' command and control ' instructions and are used to communicate with infected PCs and to update malicious software .
On the heels of this discovery , researchers learned that hackers are also hiding messages in RSS feeds that are set up to broadcast as " Twitter Tweets " .
( Source : yahoo.com )
Traditionally , only infected PCs would respond to the ' command and control ' type of instruction found via IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) servers or by hiding commands in obscure websites .
The exodus away from this method and towards legitimate sites comes after the realization that more and more security programs are getting better at uncovering even the most remote websites .
Twitter , Facebook Not Likely Restricted
Restricting access to a malicious remote server is easy enough to do : once the site is blocked , the payload can not be delivered .
However , since the payload is now incorporated into legitimate domains such as Facebook and Twitter , restricting access to these legitimate sites becomes an improbable task .
It appears that Symantec detected the Trojan horse early enough because the prototype malicious script was merely used to gather information needed for future attacks .
While that part may be good news , knowledge that such behavior exists also presents a preview into the disturbing , continuing relationship between hacker and social networking mediums .

President Obama will encounter difficulties wrangling together liberal members of his own party on issues if he abandons the public option , one Democratic congresswoman warned Sunday .
" He 's going to have a real hard time with us , " Rep. Yvette Clarke ( D - N.Y. ) said during an interview on MSNBC when asked if Democrats would " abandon " him .
Clarke said she expects the president to flex some political muscle Wednesday night during a speech to a joint session of Congress , where he 's expected to detail his priorities for healthcare reform .
There have been varying signs about where , if at all , Obama will come down on the public ( or " government - run " ) option , as liberal Democrats have expressed growing dissatisfaction about the president 's handling of healthcare .
Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - N.Y. ) , for instance , has continued to warn against dropping the public option , accusing Obama of not having led members of his own party in support of the controversial provision .
Clarke said the public option is the only plan that would genuinely affect costs .
" The only thing that drives that down is a public option , " she explained .
" In my constituency , they understand what that means , they understand that 's not a government takeover ... it is the one thing we can actually do to bring reform to healthcare . "
Viewers and listeners are rallying around the BBC , according to a Guardian / ICM poll published today .
It shows rising levels of trust in the broadcaster and increased public support for the licence fee .
The results challenge claims that the BBC 's growth has a " chilling " effect on consumer choice , made last month in a speech by James Murdoch , European chief executive of News International .
His comments opened up debate about the future of the corporation , which is protected by its guaranteed licence fee while some other media organisations are facing sharp falls in revenue .
Murdoch criticised what he called the " expansion of state - sponsored journalism " on the BBC 's website , but today 's poll suggests public respect for the BBC 's output is growing .
An overwhelming majority , 77 % , think the BBC is an institution people should be proud of – up from 68 % in an equivalent ICM poll carried out five years ago .
Most , 63 % , also think it provides good value for money – up from 59 % in 2004 .
Since the previous poll the BBC has come under fire for the standards of its journalism , after the Hutton inquiry and during the scandal involving fake phone - in competitions on high - profile programmes and wrongly edited footage of the Queen .
But public confidence in the corporation 's output has grown .
Asked if the BBC is trustworthy , 69 % now say yes , against 60 % in 2004 .
Only 26 % disagree .
Confidence in the BBC has also improved sharply since a Guardian / ICM poll in 2007 .
Then , a majority , 59 % , said their trust in the corporation had fallen in the wake of the much - publicised TV fakery scandals , while only 37 % said it was unchanged .
Now attitudes have reversed .
A majority , 57 % say their trust in the BBC has not faltered while 41 % say it has fallen .
The BBC seems to have overcome criticism of the high salaries paid to some members of staff and stars such as Jonathan Ross .
Only 49 % think the BBC should declare what it pays people , against 50 % who do not .
This show of public support comes during a difficult year for the BBC , in which it has faced concerted criticism from politicians , sections of the national press and rival media companies over levels of executive and talent pay .
The BBC responded in June by revealing the pay and expenses of senior executives , but has been fighting a rearguard action against mounting pressure to publish more details of the pay of top presenters such as Jonathan Ross .
The BBC is also involved in a political tussle over the future of the licence fee .
The government 's Digital Britain report in June recommended that a portion of the licence fee be set aside for funding a replacement for ITV 's regional TV news service and children 's programmes on Channel 4 , a move that the BBC is fighting vigorously to prevent .
Support for the BBC sits alongside strong continued respect for other broadcasters , including Sky , part - owned by News International .
Asked whether they think the BBC is more likely to tell the truth than its rivals , only 38 % agree .
A clear majority of viewers and listeners – 58 % – said they think there is no difference between news on the BBC and other channels .
Those figures are almost identical to results from 2007 .
Most people also question the continued need for the licence fee – although support for it has risen over the last five years .
Asked to pick from a range of ways of funding the BBC , including the licence fee , a subscription service and selling advertising , more people back the licence fee than any alternative .
But supporters remain in the minority .
The fee is backed by 43 % , against 24 % who think advertising should foot the bill and 30 % who think people should pay to subscribe if they want to see BBC programmes .
In 2004 , only 31 % backed the licence fee , 12 points lower than today .
In other areas , opinions are contradictory .
Most people – 81 % – think the BBC should stay impartial in return for its right to raise money .
But there is also public support for Murdoch 's call for the easing of tight restrictions on what broadcasters can say : 61 % agree the BBC and other broadcasters should be free to hold political positions , against 37 % who disagree .
Nor is there any demand for the BBC to ease pressure on commercial rivals by charging for its website .
Only 16 % think this should happen , against 79 % who do not .
However many people think that the BBC has dumbed down since its heyday .
While 57 % think it has gone downmarket , 40 % do not .

Tom Brokaw -- after lecturing us on how ignorant Americans are when it comes to health care reform -- wrongly claims that the public option would cost $ 1 trillion .
Uh , actually a preliminary CBO estimate said the public option would save $ 150 billion .
Yes , save .
The fact is , health care reform without a public option would be more expensive than health care reform with a public option .
( And as a nice little bonus , a smaller proportion of the money would go to the private health insurance companies that created the health care mess int he first place . )

An ex-nightclub bouncer has been jailed for 25 years for trying to murder his heavily pregnant partner and attempting to destroy their unborn baby .
Simon Morris , 37 , had been having an affair and would have inherited money from Nerys Price 's will , Mold Crown Court was told .
The prosecution said he had made the attack look like burglary gone wrong .
He denied trying to kill Ms Price , also 37 , as she slept beside him at their home in Prestatyn , Denbighshire .
Jailing Morris for 25 years for the attempted murder and a further 25 years for the attempted destruction of his daughter , to be served concurrently , Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said he had committed a " shocking " crime .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The jury have convicted you on the basis of compelling evidence , " he said .
" To have tried to kill your partner within just a few weeks of her giving birth is , in my opinion , quite a shocking and aggravating feature .
" It was a wicked and callous attempt to rid yourself of a partner who was willing to have your child and who had done nothing but give you love and affection . "
The trial heard Morris hit Ms Price twice on the head with the sharp end of a bricklayer 's hammer when she was 38 weeks pregnant with his child .
Prosecutor Patrick Harrington QC said Morris then made it look as if an intruder had been responsible , but a random burglar would have nothing to gain and everything to lose from attacking a heavily pregnant woman .
Nerys Price was 38 weeks pregnant when Simon Morris attacked her
Disbelief of attack victim
When Ms Price woke up she asked Morris to call the police but remembered seeing sevens and nines on his phone as he tried to to dial 999 , she told the jury .
" It appeared that he was trying to ring the police but was clearly missing the numbers , " she said .
Skull fractures
After contacting the emergency services herself , she was taken to hospital where she later gave birth by emergency caesarean section to her daughter Freya .
She was treated for two skull fractures and underwent emergency surgery .
Both have since made a full recovery .
Ms Price , who now lives in Ruthin , Denbighshire , also told the court how , on her release from hospital , she began having doubts about Morris 's " peculiar behaviour " .
He was arrested eight days after the attack on 23 August , 2008 .
In the run-up to the attack he was " the driving force " behind the couple changing their wills , the court heard .
Ms Price 's death would have initially made him the sole beneficiary of £ 145,000 from her " death in service " insurance policy , and in total he would have landed hundreds of thousands of pounds .
Nerys
Price thought he was her loving , doting boyfriend and father of her unborn child
Patrick Harrington QC
Mr Harrington said Morris had also begun a new relationship with another woman , Kate Christian , a mother - of - two , of Tremeirchion , Denbighshire .
The prosecutor told the court Morris had met Ms Christian at a bar in St Asaph , several months before the attack and was planning to use the money he inherited to start a new life with her .
" Nerys Price thought he was her loving , doting boyfriend and father of her unborn child , " said Mr Harrington .
" For his own wicked reasons he had determined to kill her . "
Bowed head Morris admitted betraying Ms Price but said it did not make him capable of wanting to kill her and their unborn child .
His barrister Nick Johnson QC told the court Morris 's " greatest sin " was the fact he deceived Ms Price , and said it had made him an " easy target " for police .
The defence said a possible explanation for the break - in was intruders wanted the keys to Morris 's £ 16,000 American Chevrolet Corvette .
After the case , Morris 's family said they would fight to clear his name , attacked the police investigation and claimed the real culprit was free .
We stand by him and stand by his innocence ... he has been set up
Jonathon Morris , brother of Simon Morris " For Simon , obviously , we stand by him and stand by his innocence .
He has been set up , " said his brother Jonathon .
" The real offender should have been here today and found guilty , not Simon . "
His father David Morris said Morris had been excited at the impending birth of the baby and would never have done anything to harm Ms Price .
He had originally been tried in May , but the jury failed to reach a verdict and a retrial was ordered .
This second trial ended with a jury of eight men and four women finding him guilty .
Morris bowed his head as the jury returned unanimous verdicts following almost six hours of deliberations .
He looked to the floor , shaking his head , as he was sent down .

Sebastian Vettel is hopeful that topping the timesheets in Friday practice for the Singapore Grand Prix is a sign that Red Bull Racing is back on form after scoring only one point in the last race at Monza .
The 22 - year - old believes that , although it is difficult to make any definitive conclusions about the relative pace of the car after today 's running , the team is stronger here than it was in the Italian Grand Prix .
" It definitely looks better than Monza , so I 'm more optimistic , " said Vettel when asked by AUTOSPORT if he believed the team could fight for victory .
" But on Friday it 's always difficult to say how quick you are and here it 's more difficult because people catch a lot of traffic .
I have n't seen the laptimes , so we will sit down tonight and see , but it seems better than the last race . "
Vettel added that he was happy with the balance of his Red Bull RB5 , which allowed him the confidence to push hard on the twisty Marina Bay track .
" You can't really have a perfect car here , " said Vettel .
" It 's always a compromise because there are so many bumps and it's quite a rough circuit .
" The speed might not be so high , but it 's challenging and you 're fighting your car , but if you have a good feeling and the confidence then you can push .
I feel quite comfortable . "
Vettel lies 26 points behind championship leader Jenson Button with just 40 to play for , but insists that he has not given up on winning the title and will go all - out for victories .
" I wish we had 10 races to go , but we do n't , " said Vettel .
" We will just try to get the maximum out of these four races and whatever happens , happens .
" It 's maximum attack ! "

Good article , which basically says our policies are based more on fear than on reality .
On cyber -terrorism :
So why is there so much concern about “ cyber- terrorism ” ?
Answering a question with a question : who frames the debate ?
Much of the data are gathered by ultra-secretive government agencies — which need to justify their own existence — and cyber - security companies — which derive commercial benefits from popular anxiety .
Journalists do not help .
Gloomy scenarios and speculations about cyber - Armaggedon draw attention , even if they are relatively short on facts .
Politicians , too , deserve some blame , as they are usually quick to draw parallels between cyber - terrorism and conventional terrorism — often for geopolitical convenience — while glossing over the vast differences that make military metaphors inappropriate .
In particular , cyber - terrorism is anonymous , decentralized , and even more detached than ordinary terrorism from physical locations .
Cyber - terrorists do not need to hide in caves or failed states ; “ cyber - squads ” typically reside in multiple geographic locations , which tend to be urban and well - connected to the global communications grid .
Some might still argue that state sponsorship ( or mere toleration ) of cyber - terrorism could be treated as casus belli , but we are yet to see a significant instance of cyber - terrorists colluding with governments .
All of this makes talk of large - scale retaliation impractical , if not irresponsible , but also understandable if one is trying to attract attention .
Much of the cyber - security problem , then , seems to be exaggerated : the economy is not about to be brought down , data and networks can be secured , and terrorists do not have the upper hand .

The Ferrari team has announced that Luca Marmorini will replace Gilles Simon as head of the engine and electronics department .
Marmorini returns to Ferrari after having worked for Toyota for ten years .
The 48 - year - old Italian left the Japanese squad in January this year .
He had worked for Ferrari in the 1990s .
" Ferrari wishes to thank Gilles Simon for the important contribution he made during his time with the Gestione Sportiva , first , from 1994 to 2006 as head of Engine Design and then as head of the whole Engine Department , " the team said in a statement .
" During that time , the V10 and V8 engines built at Maranello won six Drivers ' World Championship titles and eight Constructors ' , as well as taking 106 Formula 1 race wins . "
L’altra sera all ’Infedele hanno detto una cosa che nessuno aveva mai osato : ovvero che secondo loro ( secondo loro , sia chiaro , eh ) Antonio Ricci è l’autore della perpetuazione televisiva della vecchia identità italiana da strapaese maschilista , riconfezionata e occultata da pretese di “ ironia ” a cui non crede nemmeno lo stesso Ricci .
Ora vediamo se Staffelli si trasferirà davanti a casa Lerner , o se Ricci in un colpo di genio andrà da Lerner a difendere di persona il mostro peninsulare che ha creato .
update : mi dicono la prima , per ora con servizio contro Lerner .
Siccome Ricci è intelligente , a me piacerebbe che una volta ne parlasse nel merito , della questione .
Anche rivendicando di fare quello che gli pare , e non rompete , se vuole : ma controaccusare l’accusatore è un po ’ noioso , lo lasci fare ai politici che sfotte .
Cable giant Comcast Corp. is kicking the tires of NBC Universal , according to people familiar with the situation .
Comcast , the nation 's largest cable operator with almost 25 million subscribers , has been looking to increase its content holdings for several years .
In NBC Universal it would get its hands on not only a big broadcast network and movie studio , but also several powerful cable channels , including USA , Syfy , CNBC , MSNBC and Bravo .
NBC parent General Electric has often denied that it is interested in selling its entertainment holdings .
Of course , if history is any guide , Comcast does n't necessarily wait for an invitation before making a play .
Five years ago it made an unsuccessful run to buy Walt Disney Co. for $ 54 billion .
The price tag for NBC Universal would be substantially less than that .
A recent analyst report from J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa valued NBC Universal at $ 30 billion to $ 35 billion .
However , such a deal would likely be very complex because there would be huge tax implications for NBC Universal parent General Electric , which first bought NBC in 1986 for $ 6.5 billion .
That is still a pretty steep price tag for Comcast to swallow .
The cable giant has a market cap of $ 48 billion and about $ 4 billion in cash so if it were to buy all of NBC Universal , it would be a highly leveraged transaction .
Speculation that GE may be looking to unload NBC Universal has heated up as of late in part because the French conglomerate Vivendi , which holds a 20 % stake in the entertainment unit , may look to unload its interest before the end of the year .
There have been questions raised as to whether GE -- which has first dibs on the Vivendi interest -- could muster the $ 4 billion - $ 5 billion needed to buy back the stake or whether another company such as cash - rich Time Warner or Comcast would step in and buy it .
Whether Comcast is making a serious run at all of NBC Universal outright or just in acquiring a stake in the company or forming a joint - venture remains to be seen .
In a statement , Comcast denied a report from industry website The Wrap that it had a deal to buy NBC Universal , but it declined to elaborate on any other talks it may be having with NBC Universal .
A spokeswoman for NBC Universal declined to comment .
For Comcast , getting all or some of NBC Universal would give it programming assets to match its distribution clout .
It currently only owns a handful cable networks including E! Entertainment Television , Versus , the Golf Channel , G4 and 10 regional sports networks .
None of its cable networks have the commercial success of NBC 's assets .
While NBC has lots of assets , many of its entertainment holdings are struggling .
Its Universal Studios is in a slump at the box office and its management the NBC network is mired in fourth place in both viewers and demographics .
It 's big gamble this fall , putting Jay Leno on in prime time , has not delivered big ratings yet although it may prove to be a smart financial gamble .
In the first half of 2009 , NBC Universal made $ 1.6 billion on revenues of $ 7.5 billion .
Its revenue accounts for less than 10 % of General Electric Co. 's total revenue .

The White House can be one of the loneliest places in the world .
Just look at the physical deterioration some have suffered during their years in office .
If you do not want more gray hair , be prepared for a dye job .
Most presidents leave Washington with , at best , mixed feelings toward the place and many with whom they 've worked -- especially the press .
Perhaps that is why they choose never to live there again after leaving office and visit infrequently .
John F. Kennedy once called Washington a city of " Southern efficiency and Northern charm . "
Harry Truman famously said that if you want a friend in Washington , " Get a dog . "
Forget your privacy :
You are a public servant
Sorry , Mr. President , but when you go into the White House , you had better know that you live in a fishbowl with few hiding places .
You are public property .
Do n't go into public life if you want a private life .
And never forget you are not the boss .
You work for the people .
Lyndon Johnson might have been joking , but one day on the South Lawn his outsized ego got away from him .
As a phalanx of helicopters assembled to transport his entourage , someone asked , " Mr. President , which helicopter is yours ? "
" Son , they 're all mine , " Johnson replied .
Presidents are so shielded from the normal routines of life that they might be forgiven for thinking they are somehow protected from everything .
The psychological impact of isolation , despite constant scrutiny , is one for the medical experts to figure out .
But it is often humorous to watch them wrestle with their surreal circumstances .
Living in their protective bubble as they do , presidents can be forgiven for losing touch with how normal people live .
But often their zeal for personal privacy contributes to their own isolation .
You are not perfect , Mr. President .
So do n't pretend that you are and hide the bad stuff .
If you are still smoking , say so directly , and openly share your struggle with the public .
Protecting your privacy can come at a greater cost than simply revealing what you do n't want the public to know .
If it is found out -- and it probably will be -- you not only have the fallout from the exposure to deal with , but you will also be accused of deceit .
Open up :
The people have a right to know
Presidents usually come into office vowing to conduct the most open administration in history .
In the White House pressroom , we tend to snicker at such promises .
They are not kept .
The openness or secrecy of an administration depends on the president .
It is your job , Mr. President , to set the tone and lay down the rules for how your White House staff views the public 's right to the truth .
There are many avenues for a president to get the message out -- through the news media , addresses to the nation and going on the stump .
You will regret using those methods to avoid tough questions , distort the truth or try to spin away your problems .
It might take a while , but the public will one day catch on .
Although most presidential press secretaries would like to shut the door on reporters , only one , George Stephanopoulos , literally did so .
Early in Bill Clinton 's administration , he had the door to his staff area closed , apparently not understanding how important this access was to us .
After much griping from the press corps , Stephanopoulos relented .
He explained why in his book , " All Too Human . "
" Helen Thomas led the charge , " Stephanopoulos wrote .
" For more than 30 years she had started her day a little before 7 a .m. by planting herself outside the press secretary 's office and asking him a question as he walked through the door .
" Now she could n't do that anymore .
With a voice that sounded then like the Wicked Witch of the West's , she went on the attack .
...
Helen was letting me know who was really in charge .
I may have been working for the new president , but she was part of the institutional presidency .
She could wait us out , and she intended to win . "
Have courage : Even if it hurts
The theme of your campaign was summed up by the title of one of your books , " The Audacity of Hope . "
You 've given us hope , Mr. President .
Now show us the audacity .
In Afghanistan , Mr. President , you risk repeating Lyndon Johnson 's disastrous escalation of the Vietnam War after listening too much to the generals .
Again , the Pentagon wants more troops for a tricky war , vowing success in Afghanistan if you only agree .
That 's what the British and the Russians thought before they utterly failed to subdue their foes in Afghanistan 's difficult terrain .
Have courage to resist such pleas if your instincts say otherwise , Mr. President .
That is why the founders of our nation put a civil servant in charge of the military .
You are the decision - maker , not the follower .
Remember , the generals work for you .
Think about how Harry Truman once proved the point .
He had just fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur for publicly disagreeing with his policy against expanding the Korean War into China .
Truman elaborated on the decision for reporters in his typically blunt fashion :
" I fired him because he would n't respect the authority of the president .
I did n't fire him because he was a dumb son - of - a- bitch , although he was , but that 's not against the law for generals .
If it was , half to three - quarters of them would be in jail . "
Give us vision :
It 's your legacy
A good president , wrote 19th century historian Henry Adams , " resembles the commander of a ship at sea .
He must have a helm to grasp , a course to steer , a port to seek . "
The port you seek , Mr. President , is your vision .
Those who take this lightly do so at their peril .
But even the most inspirational vision is just talk if not combined with action .
Now is the time to fill in the blanks , Mr. President .
The excitement and newness of your presidency has worn off .
Turn your vision into reality .
Show us that you can deliver results .

Developing Games for Android
By Derek James
The advent of smartphones has opened up an entire new range of platforms for game development , particularly for independent game developers .
The iPhone 's App Store model has been enormously successful , with a recent estimate of $ 2.4 billion in annual sales .
From a developer 's perspective , app stores have the incentive of a distribution channel with powerful search and marketing capabilities .
They also provide an intermediary that handles the logistics of selling and downloading -- generally for a cut of 30 % .
You 've probably heard the Cinderella stories of developers like Steve Demeter , whose triangular variant on match - 3 games , Trism , reportedly earned him $ 250,000 in just two months in the iPhone App Store .
Take also Ethan Nicholas ' iShoot , which reportedly earned $ 600,000 in a single month .
With the gold rush mentality and the iPhone 's undeniable success with the App Store , why would a game developer choose to make a game for any other smartphone platform ?
About six months ago , I started developing games for Google 's Android OS , somewhat by chance .
A friend who works for Google gave me a G1 developer 's phone as a gift .
At that point , I had n't even heard of Android .
In the process of learning about the OS , I came across the Android SDK , and downloaded it to give it a spin .
I was instantly hooked .
While iPhone apps are written in Objective C , the Android SDK uses relatively more programmer - friendly Java .
The iPhone store charges developers $ 99 a year to distribute their apps , while Android has a one - time $ 25 fee for developers .
And the review process for iPhone apps grows increasingly lengthy -- sometimes weeks or more -- and it 's somewhat arcane .
Android apps go live as soon as the developer hits the publish button .
Google handles the review process post - hoc , and is much more lax in terms of content .
With the greater ease of producing and distributing apps through the Android Market , why are n't game developers large and small clambering to produce quality games for the system ?
There are a number of reasons , but number one is , of course , money .
Mobile ad company AdMob released its July 2009 report ( pdf ) which notes the following :
45 million estimated combined iPhone and iPod Touch users , compared to 3 million Android users
50 % of iPhone users bought at least one paid app during a month period , compared to 19 % of Android users
The estimated market value of the iPhone App Store is about $ 200 M per month , compared to an estimate of about $ 5 M per month for the Android Market
So a major part of the equation is pure size .
But another factor is the population makeup of Android users and their perception of the platform .
The iPhone user population is likely much more diverse , with a greater cross-section of users representing more diverse demographics , while the Android user population is still likely predominantly tech - centric early adopters .
Since Android is an open - source system , the perception may also be that the software that runs it should follow the same model .
Thus many users may be reticent to spend money on apps .
Of course , the hope among Android game developers is that an influx of new phones on a variety of new carriers will increase and diversify the user base , increasing sales .
However , current reports are gloomy .
One case study is Larva Labs , a New York based mobile game developer .
Larva recently shared its sales stats for August , and they were n't pretty .
Despite having two games in the market that both spent time in the top 10 among paid apps in their categories , the daily average income for August was $ 62.39 .
The developer laments issues with the market interface ( poor organization and search ) and a lax return policy ( 24 - 48 hour returns , no questions asked ) .
But the issue of piracy is also raised , and is another likely source of poor performance of games in the Android Market .
A cursory search of popular torrent sites reveals bundles of Android games for download .
The next release of Android is bringing much needed revisions to the market interface .
As for piracy , as with any game market , it is difficult to determine the impact .
The Android Market includes optional DRM , but it is unlikely to slow or deter would - be pirates .
Unlike the iPhone , an Android device does not need to be jailbroken in order to allow installation of pirated apps .
A user can simply install pirated apps onto their SD card and use one of the freely - available app installers from the market .
The return policy even allows a would - be pirate to download an app , make a copy , and then get a full refund .
They do n't even have to pay for the original copy they pirate !
One viable way to mitigate the effects of piracy is to monetize apps through advertising , rather than relying on direct sales .
About half of the revenue from my games has come from ads as opposed to direct sales .
Despite the seemingly poor state of the Android market , the Larva Labs developers remain upbeat about the potential .
The mobile analytics company Flurry notes the growth of new Android projects next to the relative decline of new iPhone ones .
The AdMob market report mentioned earlier also notes that ad requests from Android have now edged out requests from Windows Mobile , both internationally and domestically .
While iPhone is still the king of the hill , Android is pushing its way into the market .
There are currently only two handsets that run Android available in the U.S. : the T - Mobile G1 ( aka HTC Dream ) and the T - Mobile myTouch ( aka HTC Magic ) .
The G1 has a hardware keyboard , while the myTouch does not .
Other than that , both devices have the same screen size , and so far cross - device development is still pretty straightforward .
I 've heard that both HTC and T - Mobile are pleased with the sales performance of both devices , though I 'm not aware of hard figures .
Based on analytics from my own apps , about 20 % of my existing user base own the myTouch .
The good news : a spate of new devices are on the way .
Motorola just unveiled its Android - powered Cliq , which will soon be available through T - Mobile .
Another Motorola phone announcement is expected soon .
Earlier this year , the estimate was that 18 - 20 Android - powered devices would be released by the end of the year .
That remains to be seen , but there it is extremely likely that by the holiday season there will be at least half a dozen Android smartphones , probably on multiple carriers .
Things could get very interesting with this new wave of devices .
The myTouch alone has n't changed the game , but the incremental influx of new hardware , especially with the openness and customizability of Android , and choice of carrier , could start to see Android carving out a significant portion of the market .
On the one hand , that seems like good news to Android developers .
An increase in the market can only be good , right ?
Well , an open issue is one of device compatibility .
The current HTC devices have a trackball , while other devices may or may not , opting for a touchpad or alternative input device .
Another issue is screen resolution .
The current devices all have a 3.2 inch screen with a resolution of 480x320 , but newer devices may have resolutions that are smaller or larger ( e.g. there are already tablet PCs running Android slated for release ) .
In terms of RAM and processing power , there are not significant differences in the devices rolled out thus far .
Although continued improvements and custom builds of Android can get the most out of existing specs , the newer generation of Android smartphones -- those poised to be released by the end of this year -- should have more RAM and more powerful chipsets .
So building more CPU - intensive games for the platform will only get easier , but the decision to do so may become more difficult .
One advantage of programming for the iPhone is not having to worry ( much ) about hardware compatibility .
This could potentially be a problem for Android game developers as new handsets emerge .
The possibility of a backlash exists if users buy a new Android smartphone only to find that the most popular games in the market do n't render properly on their screen , or that the control scheme for the game does n't work .
A developer can try to work their way around these issues by designing for multiple screen resolutions and including multiple input methods , but this of course means extra work .
Other issues include the limitations of the first - generation hardware that 's currently running Android .
Specifically , battery life and storage space are both big issues on the G1 , and games can tend to hog both , especially the more features they use .
I just finished a game for the second iteration of the Android Developers Challenge -- more on that in a moment -- and it uses the GPS functionality of the device .
Unfortunately , the GPS finder is a huge drain on the battery .
As for storage space , the G1 only has 70 MB of storage allocated for apps .
That means designing lean games in terms of music and art assets , since users may not want to delete a bunch of existing apps to make way for your 10 MB masterpiece .
The newer generation devices have several times the capacity , so in a sense these problems are being resolved as new hardware rolls off the shelves .
But the limitations are in place for most of the current generation of users and developers .
Likely because Google is behind the curve in the smartphone game , it has instituted a strategy designed to lure developers to the platform with the promise of cash -- not in the form of market profit , but in prize money .
Last year Google held an open contest for the best apps , the Android Developer Challenge , a free - for - all in which candidate apps were selected by a panel of judges .
This year , it kicked off the Android Developer Challenge II , with $ 2 M in prizes .
Rather than lumping all entries into one bin , ADC II is divided into 10 categories , including two for games ( Casual / Puzzle and Arcade / Action ) .
The deadline for submissions closed on August 31st , and winners are to be decided by two rounds of judging : one by users and one by a panel of judges .
However ,
If you had n't heard of the challenge , you 're probably not alone .
Google did n't do much to spread the word , probably assuming that the lure of large cash prizes would carry the news effectively .
With the overall winner set to take home $ 250,000 , the strategy seems sound .
But the jury is out on whether or not the ADC II has been effective in drawing game developers to the platform .
The first contest had about 1,700 entrants , but no numbers on the second challenge have been released as of this writing .
I spent the summer working on an entrant into the ADC II , a puzzle / RPG hybrid along the lines of Puzzle Quest , with the twist that the player must physically visit locations near them , such as coffee shops and grocery stores , in order to unlock content .
Developing the game presented some unique challenges , learning how to incorporate the Google Map API , for example .
And some aspects of development still need a lot of work .
For example , the functionality for playing sounds and music is extremely limited and has been historically buggy .
However , overall the experience was very rewarding , and grassroots developer communities provided answers to nearly every issue I encountered .
In particular , the sites anddev.org and the Android Developers Google Group have been helpful .
Still , there are existing issues that are problematic for the platform .
There are quite a few games for the iPhone that utilize an underlying physics engine , but I 'm currently not aware of any games for Android that are physics - based .
Ports of some existing 2D engines to Android have apparently not performed well enough to use them for games .
Again , as with the other issues related to developing on first - generation hardware , newer devices will probably render them obsolete .
For now , if a developer decides to implement a game exclusively for a particular smartphone platform , and the choice is between the iPhone and Android , the tradeoff is between trying to get noticed in an incredibly crowded and competitive market where the potential payoff is huge for those at the top , or entering a market with low barriers , little competition , currently low returns , but the possibility of potential growth .
Hopefully there will continue to be developers that take both roads , and the smartphone market will continue to grow as a diverse outlet for game development .

' Inside the Mind of Mark Foley ' : Disgraced Congressman Turned Talk Radio Host Brought down by sexually explicit emails to underage pages , he tapes first show .
Sept. 9 , 2009  --
Nearly three years after then - Congressman Mark Foley , R-FLA , saw his political career crumble following the revelation of his sexually explicit emails with underage congressional pages , he 's garnering the spotlight once again : as a radio talk show host .
Foley , who resigned after ABC News '
The Blotter broke the story before going to rehab in Arizona , is set to debut his radio show entitled " Inside the Mind of Mark Foley " on Sept. 22 on West Palm Beach radio station WSVU 960am .
" You 're going to be amazed , " said WSVU spokesman Joseph Raineri of Foley .
Raineri said that " with everything that 's going on with healthcare and everybody questioning what 's happening in Washington , DC , we thought who better to explain what 's going on than Mark Foley . "
In between the musical stylings of Frank Sinatra , Barry Manilow and Barbara Streisand , Foley 's show will discuss , Rainier said , " the inner workings of DC and how things are being decided and what the process is . "
He said the sexually explicit emails that brought Foley down are " not really for us to comment on " and that " as far as what he did with his personal life , that 's not for us to say . "
When the page scandal broke , Foley was the chairman of the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children .
He resigned hours after ABC News questioned him about the instant messages with former congressional pages , some of whom were under the age of 18 at the time of the exchanges .
Officials in Florida announced a year ago that Foley would not face criminal charges because of " insufficient evidence . "
Foley Show Debuts Sept. 22
Foley taped the first half of his one - hour premiere on Tuesday , which will be presented as a conversational , ' Meet the Press ' style show , Rainier said , with Foley talking with the station 's general manager .
The show 's full schedule will be announced the week of the premiere , said WSVU , which describes itself as an " Adult Standards music station catering to an older audience that is concerned with the current healthcare issue . "

President Obama yesterday nominated Assistant Minneapolis Police Chief Sharon Lubinski for U.S. Marshal .
If she is selected , Lubinski would be the first openly gay U.S. Marshal in the country and one of two active female Marshals of 94 serving across the country , and the first female to serve in Minnesota .
Said Obama : " Assistant Chief Lubinski has dedicated her career to the noble cause of protecting her fellow Americans .
She has displayed exceptional courage in the pursuit of justice , and I am honored to nominate her today to continue her selfless work as a U.S. Marshal for the District of Minnesota . "
In a press release , the White House noted Lubinski's background : " She has served in the Minneapolis Police Department for 20 years , 10 of those years in command positions .
Prior to joining the Minneapolis Police Department , she spent eight years with the Dane County Sheriff ’s Department in Madison , Wisconsin .
She is currently a member of the community faculty at Metropolitan State University School of Criminal Justice .
Lubinski earned her Bachelor ’s degree from the University of Wisconsin - Madison , and a Master ’s from Hamline University , where she is also currently pursuing a doctoral degree in Public Administration . "
Lubinski said she would be honored to serve : " During my 30 - year career , I ’ve actively partnered with federal law enforcement agencies in many different capacities , ” Lubinski said in a statement .
“ The U.S. Marshal has a uniquely important role as the chief enforcement officer of the federal courts , charged with ensuring the safety and effective functioning of our justice system . "
django-registration
So , life has been eventful lately .
There was DjangoCon , which was awesome even though I came away deeply unhappy with how my talk turned out ; due to a lot of hectic things going on , it fell far below the standard I usually like to enforce for myself .
I ’ve got a couple things cooking for PyCon , though , which will hopefully make up for it .
Things are starting to ramp up for the Django 1.2 development cycle , which is looking to be chock full of awesomeness .
There ’s quite a lot of interestingness going on at work which , unfortunately , I ca n’t really talk much about right now but which is bringing with it a general “ OMG BUSY ” status .
And , of course , there was last week ’s emergency Django security release .
What little free time I ’ve had has been divided between two personal projects .
One is finishing up the code repository for the second edition of Practical Django Projects ( which I ’d hoped to get some serious time on last weekend ; the security stuff kinda crapped all over that , so I ’m hoping to get back to it Saturday or Sunday , while curled up on my couch with a bunch of football games ) .
The other is a complete rewrite of my most popular open - source application , django - registration .
As luck would have it , I ’ve recently been able to devote a bit of work time to it and get it nearly finished , so I ’d like to take a minute to talk about that .
I ’ve always tried to have django - registration offer some opportunities for customizing how users sign up , because that ’s a feature which tends to have such varied requirements from site to site .
There ’s always been , for example , the ability to specify custom form classes , custom templates and custom redirects for actions which require them .
But at its core , django - registration has always had the default workflow — two - phase register - then - activate — more or less hard - coded in , and that ’s a problem : there are lots of use cases where it just does n’t fit , and where working around django - registration ’s assumptions was either difficult or impossible .
So about six months ago I quietly forked the repository and started working on a new , more flexible approach , inspired by Django ’s own pluggable authentication system , which in turn owes a lot to various similar systems which preceded it .
My goal was to move all the actual logic of user registration into a standard interface , then rewrite django - registration to work with anything which implements that interface .
The result , today , is the first alpha release of django - registration 0.8 , which you can download from the project page at Bitbucket .
A copy of the in - progress documentation is also up , and is built using Sphinx , which is frankly awesome for this .
Browsing around the documentation ( pay particular attention to the release notes and upgrade guide ) should give you a feel for what ’s new and what ’s changed .
All the actual work of registering ( and , optionally , activating ) accounts is now handled by swappable backend classes ; to plug in a new workflow , simply write a backend which implements it .
The full backend API , for those of you who ’d like to try your hand at it , consists of six methods , two of which are optional .
Between them , I ’m pretty sure they cover the whole range of things people will need or want to do with user registration .
The original two - phase workflow used by older releases is now implemented as a bundled backend , and is mostly backwards - compatible : you ’ll need to add one new template , and make a couple changes to one other , but aside from that things should Just Work ( TM ) .
If you ’re feeling adventurous and you ’d like to try it out , grab the 0.8 alpha package and install it .
Note that you ’ll need to download it directly from Bitbucket , or point your favorite package - install tool at the Bitbucket URL ; this package is not on PyPI and wo n’t be until 0.8 goes final .
If you spot bugs , head on over to the issue tracker and let me know about them .
Between now and the final 0.8 release — and I do n’t yet know when that ’ll happen —
I ’ve got a few more things I ’d like to get done :
Adding at least one other backend bundled with django - registration , as an example of how to do that .
Collecting and checking in updated translations ( there are two new strings , and a few that no longer need explicit translation because they ’re translated by Django itself ) .
I ’m looking at Transifex ( which is both incredibly awesome , and Django - powered ) as an option for making this easier all around .
Expanding the documentation and smoothing out any wrinkles in the upgrade process ; it is n’t 100 % painless and ca n’t be since the changes under the hood were so big , but I suspect there ’s still room for improvement .
Once it ’s out the door , django - registration 0.9 will begin ; I ’m hoping it ’ll collect fixes for any bugs which have crept through unnoticed , permanently stabilize the backend API , and provide a stepping stone toward a 1.0 release .
If you ’re interested in helping , feel free to grab a copy of the code from the Mercurial repo ( if you have a Bitbucket account , you can just fork directly ) and dive in .
In preparation for a study group on Numeric Photography , I started toying with what language to use for the coding projects .
Feature shopping
My inclination , of course , was to go with Lisp .
Part of the goal of the assignments , however , was to make interactive web applications for each assignment and a gallery at the end of the completed assignments .
I experimented a bit with Armed Bear Common Lisp .
The hurdles that I would need a user to go through to use my application safely were too great .
The user would have to edit their own java .
policy file to give my applet permission .
If I wanted to let the user do that with a single click or something , I would have to spring for a $ 200 / year code - signing cert .
My next choice then was stand - alone Lisp applications .
Rather than online , interactive applications , I would have downloadable ones .
Not ideal , but doable .
The big hurdle here is crafting a GUI to run the application .
The GUI would n’t be too terrible thanks to an interesting concept that Dirk Gerrits pointed out : Immediate Mode GUIs .
I have already implemented the buttons from this tutorial in OpenGL under SBCL .
Late one night , I remembered Parenscript .
It is a Lisp - like language that compiles to Javascript .
Parenscript was a little bit more its own thing and a little bit less Lisp than I had wanted .
But , it got me thinking .
What can you do in Javascript these days ?
I searched for image processing javascript .
The first hit was Pixastic .
It is a library of basic image processing functions that you can run on any image on your page .
At its heart , it uses the Canvas element that is available on Safari , Firefox , and Opera .
So , I figured , why not ?
If I can get an FFT working in Javascript , then there is nothing keeping me from implementing all of the assignments in Javascript .
Yes , Javascript is awful , but it ’s a dream compared to Java .
The new Javascript debugging features in Safari are quite useful , too .
Success
Below is a simple example of what I have working .
When you first load the page , you see an image of my son and my dad at the Pittsburgh Zoo .
This image is actually loaded in a hidden image and copied into a visible canvas .
You are seeing the canvas .
If you press the FFT button and wait for it , you will see a representation of the 2 - D Discrete Fourier Transform of the image .
Really , the DFT output is complex numbers .
The representation is just the magnitude of the complex numbers .
The actual complex numbers are kept around in a variable so that when you hit the IFFT button , it has enough information to actually reconstruct the image .
So , the FFT button works from the pixels in the canvas .
The IFFT button works from the data generated with the last FFT .
So , unfortunately , you cannot meaningfully FFT - FFT -IFFT-IFFT here .
It is interesting , but not meaningful .
Also , I was trying to add a text box here so that you could use your own image , but I am not getting it right .
You ’re going to have to wait until I finish the whole assignment .
You need a browser that supports the Canvas tag .
Firefox , Safari , and Opera should all work .
Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis and safety Ed Reed will not be fined for disparaging comments made regarding the officiating in Sunday 's game against the Patriots , league executive Ray Anderson decided Tuesday .
Anderson 's decision was relayed through a league spokesman .
Lewis had called two roughing the passer penalties against the Ravens " embarrassing , " while safety Reed called some of the spots the Ravens received at the line of scrimmage " terrible . "
The Ravens were called for two key roughing the passer penalties , one on Haloti Ngata in the first quarter and another on Terrell Suggs in the second quarter , that kept drives alive .
The Patriots ended up scoring touchdowns on both drives .
" Without totally going off the wall here , it is embarrassing to the game , " Lewis said after the 27 - 21 loss to the Patriots . " [ Tom ]
Brady is good enough to make his own plays .
Let him make the play .
When you have two great teams that are going at it , let them go at it .
Both of their touchdown drives had personal fouls that kept drives alive .
Did that win or lose the game ?
No , but it got them 14 points . "
Anderson , the NFL 's executive vice president of football operations , was present at the game .
" I know Joe [ Flacco ] got hit [ six ] different times hard , and there was one call , " Ravens coach John Harbaugh said Monday .
" There were five that were n't called , and the one that was called was the sixth .
Tom [ Brady ] did n't get hit five times .
We want him to be hit more than he was hit , but when he did sort of get hit , it was called .
That goes to the credibility of the whole thing . "
Asked if the Baltimore defense might be scrutinized more than other teams because of its surly reputation , Harbaugh replied , " That 's an interesting question .
I sure hope not , because that goes back to the credibility of the league and the credibility of the game . "

A French physicist arrested last week while working at the world 's largest atom smasher has told investigators he corresponded over the internet with a contact in north Africa 's al - Qaida branch , a judicial official said today .
The exchange vaguely discussed plans for terror attacks , but nothing concrete was planned , the French official said , speaking on condition that his name not be used because the investigation is ongoing .
The 32 - year - old Frenchman of Algerian origin was one of more than 7,000 scientists working on the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland .
He and his brother were taken into custody Thursday in south - eastern French city of Vienne .
The brother was released from custody on Saturday .
The physicist was still being held in the Paris area on Sunday , with no charges filed against him .
Under French law , terror suspects can be held without charges for up to four days .
US monitors picked up the exchange between the scientist and his contact in the militant group , known as al - Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb .
The north African group regularly targets government and security forces in Algeria , and occasionally attacks foreigners .
At work , the physicist had no contact with anything that could be used for terrorism , the European Organisation for Nuclear Research has said .
He worked on one of a series of research projects along the 17 - mile ( 27 - km ) circular tunnel under the Swiss - French border .
Just as Sweden recently expelled one of China ’s diplomats , the Asian nation returned in kind by expelling a Swedish diplomat and apparently also blocking online news site The Local from millions of Chinese web - surfers .
China is known to block websites the government deems too controversial , and it appears The Local is its latest victim .
The site , which labels itself “ Sweden ’s News in English , ” ran a story in late June about Sweden ’s expulsion of the Chinese diplomat .
It is believed that this story is the cause of the ban .
The article focused on allegations that one of China ’s diplomats was spying on political refugees who live in Sweden , according to The Local .
An Internet user living in China has reported that The Local appears to be the only Swedish news site currently being blocked by the government .
Known as the Golden Shield Project , or the Great Firewall of China , the Chinese government began controlling Internet access in 2003 via this agency , whose sole mission is to deny access to offensive websites .
One of Sweden ’s more vocal libertarian bloggers , Johan Norberg , has also been repeatedly banned from posting in China by the government agency .
“ I have been to China and have even met a person who works with Internet control there .
As I understand it , they have some Swedish staff who keep a check on these things , ” Norberg told The Local .

In a post on the search engine ’s Italian blog , Marco Pancino , European Policy Counsel for Google said the company felt obliged to make some clarifications regarding claims that Google is no different to the The Pirate Bay .
Pancino says ( translated by Google ) that Google ’s job is to index and make all information online available , regardless of the formats in which these files are placed online , adding that , “ The file formats are not in themselves illegal , but the use to which it is put to them as such . ”
He goes on to compare Google and its users to a highway and the drivers that use it .
“ For example Google is like a highway on which cars are moving .
Google can not be held responsible if one of these cars is a crime committed , nor is the car itself . ”
Throughout the Pirate Bay trial , which ended last week in a guilty verdict , the defendants posed on multiple occasions that Google could be used to find illegal torrent files – not just the Pirate Bay .
“ Bit torrent technology can be used for both legal and illegal means on Pirate Bay in the same way as by Google or MySpace , ” said defense lawyer Jonas Nilsson on the closing day of the trial .
The prosecution , and subsequently the judge , did n’t buy the argument and found the Pirate Bay guilty for its crimes against the entertainment industry .
However , tons of people still believe that if TPB is guilty , then so too is Google for offering users the a product capable of serving the same function as the Pirate Bay .

Advertisement A complaint has been lodged after a man stood naked on a Trafalgar Square plinth as part of the ongoing One and Other art installation .
Justin Holwell stripped and posed naked on the fourth plinth during his one - hour slot from 1400 BST on Sunday .
Ex-detective Mark Williams - Thomas said his wife and children were " annoyed and upset " .
He complained to police but Mr Holwell was not taken off the plinth .
A police spokesman said it was not a crime to appear naked in public .
Artist Antony Gormley 's One and Other project enables public volunteers to stand on the central London square 's fourth plinth for one hour at a time .
They are allowed to do anything during that time , as long as it is not illegal .
Mr Holwell , 24 , from Loughborough in Leicestershire , said he confirmed with event producer Artichoke that he would be permitted to undress while on the plinth .
Afterwards he said : " I was chatting to my mates about it ; they see me as a bit of an exhibitionist , this seemed the natural way to go . "
Mr Holwell , who works in a double - glazing factory , added : " It 's the human form , everyone 's the same , it 's not like I 'm showing off something that no one else has got . "
But Mr Williams - Thomas , a former Surrey Police detective constable , said his three children , aged between eight and 13 years old , were " very shocked and embarrassed " by Mr Holwell 's nudity .
This was a public place and therefore I should be able to take my children without the fear of them having a man naked exposing himself
Mark Williams - Thomas
He approached nearby police officers and asked them to intervene .
However , after contacting a superintendent , the officers said they would not take any action against Mr Holwell .
Mr Williams - Thomas subsequently complained to the Metropolitan Police .
Mr Williams - Thomas said : " I fully expected that the surrounding police or organisers would stop this man .
To my total surprise they stood by and did nothing . "
He added : " This was a public place and therefore I should be able to take my children without the fear of them having a man naked exposing himself . "
Mr Williams - Thomas said Mr Holwell committed an offence under common law by exposing himself .
' No obscenity ' But a Metropolitan Police spokesman said : " We can confirm officers have received a complaint with regard to an exhibition on the fourth plinth on Sunday 30 August .
" This complaint is currently being considered , and the complainant will be notified in due course .
Any complaints are considered on a case - by - case basis . "
Event producer Artichoke said a number of participants have chosen to remove their clothes .
A spokeswoman said : " We have been working with the Metropolitan Police for several months and they agree that there is nothing illegal in nudity , provided no obscenity is committed , which is why they did not intervene in this case . "
Earlier last month police ordered a One and Other participant to put his underpants back on after he appeared naked on the plinth .

Former Renault team boss Flavio Briatore has vowed to hit back at those who " betrayed " him in the race - fixing scandal .
The Italian received an indefinite ban from Formula 1 after being found guilty of having conspired to fix the result of the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix .
Briatore will also not be allowed to participate in any FIA - sanctioned series or manage any Formula 1 drivers .
The 58 - year - old , in a response to a selected group of Italian journalist , said he will eventually emerge victorious and have a " great party " to celebrate .
" I 've been betrayed by my own world , " Briatore was quoted as saying by the Repubblica newspaper .
" In the end I will win and , you 'll see , we 'll have a great party .
It will be organised well and we 'll invite all those people who have stayed close to me during these tough times .
" ( This response ) is just a matter of good manners , because I do n't want to say absolutely anything .
I 'm not giving any quotes .
I will talk only at the right time , assuming that they still allow me to talk .
" Look at the verdict the FIA has put online on Tuesday : it is not about me . "
As Zero Hedge pointed out first , yesterday Dick Bove performed what should be a FINRA or SEC punishable act , by first pumping the stock of Wells Fargo live on pumpathon central CNBC , and subsequently downgrading it , causing a major market selloff .
Today ,
Bove tries to backtrack and explains the foolishness of his actions , while telling all those stupid enough to follow his recommendations that he will no longer be providing " immediate earnings commentary " ( whatever the hell that is ) on air .
If his " less than immediate commentary , " such as his Buy call on Lehman weeks before the bank filed for bankruptcy , is any indication , perhaps Mr. Bove should consider dropping the " commentary " business period .
From the WSJ :
Prominent banking analyst Dick Bove , who caused a stir Wednesday with seemingly contradictory remarks on Wells Fargo , has decided he ’ll no longer provide immediate earnings commentary on air .
“ I ’m not going to do it anymore .
I ’m going to have to see the numbers before I go on air , ” Bove told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday .
“ It creates an untenable situation . ”
Excuse us ... " going to see the numbers before I go on air ???? "
This presumed expert goes on air without having a clue what the hell he is talking about in the first place ?
And viewer - starved networks such as CNBC actually have him ?
The situation would be hilarious if it was n't so tragic .
“ Once I went through the numbers , it was evident to me that this company ’s earning power was lower , ” Bove said Thursday .
Late Wednesday , he had said that what CNBC wants “ is a quick reaction to a number , that ’s what they want , ” contending there was n’t a conflict between the statements .
CNBC declined to comment Thursday on Bove .
Why , thank you for explaining your reasoning , Dick .
And all those who bought WFC per your CNBC - sponsored appearance , only to see massive losses thanks to your subsequent downgrade , are surely also also very grateful .

RUSH TO RETIRE RUSH TO RETIRE WASHINGTON 
The number of retired workers who began collecting Social Security benefits jumped by a record 19 % in the 2009 fiscal year that ended Wednesday as aging Baby Boomers and the unemployed chose to retire early .
More than 2.6 million retired workers entered the Social Security system , up from 2.2 million in fiscal 2008 .
That 's a much bigger increase than during past recessions .
" There are just not enough jobs for older people , " says Richard Johnson , senior fellow at the non-partisan Urban Institute .
" They have no choice but to go on Social Security . "
The number of disabled workers receiving first - time benefits also soared to nearly 1 million , an increase of 100,000 over the previous year , according to Social Security Administration records .
Those two factors are putting new pressure on Social Security 's finances .
The program paid out $ 6 billion more in August than it took in .
It 's projected to run in the red for the next two years before returning to a surplus in 2012 .
" We have the combination of more people filing for early retirement and disability benefits at the same time that we have a reduction in the size of the workforce , " said Stephen Goss , Social Security 's chief actuary .
The figures are affected both by the lengthy recession , which has sent unemployment to 9.7 % , and by Baby Boomers who began reaching the early retirement age of 62 in 2008 .
More people are in the pipeline .
New applications for Social Security increased nearly 23 % in fiscal 2009 , the agency said .
It had projected a 15 % increase based on the first wave of Baby Boomers born in 1946 and 1947 .
The rest of the increase is because of rising unemployment , Goss said .
Those who choose early retirement at 62 get reduced monthly benefits .
If they stay retired and live longer than expected , they would receive less than if they had waited to claim benefits .
Widows who rely on their husbands ' benefits also would lose out .
" The goal should be to have as high a monthly income from this as possible , " says Alicia Munnell , director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College .
" It 's unfortunate that we 're going to have this many people who have claimed these … reduced benefits . "
The decision on when to take Social Security benefits is difficult , but many experts advise waiting as long as possible .
The benefit is calculated based on salary and years in the workforce ; the longer you work , the higher the benefit .
But many Baby Boomers are choosing to take benefits at 62 .
Disability claims rose 17 % this year , to more than 3 million , according to Social Security .
It 's projected to jump to 3.3 million in 2010 .
" The economy plays a big part , " says Dan Allsup , spokesman for Allsup Inc. , which handles disability claims .
" Every time there is a recession , it spikes . "
At the same time , older people are trying to stay in the workforce longer or seeking to return because their savings have taken a hit .
Nearly two - thirds of people ages 55 - 64 are working , more than at the peak of the economic boom .
But in the past few months , the percentage has declined slightly .
" We have seen a rise in job discouragement , " said Steve Hipple , a Bureau of Labor Statistics economist .
" We know how poor the job market is . "

A ' Marriage Strike ' Emerges As Men Decide Not To Risk Loss

A ' marriage strike ' emerges as men decide not to risk loss
By Glenn Sacks and Dianna Thompson
Katherine is attractive , successful , witty , and educated .
She also can't find a husband .
Why ?
Because most of the men this thirtysomething software analyst dates do not want to get married .
These men have Peter Pan syndrome :
They refuse to commit , refuse to settle down , and refuse to " grow up . "
However , given the family court policies and divorce trends of today , Peter Pan is no naive boy , but instead a wise man .
" Why should I get married and have kids when I could lose those kids and most of what I 've worked for at a moment 's notice ? " asks Dan , a 31 - year - old power plant technician who says he will never marry .
" I 've seen it happen to many of my friends .
I know guys who came home one day to an empty house or apartment - wife gone , kids gone .
They never saw it coming .
Some of them were never able to see their kids regularly again . "
Census figures suggest that the marriage rate in the United States has dipped 40 percent during the last four decades to its lowest point since the rate was measured .
There are many plausible explanations for this trend , but one of the least mentioned is that American men , in the face of a family court system hopelessly stacked against them , have subconsciously launched a " marriage strike . "
It is not difficult to see why .
Let 's say that Dan defies Peter Pan , marries Katherine , and has two children .
There is a 50 percent likelihood that this marriage will end in divorce within eight years , and if it does , the odds are 2 - 1 it will be Katherine , not Dan , who initiates the divorce .
It may not matter that Dan was a decent husband .
Studies show that few divorces are initiated over abuse or because the man has already abandoned the family .
Nor is adultery cited as a factor by divorcing women appreciably more than by divorcing men .
While the courts may grant Dan and Katherine joint legal custody , the odds are overwhelming that it is Katherine , not Dan , who will win physical custody .
Overnight , Dan , accustomed to seeing his kids every day and being an integral part of their lives , will become a " 14 percent dad " - a father who is allowed to spend only one out of every seven days with his own children .
Once Katherine and Dan are divorced , odds are at least even that Katherine will interfere with Dan 's visitation rights .
Three - quarters of divorced men surveyed say their ex-wives have interfered with their visitation , and 40 percent of mothers studied admitted that they had done so , and that they had generally acted out of spite or in order to punish their exes .
Katherine will keep the house and most of the couple 's assets .
Dan will need to set up a new residence and pay at least a third of his take - home pay to Katherine in child support .
As bad as all of this is , it would still make Dan one of the lucky ones .
After all , he could be one of those fathers who cannot see his children at all because his ex has made a false accusation of domestic violence , child abuse , or child molestation .
Or a father who can only see his own children under supervised visitation or in nightmarish visitation centers where dads are treated like criminals .
He could be one of those fathers whose ex has moved their children hundreds or thousands of miles away , in violation of court orders , which courts often do not enforce .
He could be one of those fathers who tears up his life and career again and again in order to follow his children , only to have his ex-wife continually move them .
He could be one of the fathers who has lost his job , seen his income drop , or suffered a disabling injury , only to have child support arrearages and interest pile up to create a mountain of debt which he could never hope to pay off .
Or a father who is forced to pay 70 percent or 80 percent of his income in child support because the court has imputed an unrealistic income to him .
Or a dad who suffers from one of the child support enforcement system 's endless and difficult to correct errors , or who is jailed because he cannot keep up with his payments .
Or a dad who reaches old age impoverished because he lost everything he had in a divorce when he was middle - aged and did not have the time and the opportunity to earn it back .
" It 's a shame , " Dan says .
" I always wanted to be a father and have a family .
But unless the laws change and give fathers the same right to be a part of their children 's lives as mothers have , it just is n't worth the risk . "

Glad I got married before I read this .
The article is , of course , undeniably true .
The divorce laws in this nation are insane .
A wife 's lawyer will almost always try to get a restraining order on the husband -- regardless of whether or not the husband is any risk -- because a restraining order is powerful leverage with the court .
" Hhmmm .... he's so terrible and threatening she had to get a restraining order to protect herself and her children from this monster . "
The family court system requires a complete overhaul .

close to marriage .
At least I 'll be able to retire some day .
This is right on !!
I 've seen it so many times that I absolutely refuse to even getto marriage .
At least I 'll be able to retire some day .
The article forgot to mention alimony which is still popular in some jurisdictions .
My friend got the son in his divorce ( the boy was 16 , chose to live with dad ) , but still had to pay some crazy amount on the order of $ 2000 per month for 4 or 5 years so that she could " get back on her feet " .
Heck , in my court , she would have paid back rent to him for the time she spent living under his paycheck . :^)
This ought to get a rise out of someone ...

Yep ... marriage is just too risky for a man today .
If his woman and kids stuck around that would be one thing .
But if there 's a divorce a couple of years down the road , he 's right back where he started .
No wonder so many men opt to stay single .
Unless our national policies make marriage rewarding for men its better to avoid the grief and disillusion that comes with falling out of love and getting stuck with the bills .

Run in my jurisdiction and you have my vote , Judge Meyer . : O )
To : College Repub
VERY well drafted so as to be enforceable not only in the state where they were drawn ( and you married ) , but in the jurisdiction you 're living at the time of the divorce and ( if there are significant assets involved ) in each jurisdiciton where you have assets .
Pre -nuptial agreements can help , providing they arewell drafted so as to be enforceable not only in the state where they were drawn ( and you married ) , but in the jurisdiction you 're living at the time of the divorce and ( if there are significant assets involved ) in each jurisdiciton where you have assets .
The problem is that some courts will reform the agreements or declare them void against public policy depending on the fact situations .
Pre -Nups are an area where only the best will do -- hire a real matrimonial expert as your attorney to draw it , not your regular trusts and estates lawyer or general practitioner who would draw your will .
If you move to a new state , consult an expert in the new state as to the enforceablity of your Pre-Nup .
And you will need to take special precautions if you are moving to ( or living in ) California , Texas , Louisiana or the other ' community property ' states in which all earnings and assets aquired by a couple during the marraige are considered jointly owned 50/50 .

I think the biggest problem is that too many people rush into marriage with no counseling , and do n't even consider finding someone of the same religion , abstaining till marriage , etc .
Yes , the feminist movement is probably responsible for much of this .

Rep. Anthony Weiner on MSNBC's Dr. Nancy show explaining how the AHIP memo released yesterday is making the case for the public option .
Weiner :
But it ’s interesting in their analysis they ’re not 100 % wrong .
It is true that the Baucus plan does n’t cover enough people .
And it is true — the health insurance says it straight out on your show a moment ago — they ’re going to raise the rates .
The only thing that prevents them from doing that — and you almost got your last guest to stumble into saying it — some form of competition , but in a strange way the health insurance industry , not standing up and saying “ No , no ” they ’re not doing enough in the Baucus bill , what they really mean is we thought we were going to get all these new customers and you ’re doing all these other things to try to hold down costs —
“ They ai n’t gonna ’ work .
We ’re not going to let you do it ” .
Which is why the argument is more profound than ever and Chuck mentioned it , we have to have the public option .
If we do n’t have it — if you leave them to their own devices — the health insurance industry right now is putting us on notice , “ We ’re not going to lower costs at all .
We ’re going to keep on raising costs . ”
Because that ’s their business model .
[…]
If you have the health care industry complaining that we ’re going to raise costs because of these changes , it is them putting us on notice that we have n’t put enough cost containment in the bill .
You know , the health care industry themselves is putting out a whole report saying that .
That should be a tell to the Baucus team that “ You know what ? ” maybe it ’s time for them to go back and revisit the public option .
But the other thing that ’s interesting here is the deal was always going to be for the health care guys , look , you ’re going to get all these new customers that are going to be coming in and that ’s going to be the reason you ’re going to take a hair cut here .
But make no mistake about it , the health care industry keeps raising costs and I think what ’s going to happen with the Baucus bill is put new requirements on them , they raise costs and whatever subsidies we ’re giving people to buy their own insurance , they wo n’t be able to afford it and we ’ll keep on losing people .
This is the whole argument for the public option is right here laid out by the health care industry right now .
Dr. Laura :
Do you think you ’ll get it ?
Weiner : I think so .
I think in a strange way , and obviously they did n’t mean this , the health insurance lobby today fired the most important salvo in weeks for the public option , because they have said , as clear as day , left to their own devices , according to their own number crunchers , they ’re going to raise rates 111 % .
And that ’s why , you know we have a petition at CountdownToHealthCare.com where we ’re telling people for the moderates in the Senate , the so - called moderates , and for the White House , we need the public option , and the health care industry is making our argument for us .
I use actual , measured needs to help design software .
I also use reported failures to help design software .
I have one more design principle : I use misunderstandings to help me design software .
In particular , this is an API - level design principle .
The question changes from " How can I make a particular feature possible ? " to " How can I make a particular feature impossible to misuse ? "
Up - front Failure Prevention
It 's easy to demonstrate failures of this principle ; consider string handling in the C programming language , or global - by - default variables in Perl 5 , or the Python REPL 's behavior when you type quit or exit .
( That last example catches me every time I use Python 's interactive mode .
Thanks for the lovely warning .
Please do what I want if you know what I want . )
This principle also falls somewhere in between necessity - driven design and bug - driven design .
It requires asking " What could possibly go wrong ? " , enumerating the likely and unlikely possibilities , analyzing their risk , and determining the likelihood of failure .
For example , Parrot supports a data structure known as a constant string .
These are immutable singleton structures which represent strings used pervasively throughout the core system .
By making them immutable , we obviate the need to make copies to prevent unwanted modifications .
By making them singletons , we can collapse multiple references to a single string into pointers to that singleton string and save lots of memory .
We use a macro called CONST_STRING in C code in the Parrot core to identify one of these strings .
While it would be nice if our documentation were always sufficient to describe how to write a Parrot extension without copying and pasting code from the core , I realize that almost everyone who will ever write a Parrot extension will start with skeleton code cribbed from elsewhere .
I wanted to make the constant string technique work reasonably well for extensions as well .
It 'll never be quite as fast nor efficient as the core version , but a quick cache does help a lot of benchmarks .
Our first attempt used a different macro , CONST_STRING_GEN , as the internal implementation of that macro had to be different .
Rather than poking directly into interpreter memory , extensions have to go through a secondary lookup : they do n't have access to internals in the same way that Parrot 's core does .
Then I realized the problem .
I do n't want to explain the mechanics of how constants string work , at least not to people writing extensions .
I want to say nothing more than " If you know you 'll never need to modify this string , mark it as a constant string . "
I know I do n't want to explain the differences between the caching models , especially because extensions should n't need to know anything about Parrot 's unencapsulated internals .
Yet I knew that people would copy code from the core into their extensions and then wonder why their versions Just Did Not Work .
I changed the extension processor to emit a different version of the CONST_STRING macro local to each extension which uses the appropriate public API to manipulate constant singleton strings .
Even though the mechanics of how this works differs between core code and extension code , it still reads the same way .
People can copy and paste code between core data structures and extensions without knowing the difference , at least in this respect .
Even though copying and pasting is generally bad , it 's so pervasive ( especially in this context ) , our interfaces have to allow for it -- and should not allow people to make subtle errors .
For further reading , I suggest Joshua Bloch 's How to design a good API and why it matters talk from OOPLSA 2006 .
Reacting to Failure
Of course , it 's not always possible to predict what people will do wrong .
Sometimes the best you can do is look at a bug report , ask yourself " Wait , why in the world would you ever write code this way ? " , and then work backwards .
How did that failure occur ?
Do you not provide the right APIs ?
Do your abstractions leak ?
Are people working around a broken feature ?
Are people working around the lack of a feature ?
Sometimes you need to pave the cowpaths .
Sometimes you need to change the way you explain code .
Sometimes you need to change the name of an API call or a parameter to suggest the right behavior .
Mostly you need to understand where and why expectations went wrong .
Only then can you change the vocabulary of the system to change expectations for the better .
That 's why I welcome quick , rapid feedback .
If something does n't work , I want to know that as soon as possible -- before it gets too established to improve , before it confuses too many people , and before people accept it as " just another quirk . "
There can be a little pain to start , especially for early adopters , but there 's no substitute for solving real problems in the real world to help you understand exactly what you should have designed in the first place .
Maybe next time you 'll get more right .
( This , I believe , is one of those practices which separates real , actual agile development from Big - A - Because - It 's - Hip - Agile development : pervasive , ubiquitous feedback gathered and reflected upon to produce small , verifiable changes to development practices designed to improve the process itself . )
An opened Samsung HD753LJ hard disk drive .
Researchers predict that , in 2020 , hard disk drives will likely be less expensive on a cost per terabyte basis than any of the competing technologies .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
The ability to store and retrieve data is an important component of today 's computers , as well as other modern electronic devices such as cell phones , video game consoles , and camcorders .
Since their invention in the 1950s , magnetic - based hard disk drives ( HDDs ) have been the primary method of nonvolatile storage .
However , researchers are currently developing several new and promising nonvolatile memory ( NVM ) technologies , but for one of them to replace HDDs within the next decade , it will be a challenge .
According to a new study , if HDDs continue to progress at their current pace , then in 2020 a two - disk , 2.5 - inch disk drive will be capable of storing more than 14 TB and will cost about $ 40 ( today , a typical 500 GB hard drive costs about $ 100 ) .
Although flash memories have also become popular - with advantages such as lower power consumption , faster read access time , and better mechanical reliability than HDDs - the cost per GB for flash memories is nearly 10 times that of HDDs .
In addition , flash memory technology will reach technical limits that will prevent its continued scaling before 2020 , keeping them from replacing HDDs .
In a study published in a recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Magnetics , Professor Mark Kryder and PhD student Chang Soo Kim of Carnegie Mellon University have investigated 13 up - and - coming NVM technologies to see whether one of them might outperform HDDs on a cost - per - TB basis in 2020 .
Their results showed that most technologies will probably not be competitive with HDDs or flash memories at that time , except for two potential candidates : phase change random access memory ( PCRAM ) and spin transfer torque random access memory ( STTRAM ) .
As Kryder and Kim explained , PCRAM is based on the phase change properties of chalcogenide glass .
With the application of heat , the glass can switch between two different states ( amorphous and crystalline ) to be used as a memory .
With their small cell size and ability to store multiple bits per cell , PCRAMs have the potential to offer high densities and be cost - competitive with HDDs , but their biggest drawback is that they require somewhat higher power than most other technologies .
PCRAMs are already beginning to be marketed by Numonyx Inc. , an Intel - ST Microelectronics joint venture , and so are closer to practical realization than STTRAM .
STTRAM , which is similar to magnetic RAM , uses a spin polarized current to write data by reorienting the states of a magnetic tunnel junction between parallel and anti-parallel orientations .
In their evaluation , Kryder and Kim found that STTRAMs appear to potentially offer superior power efficiency , among other advantages .
If STTRAMs could be improved to store multiple bits per cell , the researchers predict that STTRAMs ’ density could make them candidates for replacing flash memory and possibly HDDs .
“ We were surprised to find that the study indicated that , even in 2020 , hard drives were likely to be considerably less expensive on a cost per terabyte basis than any of the competing technologies , ” Kryder told PhysOrg.com .
“ It was also somewhat surprising to find that the technical potential of a technology was not necessarily well - correlated with where the industry was investing the most dollars ; rather , industrial firms are tending to invest where they have the most know - how .
This is not necessarily the wisest decision , but is quite understandable . ”
The other NVM technologies that Kryder and Kim evaluated were ferroelectric RAM , magnetic RAM , carbon nanotube RAM , probe memory , holographic memory , copper bridge RAM , resistive RAM , racetrack memory , single electron memory , molecular memory , and polymer memory .
Although these technologies offer potential , each of them still faces significant performance challenges over the next decade .
Holographic memory , for example , offers high density and is inexpensive , but it currently only offers “ write once , read many times ” ( WORM ) functionality , and with its 50 - year storage lifetime it may be better suited to the archival market .
The researchers also pointed out the intriguing concept behind single electron memory , where information could be stored in something as small as a single electron , but they predicted that this technology likely wo n’t be practical until beyond 2020 .
Kryder , who has previously been CTO for Seagate Technology , the world 's largest hard drive maker , explained that he had been continually asked to review new technologies that were often touted as potentially replacing hard drives .
“ Feedback from industrial associates has indicated that having a structured set of criteria to evaluate technologies was very useful and that the study has helped them to prioritize the technologies that they look at , ” he said .
“ This study allowed us to identify the most promising technologies on which to work , and we are now attempting develop multi- level cell STTRAM . ”

Gamers the world over sighed with relief when it was revealed that Ubisoft was developing a sequel to the much loved Beyond Good & Evil .
The company has been incredibly quiet about the game ever since , however .
Now Ubi's North American CEO
Laurent Detoc has expressed doubt over whether the game will even come out at all .
" Yes , that worked out ( referring to the success of Assassin 's Creed ) , but it does n't work out every time , and sometimes you come back to an IP that did n't work because you still think it could have — like Beyond Good and Evil , which was leaked , so now people know we 're working on a new one , " Detoc told Industry Gamers .
" Whether or not it comes out remains to be seen anyway , but we did n't want to abandon that IP because it has a cache and authenticity about it .
There 's something very pure about that game and it's too bad that we were not able to build it as an IP at the time . "
And if that was n't enough to break the hearts of BG&E fans out there , he also added : " I did n't say there 's definitely going to be another game .
I said something had leaked , which means we 've been working on some Beyond Good and Evil stuff , but whether there 's going to be another game or not , that 's something for the future . "
Now , it 's entirely possible that Detoc is simply covering his bases in the off chance that BG &E2 is n't released .
But combined with noticeable lack of new information that Ubisoft has revealed about the game , his comments are more than a little distressing .

Goethe and ernie - 2009-03-07
The video was easily five stars before the wipeout , which alone would 've added five stars , but the jukebox - stopping sound effect took it beyond that ... and the comments ... and the sex crimes ...

The public option is “ about as unpopular as a garlic milkshake , ” House GOP Leader John Boehner ( Ohio ) said Thursday .
Boehner inadvertently invited the public to lobby him in support of the government - run healthcare plan endorsed by the Democratic leadership .
“ I ’m still trying to find the first American to talk to who ’s in favor of the public option , other than a member of Congress or the administration .
I ’ve not talked to one , and I get to a lot of places and I ’ve not had anyone come up to me — I know I ’m inviting it — and lobby for the public option , ” Boehner said .
“ This thing ( the public option ) is about as unpopular as a garlic milkshake , ” Boehner added , noting that he had not consumed such a milkshake .

Rivers are dry in some areas , and people have been enjoying unusually hot days Australia has experienced its warmest August on record amid soaring winter temperatures .
Climatologists have blamed both the effects of climate change and natural variability .
Australia 's Bureau of Meteorology says that August was a " most extraordinary month " with mean temperatures 2.47C above the long - term average .
August in Australia culminated in a record - breaking heat - wave across much of the continent .
In the Queensland town of Bedourie the temperature reached 38.5C .
Elsewhere , New South Wales , Victoria and South Australia have had their warmest winters on record .
We needed rain most probably a fortnight ago for our crops to realise their full potential and every day it does n't rain that will fall quite dramatically
John Ridley
New South Wales farmer Blair Trewin , from the National Climate Centre , says the past month has brought unprecedented conditions .
" Early last week we saw a number of locations in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland break their August record - high temperatures by four or five degrees .
And to break records by that sort of margin is something which is extremely rare , " said Mr Trewin .
Scientists believe that such unseasonal temperatures are the result of global warming and of the climate 's natural variability .
There are warnings that spring in this part of the southern hemisphere is likely to bring more hot weather , exacerbating a long - standing drought .
John Ridley , a grain farmer in New South Wales , is a worried man .
" We needed rain yesterday , right .
We needed rain most probably a fortnight ago for our crops to realise their full potential , but most probably been 30 % of our yield potential gone and every day it does n't rain that will fall quite dramatically from there , " said Mr Ridley .
The warm , dry conditions have also prompted the authorities to warn that Australia 's annual bushfire season is again likely to be severe .
Already serious outbreaks have flared to the north and south of Sydney , the country 's most populous city .

The Secret Service announced today that a juvenile was behind the Facebook posting that asked whether President Obama should be assassinated , calling it a prank that would not lead to prosecution .
The agency declined to release the juvenile 's name , age or residence .
The Facebook posting , put up Saturday but since removed , posed a quiz to readers , " Should Obama be killed ? "
The options were no , maybe , yes , and " yes , if he cuts my health care . "
Secret Service agents -- who investigate all potential threats against presidents -- spoke with the child and the parents , and determined that there was no intent to harm Obama , agency spokesman Ed Donovan said .
" This is something we classified as a mistake on the juvenile 's part , " Donovan said .

I 'm not your average male shopper .
I 'll go to the department store and try on a bunch of clothes before I decide on what I want to wear .
I 'll try on 5 different pairs of jeans before I choose one .
I want to get the one that fits me best and looks good .
So I picked up a couple of items , and as you can imagine , that took away a good chunk of my day .
It is n't exactly fun standing in a dressing room with all sorts of pins and needles on the floor .
Some of my friends prefer to shop online .
They 'll order the clothes online , wait for them to come , try them and on , and send back anything that is n't going to work out with them .
However , that process could end up being even more time consuming than actually going to the store to pick it up .
I could just imagine them killing half a month on waiting for clothes .
There has to be a better way , right ?
So I pondered what 's out there .
There are some stores that will put different outfits over a picture of you .
You can kinda see how it looks , but you can't really get a whole perspective .
I mean , you try on clothes with more than just mirror .
The sides and back are just as important .
This way just does n't seem too effective to me .
What I see happening is a store like Macy 's having a place in their physical store that will measure up a 3 - D model of you exactly .
Imagine having a bunch of cameras and laser beams measuring you up like something out of a science fiction movie .
I see this happening sooner than we know it .
Look at how far we 've come with the Kinect .
It can do incredible things , and every day we 're impressed more and more by it .
So they would take that 3 - D model of you , and apply it to an account you have on their site .
You can update your build the next time you go shopping at that store , or maybe with some game console device like the Kinect .
Who really knows the scope of power that device wields ?
So you 're online with a 3 - D model and it will fit the clothes on you on exactly how it will fit .
It could find better clothes that fit you better from different brands .
There 's just an unlimited wealth of possibilities with this scenario .
I 'd get into this more in depth , but I 'd be boring everyone to death .
Well how does this apply to Web 3.0 you ask ?
I 'm glad you asked !
So if you recall , Web 3.0 is primarily based off social media .
What could happen is that there will be software out there to compare your body with other people on the web with similar or exact builds .
Advertisers could make recommendations to you based on what everyone else is purchasing .
They can take all sorts of things into consideration .
Weight , height , skin color , muscle build , length of appendages , etc ...
Let me play out a scenario :
A random guy who has the same build / body type as you buys a bunch of clothes .
He rates them positively .
You logon to a website to buy some clothes .
They have your user profile and they compare it with this guy who just bought clothes with the high rating .
They 'll automatically make recommendations to you when you login .
Let 's say you 're not interested in what that guy bought , but you 're interested in Polo T - shirts .
So you click on the polo t- shirts section and each t- shirt you click , it will go onto this 3 - D virutal body of yourself .
You 'll be able to rotate it .
You can check to see how it fits on body parts you might want to display or hide .
You 'll be able to see yourself in a whole different scope with this method .
Nonetheless , when you finally select the polo you want to buy , you may have a friend who actually bought that polo and you 'll know that information because everything seems to be shared more and more on social media .
So there , the purchasing decision to buy is enticed by your friend because he has the same shirt .
It might be deterred as well because they have the same shirt and you want to be different .
Whatever it may be , it 's influencing your decision .
Anyway , getting back on track :
So clearly we can see how your shopping for clothes has become much more simplified because there is more information to influence your decision .
After you build up a profile on one of these things , advertisers can start advertising clothing that you would be interested in buying because it would look great on you .
Not only that , but they can also advertise to your friends the same shirt .
Why stop at your friends ?
How about all people with that same build because you gave it a positive rating .
So as you can see what I 'm saying , the dynamic of shopping will and have to change .
As it gets easier to make decisions on purchasing clothing , you 'll see less returns than these Pre-Internet ways .
With that in mind , we can see a higher ROI ( return on investment ) for retail companies advertising .
Tell me your thoughts people .
Parents was the theme of the episode and we got to see lots of development on that front .
The final scene was disturbing to me on so many levels .
We see Sally curled up under the table not really sure how to deal with Gene 's death .
After hearing the adults laugh a bit , she comes into the kitchen and gives a little rant .
Personally , I find child actors ( not in horror movies ) cute no matter what they do , and this was no exception .
The articulation of " really , really gone " just got me amused .
Before this , Betty bites into Gene 's peach and squirts the fruit everywhere which visually was gross and also was interesting how Betty wanted to eat the peach which to Don seemed macabre while she found it as a way to hang on to Gene .
Sally falls asleep to the television and a story with pictures of a Vietnamese monk who set himself on fire .
Too bad she could n't fall asleep to a happy death story like Pushing Daisies .
Sally looks like she 'll be scarred for life , but who could you blame ?
The obvious choice would be Betty , and I guess emotionally she 's never really there for her children , but Don is n't really either .
Betty does n't know how to deal with things , and no one has ever taught her .
Sally rides such an emotional roller coaster from driving the car with Gene to eating the ice cream , oblivious to the fact that Gene is showing signs of stroke that whatever she does next probably wo n't be good .
Watching the client plunk millions of dollars for jai alai was a hoot .
We all know the idea does n't catch on except in certain parts of the country , and it just sounds so ridiculous that you can't help but laugh .
His father gave him all the money and Pete makes a great comment and how jai alai is an investment his father would make .
Of course the client is an idiot and thinks this mean his venture is even better .
Peggy also sparred with her mother over moving out .
As always , Peggy comes armed and has plenty of reason to leave .
Her mother is clearly opposed and starts spouting off nonsense .
The whole thing was pretty straightforward and one - sided .
What I found interesting was the way in which Peggy found a roommate .
After an overly pretentious note , Joan pitches ( literally ) an instant plan for success and it works , bringing in Carla Gallo who is in her usual role as the excited , peppy girl .
The Patio ad was a failure after Sal is given reins of the director .
The Bye Bye Birdie imitation was fine as I could tell , but the Patio executives had problems with it that they could n't pin .
Without any specifics , this is supposed to reflect on Sal homosexuality .
How ?
Beats me .
There will be thousands of ideas with zero answers , but that 's what makes interpretation so fun .
Sal 's personal life is unraveling as his professional career after being made commercial director is improving .
While explaining the vision of the Patio commercial to his wife , Sal just had to give us his version .
His wife was clearly upset and to be honest I was a little weired out as well .
Another wonderful episode with great performances all around .
There were a couple more references to JFK today in regard to parents , and his assassination is looming .
Score : 9.5/10
With New York City recently scoring a medallion for " Bronze Achievement in Bicycling Direction " by the " LAB Academy " ( you like us ! you really like us ! ) we figured it was a good time to post our very brief StreetFilms visit to Davis , California back in August 2007 .
Even though Portland , Oregon is nipping at their heels , Davis is still the only city in America to attain the very prestigious Platinum status for overall bicycle friendliness in a city .
Credit for Davis 's bike - friendliness goes back to the 1960's when forward - thinking University of California urban planners began thinking about ways to make it safe and convenient for college students and city residents to travel safely by bike .
During an era when most California towns were focused on building freeways , strip malls and suburban arterials , Davis 's planning wizards were developing off - street greenways , bike lanes and installing bike racks everywhere .
In the last decade , an influx of car - commuters moving to Davis from nearby Sacramento and San Francisco has decreased the bike commuting mode share from 25 percent to 18 percent .
Still , Davis remains an amazing place to use a bike for transportation .
Any place that has eliminated school buses and have children riding bikes to school is doing something right .
And check this out -- Davis has its own Wiki page devoted to bicycling .
Now click your heels four times and repeat after me , " There 's no place like Davis .
There 's no place like Davis .
There 's no place ... "

As you can see behind me , welcome to Davis , California .
This is the only Platinum bicycle city in America as designated by the League of American Bicyclist , and what that shows is a unprecedented level of commitment to bicycling and making cyclists feel safe .

Living in Davis , of course bicycling is such a great way to get around town because Davis is sort of an urban island , a sea of agriculture .
The longest one way commute within the city of Davis is going to be about five miles , and that ’s only , you know , from one end of town to the other , so that ’s a very , you know , workable distance for most people .
The city is flat , there ’s hills except for a couple of overpasses .
The weather is typically pretty mild .
And the city and the campus back in the 1960 ’s decided to build on those advantages and started building , you know , putting bike lanes on streets , building bike paths , putting in bike racks everywhere .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Ruth Asmundson : </i > [ 01:11 ]
For a long , long time there were actually more bicycles than people in Davis .
And the ridership used to be 25 % of the people ride their bicycle to and from work .
And now it ’s down to 17 % , but it ’s still higher than the rest of the country because the average ridership in the country is 1 % .

We started a Bicycle Advisory Commission about a year ago so that we can not just rest on the laurels of what we ’ve done so far , but to keep getting better and better .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Kelly Foley Stachowicz : </i > [ 01:40 ]
As a recreational cyclist and a mother of two young children we can go as a family pretty much anywhere in town , whether it ’s going to the kids ’ schools or going to a park or visiting friends , we can do that all together and we can do it safely and we can do it with great enjoyment .

So even out here in the outskirts of Davis the city has made amenities so that if you do want to bicycle to get around , to go to Downtown , you can .
Point to point Davis , California most strips are n’t more than five miles , so what the goal has been has to make sure that anywhere you live , you can get on a bicycle if you do n’t want to get in your car to get to your destination .
So even in the most rural areas you ’ll find greenways and bike lanes and bike amenities that help you to get to wherever you might want to go .

It ’s a relaxed pace here and the bike lanes that run through the whole city , there ’s greenbelts everywhere so that it ’s been incorporated into the planning of the city for several decades .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Clarence Eckerson Jr.:</i> [ 03:01 ]
So in between UC Davis campus and the city , the town itself , there are a number of these bollards that have been placed , they ’re like diagonal diverters .
These streets have been designated bicycle priority streets .
They ’re not bicycle boulevards but they have the same feel of them .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Don Saylor : </i > [ 03:19 ]
About five years ago we opened up an under - crossing , a brand new under - crossing underneath an interstate highway , interstate 80 , that connects our community one … from one southern end to the northern end so that people do n’t have to go out on the vehicle off ramps .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >[ music ] </ font > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Shaman Van Gelder : </i > [ 03:38 ]
The idea there is to empower people to be able to maintain and have their own bicycle .
Myself , and I think a lot of other people , who are invested here feel that bicycles are freedom .
In a way it ’s a revolution .

So here we are at another very cool bicycle amenity in Davis .
This is the Dave Pell Bicycle crossing , and this shows Davis ’s commitment to bike and pedestrian access .
This bridge crosses over the Amtrak tracks and I80 .
It was constructed as one of many bike facilities in Davis that go over or under very complicated crossings for bikes or pedestrians .
So once again Davis showing their Platinum status by going the extra mile .

My kids have asked me before what those big yellow things are , and normally we call them school buses .
We do n’t have them in Davis .
So kids have to bike to school or walk to school , use their energy up in sort of proactive ways .
This makes for a lifestyle that ’s pretty convenient .
You do n’t have to rely on your car if you do n’t want to , and certainly with the price of gas these days it makes it a lot less expensive and healthy as well .

We ’re standing here at the corner of Wesleyan and Sycamore , one of the tougher intersections for pedestrians or bikes to actually get across here cos the school ’s over here , a lot of people live over here .
So one of the great things they ’ve done here in Davis is over the years they did a lot of experimentation and one of the things they ’re credited with doing was to use the bicycle signal and there ’s actually debate this maybe the first bicycle signal in all of the US .
It ’s easy to use .
So all you do is you come over here , you press the bike signal and then as you can see , you can drive your bike across .
You could also use the in - ground bike sensors also to activate the light , and what that does is it stops cars in all directions .
There ’s actually a warning sign to cars not to make a right hand turn into the cyclist , and you cross .

The relationship between bicyclists and motorists for example in this town is better than any place I ’ve ever ridden and I ’ve taken my bike to lots of , you know , other bicycle friendly communities around the country and really nothing matches Davis .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Clarence Eckerson Jr.:</i> [ 05:59 ] $ 370.00 , that ’s how much it ’ll cost you if you go through a red light in Davis .
And to back it all up , you do n’t even need cops or people standing here , they use photo enforcement .
One of the things that makes Davis such a wonderful community to live in is it ’s commitment to open space and public gathering areas .
But also it ’s traffic calming not only for bicyclists but for pedestrians .
What the city of Davis has done in the Downtown area is at every major intersection they ’ve put in neck - downs , and what they ’ve done is they ’ve created these gateways for pedestrians .
You know where you ’re supposed to cross , they ’re inviting , they ’re green , they ’re an alert to drivers that you are entering an area that people are going to be crossing , you better slow down .
And they work wonderfully .

We ’ve been trying also to make our Downtown more bikeable , more walkable .
Bike parking is important for any development .
Bike parking , bike lanes , anything that has to do with bicycles .

When was the last time you saw this much bike parking ?
At a strip mall .
At a Rite Aid .
At a school .
Outside the bookstore .
Taco Bell .
The movie theatre .
Of course the bike shop .
At a Fluffy Donuts .</ font ></p> < p > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " ></ font ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >[ music ] </ font > < br ></p> < p >< font size = " 3 " face = " Times New Roman " >< i> Clarence Eckerson Jr.:</i> [ 07:29 ]
So as we say goodbye to the City of Davis , California , I just wanted to point out bicycles are everywhere .
The city is in love with bicycles .
I also want to thank the Mayor for giving me a little symbol of appreciation .
She bestowed me with a lapel pin of Davis , California which , of course , has the bicycle on it .
What else would it be ?
Goodbye , take care .

Sharpest ever images of Betelgeuse reveal how explosive red supergiant loses mass
It looks like a catastrophic explosion in the latest sci-fi action thriller but this awe - inspiring image is actually based on the latest state - of - the - art space imaging .
The artist ’s impression , inspired by the sharpest ever views of the supergiant star Betelgeuse , reveals an enormous plume of gas almost as big as our own Solar System blasting outwards .
The discoveries , revealed by the latest techniques on the European Space Agency ’s Very Large Telescope , could help unravel why the mammoth plasma ball spews out material at such an incredible speed .
Superstar :
An artist 's impression of red giant Betelgeuse based on combined images from the European Space Agency 's Very Large Telescope
Almost 1,000 times larger than our sun , Betelgeuse is the second largest star in the constellation of Orion and one of the biggest stars known to man .
The red supergiant is also one of the most luminous stars , emitting 100,000 times more light than the Sun .
For decades , astronomers have struggled to explain how the mysterious red supergiants expel such vast amounts of material .
They can shed the mass of the Sun in just 10,000 years .
One theory was that the loss could be shed from areas above the star ’s polar caps as they rotate .
But the two teams , who have studied the supergiant with the NACO and AMBER instruments on ESO ’s Very Large Telescope , have concluded that it is powerful gas motions within the star that force out the huge mass of gas .
Huge :
The plume of gas seen in the artist 's impression , left , and captured by NACO on ESO 's Very Large Telescope .
Gas spewed out from Betelgeuse to a distance equivalent to travelling from Neptune to the Sun
One team captured the sharpest image to date of Betelgeuse using NACO , an adaptive optics instrument , and a ‘ lucky imaging ’ technique , which combines the sharpest exposures to surpass the accuracy of a long exposure .
The resulting image approaches the theoretical limit of resolution possible with the 8 - metre telescope .
It is so sharp it could even spot a tennis ball on the International Space Station from Earth .
‘ Thanks to these outstanding images , we have detected a large plume of gas extending into space from the surface of Betelgeuse , ’ lead researcher Pierre Kervella from the Paris Observatory told the website PhysOrg .
The plume bursts out to at least six times the diameter of the star - about the distance from Sun to Neptune .
‘ This is a clear indication that the whole outer shell of the star is not shedding matter evenly in all directions , ’ adds Kervella .
Bigger picture : Betelgeuse within the constellation Orion is identified by a marker , left , and in a zoom
Meanwhile , results from AMBER revealed intense up - and - down motion of gas within Betelgeuse ’s atmosphere .
Keiichi Ohnaka from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn , Germany , said : ' Our AMBER observations are the sharpest observations of any kind ever made of Betelgeuse .
' Moreover , we detected how the gas is moving in different areas of Betelgeuse ’s surface - the first time this has been done for a star other than the Sun .
News Flash : I Didn't Like Hooters ( With Footnotes by a Straight Man ) *
all photos kelly o
It is 11:37 a.m. in the Hooters parking lot , and the festivities have already begun .
Beneath a be-Hootered banner , two men play " Crocodile Rock " on dueling pianos .
The pianos , however , are not pianos .
Instead , two electric keyboards have been implanted in black piano - shaped boxes .
If dueling pianos can be said to become " more depressing , " this has occurred .
To the right of the dueling electric piano - shaped boxes is a rectangular fenced - in pen , in which 50 or so Hooters girls are milling about in their traditional orange baby - shorts and white Skechers and diarrhea - colored panty hose .
Close quarters .
It is hot outside .
The air smells of manure .
This is no ordinary Hooters franchise — it is a Hooters casino , one of only three in the known world1 ( if a Hooters restaurant can be said to become " more depressing , " this has occurred ) .
2 Prior to its Hooterizing , the space already housed a casino .
That casino was called Rascals .
Rascals is dead now .
Hooters lives .
We have come to the grand opening of the Hooters of South Park — a semi-industrial , working - class neighborhood south of Seattle , most recently famous for a horrific murder — to witness a fat man cut a symbolic ribbon with a pair of oversize novelty scissors .
Also , we will eat wings .
Also , die a little inside .
I know Hooters is nothing new .
I 'm sure feminists have been pitching fits about it since the first one opened in Buttfuck , Florida , in 1983 .
But Hooters is new to me .
I managed to avoid Hooters for the first 27 years of my life — much as I avoided strip clubs and other social transactions geared toward the male boner — and I was not , I discovered , quite ready for Hooters .
After a few minutes , a handler lets some of the Hooters girls out of their pen , and they receive Hula - hoops .
We ( journalists , family members , Rascals regulars in mourning ) sit in folding chairs and watch as the girls gyrate to " Do n't Stop Believin ' " while the dueling pianists offer commentary on their bodies and gyrations .
" Not only do they do that , " one of the pianists leers , " later , they will serve you all food . "
He transitions seamlessly into " Summer of ' 69 . "
The girls wiggle and bounce in the manure - scented parking lot .
" Those were the best days of my life ... "
The aforementioned fat man comes out and makes a speech about how working at Hooters is " empowering . " 3 I sigh forever .
We enter the restaurant , 4 seat ourselves in a booth , and meet our waitress , a truly sweet young lady who , in the spirit of Hooters Family Restaurants , I 'm going to go ahead and call Professor Boobies .
She is nervous .
Clearly , she has been instructed to flirt with us .
" So have you all eaten at Hooters restaurants before ? " Professor Boobies asks , looking around the table expectantly .
" Yes . " 5 " Yes . " " Yes . " " No . " I have not .
I am the only one .
" Oooooooo ! " she peeps .
" Hooters viiiiiiirgin ! " I prepare to lose my Hooters virginity .
I hope Hooters will use a condom .
" It 's nice outside , huh ? " Professor Boobies asks .
" Yeah , it 's sunny ! " we reply .
" And in September ! " " It 's almost October , " I remind her .
" HALLOWEEEEEN ! " she cries , clapping her hands .
On the table are several copies of the September / October issue of Hooters : The Magazine , Special 2009 Swimsuit Spectacular Issue .
The Hooters magazine breaks down as follows : 60 percent titties ( faux ) , 20 percent sports , 14 percent idiotic bullshit , 1 percent Ted Nugent , and 5 percent extra titties ( because , titties ! ) .
The back page is an editorial called " A Separate Set of Rules ! " by one I. J. Rosenberg , who owns a " sports marketing company " in Atlanta .
I. J. Rosenberg believes that celebrities , or " ' special ' people , " get special treatment , that they live by " a separate set of rules , " and that this double standard has led our country into a " financial and moral crisis . "
I. J. Rosenberg cites many damning instances of celebrities who " never really paid the price , " including Bill Clinton ( " Clinton lied to me , to you , and to the rest of the American people " ) , Ted Kennedy ( " Is he still a senator ?
He 's the epitome of ' never goes away ' " — oops ! ) , and O. J. Simpson ( " For 12 years after being acquitted for the murder of his ex-wife , The Juice walked the streets " ) .
I. J. Rosenberg demands justice .
Exclamation point !
Of particular note in Hooters : The Magazine is the " JOKES " page , which offers a quip about the terror of rectal thermometers ( that 's like gay buttsex , you know ! ) ; the story of " Joan , the rather well - proportioned secretary " who did n't realize she was lying naked on a skylight ; a handful of old - timey blond jokes ; and a humorous exchange between two hunters : " Hey , you almost hit my wife . "
" Terribly sorry .
Have a shot at mine , over there . "
Periodically , waitresses come by and ask if we want them to sign our magazines .
" Yes ? " we reply .
" I 'll sign on the page number of how old I am , " says Professor Boobies , " and do n't say 16 ! "
Um , I was n't going to ?
The owner of the franchise , a remarkably uncharismatic man in an orange tie , comes by to say hello .
I shake his hand much harder than is necessary .
" Our motto is : Every day we throw a party and you 're invited , " he tells us , distracted ( by boobies ? ) .
" We 're committed to the growth of entertainment and excitement in the Seattle area . "
Eye contact is minimal .
6
Finally , wings arrive .
" Let me guess :
Are you guys a spicy table or a not - spicy table ? "
Professor Boobies asks .
We wait for her to guess .
She does n't .
" Spicy ? " we say .
" I knew it ! " ( Then why did n't you guess ? )
The wings are deep - fried , which I did not expect .
Grease runs down my chin .
Professor Boobies ' acrylic nails make it difficult for her to open the small , prepackaged tub of ranch dressing .
One nail accidentally pierces the foil , and she has to go in the back for help .
I dip the wing in the ranch .
I feel fat and condescending .
In modern times , because of " society " and " women 's rights , " it 's not acceptable to be ( publicly ) a person who likes their women dumb , subservient , seminude , and kept in a pen .
A lady is n't just boobs with legs , an animated sexy mannequin that brings you food , and you cannot shoot a lady in the face just because she nags or wo n't give you a mouth - hug on your johnson ( see : " JOKES " section , above ) .
Anymore .
We did that already ( see : caveman times through 1975 ) .
Except at Hooooooters !
Hooters is like a misogyny theme park , where intellectual curiosity is kept to a minimum ( see : I. J. Rosenberg ) , all the women are girls , all the girls who were n't born " empowered " have cut open their chests and stuck plastic bags of goo in there and sewn 'em up again in the name of making money and making men happy , and no one 's shaming you into treating them like humans with brain - parts .
You 're paying for the privilege , after all .
They have the right to vote , after all ( going on 100 years now !
Girl power ! ) .
Jesus Christ .
I 'm raising my daughters to be ugly .
It 's like — a friend pointed out later — if someone opened a restaurant called Niggers , and the all - black waitstaff dressed like slaves and step ' n ' fetched you platters of watermelon , and when it was your birthday they were all , " Jump - down - turn - around - pick - a - bale - of - cotton ! " and brought you a cake in the shape of a bale of cotton .
And racists could go !
And indulge their desire to be publicly racist under the guise of a fun-loving theme restaurant !
Niggers !
It 's all in fun .
It really is like that .
7
Eventually , when we can eat no more curly fries , the Hooters girls , under the watchful eye of orange - tie - man , clap their hands and sing a loud song .
It is last call .
Lunch is over .
Some of the Hooters girls seem happy ; some do n't .
It 's a job .
They get to make some money .
They are pretty .
Some of them have fake hair .
Maybe they want more than Hooters ; maybe they do n't .
Maybe it 's just a restaurant .
We step outside into the bright parking lot , hot in September .
I 'm glad I 'm not wearing panty hose .
It smells like manure .
* Footnotes
by Paul Constant
1 . The others are in Las Vegas and Spokane .
This month , Renton will boast the world 's first Hooters restaurant and bowling alley .
2 . Let 's visit with the devil 's advocate for a minute .
Every job waiting tables sucks .
How is a job waiting tables at , say , the Cheesecake Factory any better ?
You have to wear a silly , impractical outfit ( white jeans ?
In a kitchen ? ) .
You may not be objectified as openly , but you still flirt for tips .
And how about the poor , wretched human beings at Cold Stone Creamery or Johnny Rockets , forced to sing for their tips while wearing silly outfits ?
Is that somehow okay because it 's not sexual ?
And Hooters waitresses probably make better tips .
One could argue that Hooters does n't create a problem , it just capitalizes on it .
We are America .
We have capitalized on our problems from the very beginning .
At least some women are making more money off of it now , right ?
Right ?
3 . The fat man also makes a speech about how he will protect the Hooters brand .
It 's unclear exactly what he 's going to protect Hooters from — socialism ? — but he made that vow , in front of journalists and family members and the all - encompassing odor of shit .
So if something awful happens to the Hooters brand because of the Hooters casino in South Park , we all will know who has failed in his sacred calling .
4 . To get into the restaurant , we have to walk through a gauntlet of cheering Hooters girls .
A reporter for some local publication or other , a large , slovenly , doofy guy with a goatee , holds up his hands and throws his chin in the air pridefully , accepting the applause like some loose - fit - khaki - wearing potentate returning home from JCPenney with a great bounty .
5 . My previous trip to Hooters :
On a business trip to Washington , D.C. , three middle - aged ladies thought it would be hee - larious to drag their bookish young employee to a Hooters for a business lunch .
I ate a pale , gamy chicken sandwich , watched a Hooters waitress try to teach an awestruck 3 - year - old boy how to Hula - hoop ( she was probably more successful at creating a future panty - hose fetishist ) , and puked my lunch back out on the side of NPR 's headquarters during the walk back .
6 . If you are embarrassed to be in a Hooters and you are a straight man , eye contact is incredibly problematic .
You do n't want to just stare the waitress in the eye , because that seems to somehow proclaim " I 'm not staring at your tits " in a very blatant way .
So you just have to look at the tabletop , or some neon orange thing or another , or your glistening food .
7 . Okay , it 's not quite like that .
But here 's the most problematic thing about the Hooters brand : its positioning as a family restaurant , built on family values .
They encourage people to bring their kids .
They sell child - size Hooters T - shirts ( one kid 's T - shirt has handprints all over it , and it reads " Hooters Girls Can't Keep Their Hands Off Me " ) and even Hooters bibs and onesies for infants .
In this way , it is more dishonest than , say , strip clubs or porn , which are clearly for adults .
Hooters avoids that kind of stigma in part thanks to regular and publicized charitable donations — today 's restaurant opening trumpeted a gift to a local cystic fibrosis foundation and featured a heartfelt , and incredibly awkward , speech about the horrible disease by the relative of a CF sufferer .
The exceptionally well - preserved fossil primate known as " Ida " is not a missing link as some have claimed , according to an analysis in the journal Nature .
The research is the first independent assessment of the claims made in a scientific paper and a television documentary earlier this year .
Dr Erik Seiffert says that Ida belonged to a group more closely linked to lemurs than to monkeys , apes or us .
His team 's conclusions come from an analysis of another fossil primate .
The newly described animal - known as Afradapis longicristatus - lived some 37 million years ago in northern Egypt , during the Eocene epoch .
And the researchers say it was closely related to Ida .
This study would effectively remove Ida from our ancestry .
Erik Seiffert , Stony Brook University Ida lived some 47 million years ago and was given the scientific name Darwinius masillae .
Dr Seiffert and his colleagues say that both Afradapis and Darwinius were in a sister group to the so - called " higher primates " , which includes humans .
This extinct sister group , they say , was more closely related to lemurs and lorises .
Cul - de-sac '' The suggestion that Ida [ was ] ... specifically related to the higher primates , namely monkeys apes and humans , was actually a minority view from the start .
So it came as a surprise to many of us who are studying primate palaeontology , " said Dr Seiffert , from Stony Brook University in New York , US .
'' Ida , which is a member of this genus called Darwinius , is in a fossil group called the Adapiforms which have traditionally been seen as more closely related to the lemurs and lorises - which live today in Madagascar , Africa and Asia - than to [ monkeys , apes and humans ] . "
This group , including this new specimen described in Nature , has a lot of traits that are found in apes and monkeys
Jorn Hurum , Natural History Museum , Oslo
He added : " We have analysed a large data set based on observations we have made on almost 120 living and extinct primates and what we find ... [ is that ]
Darwinius and this new genus that we 've described are not part of our ancestry .
" They are more closely related to lemurs and lorises than they are to tarsirs or monkeys , apes and humans .
This study would effectively remove Ida from our ancestry . "
Dr Jorn Hurum , from the Natural History Museum in Oslo , Norway , was one of the authors of the paper about Ida published in the journal Plos One this year .
Responding to the study in Nature , he said : " It 's a very interesting paper , and - at last - this is the start of the scientific discussion around the specimen we described in May nicknamed Ida . "
He added : " What the authors say is that this is an extinct side branch of the group leading to lemurs that is not in any way related to apes and monkeys .
" What we said in our scientific paper in May is that this group - including this new specimen described in Nature - has a lot of traits that are found in apes and monkeys . "
However , Dr Seiffert and his colleagues regard such features as examples of " convergent evolution " .
This involves features arising independently in separate lineages , possibly as a response to similar evolutionary pressures .

SAN JOSE , Calif . - The San Jose City Council is set to vote on a $ 200,000 settlement offer to a female firefighter who said she was harassed after complaining about hard - core pornography at her firehouse .
Julie LaBlanc sued the city in 2008 after she found a pornographic magazine under her 9 - year - old son 's pillow that he said he found at the firehouse .
LaBlanc alleged she found more than 60 other such magazines at work the next day .
She said she was taunted and shunned by fellow firefighters while the city investigated her complaints .
San Jose has a policy prohibiting sexually explicit material in the workplace .
The city council is expected to take up the matter Oct. 20 .
LaBlanc 's attorney would not comment on the pending settlement .
A Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) proposal that would require Internet service providers to treat all network traffic equally was met with resistance by Republicans on Capitol Hill today .
FCC chairman , Julius Genachowski is expected to unveil a policy that advocates network neutrality this week .
If the policy is implemented , providers would no longer be able to interfere with information that flows through their networks .
ISPs , including Comcast , have managed peer - to - peer network traffic to alleviate network congestion , and oppose the concept .
Senate Republicans also stand in opposition to net neutrality , and moved to deny the FCC funding for developing or implementing new Internet regulations .
Genachowski was appointed to the FCC by President Obama .
“ I am deeply concerned by the direction the FCC appears to be heading .
Even during a severe downturn , America has experienced robust investment and innovation in network performance and online content and applications , ” Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said in a statement .
”
She said that regulations could stifle innovation , and that the marketplace would respond to companies that exhibit questionable behavior .
Vinton Cerf , co-inventor of the Internet Protocol and Google evangalist , and Tim Berners - Lee , creator of the World Wide Web , favor network neutrality .
Berners - Lee believes that ISPs seek to shift customers to a tiered pricing model , where access to information pipelines will be tightly controlled .
I agree with Berners - Lee , and would rather see preemptive regulation than for Internet users to lose the benefits of the Internet .
Toll booths would impede–not encourage –innovation .

A Plain Man's Universe -
No maths .
Let us take another quiet look at Universe and its reality .
As we are inextricably part of its process and our sight is therefore distorted by our involvement , it is better that we step outside and view it from its exterior , otherwise we are trying to study herd - management from within the mucky depths of a cow 's omasum - third stomach .
Universe is biggish ?
Comparative to our size , yes , so let us reduce it to something more manageable that , like an amorphous balloon , we can hold handily before us for our inspection .
This is the complete Universe we have here , containing within it all that has ever happened in it .
It is complete .
It contains any beginning that it has ever had , whatever it may be , through to and including its final state , finite or infinite .
It 's all still there ; it has nowhere else to ' go ' .
From this perspective you may note - look , just there - the formation of the planet earth , never far in on this Universal scale , and on it the scum of life formed and eventuating , as on so many other planets on countless stars within countless other galaxies .
Universe , as seen from here , is very different from what humans normally perceive .
For the chemical organisms that living things are , observation and perception require the action of their chemical processes as they move across space , so that their impression of anything and everything necessarily has to be always fleeting and transitory , from within a moving and limiting bubble of consciousness and with the illusion of ' time ' .
We can only see a moving universe instead of also the aspect of its ' timeless ' stillness at all stages of what we see as its ' action ' .
Suppose you take a photograph ; this is the closest we can get to seeing a true state of Universe .
The ' now ' of the event still remains , as an ineradicable part of Universe , but your bubble of consciousness , as provided by the ever - continuing action of your materials in their movement with your consciousness in and across expanding space , has moved on .
Say " now and now and now " , and each ' now ' is twenty miles removed from the last , as the planet girates onward on its path around the sun , apart from the movement of the sun around the galaxy , or the galaxy onward relevant to other distant galaxies .
But the previous ' now ' still exists and is no less real just because our fleeting ' awareness ' is no longer inhabiting it .
So the reality , as we now see , is that ' yesterday ' is still there , the microbial ancestors of dinosaurs still exist , and all the future to and including the final completed state is already there .
Thus , as we see , ' time ' does not exist ; what the humans call ' time ' is really only a relative position in space and distance in and across which our materials act , thus giving us the impression of ' time ' and a view of Universe only ' in action ' .
And now we can see that Universe is all formed of just one ingredient : space .
Distorsions in mere space give the effect of sub-atomic particles , which combine to form the effect of atoms and their concomitant action , which combine to form the effect of molecules , and so animate and inanimate matter .
It is this Universal action that on an atomic scale animates our materials and enables our observation and also our decomposition when our observation finishes and we are what the still - alive then call " dead " .
Matter also gives the effect of binding energy of the atoms , their weak repulsive force when their stability is disturbed , gravity , and galactic repulsion over vast distances , which is caused by the distant expansion of space which carries the receding galaxies static within it .
In fact , it seems that gravity and the binding energy are also the effect of the compression or concentration of space .
And all these different forces are merely harmonics of the single force provided by these products of the same basic ingredient of space .
I will mention that you can neither add nor subtract a single atom to or from Universe .
Furthermore , you cannot influence its totality differently in any way .
You may thrash about in your own little locality within it if you wish , but if you do , then your wanting to and doing so was previously ( prior in space ) caused by the combination of your experience and the influence of your genetic programming , so that it had to happen and was always prescribed and predestined within the completed Universe , irrespective of what you might intend or try .
If it were possible to run the process of this Universe a million times , it would have no alternative other than to happen in exactly the same way , every time .
Every particle is as it has to be at any point in space , and when it has to change , due to external influence or to the instability of its composition , then it changes to the state prescribed by its circumstance .
It has no other option , and in that respect , Universe is perfect .
( Yes , I know , a bus parked on your foot may give you a different impression , but that is the difference between ' perfect ' and ' ideal ' . )
Incidentally , we can also see that the acceleration of expanding space causes these galaxies here to recede at many times the speed of light from those galaxies remote from them over there .
It is simply a matter of sufficient distance between them .
If this fact offends scientific decorum in some sense that 's unfortunate , but that 's just the way it is and complaints should be taken up with Universe .
Is Universe alive ?
Well , like some of the foregoing , that question may be a little ' unscientific ' and depend on terminology and so on , though is none the less real or pertinent for all that .
Here is a grain of sand .
With some more of the same it can be made into a silicon chip which , in a computer , can ' think ' .
But is it alive ?
Between my ears I have half a pound of somewhat yucky greyish meat , with which I am able to process evidence from my view of the world and to ' think ' .
Am I alive ?
( One moment . . .
Ye-es , at the moment , still slightly so . )
But Universe contains not only all of us , together with all other thinking life - forms that undoubtedly exist , it also contains everything that exists in the Universe , all interconnected by attractive and repulsive energies and electro - magnetism . . .
Does it think ?
It would be very surprising if awareness and perception did not exist in it , in ways and means of which we presently can have no conception .
So , is Universe alive ?
Is it aware of us ? - I remember forty - odd years ago ' scientists ' pontificating gravely that " The only thing of which we can be quite certain is that it is unconscious of us " .
- Oh ?
What is Universe ? -
Well , what is a grain of sand ?
No , WHAT is it ?
Is n't Universe simple ?
Just one ingredient , already complete . . .
In fact , since it is , and has no other option , it is absolutely simple .
Is that simple enough for you ?
We might even ask why ' scientists ' should want to make something so sublimely simple so incomprehensibly complicated - as if we did n't know .
No maths ? - Sorry , no maths .
Someone at ESPN just lost their job .

[ The 20 Or So Greatest GameDay Signs – Ever ]
As seen way back in 2008 , pre-Peephole - Gate .
In a discussion I seem to keep having these days when I mention that human spaceflight is actually a valuable endeavour for a nation , I ’m usually met with a look of incongruity .
Then the question :
What has space exploration ever done for us ?
I used to get a little angry about this question ( of course space exploration is important ! ) but in actuality , I have to explain the answer because it is n’t necessarily obvious .
By pushing into space , a nation can enrich its technology , improve education , boost employment in skilled areas , thereby improving the economy and generally improving a nation ’s standing in the world .
That ’s the eco-friendly version .
There are other applications such as military prowess , strategic advantage and business potential .
Unfortunately , doing bold things in space requires money , and to get money you need to convince the government that it ’s worth spending money on .
Last time I looked , there ’s no Space Race 2 going on , so we ca n’t rely on politics to see the necessity of space flight .
However , the US has invested billions of dollars in the exploration of space , and although NASA is a money - hungry entity , it produces results and has shaped the world as we know it .
Granted , the US space agency was built on Cold War ideals and was hinged around the sole purpose of beating the Soviets to the Moon , but modern NASA is still relevant , if not more so .
Rockets and healthcare
From space , and back to Earth with a bump .
I watched a series of fascinating videos of the protests that went on in Washington D.C. on September 12th concerning President Obama ’s healthcare reform plans .
The Tea Party ( not Twinnings , or Boston … some other tea party that did n’t have a lot of tea ) exploded to life to the sound of tens of thousands of voices protesting “ socialist ” healthcare .
Apparently , a nationalized healthcare system is a bad thing .
The arguments against Obama ’s plan seem rather outlandish to me , and a hardcore group of protesters ( not all the protesters , just a few apparently missing a sanity gene ) accused the US President of being a “ communist , ” “ socialist , ” “ Marxist ” and ( most shockingly ) a “ Nazi . ”
So , here we are , with a field - full of rabid protesters that have been whipped up into a frenzy by the media , special interest groups and political antagonizers .
These geniuses see a nationalized healthcare system as a socialist agenda .
Of course , this means communism is just down the garden path .
Last time I looked , the UK was n’t a communist state , and although the British National Health Service ( NHS ) is n’t perfect , it ’s a damn sight better than the US health insurance insanity .
The point I ’m trying to make is that tens of thousands of people descended on the US capital to protest a healthcare bill that actually seems quite sensible .
Unfortunately , this huge group believe this bill is actually a government conspiracy intended to dupe the public , bankrupt the country and control the nation .
NASA losses
Now let ’s wind back the clock to last year , when it was announced NASA would be shedding thousands of jobs when the space shuttle is retired .
More recently , a task group was formed to discuss NASA ’s options considering its budget is n’t going to grow any time soon — unfortunately , Bush ’s “ Vision for Space Exploration ” ca n’t be done because the Constellation Program will cost too much .
Now the Augustine Commission has set out some plans that may curtail NASA ’s big projects , possibly even cancelling Constellation .
To top all this off , there is a 5 - year gap ( minimum ) between the shuttle being retired and Constellation taking over ( if that even happens ) , that means there will be at least 5 years the US will have without a manned launch vehicle .
Yes , the US has gone through this before ( between the end of the Apollo Program in 1970 and the Shuttle Program in 1982 ) , but this time we could lose access to the space station , a $ 100 billion project the US is heavily invested in .
Fortunately , US companies are seeing business opportunities in space , so given enough funding , start - ups like SpaceX could start ferrying NASA astronauts into LEO sooner rather than later .
There are also other nations involved in the space station and they can give us a lift into space .
Unfortunately , apart from the Shuttle , there ’s only one other spacecraft that ’s human - rated in the world .
That ’s Soyuz .
Russian Roulette
Soyuz is great , it ’s a sturdy vehicle and it ’s received little complaint from the astronauts and cosmonauts that have been ferried around in it ( well , most of the time ) .
The Russian space agency will basically be offering NASA taxi rides into space so the US can still use the International Space Station .
The cost ?
$ 50 million per seat .
Wow , what a bargain .
The space shuttle costs the best part of a billion dollars to launch every time .
Compare that with $ 50 million , it almost seems as if this 5 - year gap is a good thing .
It might save NASA some money !
However , in the process of retiring the shuttle , skilled US jobs will be lost .
Even the transition from the shuttle program to Constellation will cause a re-shuffle of NASA employees .
Last year , Senator Bill Nelson pointed out that shedding jobs from the US space agency , only to rely on a Russian launch vehicle , will have the effect of generating jobs in Russia .
This might seem like an over - exaggeration , but it may indirectly be the case .
The added concern is that the $ 50 million value per Soyuz seat could increase .
After all , US - Russia relations are n’t exactly toasty , the Russian space agency could set its own price for taxi rides to the space station .
NASA money will be spent , not on advancing US spaceflight capabilities , but on another nation ’s spaceflight capabilities .
Sure , NASA and Roscosmos are co-operating now , but both are government - backed entities and that co-operation could turn south during the next East - West political upset .
Conclusion
In summary , until US spaceflight companies develop human - rated space vehicles , or until the Constellation Project ( or equivalent ) is finished , the US will be wholly dependent on Russia for human spaceflight .
NASA will be paying a premium rate for that privilege .
So when I see thousands of individuals crowding on Capitol Hill , angrily protesting about the idiotic belief that the President of the USA is on the verge of creating a communist state , I think about NASA and the fact that the US space agency has been forced to pay for seats on board a spaceship maintained by an ex-communist state the US government is having problems with .

Less
More than a million people could find themselves unable to buy a home after Britain 's financial watchdog said it planned to ban lenders from offering mortgages to people who cannot prove their income .
Experts criticised what they said was an " over - reaction " from the Financial Services Authority , saying that while there were abuses in the run-up to the credit crunch , the vast majority of such " self - certification " loans were legitimate .
Even the FSA said it accepted that the mortgage market worked well for " 95 per cent of consumers " .
As the borrower does not have to prove his or her income to their lender , self - cert mortgages are usually used by small businessmen and freelancers , whose numbers are set to increase significantly as unemployment continues to rise .
Economists say the jobless total will not peak until next spring .
Ray Boulger , senior technical manager at mortgage broker John Charcol , said : " This seems excessive .
When the recovery gets under way and mortgages become more widely available they will be shutting people out of the market when what they are supposed to do is protect them .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" The FSA says it can't understand why anyone would need a self - certification mortgage .
That 's a damning indictment of its understanding of the market .
Often a small business person will take one out because in the time it takes them to prepare the accounts they need to prove their income they could lose a house . "
Mr Boulger estimated that a million or more of the 10 million home loans in Britain were self - certification mortgages .
He said that the vast majority of them were perfectly legitimate .
The Council of Mortgage Lenders was more measured , but it expressed similar fears .
Director general Michael Coogan said : " There is a risk that the new FSA rules may end up making it more difficult to get a mortgage for those people who used self - cert for perfectly legitimate reasons .
We will want to work with the FSA to make sure that the new rules do n't have negative spin - off consequences , and end up slowing down market recovery or excluding creditworthy borrowers . "
There were also warnings that the FSA 's plans could result in an increase in financial exclusion , with banks reverting to the practice of only lending to the " safest " borrowers for fear of the upsetting the watchdog .
Rosali Pretorius , financial markets and regulation partner at City law firm Denton Wilde Sapte said : " The FSA should be careful not to throw out the baby with the bathwater .
Not so long ago , there were widespread concerns on financial exclusion .
Impose too many rigours on the banks and the ' hard - working families ' the politicians are fond to speak of will have no access to lending to get on the housing ladder .
Unusual applicants should not be excluded just because the breadwinners are self - employed or cannot easily get conventional insurance on account of medical conditions . "
Privately , lenders voiced deep unhappiness about the plans , arguing that they were being criticised by the Government for failing to lend enough to consumers while the FSA was proposing new curbs .
But the watchdog defended its stance .
Jon Pain , FSA managing director of supervision , said : " We are not trying to make it impossible for self - employed people to get mortgages .
They will just have to prove their incomes . "
Mr Pain said that nearly " half " the mortgages advanced prior to the advent of the credit crunch were either self - certification or fast - tracked , meaning borrowers were able to obtain loans without providing any evidence that they could afford to pay them back .
" For the vast majority of consumers the mortgage market works well .
What we are trying to do is deal with the excesses .
There are still 400,000 people in arrears and if we can stop some people going through that , it would be a good thing . "
Other measures being considered by the FSA include the possible introduction of a cap on the amount banks lend to people based on multiples of their incomes " in the future " .
The watchdog also said it was concerned that large loans were frequently advanced to risky groups such as people with low incomes and / or high debt .
It described this as a " toxic mix " and said it would act to prevent it from happening by forcing lenders to ensure borrowers pass " affordability tests " .
It proposes making mortgage brokers personally accountable to the FSA while lenders are likely to be banned from imposing charges that allow them to profit when their customers go into arrears .
The FSA said its proposals followed the emergence of banks engaging in what it called " high - risk lending strategies which typically focused on higher risk borrowers ; relaxed credit standards ; and a mutual assumption by too many borrowers and lenders that the good times could not end " .
If they are adopted as they stand in yesterday 's discussion paper they will mark a significant departure for the regulator , which has until now fought shy of regulating financial products , preferring to focus on the way they are sold .
The watchdog said consumers were as much at fault as lenders for problems in the market in the run-up to the credit crunch and suggested that they needed protecting from themselves .
" We believe that irresponsible borrowing has been just as much a part of the problem in the mortgage market as irresponsible behaviour by firms .
Most consumers , of course , have acted responsibly , but a significant minority have made decisions which were imprudent and which they should have been in a position to recognise as such in advance , " it said in its discussion document .
While the industry was unhappy with its proposals , consumer groups were more welcoming .
Which ?
chief executive Peter Vicary - Smith said : " We 're pleased that the FSA is looking to take a more robust approach to regulating the mortgage market although we would like to see tougher measures such as a ban on mortgages over 100 per cent and the naming of lenders that mistreat their customers .
" Mortgage providers are already responsible for assessing affordability , so why is the FSA only getting tough on it now ?
Many borrowers are suffering the consequences of irresponsible lending . "
Currently it is hard to get a mortgage of greater than 70 per cent of a home 's value without paying a substantial premium but the market has been liberalising in recent weeks with lenders finally willing to take greater risks .
The new rules : Can you beat them ?
* While tighter lending rules may help stop families over - committing themselves , the FSA 's proposals could also hit anyone planning to take out a mortgage or remortgage .
A ban on self - certified loans would hit the self - employed and freelance workers , while new affordability tests could make it harder for first - time buyers .
Existing borrowers may also be hit when they come to remortgage as more cautious lenders may move them into a higher risk bracket .
The proposals will mean more paperwork for self - employed people .
They will need to provide three years ' worth of accounts , or a letter from their accountant confirming their income .
Anyone with less than three years ' self - employment may still be able to get a mortgage , if they can prove affordability .
Many lenders already use affordability rather than income levels as a way to decide whether to agree a loan .
They generally want to examine bank statements – say six months ' worth – to see how much money you have coming in and what your outgoings are .
If the FSA 's proposals are adopted , lenders are likely to ask for even more details of your spending .
The net result will be that if you can't prove you can afford a mortgage , you wo n't get one .
On top of that existing mortgage - holders who may have inflated their income to get their loan could have problems if they need to remortgage .

Case study ' It will be much tougher for me '
* Georgina Burnett , 30 , is a self - employed television presenter and life coach .
She is getting married next September , and currently rents a house in Sevenoaks , Kent with her fiancée .
I became a headhunter after leaving university but I 've been freelancing for about six years now .
My fiancée and I moved in together a year ago , and chose to live outside London – even though both of us work there – because you get so much more for your money .
We were always looking at properties .
However , the new rules make me think that I should hold off and save up for a bigger deposit .
People who go self - employed or freelance will find proving their income especially difficult , because – particularly when you first set out – your earnings are so uncertain .
Even people who are well established sometimes earn double in one month what they will in another .
So I suppose the new regulations will make all self - employed people think twice about getting a mortgage .
It is also a strange time to be self - employed .
I have noticed that whereas before I 'd be booked up well in advance , it is now all very last minute .
At the beginning of the month you 're looking at the number of days you 've got booked in , unsure about how much you 'll be earning .
The last thing you want is a huge mortgage hanging over your head .
Although the other rules seem quite intrusive on the surface – the lenders will be able to look at exactly how much you 're earning , and what you spend on your lifestyle – I suppose their argument is that if you 've got nothing to hide then you 've got nothing to worry about .
If I was lending someone that much money , I 'd want to know it was going to be paid back .
I kind of agree with the general idea behind the new rules , because things do have to change .
I personally would never want to borrow more than I could afford to pay – I would n't want that kind of pressure on me .
But this is n't going to help me get on to the property ladder .
Five years ago , Internet traffic was , for the most part , managed by tier 1 providers like AT&T , Verizon , Level 3 Communications , and Global Crossing , all of which connected to thousands of tier 2 networks and regional providers .
Today , that has changed .
Now , instead of traffic being distributed among tens of thousands of networks , only 150 networks control some 50 % of all online traffic .
Among these new Internet superpowers , it 's no surprise to find Google listed .
In fact , the search giant accounts for the largest source ( 6 % ) of all Internet traffic worldwide .
This data comes from a new report put out by Arbor Networks , who has just completed a two - year study of 256 exabytes of Internet traffic data , the largest study of global traffic since the start of the commercial Internet in the mid-1990's .
" Hyper Giants " Rule Today 's Internet
The biggest trend to come out of Arbor Networks ' report is clearly that of the Internet 's consolidation .
Today 's Internet is " flatter " and " more densely connected " than ever before , reveals Arbor Networks ' Chief Research Officer Danny McPherson .
Not only is Google the largest traffic source , there are only 30 large companies in addition to Google and including sites like Facebook , Microsoft and YouTube which now account for a disproportionate 30 % of all Internet traffic .
According to Craig Labovitz , chief scientist at Arbor Networks , this shift represents the Internet 's move into a second phase where it's no longer " all about contacting websites . "
Rather , " over the past two years larger organizations have been buying up the smaller websites and by July 2009 , 30 per cent of the internet was owned by a few large sites . "
The acquisitions , the result of billions of dollars spent by large companies snapping up smaller ones , has created a new Internet core of " hyper giants , " a coin termed by the report .
The other companies making the list of Internet giants include names like Akamai , Limelight , BitGravity , Highwinds , and Gravity - hardly household names , and certainly not big telco providers .
Instead , these content delivery networks ( CDNs ) , are the new Internet backbone that help move large amounts of data across the web .
So Long P2P , Hello Streaming Media
Consolidation is not the only trend revealed by the new findings , however .
The report also discovered a sharp decline in peer - to - peer traffic , which only two years prior peaked at 40 % of all traffic worldwide .
Today , while still a hefty number , P2P traffic has dropped down to 18 % .
Why the change ?
For the most part , the file - sharing that took place on networks like Limewire and Napster back in the late 90's and early 2000's , has now been largely replaced by streaming video thanks to to sites like YouTube , Hulu , and Netflix .
Given easier and less technical ways of accessing media , consumers have begun to shift away from the headache of P2P to these new and often free or ad - supported sites .
Today , as much as 20 % of web traffic is video , Labovitz estimates .
As far as Internet traffic in general , more than half ( 52 % ) is web - based , up from 42 % in 2007 .
The remaining traffic comes from email and private networks .
A " Dramatic " Shift ?
" Saying the Internet has changed dramatically over the last five years is cliché - the Internet is always changing dramatically , " notes Labovitz .
" However , over the course of the last five years , we 've witnessed the start of an equally dramatic shift in the fundamental business of the Internet . "
He adds , " as content is getting faster and better quality it will change the face of the internet . "

The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded on Monday to two American social scientists for their work in describing the numerous relationships within a company or among companies and individuals that shape market behavior .
The prize committee cited Elinor Ostrom , 76 , at Indiana University , and Oliver E. Williamson , 77 , at the University of California , Berkeley , for work done over long careers .
Ms. Ostrom is the first woman to receive the economics prize in the 41 - year history of the award .
She is a political scientist , not an economist , and in honoring her , the judges seemed to suggest that economics should be thought of as an interdisciplinary field rather than a pure science governed by mathematics .
“ This award is part of the merging of the social sciences , ” said Robert Shiller , a Yale University economist .
“ Economics has been too isolated and too stuck on the view that markets are efficient and self - regulating .
It has derailed our thinking . ”
The Nobel judges in Stockholm notified the winners when it was 6:30 a.m. in Bloomington , Ind. , where Ms. Ostrom lives , and 3:30 a.m. in California .
Mr. Williamson ’s grown son , home on a visit , answered the ringing telephone and passed the call to his father , awakening him .
Ms. Ostrom said she , too , was awakened by the call and afterward made herself a cup of coffee in the kitchen .
Both expressed surprise that the award had come their way .
They will split $ 1.4 million in prize money .
Alonso's team are accused of fixing last year 's Singapore race Renault driver Fernando Alonso says he is " very surprised " by the race - fixing charge levelled at his team over last year 's Singapore Grand Prix .
The team are accused of plotting with driver Nelson Piquet Jr to crash in the race to provoke a safety car period in order to aid Alonso 's path to victory .
" I 'm very surprised , " Alonso said on Thursday at the Italian Grand Prix .
" I can not imagine these things , these situations .
It 's something that never entered my mind . "
F1 's governing body , the FIA , has called Renault to a hearing of its world motorsport council on 21 September to answer the charge .
If they are found guilty , they face severe sanctions , which could include expulsion from this year 's F1 world championship .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Renault have said they would not make any comment until after the hearing and Alonso refused to answer questions on the specifics of the allegation .
" I will not comment too much about this because the team said that as a team we will not comment , " the double world champion said .
" For me it 's not even the time to think about , or to pay attention to , this .
" It 's difficult to understand for me all this situation and this investigation .
It is just too incredible . "
Piquet was sacked by the Renault team after July 's Hungarian Grand Prix and has since been outspoken in his criticism of Renault team boss Flavio Briatore .
I was shocked at the allegations - I would be ashamed if it 's true
Rubens Barrichello
Brawn driver
There are reports that the Brazilian has told the FIA that he was asked to crash by the team before the race , and that Renault in their evidence to the FIA investigators denied this .
Asked directly whether he knew of any plan to ask Piquet to crash in Singapore , Alonso said : " No . " F1 is awash with conspiracy theories about the race and the investigation .
Brawn driver Rubens Barrichello said : " I hope we get the truth .
" It 's easier to crash a Formula 1 car than to drive one .
With all the power it 's quite easy to spin and crash , but I would be very disappointed if someone did that because someone said so .
" He [ Piquet ] is much younger than me but as a person he seems a very fair guy .
I was shocked at the allegations .
There are lots of rumours , which leads you to have all sorts of different ideas .
I would be ashamed if it 's true . "
Alonso won in Singapore last year when Piquet crashed two laps after the Spaniard had come in for a routine pit stop .
That meant that when race officials sent out the safety car to clear up the debris from Piquet 's car , Alonso was alone among the front - runners in not having to stop for fuel and tyres .
At the time , Piquet attributed the crash to a simple error , but he was dropped by Renault after July 's Hungarian Grand Prix and has since been outspoken in his criticism of Renault team boss Flavio Briatore .
The Brazilian specifically cited unequal treatment between himself and two - time world champion Alonso as the source of his discontent .
Former world champions
Renault have already been in the FIA dock this season .
They were banned for one race after a wheel flew off Alonso 's car at the Hungarian Grand Prix .
However , the suspension , which would have ruled Alonso out of his home race in Valencia in August , was lifted on appeal .

China , the Unwelcome Guest Controversy as Frankfurt Book Fair Fetes Beijing
China , which bans hundreds of books every year , was a controversial choice as the guest of honor at this year 's Frankfurt Book Fair .
But some of the Chinese authors appearing at the fair , which begins Wednesday , have managed to slip political works past the censors .
Hackers have found a way to create automated Facebook pages and are using them to spread spyware to unsuspecting users , says antivirus and Internet security firm AVG Technologies .
Artwork : Chip Taylor
In a blog entry posted last week , Research Chief Roger Thompson said that AVG 's LinkScanner users had started detecting some " rogue spyware attacks " that were coming from Facebook pages .
When AVG started looking at the pages , it noticed that the Facebook profiles featured pictures of the same woman and merely had different names to differentiate them .
Each page had a link to a supposed video that would infect user computers with spyware if clicked .
Thompson says that there are likely untold numbers of such rogue Facebook profiles on the Web right now , meaning that the hackers have somehow found a way to bypass Facebook 's CAPTCHA system that requires users to retype a series of letters to activate an account .
Thompson said that while Facebook will certainly delete any rogue accounts it finds , the accounts " ca n't be an easy thing for them to find " and will thus be difficult to eliminate .
Slideshow : Facebook Light gallery : Check out the new look
The Facebook spyware attack coincides with an FBI warning released today saying that cybercriminals are increasingly using social networking websites such as Facebook to launch attacks .
Among the popular techniques used by hackers are hijacking a user 's account and sending spam to their friends that leads to a phishing site ; creating applications on the site that include malware or rougue antivirus software ; and using malware to gain access to users ' personal information on their profiles .

This past Labor Day weekend was my very first time attending Dragon * Con as a publishing professional , and really my first “ real ” time at all .
I say first “ real ” time because I went three years ago for a single day to see Jetse de Vries , who was there at the time with Interzone .
I spent most of it with him at his table , watching the crowd pass him by for the guy next to him installing vampire teeth ( at $ 60 a pair , using the same dental instrument and , seemingly , not bothering to clean it between applications ) .
I left with the ( mistaken ) impression that it was a weird goth con with nothing to offer the book trade .
I came back when Mike Resnick and others kept telling me that I had it wrong , and what ’s more , the percentage of people there aware of and interested in books was growing every year , both in the demographics of the attendees and among the organizers .
So I was there with a specific agenda , which was to see if it was a place that Pyr books needs to be in future .
So in that light : Forget the 30,000 - 40,000 plus attendees or whatever the head count ends up being .
I was personally most impressed by the number of publishing professionals there .
Authors like Kevin J Anderson , Michael Stackpole , Gene Wolfe , Walter Jon Williams , Eric Flint , John Ringo , Alan Dean Foster , Sherrilyn Kenyon , Mike Resnick , Aleathea Kontis , Todd McCaffrey , Scott Sigler , Josepha Sherman , James Maxey , Catherine Asaro , Gail Z Martin , SM Stirling .
And many more I did n’t run into , such as Peter S Beagle , JF Lewis , Jody Lynn Nye , Christopher Golden , Diana Gabaldon , Charlaine Harris , Cherie Priest , Susan Sizemore , CL Wilson , Janny Wurts , Timothy Zahn , and Lois McMaster Bujold .
( I ’m leaving people out too , but the sheer number of famous / award - winning / best - selling authors in this list makes it comparable to a major literary con already . )
Then there was the art show – in a HUGE and very HIGH CEILING - ED space , and featuring artists like Bob Eggleton , Don Maitz , Rick Sternbach , and William Stout .
And then the publishers that were there – Editors like Ginger Buchanan ( Ace / Roc ) , Pablo Defendini ( Tor.com ) , Stacy Hague Hill ( Tor ) , Paul Stevens ( Tor ) , Jennifer Heddle ( Pocket ) , Toni Weisskopf ( Baen ) , Steven H Segal ( Weird Tales ) , Jason M Watlz ( Rogue Blades ) , and of course Yours Truly representing Pyr books .
As to how all these publishing folk were being received , I myself spoke on three panels and did one live podcast ( thanks , Mur ! ) .
The smallest panel had over 60 people in the audience , the largest around 120 , and the podcast was standing room only with about 60 people .
What ’s more , they were n’t the same people all weekend .
And lots of people came up to me and shook my hand and told me how they really appreciated what I said on my panels .
Personal highlights were hanging out with Mike & Carol Resnick , Jennifer Heddle , Mur Lafferty , Madelynn Martiniere , Pablo Defendini , Stacy Hague - Hill , James Maxey , Jason M Waltz , Rich Sternbach .
Was great to meet Scott Sigler and the folks from steampunk costumers Brute Force Studios .
Really loved the Baen books party Friday night ( and Toni Weisskopf is rapidly becoming one of my favorite people . )
Also loved meeting the folks from the Inner Worlds book discussion group too .
My assessment :
This feels very much like the place to be , and if it is n’t yet , it ’s going to be soon .
Probably very similar in vibe to the San Diego Comic Con when it was smaller , before Hollywood became the driving engine .
The other thing I noticed at Dragon * Con verses Comic Con is that , though it has that crucial young demographic , there seems more interaction between the age groups .
You saw children , teens , 20/30 somethings , parents with small children , and old folks , all hanging out together , rather than all there and then peeling off to hang separately .
I liked that a lot .
For the writer looking to do business as well as meet with fans , it ’s probably not there yet in the former category , but will be as more publishing professionals choose to attend in future .
And in terms of the attitude of the con to publishing , both the organizers and the audience certainly communicated that they were interested in books in general and Yours Truly in specific .
I felt appreciated , welcome , and productive .
I felt something slightly different when the near - naked , 300 pound guy with a mohawk and fangs grabbed my ass on the elevator .
But hey , it was Dragon * Con , after all !
At least some of my first impressions were n’t mistaken .
The relationship between talent and virtue does not seem to be a strong one .
In fact , there does n't seem to be a relationship at all .
Take three examples : Jack Henry Abbott , Roman Polanski and Michael Jackson .
Brilliance does n't always equal virtue
We are blinded by the light .
We are dazzled by the brilliant .
We wish to believe they are good even when we know they are not .
The relationship between talent and virtue does not seem to be a strong one .
In fact , there does n’t seem to be a relationship at all .

Take three examples : Jack Henry Abbott , Roman Polanski and Michael Jackson .
Not many people remember Abbott today , but once he was famous .
Once he was all the rage .
At age 37 , Abbott had spent all but nine months of his previous 25 years in prison .
Sent to prison for forgery and bank robbery , he stabbed and killed a fellow inmate .
But he began writing to Norman Mailer , and Mailer grew fascinated by him .
Mailer was impressed with the quality of Abbott ’s letters , apparently believing that nobody who could write that well could actually be a violent and dangerous man .
Mailer took up Abbott ’s cause and used his influence to get Abbott ’s letters published .
They eventually became the book “ In the Belly of the Beast , ” Abbott ’s view of prison life , published in 1981 .
Other glitterati , like Jerzy Kosinski and Susan Sarandon , championed him .
Abbott was on “ 60 Minutes ” and in Rolling Stone .
Mailer pushed for Abbott ’s release .
Abbott was paroled and entered the New York social whirl just as his book was becoming a national best - seller .
Five weeks after he got out of prison , Abbott went into a restaurant , picked a fight with a waiter and in less than two minutes plunged a knife into a waiter ’s throat .
The waiter , age 22 and a newlywed , died almost instantly .
Abbott was tried , was convicted and received a sentence of 15 years to life .
In 1992 , Mailer said in an interview that his involvement with Abbott was “ another episode in my life in which I can find nothing to cheer about or nothing to take pride in . ”
In 2002 , Abbott , all but forgotten , hanged himself in his prison cell .
Polanski , a creepy man of immense talent , did unspeakable things to a 13 - year - old girl in Los Angeles in 1977 , when he was 44 years old .
Polanski pleaded guilty to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor and then jumped bail and fled to Europe , where he has lived comfortably ever since .
A few days ago , however , Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on a U.S. warrant .
The United States is now seeking Polanski ’s extradition to Los Angeles for sentencing in the 1977 case .
Some glitterati are outraged .
Martin Scorsese , Woody Allen and David Lynch have signed a petition .
Whoopi Goldberg said recently on “ The View ” of Polanski ’s actions , “ I know it was n’t rape - rape .
I think it was something else , but I do n’t believe it was rape - rape . ”
Peter Fonda said , “ We should have been celebrating the arrest of Osama bin Laden and not the arrest of Polanski . ”
One news service said “ the world ’s cultural elite ” were rushing to Polanski ’s defense .
Jackson was never convicted of any crimes , but in 1994 he settled a case of alleged sexual abuse with a 13 - year - old boy for a reported $ 20 million .
In 2003 , Jackson was arrested and charged with seven counts of child molestation involving another 13 - year - old boy .
He was found not guilty following a jury trial .
When Jackson died suddenly in June , the media indulged in an orgy of Jackson coverage .
His talent , his genius and his extraordinary achievements were talked about day after day after day .
It was rare to hear even a mention of the troubling aspects of Jackson ’s life , even though doing so could have been a teachable moment for young people .
It could have been a way to teach them to avoid being blinded by fame ( even though their parents often were ) .
President Barack Obama was very careful in what he said after Jackson ’s death .
“ Michael Jackson will go down in history as one of the greatest entertainers , ” he said in an interview .
“ You know , I think his brilliance as a performer also was paired with a tragic and , in many ways , sad personal life . ”
Brilliant people can be tragic and sad .
Brilliant people can do bad things .
Maybe Henri de Toulouse - Lautrec said it best : “ One should never meet a man whose work one admires .
The man is always so much less than the work . ”

The images will be destroyed straight away , say the authorities A trial of a scanner that produces " naked " images of passengers has begun at Manchester Airport .
The authorities say it will speed up security checks by quickly revealing any concealed weapons or explosives .
But the full body scans will also show up breast enlargements , body piercings and a clear black - and - white outline of passengers ' genitals .
The airport has stressed that the images are not pornographic and will be destroyed straight away .
Sarah Barrett , head of customer experience at the airport , said most passengers did not like the traditional " pat down " search .
At Manchester Airport 's Terminal 2 , where the machine has been introduced , passengers will no longer have to remove their coats , shoes and belts as they go through security checks .
Ms Barrett said : " This scanner completely takes away the hassle of needing to undress . "
Ms Barrett said the black - and - white image would only be seen by one officer in a remote location before it was deleted .
" The images are not erotic or pornographic and they can not be stored or captured in any way , " she said .
Passengers could refuse to be scanned , she added .

The scanners cost £ 80,000 each .
They work by beaming electromagnetic waves on to passengers while they stand in a booth .
A virtual three - dimensional image is then created from the reflected energy .
Ms Barrett said the radiation levels were " super safe " .
She said : " Passengers can go through this machine 5,000 times a year each without worrying .
The amount of radiation transmitted is tiny . "
The Department for Transport will decide whether to install them permanently in about a year 's time .
The scanners , made by RapiScan Systems , have already been tried at Heathrow Airport from 2004 to 2008 .
A BAA Heathrow spokeswoman said the technology had been " very effective " and the airport operator was considering possible wider use of it in the future .
The scanners are being gradually rolled out at airports across the US , after use in Los Angeles and New York .
Below is a selection of comments you have sent in regarding the issues in this story .
Join in the debate Absolutely disgusting .
I would rather be " patted down " than have my images stored for a security guard to see - even if they are destroyed .
Big organisations cannot be trusted with information / data etc ( government and private sector companies have lost many of our personal details in the post ) and this leaves me feeling even more vulnerable in our big brother state .
Will they soon add this information and our naked images to our biometric data card ?
Z , Birmingham Absolutely not !
What is this country coming to !
This is disgusting , a real invasion of our last privacies .
To have a picture of someone naked viewed by some unknown person , revolting .
To say that the pictures will be destroyed immediately is a nonsense .
For a start time and time again the Government has shown that it cannot keep our information secure .
With nursery workers taking pornographic pictures of children in their care how long will it be before the airport pictures are being trafficked on the net ?
Angela Smith , Annan , Dumfriesshire
If it meant that as passengers we were more secure and also meant we did n't have to go through the added hassle of undressing then I can't see why people would complain , especially given the authorities assurances that the images are destroyed .
Steven Todd , Glasgow
If this speeds up security I cannot see a problem , this is for our own safety !
Julie Harris , Farnham Surrey
Yes , I would mind .
I have nothing to hide but I would be unhappy having a x-ray which produced a naked image of me even if it was destroyed straight away .
It 's just not right .
Hazel , Suffolk I think it would be very embarrassing to go throughout the scanner .
But if it is going to keep us safe from terrorists then it is worth it and essential .
I 'm sure the person seeing the images will see so many every day that they will not be in the least bit interested in our naked bodies .
Roy Woolnough , Watford Fantastic idea !
With so much terrorism targeted at planes these days , this is necessary and I do n't feel like it breaches privacy at all .
We should n't allow the privacy factor to get in the way of public safety .
Joseph , Scunthorpe , England I would not be keen on this and it is not right for someone to be looking at intimate images of children .
This system should not get the go ahead .
Roy Lavender , Bilston
This is an absolute abuse of power .
It is completely unacceptable and makes people feel violated .
What a disgrace !
If snooping into every other part of our lives is not enough now they have to snoop on our bodies too !
I think government has gone power mad !
Mike Brown , Corby , Northamptonshire I 'd rather have this , than be fully searched .
If it speeds up check in , and makes travelling less stressful , bring it on .
I think because of the amount of unnecessary surveillance we appear to be subject to , good ideas get a little too much criticism when they arrive .

Ben Goldacre , Saturday 8 August 2009 , The Guardian .
Much of what we cover in this column revolves around the idea of a “ systematic review ” , where the literature is surveyed methodically , following a predetermined protocol , to find all the evidence on a given question .
As we saw last week , for example , the Soil Association would rather have the freedom to selectively reference only research which supports their case , rather than the totality of the evidence .
Two disturbing news stories demonstrate how this rejection of best practice can also cut to the core of academia .
Firstly , the Public Library of Science in the US this week successfully used a court order to obtain a full trail of evidence showing how pharmaceutical company Wyeth employed commercial “ ghost writers ” to produce what were apparently academic review articles , published in academic journals , under the names of academic authors .
These articles , published between 1998 and 2005 , stressed the benefits of taking hormones to protect against problems like heart disease , dementia , and ageing skin , while playing down the risks .
Stories like this , sadly , are commonplace : but to understand the full damage that these distorted reviews can do , we need to understand a little about the structure of academic knowledge .
In a formal academic paper , every claim is referenced to another academic paper : either an original research paper , describing a piece of primary research in a laboratory or on patients ; or a review paper which summarises an area .
This convention gives us an opportunity to study how ideas spread , and myths grow , because in theory you could trace who references what , and how , to see an entire belief system evolve from the original data .
That analysis was published this month in the British Medical Journal , and it is quietly seminal .
Steven Greenberg from Harvard medical school focused on an arbitrary hypothesis : the specifics are irrelevant to us , but his case study was the idea that a protein called β amyloid is produced in the skeletal muscle of patients who have a condition called “ inclusion body myositis ” .
Hundreds of papers have been written on this , with thousands of citations between them , and using network theory Greenberg produced a map of interlocking relationships , demonstrating who cited what .
By looking at this network he could the identify intersections with the most incoming and outgoing traffic .
These are the papers with the greatest “ authority ” ( and Google uses the same principle to rank webpages in its search results ) .
All of the ten most influential papers expressed the view that β amyloid is produced in the muscle of patients with IBM : in reality , this is not supported by the totality of the evidence .
So how did this situation arise ?
Firstly , we can trace how basic laboratory work was referenced .
4 lab papers did find β amyloid in IBM patients ’ muscle tissue , and these were among the top ten most influential papers .
But looking at the whole network , there were also 6 very similar primary research papers , describing similar lab experiments , which are isolated from the interlocking web of citation traffic , but which received no or few citations : these papers , unsurprisingly , contained data that contradicted the popular hypothesis .
Crucially , no papers refuted or critiqued this contradictory data .
Instead , they were just ignored .
Using the interlocking web of citations you can see how this happened .
A small number of review papers funneled large amounts of traffic through the network , with 63 % of all citation paths flowing through one review paper , and 95 % of all citation paths flowed through just 4 review papers by the same research group .
These papers acted like a lens , collecting and focusing citations on the papers supporting the hypothesis , in testament to the power of a well received review paper .
But Greenberg goes beyond just documenting bias in what research was referenced in each review paper .
By studying the network , in which review papers are themselves cited by future research papers , he showed how these reviews exerted influence beyond their own individual readerships , and distorted the subsequent discourse , by setting a frame around only some papers .
And by studying the citations in detail , he went further again .
Some papers did cite research that contradicted the popular hypothesis , for example , but distorted it .
One laboratory paper reported no β amyloid in three of five patients with IBM , and its presence in only a “ few fibres ” in the remaining two patients : but 3 subsequent papers cited these data saying that they “ confirmed ” the hypothesis .
This is an exaggeration at best , but the power of the social network theory approach is to show what happened next : over the following 10 years , these 3 supportive citations were the root of 7848 supportive citation paths , producing chains of false claim in the network , amplifying the distortion .
Similarly , many papers presented aspects of the β amyloid hypothesis as a theory , but gradually , through incremental mis-statement , in a chain of references , these papers came to be cited as if they proved the hypothesis as a fact , with experimental evidence , which they did not .
This is the story of how myths and misapprehensions arise .
Greenberg might have found a mess , but instead he found a web of systematic and self - reinforcing distortion , resulting in the creation of a myth , ultimately retarding our understanding of a disease , and so harming patients .
That ’s why systematic reviews are important , and that ’s why ghost writing should be stopped .
Getting a bill through the Senate remains a big challenge , but even there , the Obama administration has a reasonable chance of corralling the 60 votes it would need to pass legislation more or less on its terms .
One wavering Democratic moderate , Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska , signaled over the weekend that he might be able to go along with one of the compromise proposals under discussion .
Senator Olympia J. Snowe , the Maine Republican whose vote would be vital to Mr. Obama , remains deeply engaged in negotiations , and there are indications that one or two other Republicans , like Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio , might be in play .
Politically , there is an imperative for Democrats to act ; they remember well the disastrous political fate that befell them in 1994 , when they lost control of the House and Senate after failing to pass a health bill under President Bill Clinton .
Rahm Emanuel , the bare - knuckled political operative and former Clinton aide who is now the White House chief of staff , has wasted little time in reminding his fellow Democrats that , as he said in an interview Tuesday , “ the inability to act here will have political consequences . ”
None of this is to understate the magnitude of the task facing Mr. Obama as he begins a final drive for the legislation with a nationally televised address to Congress on Wednesday night .
The size and complexity of the legislation , the deep partisan divide , the undercurrent of concern among voters about whether government is getting too big and intrusive , opposition from special interests  all create land mines that could still blow up the effort .
But even after weeks filled with seemingly ominous portents for Mr. Obama ’s ambitions , there is evidence that public opinion remains basically supportive of him .
Despite intense controversy over the “ public option , ” a government - backed insurance plan that would compete with the private sector , a CBS poll at the end of August found that 60 percent of Americans still support the idea , down from 66 percent in July .
And half the respondents to the poll said Mr. Obama had better ideas on health care than Republicans , down from 55 percent .
Mr. Obama likes to say that in the 100 years since President Theodore Roosevelt began advocating universal health care , “ we ’ve never had such broad agreement on what needs to be done . ”
On Capitol Hill , it is possible to see how a compromise could come together ; Mr. Nelson indicated over the weekend that he could back a provision known as a “ trigger ” to create a public option if private efforts to cover the uninsured failed .

FLORENCE , Colo . ( Reuters ) -
Over the hill from the first hole at Sumo Golf Village is the Federal Correctional Complex .
Golf pro Randy Burross could hit the prison with a single drive .
A general view of the Florence Federal Correctional Complex in Florence , Colorado , May 26 , 2009 .
Dubbed the " Alcatraz of the Rockies , " the jail could eventually become the home of some of the detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention center that President Barack Obama wants closed by January .

He ’s more concerned about the rain on this day than the prospect of having Guantanamo Bay detainees held over the fairway in the salmon and turquoise buildings set in rolling prairie .
“ This is the safest place in the state , ” Burross said .
“ And if anyone did escape , they would n’t hang around here . ”
Dubbed the “ Alcatraz of the Rockies , ” the jail could eventually become the home of some of the detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention center that President Barack Obama wants closed by January .
Obama , who has run into a storm of questions on what he plans to do with the 240 foreign terrorism suspects held at Guantanamo , said last week he would seek to transfer an undisclosed number to “ highly secure ” U.S. prisons , such as the federal Administrative Maximum Security jail outside Florence .
Dubbed a “ supermax ” jail , it is the only federal prison of its kind in the country .
It houses a Who ’s Who of people convicted on terrorism charges , including Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski , 1993 World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef and Zacarias Moussaoui , convicted for his role in the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States .
The 490 - bed facility currently has only one opening .
The supermax prison is part of a correctional complex that sits about 2 miles south of the Colorado town of Florence .
A sparse , chest - high barbed - wire fence is the only thing separating the four prisons that make up the complex -- each of varying levels of security -- from the two - lane Highway 67 .
Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called on Obama to develop a plan to deal with detainees from Guantanamo , which opened at a U.S. naval base in Cuba in 2002 to house suspects in the war on terrorism declared by Obama ’s Republican predecessor , George W. Bush .
TARGET FOR REPRISALS ?
Objections to detainees being brought to the United States have included concern about their rights once in the country -- rather than at Guantanamo -- and worries that the transfer could make towns like Florence targets for reprisals .
But the lack of concern of a resident like Burross is echoed all around this quaint town of 3,800 people , which made a push to host the jail when the government dreamed up the concept of concentrating the U.S. prison system ’s most violent , disruptive and escape - prone prisoners in ‘ supermax ’ facilities in the mid-1990s .
The town even sees the prisons as a way through the country ’s current economic gloom .
“ The prisons are a recession - proof , non-polluting industry for us , ” said Florence City Manager Tom Piltingsrud .
“ There ’s not a lot of concern about sending detainees here because they ’ve already sent us the worst of the worst . ”
Profound isolation lies at the heart of the supermax detention philosophy .
Prisoners are under around - the - clock surveillance and have no contact with each other , leaving their 7 - by - 12 - foot cells only for a daily hour of exercise in a concrete chamber .
The conditions are designed to be both harsh and secure .
The Federal Bureau of Prisons said no one has escaped or even made a serious attempt to do so since the prison was built in 1994 .
“ I have the utmost confidence in the Bureau of Prisons , the Department of Justice and our local law enforcement agencies that they can handle anything they are tasked to do , ” Florence Mayor Bart Hill said .
Not everyone in Washington has been as sanguine about Obama ’s plans for the Guantanamo detainees .
Lawmakers say they do not want the “ worst of the worst ” being brought to prisons in their states .
Former Vice President Dick Cheney led the Republican riposte , with speech last Thursday that lambasted Obama ’s security and detention policies .
The Democratic - led U.S. Congress sent Obama a stinging setback by stalling funding for the closure because there is no plan on what to do with the prisoners held there .
Australia ’s Westfield ultramarathon had a surprise entrant in 1983 : a 61 - year - old potato farmer named Cliff Young arrived wearing overalls and gumboots and took a place among a field of 150 elite 20 - somethings for the 543 - mile run from Sydney to Melbourne .
Young ran with a peculiar shuffling gait that soon left him far behind the leaders , but as the race wore on he regained the ground rapidly .
His strategy was simple :
He did n’t sleep .
He had routinely rounded up sheep on his family ’s 2,000 - acre ranch in Victoria , where he often ran two or three days without rest , and this preternatural endurance carried him easily into first place in the Westfield race , beating the record time by nearly two days .
At the finish Young said he ’d been unaware there was a $ 10,000 prize ; he gave it away to five other runners and returned quietly to his ranch .
Asked what advice he ’d give to other elderly runners , he said , “ No matter what you do , you have to keep moving .
If you do n’t wear out , you rust out . ”
Brent Bjorlin and his fellow airline passengers did n't have a clue something had gone wrong at 37,000 feet until federal officials with badges and guns boarded the Northwest plane after it landed in the Twin Cities on Wednesday night .
As passengers prepared to leave , flight attendants told them to sit back down , Bjorlin said .
Eventually , he and the others filed out , walking past security officials standing outside the closed cockpit door and still others on the jetway and at the gate .
" It looked like it was a big deal , " said Bjorlin of St. Michael , Minn .
It was n't until the next day that he and the others found out that Northwest Flight 188 from San Diego had overshot Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport by 150 miles , winding up in Wisconsin before turning around to land safely at MSP .
Federal officials say the pilots apparently became distracted .
Military jets had been on standby to track down the jet after it dropped out of radio communication for about 75 minutes .
" When you hear that fighter jets were ready to scramble , that just gets you really mad , " said passenger Scott Kennedy .
In hindsight , passengers say , the wayward flight to Wisconsin may explain why the flight seemed to " drag on , " the usual pilot updates were nonexistent and why a flight attendant 's " unusual comment " now makes perfect sense .
Some passengers worried about making their connecting flights , Bjorlin said .
When a passenger asked when the plane was expected to land , the attendant returned 10 minutes later and said , " ' I have no idea when we 're going to get to the terminal , ' " he said .
Eventually , the pilot announced that the crew was waiting for clearance and would be landing soon , said Anne Kroshus of Woodbury .
But the expected arrival time came and went .
" It was bizarre , " she said .
" It certainly did n't feel like we were circling . "
" I hate flying , " Kroshus said .
So to find out that the plane lost radio contact and missed its mark " really freaks me out , " she said .
" Planes are scary enough as it is , and [ now I find out ] that my safety was completely on the line by their negligence . "
The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) is investigating , and Delta Air Lines , which operates Northwest Airlines , has suspended the pilot and co-pilot of the Airbus A320 .
Delta said Flight 188 had 144 passengers and five crew members .
The pilots did n't respond to controllers ' repeated efforts to contact them from about 7 p.m. , when the plane was over western Kansas , until 8:14 p.m. when the plane was in Wisconsin , about 150 miles northeast of MSP .
The plane flew over the Twin Cities at 7:58 p.m .
The situation grew increasingly alarming from a safety and security standpoint because the pilots could have been in distress or the plane hijacked , said FAA spokesman Tony Molinari .
" When you are n't speaking to a commercial airliner , that 's a big issue for us , " he said .
" We see them on the radar , but not being able to talk to them is a problem . "
Control towers in Denver and Minneapolis tried to contact them , as did Northwest , via its dispatch network .
Jets on the verge of taking off
The military had four fighter jets ready to chase down the plane , said Michael Kucharek , a North American Aerospace Defense Command spokesman .
The jets were on the " edge " of taking off but did not have to because communication with Flight 188 was reestablished .
" You never know what the situation is , why they 're not in contact , " he said .
The fighter pilots would have flown by the plane to see whether someone was in control or tried " other methods " to get the attention of the pilots .
" Usually when you see fighters off your wing , it gets your attention , " he said , noting that the jets get called into action with commercial planes a handful of times each year .
The FAA said the FBI and airport police interviewed the crew , who said they " were in a heated discussion over airline policy , and they lost situational awareness . "
The crew requested that the plane be allowed to return to MSP .
The NTSB is scheduling an interview with the crew .

The X 4 is an antiaircraft rocket designed by the Germans to be launched from planes .
It was manufactured and reported to have been successfully tested , but never reached the point of combat operation .
It is a wire - controlled , rocket - propelled , fin-stabilized missile fitted with a proximity fuzed warhead .
The propulsion system is a bi-fuel rocket .
Stabilization is achieved by means of four large fins fitted to the body of the rocket , and four smaller fins fitted to the tail .
The smaller fins bear solenoid - operated control surfaces through which two - dimensional directional control is achieved .
These are operated from the parent aircraft by means of a control unit and two insulated wires leading to the rocket .
These wires are about 3 3/4 miles long .
Precise information about the warhead and fuzing system has not so far been recovered .
The warhead consists of an uncased moulded grain of dinitroglycol - based explosive which depends on high blast effect .
The fuze is a combination of acoustic proximity , impact , and self - destroying type .
The proximity feature is functioned by aircraft propeller noises and a delay of 1/50 - second is provided to enable the missile to approach the target after the acoustic impulse initiates the fuze .
The body of the rocket houses the helical aluminum tube fuel tanks and combined two - compartment steel air bottle .
The venturi protrudes from the tail portion .
The rocket is made to rotate about its axis at the rate of one rotation per second .
This permits stabilization in line of flight by a single gyro .
The missile is carried on the parent aircraft on a conventional bomb carrier modified for this special purpose
SPECIFICATIONS *
Length ( overall ) 200 cm ( 6 ft. , 6 3/4 ins. )
Length of warhead 45 cm ( 1 ft. , 5 3/4 ins. )

Philip K. Dick 's 1954 story " The Adjustment Team " is a classic paranoid work in which the world turns out to be a fabrication , which melts away .
So of course the movie , starring Matt Damon , is a " modern love story . "
Buh ?

Like many of Dick 's short stories , " The Adjustment Team " is a tightly wound little nugget of paranoia and weirdness , which explodes in your face and then ends .
We folllow a team of unruly bureaucrats , the Adjustment Team , who need to make sure everyone is place for when a synthetic reality is " adjusted " — including one real estate salesman , Ed Fletcher , who 's married to a somewhat overbearing wife .
Too bad the Adjustment Team relies on a lazy dog to make sure
Ed gets maneuvered into the right place at the right time — and Ed catches a glimpse of how unreal his world really is , as everything turns to insubstantial greyness and all the people appear dead or deactivated .
As we reported previously , Universal is making this story into a movie , Adjustment Bureau , starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt , and it 's now filming .
And as is semi-traditional with Dick 's work , Bourne Ultimatum / Oceans Twelve scribe George Nolfi is taking a lot of liberties with the story .
Instead of being married , Damon 's character single — until he meets a lovely ballerina , played by Blunt .
Explains Blunt to MTV :
It 's like a modern love story , but it 's got an ominous sci - fi backdrop to it It 's going to be exciting and disconcerting and strange , which is what I like about [ Dick 's ] work .
It 's very cool and clever .
It 's got a really tight script .

She adds that the focus of the story is not so much on Damon discovering that his world is a lie , or figuring out why everything is fabricated , but on the dark forces keeping the couple apart , and their will - they - or - wo n't - they romance :
The term soulmates is used so casually , but in this case , in this film , it is true .
They are sort of destined to be together and they fight fate to be together .

The plan to de-dollarise the oil market , discussed both in public and in secret for at least two years and widely denied yesterday by the usual suspects – Saudi Arabia being , as expected , the first among them – reflects a growing resentment in the Middle East , Europe and in China at America 's decades - long political as well as economic world dominance .
Nowhere has this more symbolic importance than in the Middle East , where the United Arab Emirates alone holds $ 900 bn ( £ 566bn ) of dollar reserves and where Saudi Arabia has been quietly co-ordinating its defence , armaments and oil policies with the Russians since 2007 .
This does not indicate a trade war with America – not yet – but Arab Gulf regimes have been growing increasingly restive at their economic as well as political dependence on Washington for many years .
Of the $ 7.2 trillion in international reserves , $ 2.1 trn is held by Arab countries – China holds about $ 2.3 trn – and the nations interested in moving away from dollar - trading in oil are believed to hold over 80 per cent of international dollar reserves .
Saudi Arabia 's denials of any such ambitions were regarded by Arab bankers as a normal part of Gulf politics .
The Saudis , of course , managed to deny that Iraq had invaded Kuwait in 1990 – even when Saddam Hussein 's legions stood along the Saudi frontier , until the US broadcast the news of Iraq 's aggression to the world .
Saudi bankers are well aware that in nine years ' time – the current timeframe for a transition away from the dollar in oil trading to Japanese and Chinese currencies , the euro , gold and a possible new Gulf currency – China will have doubled its national income to $ 10 trn ( assuming a growth rate of 7 per cent ) , at which point the US might hold no more than 20 per cent of the world 's gross income .
Such massive financial movements , encouraged by the de-dollarisation of oil , will have enormous political effects in the Middle East , especially if economic superpower rivalry between America and China comes to dominate the Arab world .
Will American economic support for Israel remain as loyal in nine years ' time if China and the Arabs are setting the pace in global financial markets ?
Indeed – perhaps with this in mind – some Israeli financiers have been expressing interest over the past two years in non-dollar Arab bank investments .
Whenever a change of this magnitude takes place over a number of years , it has to be commenced in secrecy .
Nor can it be denied that the very project to take oil trading away from the dollar market has deep political roots .
The collapse of the Soviet Union has allowed the US to dominate the Middle East more than any other world region , and the Arabs – who can no longer contemplate an oil boycott of the kind they imposed on the West after the 1973 Middle East war – are still anxious to prove that they can flex their economic power to bring about change .
Saudi Arabia 's pan-Arab offer to recognise Israel and its security in return for an Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab land is not – according to the Saudis themselves – indefinite .
If they are ignored or rebuffed , then they can search for other allies through new financial institutions to force a new Middle East peace .
China will be happy to help .

Our Mission is to educate and increase the public awareness of solar energy possibilities .
We provide content and public / private gatherings regarding solar panel construction and other forms of renewable energy .
Thank you for visiting our site !
If you are one of the many people who have recently become more aware of how expensive energy costs are becoming , home solar panel installation may be something to look into .
It is an unobtrusive and environmentally friendly way to save some money on the power bill and help move into the future .
The process is fairly quick and easy to , and will be outlined in the following steps .
Before you begin getting supplies , you will want to ask yourself whether your panels will be lying flat on the roof or angled toward the light for maximum effect .
This will affect how you install the rails , because the guide supplied here is mainly for those making panels that are set flat on the roof .
If this is the case it should be known that it is easier to put the panels in place .
First off you will want to get the screws and mounts to attach to the roof to make sure it is safe , because safety should always be number one priority .
Once you have your supplies , which can be found online or at any hardware store , find the rafters in your roof using a stud finder and drill holes .
You can use a laser or chalk line to make sure they are all in a straight line .
Place the mounts over the holes .
In here will go the rails the panels sit on .
Once the rails are in place it would be smart to hot mop them to make sure they are mounted securely .
Steel bolts will secure the rails to the posts you secure .
Now the hard part is done !
The panels themselves must be installed flat and in a straight line .
Once they are set you can connect them into an array .
Finally you must run the conduit so it connects to the inverter on top of the roof .
Congratulations , your solar panel energy system is now installed and along with the free energy bill you will enjoy a tax break from the federal government for converting to the more environmentally friendly alternative .
If you are still feeling hesitant , you should know that installing the panels yourself is a simple and safe process that will pay for itself after only four years which is a short time for such a benefit .
It will also increase the value of your home and make it far more desirable .
Hopefully you now have a better understanding of what home solar panel installation entails if you choose to try it yourself , because it is very possible .
Are you looking for ways to increase your home value ?
Well , I have an idea that will not only make the resale cost of your home increase , but it will actually save you money .
I am talking about solar energy .
Let me explain …
Solar energy is an energy - efficient way to run your home .
To summarize the idea , pretty much rays from the sun are converted into electricity .
In turn , we can save our nonrenewable resources .
If you turn your house into a green home you are increasing the value of your home to buyers .
This means that the future homeowners will not have the energy bill they are used to because , well , the sun is free .
On top of the monthly savings , they will get a tax break for going green .
That ’s a pretty nice incentive for buyers when they house next door has a $ 400 energy bill .
Do not worry about the installation costs of solar panels for you home .
The cost is completely paid for within four years of use .
The amount of money you save using this form of energy is definitely something to look forward to .
Solar panels can be used all over your home to help enhance its value .
You can use them for heating water , your pool , turn on lights , heat your home , bake cookies , and more .
There are endless options for turning your home green .
If you are anxious to bring the value of your property up , consider switching to solar energy .
Not only will it increase the value of your home , but your will save money on energy bills every month .
I have never been a sucker for do it yourself projects , but this one has especially caught my eye .
For those of you that are educated on solar energy , I am talking about solar energy kits .
For everyone else , I am about to share with you about DIY solar heating .
This activity can be done with the whole family .
There are easy guidelines and directions to follow with every kit so anyone can put one together .
A great thing about this project ( solar kit ) is that you are having a learning experience as you discover new and useful ways to conserve energy .
Before installing your own energy heating kit , you will need to get permits to do so .
Each solar kit is equipped with the specifics of what you will need to get your permit .
By contacting the permit department in your area you should be able to find someone that practices this field of interest .
After you are set to go with permits , everything thing you need comes right with the kit .
Standard tools are required for assembly , but if you like projects I am sure having tools around wo n’t be a problem .
If you get stuck in any way , there are tons of videos on the internet and well laid out instructions .
It should go smoothly though .
I completed one on my own .
A DIY solar heating kit is like a gift that keeps on giving .
You conserve energy , heat your home , and save money .
If this project has caught your eye the same way it did mine , then you too can experiences the fun and benefits of solar heating .
Are you concerned about your high energy bills ?
What about the environment , are you worried about its resources that are nonrenewable ?
Solar energy is the solution for you .
Let us discuss the costs of solar energy and how practical it is for YOUR budget .
The first thing you should know is that the size of your house has nothing to do with the cost of your solar panels .
So for those fortunate enough to live in a gigantic house , solar panels are not here to overwhelm you with fees .
What you do need to take into consideration are things like how much sun you get a day , where you live , and how much energy you use a day .
Once you can come to those conclusions , we can start the math .
Let us do an example together to figure out a ballpark cost for solar panels .
Take a peak at your energy bill as it is now and locate how many KWH you used .
We will say that number you found was 800 KWH .
Now we are going to divide 800 by 30 and we get a whopping 26.7 .
Remember that number .
It is how much estimated KWH you use a day .
If you find that you are exposed to six hours of sunlight a day you would then take the 26.7 and divide it by 6 .
You answer should be 4.45 ( or 4,450 watts ) .
If you multiply that answer times 1.15 you have successfully found out how many solar panel watts you need .
The installation costs then are related to the number you found above .
Each watt typically costs $ 7 - $ 9 .
All your installation costs should be included with that estimated ending price .
Now that you know how much your system will cost , you will be relieved to know that it literally pays for itself within six years .
There are also tax exemptions for those that choose to use solar energy .
It is an investment that is worth anyone ’s time and money .
Unless you are a part of the going green campaign , you may not be aware of the advantages of solar energy .
By taking your energy source to this new and healthy style , you are making a decision you will never regret .
Let me share with you some great features you too could be in on when going solar .
First and foremost when changing your energy source you are saving the environment .
There can not be a better side effect than that !
You are converting from using our earth ’s nonrenewable resources to using the sun as your primary source .
An interesting fact I found on the sun is that it actually provides us more energy in a single day than we use all year .
Does n’t that make you wonder why we have n’t been using solar energy all along ?
Not only are you working alongside with the environment , but you are saving yourself some money as well .
A solar panel grid starts to die down after ten years of use .
I know I know that is not exactly something you want to hear .
Until I tell you that it pays for itself with all the money you are saving in just six years !
That leaves you with at least four years of money that you would have normally spent on an electric bill .
We can all relate to high energy bills and I know we could all use a break these days .
I think it is time we all started taking advantage of solar energy .
With all of the benefits we get back from using it , what have we got to lose ?
Why have n’t there been commercials for solar - panel creation during the nightly news , especially considering we ’re facing the biggest energy crisis we have ever seen .
Does that make sense to you ?
Also consider that a large chunk of the commercials that you DO see are for automobiles … that run on GAS ( oil ) .
There are rumors of car companies threatening to pull their sponsorship from big - name television companies due to conflicting advertisements , and I believe this to be true .
Anyway .
Enough of that for now .
Build these things with your kids at home , and teach them the value of clean energy .
But beware , for there are certainly scams out there that promise to deliver the right supplies to you , but they do n’t .
I ’d like to be able to tell you what supplies you need , but I ’m sorry : I can ’t .
I only know that it CAN be done , and time is wasting .
There are reputable companies out there , and those are the ones to order from .
Unfortunately , making a few trips to your local hardware store just is n’t going to get the job done .
I ’d like to tell you that complete solar - panel vehicles are right around the corner .
I mean , “ The Year 2000 ” has come and gone , has n’t it Conan ?
Where ARE they ?
Well , they ’re not here yet , and they ’re not coming anytime soon .
Believe it .
But this article is not ALL doom and gloom , so have no fear !
They ARE coming … in this author ’s opinion , however , I do n’t believe anyone will be able to purchase a completely solar - panel powered car in anyone ’s lifetime who is living right now .
Having said that , steps are being made by a couple different car companies .
In certain new cars , they are implementing partially solar - powered roofs that can keep your car cool while turned off on hot days .
Hey , it ’s a step , right ?
Consider that it ’s probably very difficult for some researchers to get funding for this sort of thing .
Let ’s assume that it ’s not difficult for now , though : imagine what car companies may be going through during research and development .
Do you honestly think that Big Oil is thrilled to have researchers looking for alternative energy resources for cars ?
Forget it , they ’re not .
Again , in my opinion , Big Oil wants to stop any production of clean energy in cars .
Think about it : no GAS will be used on these cars .
What then , happens to the cushy jobs of some of the executives ?
I can tell you : there will BE no jobs , because the oil industry will be hurting … unless , of course , they can find a way to team up with the makers of solar panels in a different way .
Here ’s to hoping they finally start getting things right and make the cars we WANT .
Why should we worry about power and electricity ?
Why should we have the DIY ( Do - It - Yourself ) mentality ?
Well , the answer is simple : every major breakthrough in history has come from that sort of attitude , and every invention has begun this way .
Many of us have taken on the attitude of the government or big companies doing these things for us , and I do n’t really know when that started … but it certainly has n’t always been this way .
WE used to be the government , and PEOPLE used to control the big companies .
Our thought processes need a kick in the head , and we need to refresh .
Think of the advantages of doing it ourselves .
If we could use our own solar panels and wind power in our own homes , no longer would we be so reliant on Big Electricity .
If you do n’t think that ’s a big deal , go ahead and add up how much you ’ve spent on power in the last year – it ’s unbelievable , and the electric companies have so much power over our lives .
And if you do n’t believe THAT claim , go ahead and try not paying your electric bill .
See what happens .
Our entire lives shut down without power , and they wield it over us with little mercy .
I implore you readers to invest just a little time and money into being self - sufficient with energy .
Maybe you wo n’t accomplish it in your lifetime , but if you only START , our children will be in a much better position to FINISH it and start controlling this aspect our their lives .
Not to mention it ’s clean energy .
Save the earth and all that .
O.K. , so you ’re finally at the point where you ’re ready to start helping save our world ’s energy crisis .
It ’s a great place to be , is n’t it ?
We can really help our children ’s future , and it ’s time .
But there are numerous problems , with practicality being number one .
The question we ask ourselves is “ How ? ”
Well , hopefully , I can offer a little advice and insight to make this process a little easier .
First of all , solar panels are not cheap .
At all .
They ’re extremely expensive , but thankfully , we know that in the long run we ’re saving billions and billions of dollars — not to mention LIVES .
Remember that there is n’t only ONE company making solar panels , and there are different kinds and levels of quality within solar panels .
If you ’re doing internet searches , do crasoss searches and see if the company is reliable .
Find out how long they ’ve been in business .
Write them an e-mail or call them and ask for examples of their work ; if they give you clients that are local , drive by and check out their installation .
Granted , it ’s a fine line on that one … you want the best , but you also do n’t want to bother the client .
In my opinion , it ’s worth the risk .
Those of us who are trying to save the world ’s energy problems are a special kind of group , and are typically thrilled when they get a chance to talk about what they ’ve contributed , especially to like - minded people .
Once you ’ve picked out the right company for the job , learn all you can about the installation so in the future if there ’s a problem , you can do it yourself .
Remember , the cost of all this can really hurt your pockets , and every dollar counts .
And do n’t stop at one panel !
Keep up the good work , and help prepare your family for a complete conversion in the future .
Solar panels are just the way to go , and I do n’t think there ’s really any argument anymore , is there ?
But there are problems :
One problem is that the government just does n’t seem to be as committed to converting as much as some of us are .
The other problem , on a personal level , is that they are so expensive that it can seem incredibly overwhelming to the common person .
So what do we do ?
The answer is simple … sort of .
We need to start thinking long term on this issue , instead of trying to convert all at once .
Even if I ca n’t convert my entire energy source to solar panels in my lifetime , if I start now , by the time my daughter is old enough to take over my home , she ’ll be in a much better position to continue the process .
Start a fund , and dedicate it completely to solar panels .
Even if it ’s just a little bit , save it .
Let it build up interest , and see how much you can save .
As soon as you have enough saved for ONE , get it .
Install it .
Think about how much closer you would be to completely converting your home to solar energy once you have one .
You can be the only home in your neighborhood with a solar panel , and not only will you start saving money immediately , you ’ll have so much to talk about with your neighbors .
And just think : you might start a trend toward saving the world ’s energy crisis .
Remember back in the mid-80s when seeing a solar panel was “ a thing of the future ” ?
Well … what happened ??
It ’s STILL like that , and it ’s very rare that you see them attached to homes .
Sure , occasionally you see one or two homes that have a couple of them installed , and we ’ve all seen them pasted onto stop signs , but that ’s it .
For some reason , the hype surrounding the solar panel has died out ; and I think I know why .
In my opinion , I do n’t believe that the government actually WANTS clean energy .
There are far too many lobbyists in the electrical , oil , and automobile industries to tackle something wonderful like renewable energy .
It would cost billions and billions of dollars to really restart the energy crises that we have , and nobody is going to fund it at this time ; there ’s too much money to be lost , and too many of the rich would be risking their fortunes .
The solution ?
Write your Congressmen , boycott certain automobile companies , and conserve electricity .
The more we do things like that , the more the giants will see that we are serious about starting a major revolution for clean energy .
But it ’s going to take a huge effort on our parts , and we have to take it seriously .
A few hundred people here and there making a stand is n’t going to cut it .
We need to band together and make it a fight we believe in .
Join message boards , pass our fliers , attend rallies , etc .
And watch your vote !
We can do this .
How to Make Solar Panels
Search Google for the above phrase and you ’ll get roughly 16 million results .
That ’s right : 16 MILLION .
So there are answers out there , yet the majority of us are still shelling out hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month to pay the big electric companies to heat our homes for us .
Something ’s not right here , and I kind of feel like ranting about it .
Remember when we were kids and solar panels were “ the coolest thing ” ?
I do .
But what happened ?
Why are n’t we using them for our main source of energy ?
Are they too expensive ?
( While we ’re at it , where are the jet packs ? ? )
Well , I have a plan – a five - year goal .
By 2014 , I plan to get at least half of the energy in my home from solar panels .
Seems like a modest plan .
I ’ll either buy them or buy the parts and make my own .
People are already doing this , you know .
My guess is that we ’re not hearing about it very much because solar panels represent a major threat to the electric companies , in the same way that electric cars represent a huge problem for the oil industry .
But guess what ?
I do n’t CARE .
There was life before Big Oil and Big Electric , and there will most likely be life after them .
Maybe we can all make a similar , realistic goal to find sources of clean , renewable energy in the next ten years .
I just think we need to do this on our own rather than wait for the government to do it for us .
Who ’s with me ?
Judging from last night 's performance , Lou Dobbs is pinning his hopes on salvaging the tattered shreds of his credibility on claiming that , gosh , he was just reporting objectively on the " birther " controversy :
Dobbs :
A left wing group 's liberal mainstream media have stepped up some attacks on me for reporting on the controversy over the president 's birth certificate when in fact I 've stated many times that President Obama is a citizen of this country in my opinion .
The Southern Poverty Law Center , for example , called on CNN to fire me for my even discussing the story .
Coming to my defense last night , Bill O'Reilly .
... ... Undocumented persons -- well I want to say first of all to Bill O'Reilly thank you .
I do want to point out Bill O'Reilly also kicked my rear end around a bit , disagreeing with me absolutely on the issue of whether or not , as I said , the president could solve all of this by just simply releasing his long form .
He and I disagree on that , but I appreciate Bill O'Reilly being a standup guy .
And apparently I was a topic on another show on FOX News , Geraldo Rivera attacking me for being wrong on illegal immigration as well as the birth certificate controversy .
How I could be wrong about that I do n't know because all I said is the president is a citizen , but it would simple to make all this noise go away with just simply producing the long form birth certificate .
Ann Coulter came to my defense partially .
...
Well I 've repeatedly stated that President Obama is a citizen of the United States .
My question is simply why not provide the long form birth certificate and end all of the discussion .
If Dobbs thinks this kind of lame excuse is going to pass muster , he needs to think again .
Dobbs wants to have it both ways :
He wants to claim he believes Obama is a citizen , but just wants to know why there has n't been a birth certificate produced .
In other words , he believes Obama is a citizen , but believes he might not be .
As Robot regularly replied to Will Robinson : " Does not compute . " Especially Dobbs ' pretense that he merely intended to shed some light on the story .
First of all , merely covering a story on your network means you think the story has some credibility .
Yet every working journalist who has acquainted himself with it has recognized it for what it is -- a groundless conspiracy theory concocted by extremist wingnuts looking for any kind of possible ax to grind with Obama and willing to fabricate stories out of whole cloth .
In other words , it 's the kind of story that no responsible journalist will devote any more than a dismissive sentence to reporting .
But then , Lou Dobbs is not what you would call a responsible journalist .
But really , one does n't demonstrate the skepticism or objectivity that Dobbs pretends he was exercising here by claiming " no one " knows " the reality " regarding Obama 's birth certificate and remorselessly demanding to know where Obama 's birth certificate is -- when in fact everyone 's been trying to explain to him that it's in Hawaii ( as indeed he finally reported last night ) .
Verdict : Epic Fail .
Using “ Global Warming ” To Steal Your Rights
By Alan Caruba
By now , anyone paying any attention whatever to the weather has begun to notice that it is getting colder earlier in the U.S. and that this is occurring around the world .
On www.iceagenow.com, Robert W. Felix , the author of “ Not by Fire , but by Ice ” and “ Magnetic Reversals and Evolutionary Leaps ” , reports on current weather events .
A recent visit contains these items :
Storm now heading for Ireland & Britain predicted 100 days ago Snow likely to follow – 18 Oct 09
Significant snow in Argentina ’s Southern Andes – 19 Oct 09
Czech Republic : Most snow in 100 years – 16 Oct 09
Snow across Central and Eastern Europe – 15 Oct 09
Earliest October Snowfall on record in Southern Germany – 15 Oct 09
Why then is a United Nations conference on climate change to be held this December in Copenhagen still claiming that the Earth faces the dreaded “ global warming ” ?
Why is “ global warming ” the justification for terrible legislation such as the cap - and - trade bill currently festering in Congress ?
Plainly stated , there is no “ global warming ” and the Earth is , in fact , in a new cooling cycle that began in 1998 .
Ban Ki-Moon , the UN Secretary General , Britain ’s Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , Australia ’s governing body , the European Union , Al Gore and the President of the United States who will attend the UN conference , are all lying .
They are lying to impose a One - World Government on every nation stupid enough to ratify the December conference ’s treaty on “ climate change . ”
That has been the goal of the United Nations since its Environmental Program initiated the global warming hoax with an “ Earth Summit ” held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 .
To learn more , Google “ Agenda 21 . ”
Suffice it to say , the Kyoto Climate Control protocol that followed exempted China , India , and undeveloped nations from having to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , primarily carbon dioxide .
In 1998 , the U.S. Senate passed a unanimous resolution refusing to ratify this pack of lies .
Today ’s Senate , as well as House , is controlled by the Democrat Party and it is hell - bent on “ global warming ” legislation such as “ cap - and - trade ” and other horrid laws and regulations .
The reason the UN environmental program has been able to perpetrate the greatest hoax in modern times can be traced to the “ computer models ” they cited to justify the “ science ” of global warming .
Computer models are used by the U.S. Weather Service to predict conditions around the nation and you may have noticed via your local weather forecast that they are just barely reliable .
At best , they have about a 50 - 50 chance of getting it wrong within a period as short as four days .
This is because no computer model can predict the action of clouds .
Yes , clouds !
They are a significant factor in weather .
Worse , however , is the way these computer models have been deliberately manipulated by global warming alarmists such as James Hansen , a complete loony who unfortunately and inexplicably heads up the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies , a post he ’s held since 1981 .
A computer model he produced in 1971 predicted global warming well into the next century and blamed it on “ fossil fuel CO2 emissions . ”
Greens like Hansen are united in their opposition to the use of any energy other than solar and wind energy for anything .
Solar and wind account for about one percent of all the energy Americans consume daily .
In a commentary by Norm Kalmanovitch , he noted that “ As with the 1971 model , the 1998 model was proven to be false when global warming ended after 1998 even as carbon dioxide emissions continued to rise at unprecedented rates . ”
Carbon dioxide is vital to all plant life on Earth and , as such , vital to all life on Earth .
The more the better .
It would produce higher crop yields and more forest growth .
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has also perverted computer models for the purpose of advancing its One - World government agenda ; the same one that will be advanced in Copenhagen in December .
The same one President Obama is salivating for the opportunity to sign .
The IPCC ’s continued global warming lies , Kalmanovitch noted “ not only made no mention of the fact that from 1998 to 1999 the Earth cooled more than it had ever cooled during the entire global temperature record , but emphatically stated that from 1997 to 1998 the Earth had warmed more than it ever had . ”
The next time anyone tells you that the Earth is warming , they are lying to you .

America ’s gaggle of “ Minuteman ” long - range nuclear missiles went on line for the first time during the Cuban missile crisis in 1960 1962 .
But the world was supposedly protected from mutual assured destruction by the “ Permissive Action Links ” ( PALs ) which required an 8 - digit combination in order to launch .
Robert McNamara , then the U.S. Secretary of Defense , personally oversaw the installation of these special locks to prevent any unauthorized nuclear missile launches .
He considered the safeguards to be essential for strict central control and for preventing nuclear disaster .
But what Secretary McNamara did n’t know is that from the very beginning , the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) in Omaha had decided that these locks might interfere with any wartime launch orders ; so in order to circumvent this safeguard , they pre-set the launch code on all Minuteman silos to the same eight digits : 00000000 .
For seventeen years , during the height of the nuclear crises of the Cold War , the code remained all zeros , and was even printed in each silo ’s launch checklist for all to see .
The codes remained this way up until 1977 , when the service was pressed into activating the McNamara locks with real launch codes in place .
Before that time , the the lack of safeguards would have made it relatively easy for a small group of rogue silo officers or visitors to implement an unauthorized nuclear missile launch .
From the Center for Defense Information article :
Technically , crew members can launch a nuclear attack with or without approval from higher authority .
Unless PAL or its equivalent forecloses this option , as many as 50 missiles could be illicitly fired .
[…]
Military personnel , e.g. maintenance airmen , and civilian contractors who possessed minimal security credentials were granted LCC access , and annually thousands of visitors holding no clearance whatsoever were permitted access to operational LCCs .
In the interest of public relations , the Air Force permitted ready access to the Minuteman launch network by practically anyone desiring it .
[…]
One must also recite the obvious point that silos and launch control centers are loated [ sic ] in desolate reaches of the heartland .
Reaction times to mount a counterterror offensive pinpointed at one or a few of these facilities would be measured in hours , not minutes or seconds .
The men and women running SAC in 1960 essentially put the entire planet ’s population at risk by deliberately disabling the PAL safety mechanisms .
Perhaps we should keep that in mind before we put too much trust in the people charged with our nation ’s defense .

" The pro-consumer purpose " (! ) request " is to enable movie studios to offer millions of Americans in - home access to high - value , high definition video content , " three MPAA biggies explained during a meeting they held with seven FCC Media Bureau staffers last Thursday .
Consumer groups , electronics makers , pro-consumer bloggers , and consumers , it should be noted , think this idea is a very stinky dog .
So did former FCC Chair Kevin Martin .
But that does not seem to dissuade the MPAA , whose principals just can't seem to let the issue go .
What 's interesting about the group 's latest filing , however , is that it effectively concedes that the output changes it wants could , in fact , hobble some home video systems .
" The vast majority of consumers would not have to purchase new devices to receive the new , high - value content contemplated by MPAA's " request , the group assures the FCC .
But first , a history of this controversial crusade .
No go with the flow
As we 've reported for well over a year , in June of 2008 the MPAA petitioned the FCC for a waiver on a practice that the agency banned in its 2003 " plug and play " Order — messing with a video stream so as to disable either the analog or digital flow to a consumers ' home HDTV / DVR system .
This is called " selectable output control . "
Hollywood says it wants to partner with cable companies to offer pre-DVD releases of big movies , but not unless they transmit through " secure and protected digital outputs in order to prevent unauthorized copying and redistribution . "
That means bleeping the analog stream , which MPAA worries is less " secure . "
In the interviews we did with several MPAA officials , we tried very hard to get them to explain to us what exactly they want security from ( naughty consumers trying to record the movie , perhaps ? ) , but to no avail .
What the trade group rather robotically emphasizes is that pre-DVD releases will benefit people who for various reasons can't get to theaters .
" Physically challenged or elderly consumers who have limited mobility would have greater choice in movie viewing options , " the group 's filings on this issue say .
" It would similarly benefit parents who want to see a new movie , but who cannot find or afford a babysitter . "
But critics of the proposed deal want to know why the FCC should let the studios on whose behalf MPAA is petitioning — Paramount , Sony , Twentieth Century Fox , Universal , Disney , and Warner Brothers — limit the capabilities of home TV systems that consumers have already bought and installed .
" The side effect , " warns the consumer group Public Knowledge in an educational video it has put out on this question , " is that SOC would break all eleven million HDTVs in the US that do n't have digital input .
In essence , all the MPAA wants is to control when and how you watch the stuff you 've already paid for . "
Frozen critics
From this point of departure came a quick he - said - she - said at the FCC about how many home video systems SOC would screw up .
In mid-November , the Consumer Electronics Association , which not surprisingly also hates this idea , warned that if the FCC gave Hollywood an SOC waiver , 20 million HDTV sets could cease to function as they did when they were bought by US consumers .
PK's Jef Pearlman showed up at the agency 's door a few days later and called this a low estimate , since it did n't count DVRs and other devices that might get their input exclusively from analog connections .
Not to be outdone , the MPAA returned to the FCC's HQ in late November with the rejoinder that its critics were , in essence , Luddites .
" At its core , the position of CEA is that technology should be frozen in time , and any new services that require advanced technology should be banned , " a small crew of MPAA folk and supporters explained at a meeting with former Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein .
" This position is quite astonishing , coming from an organization that in the past has advocated in favor of technological innovation . "
Finally we asked then Commission Chair Kevin Martin at one of his last press conferences what he thought about SOC .
" I 'm not supportive of moving forward with this MPAA proposal at this time , " Martin told us in late December .
But when Ars pressed if the issue was now tabled for the Obama administration 's FCC , the outgoing boss said yes .
" If another Commission " wants to deal with the question , " they will be able to , obviously , but I 'm not supportive of it , " he explained .
And so , not surprisingly , SONY Pictures was once more into the breach by early February , trying to get interim Chair Michael Copps to see " the advantages of expanded consumer choices in the marketplace " that would supposedly come with a waiver on SOC .
There is no evidence that Copps , who was totally preoccupied by the DTV transition at the time , gave this issue more than a moment 's thought .
Not to worry
MPAA 's latest filing takes issue with PK's 11 million number , noting that a comment submitted by the group last September does n't cite a source for the figure .
But then it continues : " Even if accurate , the Public Knowledge figure is vastly overinclusive because it counts homes where consumers do have at least one television set with protected digital inputs ( even though they also may have older sets in other rooms in the house ) .
In fact , the vast majority of consumers would not have to purchase new devices to receive the new , high - value content contemplated by MPAA ’s waiver request . "
Our translation : SOC could screw up plenty of home theater equipment , but that 's ok , because those households have backups with digital inputs .
The MPAA filing does not explain why any device that a consumer bought with their good money should be hobbled in this instance .
Nor does it counsel the FCC on how to help those whom MPAA effectively concedes would have to buy a new device .
Nor are we any closer to a reasonable estimate of how many households would face this unfortunate result .
And do n't ask us what FCC Chair Julius Genachowski thinks about this mess because we do n't know , yet .
Hell to the No ! type Music
Chris Rock ’s documentary , Good Hair , opened Friday to mixed , but frequently positive , reviews .
I ’m going to take the painful stance of suggesting that ’s because there are n’t a lot of black women in the film reviewing community .
Good Hair is often funny , fascinating , and raises a few key ideas .
What it does n’t do is offer a cogent , relevant analysis of why black women relax their hair or wear hair extensions — which was supposed to have been the point .
Some background : Rock says he did the film because his daughter came to him one day , upset , that she did n’t have “ good hair . ”
This apparently prompted the comedian to begin an odyssey that took him from the hair salons of New York City to a hair show in Atlanta , from Indian hair - shaving ceremonies , to the Beverly Hills salons that buy the Indian hair .
But in all that conversation what you never hear are opposing viewpoints .
Nearly everyone in Chris Rock ’s movie seems to agree on a few critical ideas ( that can happen when you limit your sample ) .
Frankly , as a black woman , I sat through Good Hair with one dominant thought :
Who are these people ?
Their opinions rarely represented my own , or those of anyone I know .
I am but one voice in this vast , complicated community , but I could n’t live with myself if I did n’t say something .
Here , a few of the ways Good Hair gets it entirely wrong .
1. Black women do not want to be white .
Sure , you can find some poor soul who pops up on Oprah with deep - seated issues , but for the most part , black women are perfectly happy being black women .
A brief history :
The idea of “ good hair ” is one that , historically , has been fraught with racial stigma .
For various reasons , black people who looked whiter , like their slave masters ( read : frequently , their fathers ) had advantages over those who looked more like their African ancestors .
The preference did n’t die after slavery , however , in one sense surviving as the debate over “ good hair . ”
“ Good hair ” was that which was easy to comb , long , and silky .
Like many cultural idiosyncrasies , the notion of “ good hair ” never died completely , but there is n’t anyone in the black community today who does n’t see the term as dated , self - loathing , and patently foolish .
There is n’t a black woman I know who sits down in a stylist ’s chair to get a relaxer because she , as Rock posits , wants to look white .
Not one .
I have a relaxer .
I have one for the same reason that I do n’t wear makeup , do n’t have a gym membership , and can usually be found in jeans and a Gap tee — I ’m lazy .
I like getting out of the house in a reasonable amount of time , and do n’t cope well with a lot of hassle over what I consider superficial things .
So why bother fighting my naturally nappy hair on a daily basis when every 8 - 10 weeks I can pay someone else to do it ?
Which brings me to my second point …
2. $ 1000 at the salon ?
Get real .
The actresses and singers in Good Hair freely admit to spending a fortune on their hair , which was expected .
Wildly unusual was the handful of working - class women willing to pony up a cool grand to get a weave .
Again , who are these women ?
The cost of relaxer varies widely , from , say , $ 50 - $ 200 , depending on what zip code you ’re in , and weaves go up significantly from there .
But no one in the working class ( in their right mind ) spends rent on their hair .
Anyone who does has way bigger issues than what ’s growing out of her head .
3 . We do n’t all have weaves or relaxers .
As I mentioned , I have a relaxer , but I have several friends and family members who do n’t .
And for every 10 black women I know , maybe two have weaves .
It ’s a common hair - maintenance style , but it certainly does n’t extend to everyone .
So before you assume you know what ’s going on with a black woman ’s hair , understand that we ’re as diverse and varied with our style options as everyone else .
4 . All this is none of your business .
Unless you ’re really good friends with someone , it ’s rude to ask what ’s in their hair , whether relaxer or weave .
We ’re not anthropological subjects , and we do n’t like being treated as curiosities .
5 . White women do it , too .
Approximately 94 minutes of Good Hair is spent exploring ideas of why black women relax their hair ( so damaging ! ) or wear weaves ( so delusional ! ) .
There ’s exactly one minute spent on the fact that white women do it too .
White women frequently chemically treat their hair to make it straighter or curlier , and dye it so regularly they do n’t even know their natural color .
Does this make them culturally insecure ?
Hardly .
Those “ extensions ” that lots of white women in Hollywood ( and elsewhere ) sport ?
They ’re the same as weaves .
Some may be clipped on or glued in , but as anyone who ’s ever watched the make - over episodes of America ’s Next Top Model knows , white women wear hair enhancements too .
Which brings me to another point …
6 . Women of nearly every culture want long , thick , luxurious hair .
For every black woman who ’s ever wanted to look like Beyoncé , there ’s a white woman who desperately wanted hair like Farrah .
Long , fabulous tresses seems to be an ideal in many , many cultures , and black women should n’t be criticized , ostracized , or psychoanalyzed for wanting the same thing .
7 . The whole idea of “ good hair ” is pretty moot these days .
If “ good hair ” is that which is silky and manageable , what ’s the difference if you ’re born with it or your hair dresser gets you there ?
In its natural state , my hair is kinky and difficult to comb .
With a relaxer it ’s long and holds curls pretty nicely .
So do I have “ good hair , ” or not ?
Here ’s the fabulous , freeing , culturally uncomplicated answer : I do n’t care .
Look , I ’m not saying that Good Hair has no purpose .
The film introduces a conversation that ’s so important , it reached the White House .
( Check out the viciously racist commentary on Malia Obama ’s twists , or the New Yorker cover with Michelle Obama in an afro and tell me black women ’s hair is n’t a political issue . )
But there ’s rampant misinformation and theories that just do n’t hold up .
And no one ever seems to really address the cultural roots of Rock ’s daughter ’s question .
Neither the director nor any of the writers on Good Hair are women .
It ’s no surprise that a group of fellas got together and came up with a film that , while well - intentioned , just does n’t get it .
But tell me what you think , PopWatchers ?
Will you see the movie ?
Have some stories of your own you want to share ?
UPDATE : I love the debate here , and please keep it coming !
I just want to point out ( since a lot of people are addressing it ) that I have absolutely no problem with natural hairstyles .
I do n’t think of the word “ nappy ” as pejorative ( as some people apparently do ) , and I do n’t associate any negativity with natural hair or natural hairstyles .
( There is , in fact , an actress in the movie whose natural hair I ’d love to have . )
I simply said that MY natural hair is difficult to manage .
I do n’t begin to suppose that everyone ’s is .
My whole point is that people should be free to do whatever they want with their hair , without feeling like it has some grander cultural or political point .
Cut it , curl it , dye it blue .
As my mother always tells me , “ Do you . ”
The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida by Jack Thompson
A long - time critic of the video game industry has sued Facebook for US $ 40 million , saying that the social networking site harmed him by not removing angry postings made by Facebook gamers .
The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida by Jack Thompson .
Thompson is best know for bringing suit against Grand Theft Auto's Take Two Interactive , Sony Computer Entertainment America , and Wal - Mart , arguing that the game caused violent behavior .
In 2005 episode of CBS 's 60 Minutes , Thompson likened the popular video game to a " murder simulator " and blamed it for the 2003 shooting deaths of two police officers and a 911 dispatcher in Fayette , Alabama .
That suit was eventually dismissed , and Thompson 's critics accuse him of being a frivolous litigator .
Last year he was ordered permanently disbarred by the Florida Supreme Court , which said he had made " abusive and frivolous filings . "
None of these activities has made him many friends on Facebook , where there are literally hundreds of groups -- most with just a handful of members -- dedicated to him .
The less - offensive sounding ones have names such as I Hate Jack Thompson , Stop Jack Thompson , and Disbar Jack Thompson .
But Thompson says that some of the posts are dangerous and have caused him " great harm and distress . "
For example , he cites the group Jack Thompson should be smacked across the face with an Atari 2600 in his lawsuit .
Another link -- now apparently removed from Facebook -- reads : " I will pay $ 50 to anyone who punches Jack Thompson in the face .
If someone can get a video clip of themselves punching Jack Thompson in the face I 'll PayPal them $ 50 . "
In his court filing , Thompson says he 's been harassed ever since the 60 Minutes episode .
His house has been shot at , his car vandalized , and he's had " sex aid devices sent to his home . "
At night , he has to take his phone off the hook to keep from being awakened by angry callers .
Citing Facebook 's recent decision to remove a poll asking if U.S. President Barack Obama should be shot , Thompson demands the same treatment for his detractors in the lawsuit .
" Unlike our President , Thompson does not have the Secret Service to protect him , " he writes .
Thompson 's suit has little chance of success , according to Parry Aftab , a cyber - law attorney who is Executive director of Wiredsafety.org , a cyber safety and help group .
That 's because the U.S. Communications Decency
Act makes it clear that companies like Facebook have no liability for what people do with their services .
" They are no more liable than the phone company would be for anyone who is calling in a ransom demand , " she said .
Some readers like to demonize those who get in over there heads with debt as people who lived high on the hog and had their day of reckoning come upon them .
This story , forwarded from a reader , shows the picture is more complicated ...
Just like most everyone I know , my husband and I are in big debt with our credit card companies .
My husband was laid off on New Year ’s Eve last year .
We were in total shock .
I am retired from the USAF and receive a small monthly check , and my husband began collecting a meager unemployment check .
He searched all over the US and made several trips out west knocking on doors and handing out his resume .
NOTHING .
Anyway , we had no saving and a little bit of stock which was cashed in at an all time low .
No help there .
Then we started living off our credit cards .
Without them , we would have not made it , period .
Our daughter and her family moved in upstairs and her husband was working of a whopping $ 8.50 an hour .
No help there .
So basically we were supporting them as well .
We have a mortgage payment of $ 1175 and $ 30,000 equity still in our home , but we are unable to refinance at a lower rate BECAUSE my hubby was unemployed !
Getting back to my B of A card , I have NEVER been late on a payment in 10 years ( until last month ) .
I have always paid more than the minimum ( until January 1st ) .
BUT , my interest rates have inched up and up in the last few months and then , BOW !
I tried to use my card about 3 weeks ago at the grocery store and it was denied .
Needless to say , I walked out without the food .
We do n’t waste anything , not money , not food , not heat or lights , nothing , but we are going down fast .
The good news is that my husband got a job this week ( at a much , much lower wage ) and will finally get a pay next week after almost 10 months .
The bad news is that B of A is killing me and will ruin me soon .
I sent them a “ token ” $ 10 payment on the $ 450 monthly that I owed .
The payment was on time , but the $ 10 sure did n’t make them happy .
They slapped a “ LATE FEE ” of $ 39 even though my “ payment ” was not late AND of course the dreaded overdraft fee of $ 39 .
Yesterday I got a statement from them saying that my next payment due 11/11 is $ 950 .
I can see the snowball at the top of the hill ready to roll .
What do I do ?
Do I revolt and refuse to pay ?
Do I keep sending them $ 10 as a promise to pay ?
OR do I write Kenneth Lewis and say I want some of their TARP / bonus money back so I can apply it to my B of A account ?
It ’s not fair , although I know we lived off our credits cards and much of what I owe is money that I spent on essentials , BUT , the ultrahigh interests rates combined with their slap - on - every - extra - fee - we - can mentality is outrageous .
We have worked all our lives to have and keep our excellent credit ratings and now all that is shot .

( Nicole ) KTLA :
A 65 - year - old man 's finger was bitten off at a health care rally Wednesday night in Thousand Oaks , California .
KTLA reports that the man was part of an anti-reform crowd :
About 100 protesters sponsored by MoveOn.org were having a rally supporting health care reform .
A group of anti-health care reform protesters formed across the street .
A witness from the scene says a man was walking through the anti-reform group to get to the pro-reform side when he got into an altercation with the 65 - year - old , who opposes health care reform .
The injured anti-reform man walked to Los Robles hospital to have the finger reattached .
He had Medicare .
A blogger who witnessed the fight from the pro-reform side says that the finger - biter was provoked
Anna Pacifica Colasacco - Miss Kappa - è arrivata a pochi metri da Berlusconi durante lo show di Onna .
Ecco la sua testimonianza .
L'arrivo del presidente era previsto ad Onna per le 15,30 .
Alle 14 ero già lì .
Decisa ad entrare fra e con i cittadini .
Cittadini pochissimi , spiegamento enorme di forze dell ' ordine e protezione civile e croce rossa e dame di carità e misericordia e tantissimi giornalisti .
Entro senza problema .
Una curva , si apre davanti a me lo scenario delle casette mobili .
Villaggetto colorato , fiori alle finestre .
Il prato solo davanti ad una casa , quella che servirà per il set .
Le altre hanno terra battuta coperta di paglia .
Mi avvicino , apro una porta e varco l'uscio .
Vedo un'abitazione che mi fa pensare ad una roulotte , ma decorosa e vivibilissima .
Mi guardo intorno in cerca di cittadini .
Nulla .
I comitati avevano preparato degli striscioni e stavano arrivando alle 14,30 , come da appuntamento .
Decido di tornare all ' ingresso del paese , dove si era stabilito di incontrarci .
Appena arrivano i ragazzi del 3e32 , la polizia si fa avanti .
L'ordine è quello di non farli passare .
E li bloccano .
Io sono dall ' altra parte .
Dentro .
Auto blu , sirene .
Arriva Bruno Vespa .
A seguire , il presidente .
Mai avevo visto Berlusconi dal vivo .
Fa impressione : una statua di madame Tussauds è molto più espressiva e mobile .
Suda .
Entra nell ' unica casina col prato davanti .
Mi rendo conto di essere invisibile .
Ma voglio parlargli .
Aggiro la casetta per raggiungere un'altra entrata .
Improvvisamente un gruppo di signore , mai viste alle riunioni dei comitati , srotola uno lenzuolo , debitamente conservato in borsa .
A seguire un altro .
Il presidente esce dalla casina ed urlo con tutta la voce che ho , lui è lì a due passi , " presidente , venga a parlare con i cittadini " , " presidente venga a sentire le nostre istanze " .
Subito un nugolo di poliziotti mi oscura , ma ora urlano anche le altre , " presidente , esistiamo anche noi , non solo i cittadini di Onna , questo non è un teatro , 5.000 sfollati chiedono di rimanere sulla propria terra " .
Lui suda e si allontana verso l'asilo .
Sento degli applausi , voglio vedere chi applaude , se è Aquilano .
Cerco mani che battono e non le trovo .
Ma gli applausi ci sono , escono da un altoparlante .
Come in una sit com .
Il nostro decide di abbreviare la cerimonia e , sotto i fischi , si allontana .
La festa è finita .

Update , Berlusconi da Vespa alle 21,37 : « Non sono casette di legno , sono vere e proprie ville a cui piacerebbe anche a noi abitare » .
Certo , farà scambio con Villa Certosa .
The Lego Group - Subject of College Doctoral Thesis
The Lego Group , based in Denmark , and one of the world 's premier toy companies , is the subject of a study by the Linda Christas College doctoral business program .
Dr. Ann Voisin , Chair of the Business Department and Provost at the College says , " For a long time , The Lego Group was the only game in town when it came to the type of building material and play experience they provide .
During the last ten years , there have been many ups and downs for the Company .
Currently Lego is doing well .
However , with the loss of patent protections in Europe and Canada , some trouble with quality control relative to the Lego bricks themselves , and waining customer loyalty in both the education and bulk brick markets , we may soon see major challenges in terms of the Company 's overall competitive position .
One thing is certain , the factors I 've just mentioned will have the inevitable effect of driving prices down for the consumer .
We think it will be difficult for The Lego Group to maintain the ten to fifteen percent profit margin they have experienced in the past , unless their corporate culture changes rather radically .
What I mean by that is , for a long time , Lego has depended primarily on passive kinds of outreach strategies to maintain market dominance , such as their Fan , Certified Professional , and Partnership programs which work in a sort of one - sided way , rewarding loyalists with handshakes and t- shirts , rather than with cash payments for value delivered .
It is going to be interesting to see whether The Lego Group can change its culture quickly enough , from exclusive " club thinking " to one more open to paying independent developers for their ideas and rewarding vendors financially for adding to Lego 's market share .
This kind of proactive effort seems to be congruous with the " opportunity driven " business philosophy of the relatively new Lego Group CEO , Jorgen Knudstorp ; and , it is one of the reasons we can hope for sustained profitability at the Company .
As an example of the passive world in which Lego has labored , we found a company called ToysPeriod that has independently designed , engineered and marketed the world 's first audiophile quality , matched loudspeakers , with cases made exclusively from Lego bricks , nearly a thousand of them per pair .
The brand name is BRICKSPEAK .
Had Lego designed , engineered , packaged and marketed the product , it would have cost them - we estimate - a minimum 3.5 million US dollars .
And , yet , ToysPeriod has taken the risks necessary to penetrate the electronics market sector , without recognition or compensation of any kind from The Lego Group .
Both the direct consumption of Lego bricks , as well as the even more valuable symbolic advertising Lego enjoys from this product are just the kind of things that will maintain Lego in the # 1 position in its market .
We asked the owner of ToysPeriod if he has ever been offered a brand buyout for BRICKSPEAK , and surprisingly , Lego management has never contacted ToysPeriod regarding the product , even though BRICKSPEAK is responsible for some of the most recent resurgence in the Lego brand 's bottom line .
For our part , we are going to carry this study forward with a view to seeing whether we can assist Lego to avoid some of the mistakes IBM and General Motors , premier brands before them , made .
I use these brands not because there is a direct parallel with Lego , but because their mistakes , and in IBM 's case the correction of them , are so well known to the public .
It boils down to the temptation of a dominant brand to become insular , to believe that the marketplace will never change .
When that happens , corporate thinking becomes passive , that is , management plays " not to lose " rather than " playing to win . "
A company with that kind of culture expects the public to automatically show up at their door , much like a popular rock group would expect to be provided an audience ready to eternally purchase their CDs and buy tickets to their concerts without much further effort on their part , except for showing up at recording sessions and the obligatory waving to cheering stadium crowds .
With Jorgen Knudstorp at the helm , the passivity of the past may be , just that , a thing of the past .
That 's the picture we are hoping to be able to paint once we have input from the principals at the Company .
Whether Lego remains a viable leader or begins the all - too - familiar journey toward a more modest market position , the story will unfold in the months and years to come .
That 's what makes business both so challenging and exciting .
For investors , though , they generally prefer to avoid too much excitement on the downside . "
Well , that was quite a day !
I ’m very happy with our efforts today .
We ’re tired but happy .
We arrived at State Square in Darwin ( in front of Parliament House ) after charging up this morning and having the car scrutineered .
We left first , with lots of media in attendance to watch us glide quietly away before being followed along the road by the more conventional vehicles .
And … we got to Katherine – without recharging .
The statistics : 338.8 km ’s driven at an average of 143 Wh / Km , for a total of 48.44 kW of energy consumed for the day .
We had 50 km ’s worth of range left when reached Katherine , for an implied total range today of 389 km ’s .
Shade temperature today was 40 Celcius most of the day ( and humid as well ) .
So if we can turn in a reasonable effort in such a hot ( and hilly , and windy ) drive as we did today , this bodes well for the results further down the track to the South , where it should become progressively cooler ( after a 40 C day , anything seems cooler ) .
At the end of the stage today , we pulled up with the other cars at the stage end point – the BP station in Katherine .
Astute readers will appreciate that the Roadster does n’t actually need to pull up at a petrol station – but that was the stage endpoint , so thats where we pulled up – at least today .
On subsequent stages we ’ll skip the petrol station on the basis that its just … not … right … :)
So – off to the Parc Ferme ’ at our hotel for the night , where we set up the genset and started charging the car around 6 pm .
By about 9.30 pm the trip computer said we ’d come back up to 378 km’s of estimated range , more than enough for our first planned leg tomorrow .
The way we ’ve planned things for Katherine to Tennant Creek – for that that monster distance of 688 km ’s – is to stop to recharge twice along the way , at Daly Waters and Renner Springs – at roughly the one - third and two - thirds points along the total path .
We ’ll have brunch at Daly Waters and an early dinner at Renner Springs .
While the recharge times should be pretty sensible ( likely to be around 1.5 to 2 hours at each stop ) , these stops mean our average speed ‘ end to end ’ ( due to the stops ) will be somewhat lower than it was today .
But thats just how it is – most people do n’t get up in the morning planning to drive an EV for 688 km ’s under any circumstances – so I consider myself privileged to have the opportunity to do so at all , let alone doing so across this most incredible terrain .
In addition to various sorts of very interesting flora and fauna we passed along the way , we also passed ( and were passed by ) our fair share of Road Trains – those amazing vehicles that simply thunder along the highway , carrying huge loads …
Emilis and I are having as ball in the car , despite the temperature – its just like times we ’ve spent soaring in gliders in competitions in the past – a very similar mental process ensues , of exploring the energy consumption of the vehicle at various speeds , with various winds , on various slopes – and today gave us a wide sampling of all of the above !
Also , for soaring pilots , there was the mandatory staring at the sky – in which there were massive cumulous clouds at what was at least 15,000 feet .
The eagles were having a ball up there .
The various other cars in the Eco challenge turned in various fuel consumption figures using petrol , diesel and ( in the case of the Top Gear Australia entry – a postie bike ) , Metholated Sprits … !
But my own focus was of course on Watt Hours per Km – and I ’m really happy with our initial effort .
We ’ve sought and received dispensation to depart earlier than the other vehicles tomorrow ( 7 am rather than 8 am ) to get moving as soon as we have daylight , in order to finish at a rational time ( due to the time needed for those intermediate recharging stops ) .
One other driver said to me after the stage today that he wondered if we ’d had to recharge today , because he saw us stopped at a roadhouse at Adelaide River , part way down todays ’ road path ;
Nope – we ’d just stopped for an ice block and some more cold water ( did I mention how hot it was ? ) .
The locals at Adelaide River were most impressed with this red sports car that turned up silently and slid away again shortly thereafter – with almost no sound , no exhaust .
I felt ( and I feel ) proud to be able to do this .
Its a real adventure for us all .
Bring on tomorrow !
Invading the Vintage is a series where Franco Brambilla takes brilliantly retro photographs and forces them into the ‘ future ’ .
Ok so it is not exactly like , that but you will understand what I mean by looking at the images .
I love these but of course it is hard to seeing them without referencing Meatscapes in my mind .
Maybe it is originality which is now retro ?

Harry Reid Suggests Health Care to Cost $ 2 Trillion
HARRY REID : " He talked about CBO saying that there would be $ 54 billion saved each year if we put caps on medical malpractice and put some restrictions — tort reform — $ 54 billion .
Sounds like a lot of money , doesnt it , Mr. President ?
The answer is yes .
But remember , were talking about $ 2 trillion , $ 54 billion compared to $ 2 trillion .
You can do the math .
We can all do the math .
Its a very small percent . "

Narrow down a wide field of possible problems to come up with the right solution .
There are two types of connectivity downage : when you can't get to ANY web site or online service at all , and when you can't get to a single specific site or family of sites .
To determine which situation you 're in , try getting a response from a few different web sites , including one that most likely is not down , like Google.com , Yahoo.com , or Microsoft.com .
At this point command line lovers skip the browser and go straight to ping , a simple tool that sends data packets to a server and receives a response back .
Ping a server by typing ping google.com in your Mac 's Terminal , Windows command line , or shell .
You 'll see immediately whether or not you 're getting a response .
In the screenshot here , Google is responding within 106 milliseconds or so .
( Hit Ctrl + C to stop ; otherwise ping keeps pinging . )
Try to ping google.com or yahoo.com , as well as a few smaller sites like Lifehacker and whatever site you were trying to reach when things went down .
If you can't reach Google , Yahoo , Lifehacker , or any other site , your whole connection is borked .

If ping ai n't your cup of tea , you can also use a web browser to reach a few different sites .
Just make sure you try more than one browser when you do , just in case a specific browser 's settings or add - ons are actually the problem .
Ping is the best way to see if you can reach a given server , not your browser .
Now you know whether your connection is totally down , or if it 's just one or a few specific web sites .
If you 've got more than one computer or device on your network , try the same process on each one to make sure the problem is n't specific to a single computer .
You can even grab your Wi-Fi-enabled smartphone , hop on your network , and check to make sure that the same sites or the whole internet are unavailable as well .
Is it the same type of downage on all devices and computers ?
Ok , let 's go from there .
( If the problem is specific to one computer , skip to Scenario 3 . )
Advertisement
Scenario 1 : You can't get online at all from any device or computer
In a typical home wireless network , there are three main components : the computer (s ) and other devices , your wireless router , and your cable or DSL modem .
Of course , many more devices are involved in any network connection from your computer to a web site on the internet , but these are the ones you have control over .
If you 've been surfing away happily on your computer on your home network and then for no apparent reason go down , the first places to check are your modem and router .
Advertisement
Twitter user Jesse Glacken put it well ( and geekily ) when he described what he does to fix a broken connection .
Advertisement
In non-programmer style English :
If your modem 's lights are out , reboot it .
If your router 's lights are out , reboot it .
In short , rebooting the modem and the router will solve 90 % of your home internet connectivity problems .
Generally I unplug the router first , then unplug the modem .
( Neither of them have power buttons , so it 's a matter of pulling the power cord out of the box .
Do n't be fooled by the standby button on the top of your modem , that 's not the power button .
You have to actually pull the power cord out of the modem . )
Count down to 10 , then plug the modem back in and then the router .
Give them both time to boot up and connect by watching the activity lights .
Then try connecting to the internet again on your computer .
Advertisement
At this point , if all the lights are on but you still are n't getting ping responses nor able to load web pages , it 's time to continue down the elimination road .
Grab the cable that your ISP gave you and connect your computer directly to the modem to eliminate the router .
Reboot the modem again .
Try pinging or getting online .
No dice ?
It 's time to call your ISP .
Advertisement
If you can get online while you 're connected directly to your modem , but not when you 're connected to your router , the problem is somewhere on your router .
Unless they 've installed the router for you , most ISP 's wo n't offer tech support for your router .
Troubleshoot it by visiting its administrative page and checking whether or not it 's getting a connection from your provider .
This is the time you want to have your router 's user guide handy .
Skip down to Scenario 4 for more on the care and feeding of a troubled router .
Scenario 2 : You can't get to a specific web site or set of web sites from any computer or device
If it 's just one web site that you can't reach , the problem most likely is n't you ; it 's that web site 's server .
Advertisement
My favorite tool for checking a web site is the super - useful Down For Everyone Or Just Me tool , which tells you if the whole world can't reach that web site as well .
If it 's not just you , and that web site is indeed unavailable to anyone , use Notify Mee to get an email alert when that web site is back up .
( Thanks , warplayer ! )
Advertisement
If it turns out it is just you , you 're in an interesting pickle .
You can reach DownForEveryoneOrJustMe.com and Google.com , but not this particular web site — but the rest of the world can .
At this point , it 's time to start thinking about DNS servers .
Your ISP 's DNS servers are the ones which figure out what internet domain names ( like lifehacker.com ) map to what IP addresses .
If your ISP 's DNS server does n't have the correct address for a web site name , you 're not going to the right server .
To see if the problem is DNS , try switching to the free OpenDNS service .

To get more exact information about the source of the problem , skip down to the section on using traceroute .
Scenario 3 : One computer can't get to certain web sites , but other computers on the same network can
If you 're here reading Lifehacker , chances are your computer is free and clear of viruses and other malware .
If you 're visiting Aunt Mitzy and Uncle Ralph , however , that might not be the case .
If a specific computer can't get online but other devices can , the problem is local to that machine .
Advertisement
First , make sure the problem is n't browser - specific .
Install Firefox ( or create a fresh , extension - free Firefox profile ) and check to see if you can get online with it .
Try Chrome as well .
( If the computer can't get online at all , use one that can to download the browser installation files , or bring along a portable version on a thumb drive . )
Advertisement
If all the browsers on the system can't get online , disable the anti-virus software and check the firewall .
Sometimes corrupt AV software that 's not entirely turned off or uninstalled can mess with the network connection .
Try creating a whole new user on the system and logging in as that new user to make sure no process is running in the background that 's getting in the way .
If you suspect malware IS at work , scrub down the machine .
In the worst case scenario of a totally crap - laden system , wipe the hard drive clean and install Windows from scratch .
Advertisement
Scenario 4 : Your router requires constant resets or slows down connections
If your wireless router seems to slow down your connection or goes on vacation often and without warning , there are a few things you can do .
Advertisement
For routers that become unreachable or lose connectivity often , try updating the firmware to the latest version .
Search the router 's manufacturer 's web site for the latest and greatest and install it using your router 's administrative interface .
If you 're feeling very adventurous and have compatible hardware , try third - party firmware like DD - WRT or Tomato .
Advertisement
For router slowdowns , try reducing interference or changing the wireless channel .
The New York Times advises :
The base station may be getting interference from a new nearby device that was recently installed and is using the same radio frequency .
This can include cordless phones , microwave ovens , baby monitors , wireless speakers , mice or keyboards .
See whether the network speed improves when these devices are moved or turned off .
Moving the base station itself may also help .
For apartment dwellers , having neighbors with their own wireless networks crowding the airwaves may also impair performance , especially if everyone 's network is set to use the same default channel .
To change the router 's channel , you need to go into its configuration file ( you usually need the base station 's password to gain access to these settings ) .
The steps for changing the channel will vary based on the manufacturer , but Linksys has its instructions at snipurl.com / 3iibn.
Apple 's AirPort and AirPort Express base stations can be adjusted by using the AirPort Utility software .
Experiment with Channels 1 , 6 or 11 , as they are far enough apart not to overlap with other channels and may provide a better network signal .

The Command Line Tool of Network Ninjas : traceroute
Every good network administrator reaches for the age - old command line tool traceroute to troubleshoot broken network connections .
Traceroute maps the path data packets take from your computer to a web site , and includes every single stop along the way and how long it took to get there .
For broken connections , traceroute reveals at what exact point the broken connection is failing , and gives someone with a little knowledge of ping and IP addresses more information about how to resolve the problem .

To give traceroute a spin and see what its output looks like , try this online version ( which obviously does n't help if you can't get online at all ) .
Advertisement
To run it from your computer , on Windows from the command line type tracert google.com ( notice the missing o , u , and e ) .
In a Mac Terminal window , type traceroute google.com .
Check out this awesome traceroute tutorial or this traceroute primer to learn more on interpreting traceroute output , which will look something like this on a broken connection where the connection fails on hop 4 :

It took just two years to build the campus
A multi-billion dollar university has opened in Saudi Arabia in an attempt to enable the country to compete in science and technology internationally .
The King Abdullah University of Science and Technology near Jeddah boasts one of the world 's fastest supercomputers .
Saudi authorities hope the mixed - sex centre it will help modernise the kingdom 's deeply conservative society .
The religious police will not operate on - site .
Women will be allowed to mix freely with men and drive on campus .
ANALYSIS Sebastian Usher , BBC's Arab Regional Editor Saudi Arabia has never had any problem in paying foreigners enough to bring them into the country .
But they almost all live in a different dimension from Saudi citizens - much of the time they might as well be on another planet for all the involvement they have in Saudi life .
The aim is for things to be different with this university .
The Saudi elite behind it hope it will become an organic part of their society , acting as a beacon of academic excellence in an educational landscape still dominated by religious and rote learning .
It is also a symbol of the division in Saudi Arabia between modernisers and traditionalists - a fundamental problem that has often been patched over with lashings of cash but never as yet successfully resolved .
Women will also not be required to wear veils in the coeducational classes .
This is in contrast to the wider country where a strict Wahhabi branch of Islam is practised and women are completely segregated .
The university 's new president Professor Choon Fong Shih described the university as the opportunity of a generation .
" We give our academics the full freedom to pursue exceptional science .
We fund them to work together in groups - men and women - to work on big ideas that will make a big impact , " he said .
Similar efforts at promoting modern institutions have had mixed success in the past .
Some Saudis are concerned the university will become an international bubble which will operate in another dimension to the rest of the country .
Similar accusations have been directed at other institutions where there is a concentration of foreign nationals such as the state oil company , Saudi Aramco .
The university is full of modern hardware worth around $ 1.5 bn including three - dimensional imaging facilities .
Classes will be taught in English at the campus 80 km ( 50 miles ) north of Jeddah on the coast of the Red Sea .
Security concerns
It took just two years to construct the site from scratch on a 36 km stretch of desert .
The university has drawn scientists and students from more than 60 countries .
About 15 % of the incoming students are female , all of whom have studied at universities outside the kingdom .
It is alleged there are some limits on men and women socialising , with reports that male students are banned from entering women 's residences .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
King Abdullah has promoted reforms since taking office in 2005 , aiming to stave off Western criticism and reduce dependence on oil revenue .
In the former effort , he faces resistance from conservative clerics and princes .
Hardline clerics have been battling loose enforcement of segregation laws in other foreign compounds .
In June , the religious police cracked down on a limited - access resort , not far from the university , where women had been seen driving .
Security is expected to be high for the opening ceremony , a day after al - Qaeda 's Yemen branch issued a new threat against Saudi Arabia .
Last month , a suicide bomber tried to kill Saudi Deputy Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef .

A scheduling snafu involving the big annual Oracle party and the TV show " Trauma " has wound up costing San Francisco $ 270,000 .
The mega mix - up revolves around the party that Oracle tosses for 22,000 select clients out on Treasure Island , which this year will feature rockers Aerosmith , Who front man Roger Daltrey and Shooter Jennings ( son of Waylon Jennings ) .
For years , Oracle has rented out a big chunk of the eastern side of the island for its party , including an old airplane hangar .
That was the plan for this year 's Oct. 14 bash as well .
However , the city rented out the hangar to NBC's " Trauma , " which , while filming in the city , has provided a number of people with jobs - including the mayor 's actress wife , Jennifer Siebel Newsom .
Oracle - one of the biggest conventions of the year - found itself out in the cold .
Now , to keep everyone happy , the city is putting up a football - field - size tent on Treasure Island for the Oracle party .
Cost : about $ 270,000 .
Mayor Gavin Newsom 's office did n't try to explain away the mix - up or defend the ensuing costs .
The best the mayor 's people could do was point out that the weeklong Oracle convention brings in an estimated $ 100 million to the city , and " Trauma " brings in about $ 3 million an episode .
" If Donald Trump can build a tent for Moammar Khadafy , surely our friends at Oracle deserve the same hospitality , " said mayoral spokesman Nathan Ballard .
Sticker shock :
One of the most popular perks in the Bay Area may be coming to an end .
State Sen. Leland Yee , D - San Francisco , is moving to change the regulations on the yellow " Access " stickers that have allowed 85,000 owners of small , hybrid cars - mostly Toyota Priuses - into carpool lanes even when they 're not carrying passengers .
Yee 's proposed regulations would increase the efficiency requirement for cars to 65 miles per gallon - about 20 mpg more than Priuses get .
Yee said the idea was to " incentivize " the auto industry to be more fuel efficient .
So far , however , the only car that would qualify would be the forthcoming Chevy Volt - asking price , reportedly around $ 40,000 before tax breaks .
The new rules would go into effect in 2011 when the current stickers expire .
As for those hybrid owners who thought their stickers would be good forever - and whose cars would drop in value under the new rules ?
" I thought a lot of things would last forever , but that does n't appear to be the case , " Yee said .
Desert debut :
Our inside sources gave GOP gubernatorial hopefuls Steve Poizner and Tom Campbell mixed reviews for their appearances at last weekend 's Republican convention down in Indian Wells ( Riverside County ) .
Then there was the human bomb , a .k.a.
Meg Whitman .
The former eBay CEO was dogged by questions about her not having voted for years .
She did n't exactly stir the crowd with her address , either , hanging on to the teleprompter for dear life and coming off as wooden and overly dependent on her army of consultants .
Insurance commissioner and fellow millionaire Poizner , on the other hand , played the crowd like an experienced hand .
It went over well with party activists , but Poizner still needs to close the " stature gap " and come across as a statewide winner on the big stage .
And for all his brain power , former Rep.
Campbell is still being viewed as an also - ran .
Gone fishing : Sutter Street clothier Wilkes Bashford , whose upscale business has been struggling since the economic meltdown , abruptly closed his satellite Mill Valley store the other day - a bitter pill for even his most loyal employees .
Edward Machado , 64 , who worked at the shop for 12 years , says people found out at a 10 a.m. meeting that the store was closing immediately .
No one got severance pay .
There was no sign of Wilkes , either .
Bashford tells us workers may have been disappointed , but insists everything was handled " in a pretty straightforward manner . "
Bottom line , Bashford said , is that " in the current business environment , we needed to concentrate on our primary stores . "
And finally :
This only - in - San Francisco moment captured by Joe Mac , a recycling - booth volunteer at Sunday 's leather - laden Folsom Street Fair : a guy removing a horse bit from his mouth to ask if the plastic cups were compostable .
They were .

Graphics chip maker Nvidia has apparently been awarded a contract to provide its mobile - centric system - on - a- chip , Tegra , to a new Nintendo DS , which will be announced in late 2010 .

Insiders tell IT news outlet BSN that a single chip Tegra will supposedly power the new DS ; the Tegra was developed for use in mobile devices like Microsoft 's Zune HD as well as smart phones .
If true , this could explain why Nvidia CEO Jen - Hsun Huang declared that the Tegra account will account for half of Nvidia 's revenues in the next couple of years .
It would also be the first time Nintendo and Nvidia have partnered .

Over the summer , the Afghan Taliban ’s military committee distributed “ A Book of Rules , ” in Pashto , to its fighters .
The book ’s eleven chapters seem to draw from the population - centric principles of F.M. 3 - 24 , the U.S. Army ’s much publicized counter - insurgency field manual , released in 2006 .
Henceforth , the Taliban guide declares , suicide bombers must take “ the utmost steps . . . to avoid civilian human loss . ”
Commanders should generally insure the “ safety and security of the civilian ’s life and property . ”
Also , lest anxious Afghan parents get the wrong idea , Taliban guerrillas should avoid hanging around with beardless young boys and should particularly refrain from “ keeping them in camps . ”
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
The manual might be risible if the Taliban ’s coercive insurgency were not so effective .
Afghanistan ’s self - absorbed President , Hamid Karzai , might even consider leafing through it ; if he could account for his citizenry ’s appetite for justice and security half as adaptively as his enemies do , Barack Obama would not be struggling so hard to locate the “ good war ” he pledged to win during his campaign for the White House .
Afghanistan ’s deterioration cannot be blamed on one man , and certainly not on Karzai .
After the Taliban ’s fall , he was a symbol of national unity in a broken land — for several years , he was perhaps the only Afghan leader able to attract the simultaneous confidence of northern Tajik militias , southern Pashtun tribes , and international aid donors .
The landslide he won in the 2004 election truly reflected his standing .
Gradually , however , Karzai seemed to succumb to palace fever and corruption .
An unfortunate blend of ego and passivity hobbled him ; he could neither manage the American presence in his country nor turn its failures to his advantage by remaking himself as a convincing nationalist .
For years , the Bush Administration accepted Karzai ’s limitations , and did nothing to create conditions from which a plausible alternative might emerge .
In 2008 , as another election approached , President Bush ’s advisers at last sensed trouble ; some of them considered trying to dump Karzai .
In the end , however , Bush chose a policy of neutrality , which the incoming Obama Administration endorsed .
There is no sugarcoating how Karzai played his hand : he or his backers tried to rig the election on August 20th , a day on which several million of his countrymen defied Taliban threats of violence to attend the polls .
Recently , after weeks of equivocating , the head of the United Nations mission in Kabul , Kai Eide , of Norway , admitted that the vote had been marred by “ widespread fraud . ”
( The U.N. had earlier fired Eide ’s American deputy , Peter Galbraith , for chasing this conclusion too vigorously . )
U.N. voter - turnout estimates show that most of the fraud occurred in Karzai ’s strongholds and lifted his tally far more than any other candidate’s .
In southern Helmand Province , for example , the U.N. estimates suggest that Karzai ’s campaign may have manufactured more than seventy thousand fake votes ; in Kandahar , a hundred and twenty thousand ; in Paktika , a hundred and sixty thousand .
From June through August , nearly two hundred coalition soldiers died in military operations designed in part to create security for the election .
Karzai ’s apparent betrayal has the capacity to shock , but it would be a mistake to overemphasize his failings , just as it was an error to overemphasize his early successes .
American interests in Afghanistan — namely , the disablement of Al Qaeda along the Pakistan - Afghanistan border , and the pursuit of a region free from the threat of Taliban revolution — should not be wholly confused with the quest for an honest President in Kabul , where rulers have not often been trustworthy .

A second round of voting now looks probable ; it could help calm the country , or it could make things worse .
In any event , the election is not yet an utter catastrophe .
Two years ago , in Kenya , Mwai Kibaki allegedly stole his reëlection to the Presidency , and the country erupted in mass riots and militia killings .
In June , Iran ’s fraud - riddled vote ignited a protest movement with revolutionary ambitions .
In Afghanistan , despite possibly decisive fraud , the opposition has barely thrown a rock .
Abdullah Abdullah , the aggrieved second - place finisher , just holds press conferences in his garden .
It goes without saying that Afghans have had enough of violence .
Abdullah ’s restraint signals a broader , resilient desire among many political and tribal leaders to avoid having their country descend into chaos again .
This is the opening that American policy has repeatedly failed to grasp since the Taliban ’s fall in late 2001 : an opportunity to reject the false expediency of warlords and indispensable men , in favor of deepening participatory , Afghan - led political reform and national reconciliation .
In tandem with a decision about troop levels , the Obama Administration requires an ambitious political strategy for Afghanistan , one that will seize upon the willingness of opposition leaders to negotiate even with a tainted President Karzai about an array of national questions .
These include how electoral fraud might be prevented in the future ; whether provincial governors should be elected rather than appointed at the President ’s whim ; how ethnic balance can be assured as the country ’s Army and police force grow ; whether political parties should be encouraged ; whether the 2004 constitution should be revised to strengthen parliament ; how local government can be improved ; how corrupt or drug - dealing government officials should be brought to account ; and how Taliban foot soldiers and leaders might be encouraged to forswear violent revolution for constitutional politics .
It is not the specifics of these talks that matter most ; it is the prospective project of continuous Afghan - led negotiations , formal and informal , amply resourced with money , international attention , and supportive expertise .
Some of these projects , such as the establishment of local rehabilitation centers for defecting low - level Taliban fighters , demand urgent investments , within months .
Such political work will be no more certain to succeed than anything else in Afghanistan .
Karzai will resist encroachments upon his authority ; efforts to satisfy northern groups such as those aligned with Abdullah will conflict with efforts to pacify the Taliban , who are rooted in the south and the east .
It is essential work , nonetheless — counter - insurgency campaigns rarely prevail unless military deployments are intimately connected with political negotiations .
Since the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan , in 1979 , attempts by foreign powers to shape events there have repeatedly been thwarted by what intelligence analysts call “ mirror imaging , ” which is the tendency of decision - makers in one country to judge counterparts in another through the prism of their own language and politics .
The Politburo , for example , engaged in energetic debates about the extent to which Afghanistan might conform to the stages of revolutionary development contemplated in Marxist - Leninist theory .
As the Obama war cabinet now debates its choices , American discourse barely refers to Afghan leaders by name or to the particular equations of the country ’s diverse provinces .
Instead , historical analogies and abstract concepts from political - theory texts abound — arguments about “ legitimacy ” and “ governance , ” as if the Taliban were motivated primarily by the “ Rights of Man . ” Obama and his advisers might profitably consult the Democratic Party ’s own book of rules , specifically an entry composed by a peaceable boss from Massachusetts :
All politics is local .
In the case of Afghanistan , there is a corollary : All local progress , or failure , will be political . ♦
The increasing use of smart drugs or " nootropics , " to boost academic performance , could mean that exam students will face routine doping tests in future , suggests an article in the Journal of Medical Ethics .
Despite raising many dilemmas about the legitimacy of chemically enhanced academic performance , these drugs will be near impossible to ban , says Vince Cakic of the Department of Psychology , University of Sydney .
He draws several parallels with doping in competitive sports , where it is suggested that " 95 % " of elite athletes have used performance enhancing drugs .
" It is apparent that the failures and inconsistencies inherent in anti doping policy in sport will be mirrored in academia unless a reasonable and realistic approach to the issue of nootropics is adopted , " he claims .
But what this should be is far from clear , especially given the ready availability of these types drugs for therapeutic use , says Mr Cakic , conjuring up the prospect of urine tests for exam students .
" As laughable as it may seem , it is possible that scenarios such as this could very well come to fruition in the future .
However , given that the benefits of nootropics could also be derived from periods of study at any time leading up to examinations , this would also require drug testing during non-exam periods , " he writes .
" If the current situation in competitive sport is anything to go by , any attempt to prohibit the use of nootropics will probably be difficult or inordinately expensive to police effectively , " he warns .
Nootropics were designed to help people with cognitive problems , such as dementia and attention deficit disorder , but students with a looming deadline have several options : modafinil ( Provigil ) , methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) , and amphetamine ( Dexedrine ) .
The non-medical use of methylphenidate and amphetamine is as high as 25 % on some US college campuses , particularly in colleges with more competitive admission criteria , says Mr Cakic .
For boosting memory retention , there 's brahmi , piracetam ( Nootropil ) , donepezil ( Aricept ) and galantamine ( Reminyl ) .
And for a bit more get up and go , there 's selegiline ( Deprenyl ) .
The impact of these drugs is as yet " modest , " says Mr Cakic , but more potent versions are in the pipeline .
" The possibility of purchasing ' smartness in a bottle ' is likely to have broad appeal to students " seeking to gain an advantage in an increasingly competitive world , says Mr Cakic .
But the argument that these drugs should be banned for non-medical use because they confer unfair advantage is rather like suggesting private tuition be banned , contends Mr Cakic .
These drugs might even level the playing field for those who have been disadvantaged , he suggests .
The long term safety of smart drugs in healthy people is unknown , and this might prove a good , and perhaps the only , reason to attempt to restrict their use .
Mr Cakic points to the use of caffeine , which is known to enhance sporting performance .
It is a form of ' cheating ' that is tolerated , he says , because it is relatively harmless .

According to Kevin Rudd ’s unFair Work Australia , the economy is doing so badly that low - paid workers need to do without a pay rise this year , despite rising costs of living .
It seems , however , that Wall Street did n’t get the same message .
After slightly decreasing in 2008 , corporate fat cat pay cheques have recently started to rise again , showing exactly what the priorities of the rich and powerful are in an economic crisis .
A recent report written for the Wall Street Journal forecast that Goldman Sachs will pay out almost twice as much to its high fliers as it did last year – an estimated $ US700,000 per employee , with even more for the top execs .
This would have been sickening even back in 2007 when the economy was going better , although workers ’ living standards were not .
It ’s even more outrageous today , with millions more losing their jobs and facing foreclosures .
Steven Eckhaus , executive - employment lawyer at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP in New York , told the Wall Street Journal that he is “ seeing deals like it ’s 2007 again , ” and spoke of $ US10 m + guaranteed pay deals for corporate parasites .
With payouts like that , there ’ll be plenty of money for the filthy rich to put down a deposit on their second corporate jet , buy their children Ferraris , or to hire a chef to cook for the family pet .
In the same country , but for another class , things are n’t looking so rosy .
At the very same time that the rich are getting their snouts right back in the trough , working class living standards are in freefall .
Unemployment in the US is now 9.5 per cent of the workforce – and a massive 24 per cent amongst teenagers .
Investment author and analyst Bill Gross is one of many prominent capitalist economists who now predict that unemployment in the US will exceed 10 per cent for a protracted period .
Those with jobs are now working an average of 33 hours per week , which underlies a massive shift toward insecure part - time work that does n’t pay the bills .
And while for the rich losing a job means the opportunity to spend even more time yachting or snorting cocaine , for workers it is a catastrophe .
Losing a job – or sometimes even losing hours at work – quickly means losing health cover , being unable to pay rent or a mortgage , and often homelessness .
And it ’s not just American workers .
Ireland has 12 per cent unemployment , Spain has over 18.5 per cent .
The economic crisis really exposes the class divide at the heart of capitalism .
In a society based on exploitation , a crisis is n’t something that affects all layers of society equally .
Those who control the key decisions in society – the capitalist class – will make every effort to use the crisis to cut wages , slash job security , and do anything they can to pass the burden of the crisis onto workers rather than themselves – so they can raise profits and walk away with the enormous payouts they are again starting to give themselves .
Alan Kohler of Business Spectator projected that consumption ( by workers ) could be “ suppressed for a generation , as it was in the 1930s ” .
One thing is certain – if workers ’ wages are further pushed down , our employers will be laughing all the way to the bank .
This article , by Andrew Cheeseman , first appeared in this month ’s Socialist Alternative .
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration plans to tell Iran this week that it must open a newly revealed nuclear enrichment site to international inspectors “ within weeks , ” according to senior administration officials .
The administration will also tell Tehran that inspectors must have full access to the key personnel who put together the clandestine plant and to the documents surrounding its construction , the officials said Saturday .
The demands , following the revelation Friday of the secret facility at a military base near the holy city of Qum , set the stage for the next chapter of a diplomatic drama that has toughened the West ’s posture and heightened tensions with Iran .
The first direct negotiations between the United States and Iran in 30 years are scheduled to open in Geneva on Thursday .
American and European officials say they will also press Iran to open what they suspect are nuclear - related sites to international inspectors , and to turn over notebooks and computers that they think may document efforts to design weapons .
President Obama has repeatedly said that Iran must show significant cooperation by the end of the year , establishing what officials say is effectively a three - month deadline .
Interviews with American and European officials , however , suggest differences of opinion about how much time Iran should be given to show full compliance .
A wiry thirtysomething guy bikes out of the Whole Foods parking lot , a pannier of organic produce strapped to his rack .
He ’s on his way home to make dinner after a couple of hours spent door - knocking for Greenpeace .
He pulls into the street , pedaling quickly , but he ’s not moving fast enough for a hulking SUV whose impatient driver does n’t want to change lanes .
She tailgates him for several yards , laying on the horn , then swerves into the other lane and tears past him , yelling something about getting on the sidewalk .
The cyclist gives her a one - fingered salute , then notices a McCain - Palin sticker on her bumper .
Typical .
Bike commuters hit the streets in massive numbers last year , and scenarios like this one — starring the lefty cyclist and the GOP - loving driver — have been bandied about in media reports and water - cooler anecdotes .
But not everyone on two wheels is out to curb climate change or stick it to the man .
There are conservatives who integrate bikes into their lives just as thoroughly as their liberal counterparts do , which raises the question :
Do bikes and politics really have to mix ?
Mitch Berg is a conservative talk - radio host whose blog , A Shot in the Dark , is divided between political content and chronicles of his bike - commuting experiences .
“ I grew up in rural North Dakota , and biking was one of my escapes when I was in high school and college , ” he says .
“ It ’s my favorite way to try to stay in shape .
And if gas fell to 25 cents a gallon , I ’d still bike every day . ”
- Advertisement -
Berg does n’t believe there ’s anything inherently political about riding a bike , and plenty of conservative pedal pushers seem to agree .
“ I do not care about gas prices or the environment .
I care about fun and getting where I am quickly , ” writes Old Scratch , a poster on Bike Forums , an Internet discussion site for all things bike related .
“ I find cycling to be a very conservative activity , ” writes Maddyfish .
“ It saves me money and time . ”
However , Berg says , “ people on both sides of the political aisle do ascribe political significance to biking .
The lifestyle - statement bikers , of course , see the act as a political and social statement .
And there ’s a certain strain of conservatism that sees conspicuous consumption — driving an SUV and chortling at paying more for gas — as a way to poke a finger in the eyes of the environmental left . ”

僕は研究 員( visiting scholar ) ですが、visiting scholarは交渉ベースでスタンフォードの講義を受けることも出来ます。
僕は、今学期、以下の2つを受けています。どちらもComputer ScienceのMaster用の講義で、各教授に「visiting scholarなんだけど講義受けてもいいですか。」とメールしたら"
You 're welcome ! "
みたいな形でメールしてもらったので、若い学生たちにまぎれて講義を受けています。

# もちろん一人で研究に没頭しても良いのですが、あるレベルまでは講義に混ざった方が早く吸収できるのでそうしています。
# あとは個人的な性格の問題でもありますが、僕は教科書だけだと全く勉強できないので、耳から何かインプットした方が圧倒的に効率が良い人なのです。
アメリカの大学が全部そうなのかどうかは分かりませんが、スタンフォードは4学期制（summerは普通の学生は休みの場合が多いが、興味に応じてコースを取ることもできる）で、1学期が大体10週間くらいです。この10週間の間に集約させるそのやり方が半端じゃないです。
最初、いろいろな人に 「アメリカの大学はすごいから」とずっと言われていましたが、授業を受け始めたころは何がすごいのか全く分かりませんでした。
というわけで、一体何がすごいのか、うーん、と思っていました。
ところが、時間が経つにつれて分かってきたことがあります。
というわけで、10週間の間にこれだけの量をとにかく「集約」させて詰め込むのがアメリカの一流大学のやり方か、と納得してしまいました。
（尚、僕は別に成績がつく訳ではないので、課題や試験は任意です。学生は皆この成果によって成績が決まり、それがGPA等を通してその後の人生に大きく影響するので相当必死です。）
というわけでこんな具合なので、2つも講義を取ってしまって（僕は学生と違ってそれ以外に研究するのが仕事なので）本当に大変ですが、数年使っていない脳みそをフル回転して頑張っています。
特に 、Machine Learningは完全に数学（線形代数）と統計学が完璧に分かってないと初回から脱落しそうな勢いだったので、駒場時代にちゃんと勉強しておいて良かったなぁと改めて思っています。（と言ってもだいぶ忘れていることもありますが。汗）Machine Learningは、もちろん実用的な講義でありながら、その背景にある理論をちゃんと勉強できるという大学らしい講義で、久しぶりにこうした講義に触れられてとても新鮮です。
他方 、Information Retrievalの方はそんなに数学や統計が難しいという感じではなく、" Googler "
養成講座という具合です。講師の片方がY!の人なのが皮肉なのですが、検索エンジンの作り方をゼロから叩き込むという講義になっています。まだ数回ですが、検索エンジンを作るというのは、学術的に何にも面白くなく、ただただ効率性を追求し、マシン性能との闘いをひたすらするという、（少なくても僕にとっては）恐ろしく退屈なものだということが良く分かりました。泥臭いところを丁寧にやっているなぁという感じで、本当にこれをゼロからやったGoogleの2人は偉いと思いました。
A Gut Yontif for L.A. Drivers
As I was out driving on the recent Yom Kippur holiday ( sorry Mom and Dad , but at least I fasted ! ) , I enjoyed what seemed like a miracle : swiftly flowing traffic in the middle of the day on the streets of West L.A .
This was no fluke ; there ’s a big improvement in the Westside traffic situation every year on the Jewish high holidays .
To many , this seems mysterious .
True , West L.A. and the southern San Fernando Valley have large Jewish populations , but not that large .
How can the removal of a relatively small number of cars be responsible for such a marked drop in congestion ?
The reason is the non-linear way in which traffic congestion builds .
Each car added to a road creates a very different amount of delay , depending on how congested that road already is when the car enters .
Quite obviously , many cars can be added to a facility without creating congestion at all as the road fills up .
However , when a road reaches capacity , order breaks down very quickly .
At that point additional cars impose a comparatively large amount of delay , quite out of proportion to their small numbers .
This slows vehicles upstream and ultimately throughout the entire road system .
The bad news ?
Since the addition of a relatively small amount of new traffic can cause lots of congestion , modest increases in , say , population or economic activity can result in considerable trouble .
But the good part is the converse : getting a fairly small number of cars off the road can greatly improve conditions .
This augurs well for solutions like congestion pricing ( which I blogged about here and here ) , because if dissuading only a few drivers will make a significant difference , the tolls may not have to be draconian .
Another option is hoping the Presbyterians do their part by discovering some new driving - light holidays of their own .
But that ’s pretty doubtful at this point .
So why not think about congestion pricing ?
A small toll can have big effects .
Happy holidays !

Too much social media can be a bad thing .
Two girls lost in a stormwater drain in Adelaide , Australia , updated their Facebook status instead of calling emergency services on Sunday night , in a situation authorities called " worrying " .
It 's not clear how much danger the 10 - and 12 - year old girls were in : Australia 's ABCNews describes them as both " lost " and " trapped " , but it 's possible that they felt no imminent danger .
Nonetheless , the Metropolitan Fire Service expressed concern that the youngsters , equipped with phones , would raise the alarm on Facebook rather than calling 000 , the Australian equivalent of 911 :
The 10 - and 12 - year - old girls updated a Facebook status to say they were lost in a drain on Honeypot Road at Hackham in Adelaide 's southern suburbs on Sunday night .
Glenn Benham from the MFS says it was fortunate a young friend was online at the time and was able to call for help for them .
" It is a worry for us because it causes a delay on us being able to rescue the girls , " he said .
" If they were able to access Facebook from their mobile phones , they could have called 000 , so the point being they could have called us directly and we could have got there quicker than relying on someone being online and replying to them and eventually having to call us via 000 anyway . "
It 's not the first time social media has been used in place of an emergency call : in Atlanta , Georgia in May 2009 , a councilman was concerned that his cellphone battery would be flat by the time a 911 call connected .
Instead , he Tweeted : " Need a paramedic on corner of John Wesley Dobbs and Jackson st.
Woman on the ground unconscious .
Pls ReTweet " .

A south east Queensland council says it is outraged that a fund set up by James Hardie is suing to recover damages paid to a former council worker .
Asbestosis victim Anthony Harry Cannon worked for the Ipswich City Council in the 1970s .
This year he received almost $ 200,000 compensation from the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund set up by James Hardie .
The fund is now trying to recover the money from the council , claiming they failed to protect Mr Cannon .
Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale says it is unAustralian .
" How could a council back in the seventies or any builder know that there was dangerous products , " he said .
Asbestos compensation lawyer Thady Blundell says the case is not unusual .
" Probably [ it is ] something we 'll see much more often in Queensland given the rise of cases in Queensland in the last few years , " he said .
" I 'd expect defendants such as James Hardie to seek to shift or spread the liability to assist it in paying out claims . "
The Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund says it is not unusual for legal cross-claims to be made in asbestos damages cases .
The fund was set up by James Hardie and the New South Wales Government in 2007 .
The council says their insurers will strongly defend the claim .
How and when the fickle winds blow are increasingly critical issues for operators of the nation 's electricity grid , concludes a new 10 - year assessment of regional outlooks for renewable energy .
The questions already matter to the energy companies , funds and speculators that trade more than $ 500 billion in over - the - counter electricity contracts annually .
The North American Electric Reliability Corp. released this week its annual assessment of the long - term vulnerabilities of its eight regional grid organizations and asked them to consider a scenario with 15 percent of electricity output coming from renewable generation -- primarily wind .
Meeting the 15 percent target for renewable electricity output by 2018 would require more than 95,000 megawatts of new wind and solar generating capacity , or nearly one - quarter of all power plant capacity , NERC said .
" Significant operational challenges are expected , " it said .
( One of the eight NERC organizations , SERC Reliability Corp. in the Southeast , chose an alternative scenario that relies on doubling its nuclear power capacity . )
The report again stresses the need for more transmission lines , both to maximize the potential for wind and solar generation and to reduce threats to the transmission grid from overloaded lines .
" The [ renewable ] generation usually gets built first , and the transmission may follow months or years later , " the NERC report says .
Texas , one center of wind power production , will require 660 miles of high - voltage alternating and direct current lines , including a direct DC link from Western wind centers to Houston , NERC said .
Wind generation in the Great Plains -- the other wind hub -- grew by 50 percent between June 2008 and this past June , and could grow to 32,100 megawatts in 2017 , meeting 42 percent of electric power requirements , under that region 's scenario .
If you build it , when will the lines come ?
" There would be a need for tremendous transmission facility additions to accommodate the added wind resources .
However , at this time there are no plans that indicate which types of facilities or who and when any of them would be constructed , " NERC said .
But along with the familiar warnings about transmission shortages , NERC 's report also gives a hard push to the need to improve wind and weather forecasting .
" Although accurate wind generation forecasts have been routinely achieved 24 to 48 hours out in the future , wind cannot be forecast with any accuracy out two to three weeks , which is the time frame required to assess transmission maintenance outages , " the report by the Princeton , N.J. , grid monitor said .
Better short - term forecasts also are needed .
NERC 's report notes an " urgent need to better forecast wind speeds that results in a more accurate hourly wind generation profile . "
" As wind generation penetration levels increase , the forecast accuracy becomes essential to operate a reliable system , " NERC added .
Lanny Nichol , vice president of operations for the Southwest Power Pool Inc. , said the rapid growth of wind power has not created any general reliability or power line congestion problems .
The Little Rock , Ark. , regional reliability organization straddles the lower Mississippi River area .
" So far , we 've been fine .
We have n't had to take extreme aggressive actions " to reduce line congestion or balance the system because of sudden shifts in wind output , Nichol said .
He acknowledged a few " uncomfortable " moments .
But wind power is projected to grow rapidly in his region .
" We are still exploring and investigating and analyzing what it would take to continue to integrate an increase number of renewable resources into our footprint , " Nichol said .
Better data and forecasts may reduce power bottlenecks
SPP and other grid operators are developing more sophisticated forecasting models .
The challenge of mastering wind prediction is attracting commercial innovations .
This week , Genscape 's Enva marketing intelligence group and WSI Corp. announced a new analytical tool that will provide seven - day hourly wind forecasts , updated throughout the day .
Enva 's contribution comes from several thousand sensors it has deployed around the country , which read the power flows on high - voltage transmission lines leading away from wind farms and other generator sites , said Hudson Gilmer , Genscape 's managing director for North America .
" We have the ability to monitor directly the output of wind farms , " Gilmer says .
This enables it to combine wind data , hourly changes in power line congestion , and spot wholesale electricity prices at " nodes " or transmission line hubs where traders and utilities buy and sell electricity .
The forecasting systems are being offered in Texas and the Great Plains - Midwest regions .
In the Midwest , there are hundreds of individual nodes that have their own price points , Gilmer said .
" A lot of traders will trade spreads between several nodes . "
The company 's forecasting tool is designed to predict how changes in wind production could cause prices to separate between two nodes , he said .
The rapid growth of wind power in both regions is producing dramatic spreads in wholesale power prices in Texas and the Midwest , and transmission line congestion is the key element .
" Certainly , the increasing wind generation has contributed to transmission congestion and created operational issues that have to be managed , " said David Patton , president of Potomac Economics , the independent market monitor for the grid networks in Texas , New England and the Midwest , and the market adviser in New York state .
Strange economics blowin ' in the wind
On Feb. 24 this year , at 9:30 a.m. , for example , wind generation west of Minnesota 's Twin Cities was so plentiful relative to demand that wind farms were paying more than $ 10 an hour to utilities to take their electricity .
Wind generators can afford to sell at a small loss because they make $ 19 a megawatt - hour from a federal production tax credit .
But congested power lines prevented the excess wind from moving through northeastern Iowa toward population centers in the Midwest , where prices jumped above $ 40 a megawatt - hour in that hour .
" If we see day ahead pricing that is negative or below a certain threshold , we make the assumption in our forecasts that some or all of the wind generation in that region will not run , " Gilmer said .
" You do n't have enough transmission capacity to carry all that wind power . "
" Wind is having a pretty remarkable impact on the grid in a number of places , " said one executive of a power trading firm , who was not authorized to speak for attribution .
" If it 's not blowing in West Texas , prices there will be the same as in Houston . "
But when the wind picks up , the prices split apart , he said .
Understanding -- and accurately predicting -- how wind shifts affect prices is a central issue to the future stability of the grid , and not just the profit goals of traders , grid officials agree .
Coal - fired power plants cannot be ramped up and down efficiently or effectively by the hour or the day to match swings in wind generation .
So grid managers may have to choose which kind of power is crucial to keeping the grid operating safely .
As wind power expands , so will natural gas - fired generation , NERC predicts , and that could make electricity markets more vulnerable to the volatility of gas prices , or compel utilities to invest in gas pipelines or storage , the organization said .

European Idol
It ’s been a big few weeks for foreign - policy wonks with a betting streak , with the awarding of the 2016 Olympics and Nobel Prizes as well as Ireland ’s ratification of the Lisbon Treaty .
Although some hurdles remain , the referendum has made the creation of a president of the European Union much more likely — spurring some serious transatlantic speculation over who would fit the bill .
Normally , the politicking over which continental political heavyweight might grab an EU post is minimal .
The roles tend to be bureaucratic and , put frankly , Brussels tends to be a pretty dull place .
But the novelty and the relatively undefined nature of the beefed - up EU presidency has given the race some intrigue .
As certain politicians have emerged as speculative front - runners , an informal set of criteria has emerged as well .
European leaders and Brussels - watchers handicapping the race often comment on the characteristics they deem desirable in an EU president .
First , the president should be , well , boring — like Brussels itself .
Politicians have knocked down candidates for being too controversial or too outspoken .
Second , he should likely hold center - right or Christian Democratic political tendencies , given that Europe itself is headed that direction .
Third , he should come from a country that uses the euro — showing full fealty to the concept of the union .
Fourth , he should come from a small European country — anything other than Britain , France , Germany , and Italy , which normally dominate the union ’s affairs .
Finally , two wild - card characteristics :
He should ideally speak French and have opposed the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq — if not at the time , then soon afterward .
Above , I ’ve judged the most - often mentioned candidates on these parameters .
And below , I ’ll discuss the top contenders in more detail .
Bertie Ahern
Title : Taoiseach ( prime minister ) of Ireland from 1997 to 2008
Politics : Center - right , pro-business
Odds : 10 to 1
Ahern helped broker the Northern Irish peace agreement and spurred the Irish economy to become the fastest - growing in Europe , winning the moniker the “ Celtic Tiger . ”
But he also oversaw a building boom and credit bubble — meaning Ireland fell into a deep depression when the credit crunch and global financial crisis hit .
He resigned amid a brewing scandal over illegal campaign donations .
Ahern is well - liked and well - respected as a deal - maker .
He recently received the backing of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk ( though he would back fellow Pole Aleksander Kwasniewski , the former president , if he ran ) .
But Ahern is likely too brash to win over Brussels — he ( gasp ) even said he wanted the gig .

Anders Fogh Rasmussen
Title : Prime minister of Denmark from 2001 to 2009 , current secretary - general of NATO
Politics : Center - right , Christian Democrat , free market liberal
Odds : 6 to 1
This “ Dashing Dane ” ( repeatedly cited as the handsomest European leader , much to Silvio Berlusconi ’s chagrin ) is intelligent , centrist , and popular .
He is also a dominant power broker on the European stage as the current secretary - general of NATO .
But he only won the job with U.S. support , because he is strongly disliked in Turkey .
( He refused to apologize for a Danish paper ’s printing of an incendiary cartoon of Prophet Mohammed . )
He also won plaudits for his oversight of the contentious 2002 EU expansion debates .
His chances might be hurt by some of Denmark ’s EU opt-outs — particularly its decision not to use the euro or take up a common defense agreement .
But Rasmussen has ordered referendums on those issues and is both pro-euro and pro-European integration .
He also might appeal to small countries , which will want the presidency to go to politicians from dominant EU powers , Britain , France , and Germany .

Paavo Lipponen
Title : Prime minister of Finland from 1995 to 2003
Politics : Center - left , Social Democratic
Odds : 5 to 1
Lipponen is often cited as a leading candidate who might win the all - clear if not the support of Britain , France , and Germany .
He ushered Finland — traditionally a neutral country that has long resisted aligning itself with Europe — into the European Union .
He was and remains consensus - oriented — and is dry enough to appease Brussels .
He also speaks fluent French and English , two tacit requirements .
He does , however , have two main marks against him .
First , he is a Social Democrat at a time when Europe is moving right .
Second , there were allegations that he supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq , a decision that contributed to the loss of his position as prime minister .
( Lipponen has since attested to his and Finland ’s neutrality . )
Commentators have also noted that Lipponen ’s election might imply a more minimalist , domestically focused role for the EU president .
He is well - respected in Europe , but does not carry much international clout .

Jean - Claude Juncker
Title : Prime minister of Luxembourg since 1995 , chairman of the Eurogroup
Politics : Conservative , Christian Democrat
Odds : 4 to 1
Juncker is currently the longest - serving head of government in Europe , strongly pro-integration , and popular on the continent and in his country .
He was one of the primary architects of the Maastricht Treaty , which led to the creation of the euro , and engineered the opt - out clause .
He also initiated the “ Luxembourg process ” for integrating European policy against unemployment .
Juncker is generally inoffensive and something of a snooze — which , in Brussels , are considered major pluses .
But Juncker has advocated for the EU presidency to go to a small country , possibly from “ New Europe ” as opposed to “ Old Europe , ” and not to a juggernaut like Germany or Britain .
This might ruffle feathers .
British ministers have raised questions about Juncker ’s federalism — his advocacy for more monolithic and stronger Europe policies — and might attempt to block his ascension .

Jan Peter Balkenende
Title : Prime minister of the Netherlands since 2002
Politics : Christian Democrat
Odds : 3 to 1
Balkenende — nicknamed “ Harry Potter ” by the Dutch press for his youthful looks — ticks numerous boxes .
( In fact , he and Juncker are the only two politicians who seem to tick all of them . )
He ’s a conservative , but works readily in coalitions with his country ’s left - wing parties .
He is from a small Benelux country , with a strongly pro-Europe and highly inclusive bent .
He is somewhat soft - spoken and obscure continent - wide — characteristics that might be a plus , given that he has relatively few enemies .

Tony Blair
Title : Prime minister of Britain from 1997 to 2007
Politics : Labour , center - left
Odds : 2 to 1
Blair is the most commonly mentioned name for EU president , and — not coincidentally — the most famous politician in Europe .
As the head of Britain ’s center - left Labour Party , he presided over a long period of expansion in the British economy .
He was also notable for his strident support of the U.S. war in Iraq and for his euro - skepticism .
Indeed , Britain has not adopted the euro and has chafed against integrating economic and defense policy with the continent .
He is also derided as a “ poodle ” or “ lap dog ” for Washington .
Blair ’s ace in the hole is his international stature :
He has a command of the international stage like no other European .
If Europe decides it wants to take on the United States and China as a world superpower , Blair would be the president who commanded the most attention .
Whether this counts for or against him remains the question .

Joseph CONRAD ( 1857 - 1924 )
A classic of early literary modernism , Lord Jim tells the story of a young " simple and sensitive character " who loses his honor in a display of cowardice at sea -- and of his expiation of that sin against his own " shadowy ideal of conduct " on the remote island of Patusan .
The novel , written by Conrad for magazine serialization during an intense and chaotic ten months in 1899 and 1900 , has , in the words of Thomas C. Moser , " the rare distinction of being a masterpiece in two separate genres .
It is at once an exotic adventure story of the Eastern seas in the popular tradition of Kipling and Stevenson and a complexly wrought ' art novel ' in the tradition of Flaubert and James .

For Republicans looking forward to the first Bush - free election in a decade , the book publishing schedule is the bearer of bad news : Between New Year ’s Day and next November , as many as five Bush administration officials — including the former president himself — will rehash history in hardback .
The literary luge ride down memory lane shoves off with a return to the economic collapse via former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson ’s “ On the Brink : Inside the Race to Stop the Collapse of the Global Financial System , ” due out from Business Plus in January .

Former first lady Laura Bush ’s White House memoir tees up next , expected from Scribner in the spring .
Former President George W. Bush ’s own book , tentatively titled “ Decision Points , ” will follow in the fall from Random House ’s Crown Publishing and will recount a dozen pivotal choices Bush faced and how he made them — a trip back to the days of “ the decider ” that ’s bound to spark talk of what it omits as much as what it contains .
A candid chronicle from former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld — who told The AP that his Iraq war years would “ certainly ” be covered in his manuscript — is also expected to hit the shelves in the autumn , published by Penguin ’s Sentinel imprint .
And onetime White House chief strategist Karl Rove ’s book is also reportedly due out in 2010 , although his publisher , Threshold Editions , a conservative imprint of Simon & Schuster headed by Republican strategist Mary Matalin , would not confirm that date .
Nor would Threshold Editions confirm the widely reported 2011 release date for former Vice President Dick Cheney ’s memoir , which promises to be the most controversial of the lot — and Matalin could not be reached for comment on whether the decision to release the book after the midterm elections was a strategic one .
The literary look back will be supplemented by other reminders , large and small , of the Bush era , from the groundbreaking for the George W. Bush library , also scheduled for the fall ( although right now that ’s likely to be in November , presumably after Election Day ) , to the outcome of the Justice Department ’s CIA interrogation probe currently under way .
The question is :
What effect , if any , will all of this have on voters ’ perceptions of the two parties and their candidates ?
The Democrats ’ reaction was not hard to predict .
“ The more flashbacks of the Bush era we have , the more people will be reminded about the huge mess that Barack Obama and the Democrats inherited , ” says Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
“ So it will remind them of why they voted for change and remind them of why they do n’t want to turn back the clock . ”
Democratic National Committee spokesman Hari Sevugan agrees .
“ This will only serve to further emphasize what they continue to see from the Republican Party , which is more of the same , ” he says .
“ To tweak a phrase , it ’s come to a point where it ’s fair to say , ‘ If it ’s Sunday , it ’s Dick Cheney . ’ ”
The Bush montage plays right into the hands of Democrats , says Democratic strategist Douglas Schoen , who predicts that the midterm elections will be a battle between those who will try to make it a belated referendum on the Bush administration and those who will try to make it a premature referendum on the Obama administration .
“ I think Obama is going to run against George Bush , as a means of deflecting attention from an incomplete agenda , ” Schoen says , noting that November 2010 will likely be too soon for voters to see concrete results on the economy , health care or other Obama policies at home or abroad .
As for the Republicans , he says , their “ best case is to make the election a referendum on Barack Obama , and to the extent that there are unpleasant or uncomfortable reflections , facts , inquiries , coming out — whether about the U.S. attorneys , torture , memoirs , whatever — they ’re going to be employed inevitably and inexorably by the Obama administration , which is going to say , ‘ Look : They ’re worse . ’ ”
Democratic political consultant Bob Shrum agrees : “ A huge amount depends on how Obama ’s doing .
If Obama ’s doing better , and we ’re doing better in foreign policy , the Bush record will be magnified . ”
If that ’s what Democrats have got , say Republicans , bring it on .
“ I think that voters are smarter than that , ” says Scott Stanzel , former deputy press secretary to Bush .
“ I think voters will see that as a tired old tactic .
Even in 2008 , our candidate could have had a more compelling vision for the country .
I think that Barack Obama ’s success was more about his ability to articulate a vision than about the past . ”
And actually , says Brian Jones , a former communications director for the Republican National Committee , holding the Bush administration up against the Obama administration might not be a bad thing .
The current president ’s struggles suggest that there are no “ magic solutions ” for some of the problems his predecessor faced , he says .
“ A number of the things that the Bush administration was criticized heavily for at the end of his term , like his handling of the economy , the war in Afghanistan , lack of ability to get anything done on Social Security — the Obama administration is having as much of a difficult time , if not more of a difficult time , with them , ” Jones says .
“ It illustrates that the presidency is a tough job , but it illustrates that [ Bush is ] maybe not the boogeyman that he was made out to be , ” he adds .
Republican strategist Mark McKinnon goes even further .
“ I think George Bush ’s rehabilitation is way ahead of schedule , ” he says .
“ Voters either do n’t like what Obama has done or do n’t think he ’s done enough .
Bush ’s decisiveness and clarity are starting to look good in the rearview mirror .
And I think Republican candidates in 2010 are going to consider asking for his help . ”
The biggest danger for Republicans is not in the books themselves but in the media coverage of them , says Stanzel , who notes that the focus is likely to be on the most newsworthy or controversial snippets .
“ You see one paragraph that gets focused on and replayed — and replayed and replayed — out of several hundred pages , ” he says .
“ Four or five sentences can shape a week ’s worth of coverage , and that very much has a distorting effect , I think . ”
Still , he adds , it is possible to read too much into the kind of impact that even a mountain of political memoirs might have at the polls .
“ I would also note that the book ‘ Inside of a Dog ’ is currently outselling the most recently released Bush book , ” he says .
“ So I think people read for entertainment , and they might read for enjoyment , and maybe to learn things , but I do n’t think people will read books to decide what they should do in an election that ’s about the present day — and about the future . ”

I had a need for an application that I am writing on Google App Engine for a way to store jobs and then process them all at once .
I found the idea for a Memcached lockless queue and created an implementation of it : queue .py
To write to it ( I do this from a view where I want to store some stats about the data that was shown in the view ) :
this Queue=queue .
Queue ( QUEUE_NAME ) def method ( ) : this Queue . write ( data )
and then later on to read from it .
I created a cron job that is executed often .
this Queue=queue .
Queue ( QUEUE_NAME ) def cronMethod ( ) : msg = this Queue . read ( ) while msg : processMessage ( msg ) msg = this Queue .
read ( )
If you are using this on Google App Engine , you should also be careful that you do n’t run out of time to execute .
If you get a DeadlineExceeded Error after you have read , but before you have finished processing , then the message might get lost .
Healthcare and reform : Strong opinions in US A Senate committee has approved a bill to reform US healthcare , a key step in President Barack Obama 's attempt to overhaul the system .
Senators voted by 14 votes to nine to pass the bill , with one Republican joining Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee in voting in favour .
Senator Olympia
Snowe became the first Republican to back the proposals .
The reforms , intended to cut costs and make insurance more affordable , are Mr Obama 's top domestic priority .
The president welcomed the committee 's decision , calling it a " critical milestone " .
" We are closer than ever before to passing healthcare reform but we are not there yet , " he said .
" Now is not the time to pat ourselves on the back ...
It is time to dig in further and get this done . "
The president knows the process still has some way to run , says the BBC's Paul Adams in Washington .
But the Senate committee approval was a significant boost for the central plank of his domestic agenda .
' Miles to go ' Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Announcing her decision to break with her party on Tuesday , Senator Snowe said : " When history calls , history calls . "
However , the moderate Republican said it did not necessarily mean she would support later versions of a bill .
" There are many , many miles to go in this legislative journey , " she said .
" My vote today is my vote today .
It does n't forecast what it will be tomorrow . "
The panel 's bill , which was drafted after weeks of at times bitterly partisan debate , sets out a 10 - year $ 829bn ( £ 525 bn ) plan to cut health costs and provide affordable health insurance to most Americans .
US HEALTHCARE
No universal coverage Private health insurance available through employer , government or private schemes US spends some 16.2 % of GDP on healthcare , nearly twice average of other OECD countries US Census Bureau estimates some 46 m people do not have health insurance - includes 9.2 million non-citizens and 18 million people who earn over $ 50,000 a year Medicaid : federal - state programme for low income groups Medicare : for people 65 years old and above and some younger disabled people
Q&A : Healthcare reform Healthcare around world Senator Charles Grassley , the senior Republican on the panel , criticised the legislation and predicted that the bill would move " leftward " as it progressed through Congress .
" This bill is already moving on a slippery slope to more government control of healthcare , " he said .
The finance committee 's bill must now be combined with a bill drafted by the Senate Health Committee before going to the full Senate for a vote .
It is not guaranteed to pass , as it needs all the Democrats , two independents and one Republican to vote in favour .
' Public option '
Mr Obama argues that all Americans are entitled to insurance coverage , that rising costs must be tackled and that private insurers must not be able to deny coverage or end it when someone becomes seriously ill .
ANALYSIS Paul Adams , BBC News , Washington
On the long , tortuous road towards reform of America 's healthcare system , this was a decisive moment .
Several members of the Senate Finance Committee called the vote historic .
The Washington Post this morning reported that not since Theodore Roosevelt proposed universal healthcare in 1912 has any such bill come this far .
After months of debate , the committee 's chairman , Max Baucus , looked delighted and relieved .
In the end , those in favour of the bill won comfortably .
This was due in part to a Democratic majority , but also to the support of Senator Olympia Snowe , who became the first Republican to back any of the bills proposed this year .
But this is not the end of the process .
There are many more legislative hurdles to overcome before it becomes law .
In the meantime , debate will continue to rage .
A long congressional slog still lies ahead , correspondents say , but Mr Obama 's push for healthcare reform has gone further than attempts in the 1990s by President Bill Clinton , which never got beyond all the committees .
All the different versions of the bill produced by House of Representatives and Senate committees are broadly similar in the scope of their reforms : toughen regulations on health insurers
mandate all Americans to get insurance
offer subsidies to the less well - off and set up health insurance exchanges for people without employer - sponsored coverage , to help them choose between different options .
Lawmakers are divided , however , over whether there should be a new government - run insurance scheme - the so - called " public option " .
The finance committee 's bill is the only one not to include a public option , an element advocated by Mr Obama and some Democrats as the means of creating competition between insurers .
Last week , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded that the finance committee 's bill would result in reducing the federal deficit by $ 81bn and mean some 94 % of eligible Americans would have insurance coverage .
However , Republicans say the final draft which will be voted on is likely to be very different and more expensive than this version .
They say the proposed reforms are too costly and represent too much government intrusion into healthcare .
At the weekend , the private insurance industry issued a study that said the plans could mean policies end up costing people hundreds , if not thousands , more dollars .

A number of train have been attacked and burnt in recent months Photo : Prashant Ravi
By Amarnath Tewary in Patna
A group of students travelling without tickets in an air - conditioned railway coach in the northern Indian state of Bihar were recently asked by the ticket examiner to vacate their seats .
Nothing unusual about that , but , in this case , the students took umbrage , and set four coaches on fire .
Panic - stricken passengers on the train travelling between the Indian capital , Delhi , and Rajgir in Bihar , ran out with their bags at Bihta station while the police and railway security looked on helplessly .
Railway authorities totted up the losses : each air - conditioned coach costs eight million rupees ( $ 161,000 ; £ 98,000 ) to manufacture , and the losses from the Bihar incident cost the railways nearly $ 650,000 .
This incident again proved that burning trains have become a popular form of protest and vandalism in Bihar .
Rising violence
In June , two passenger intercity trains were attacked and six coaches burnt down by a mob at Khusurupur station - the attackers were angry with the railways after it scrapped an illegal " halt " for an intercity train at the station .
In Bihar , people routinely hop on to trains from such illegal " halts " where trains are forced to stop .
Last October , a mob burnt down two air - conditioned coaches of an express train connecting Bhagalpur with New Delhi at Barh railway station .
The police are often helpless in face of widespread vandalism
They were protesting against violence against migrant workers from Bihar in the faraway western city of Mumbai .
Train travel in Bihar has been always fraught with dangers with aggressive ticketless travellers and train robbers looting passengers .
Burning down trains is just the latest threat .
Multiple dangers
But why do people in Bihar vent their ire on trains and set them on fire ?
A senior police official , Neelmani , says people think authorities will take note of their grievances if they burn important public property like trains .
" When you target railways , you disrupt movement of trains for several hours and then your voice reaches the concerned authorities , " he said .
Railway official Gyan Prakash Srivastava says people who attack trains have no respect for public property .
" I believe it is because of the lack of public awareness and respect for government property . "
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is dismayed by the train burning spree in his state .
" Railways are our lifeline and a government asset .
I have asked my officials to go through station video footage and arrest the vandals , " he told the BBC .
In fact , trains are attacked in Bihar over every other issue .
Earlier this month , students protesting the murder of an owner of a private teaching institute ransacked the Lakhisarai railway station and disrupted the movement of trains .
Train travel is unsafe in Bihar
The very next day , four passengers were shot inside an inter -state train at Punpun railway station after a row between two groups over seat sharing .
Locals say travelling by train in Bihar is becoming increasingly dangerous .
" Anything can happen to you - you could be robbed , drugged , shot for a seat , thrown out of the coach for refusing a bribe to the police , or have your coach burnt down by an angry mob , " says Sanoj Kumar , a bank official who is a daily intercity passenger .
There is even a gang going around whose members routinely rob passengers after spiking their food and drink with sedatives .
Every day , five to six passengers drugged and looted by the gang are reported in Bihar , says Umesh Sinha , railway superintendent of police .
Some of these victims have died of an overdose or have been admitted to hospital , he said .
Then there is the problem of illegal " halt stations " where trains are forced to stop by local people - there are more than 100 of them in the state , many with actual names : some are named after local politicians and one even after a former president .
And yet while rail travel is unsafe in Bihar , seven federal railway ministers have come from the state .

Nach Wahlschlappe :
Althaus tritt zurück
Dieter Althaus ist als Ministerpräsident und Landeschef der CDU in Thüringen zurückgetreten .
Damit wird eine große Koalition mit der SPD wahrscheinlich .
Die Linke bietet der SPD offene Gespräche an .
ERFURT ap | Vier Tage nach dem Wahldebakel der Thüringer CDU ist Ministerpräsident Dieter Althaus von seinem Posten als Partei - und Regierungschef zurückgetreten .
" Mit sofortiger Wirkung trete ich als Ministerpräsident des Freistaats Thüringen und als Landesvorsitzender der CDU Thüringen zurück " , erklärte Althaus am Donnerstag in Erfurt .
Weitere Angaben machte er zunächst nicht .
Mit seinem Rückzug ist eine Koalition mit der SPD wahrscheinlicher geworden .
Althaus war nach den massiven Verlusten am Sonntag in die Kritik geraten .
Vereinzelt wurden Rufe nach seinem Rücktritt laut .
Unter anderen erklärte der Präsident des Gemeinde - und Städtebundes in Thüringen , Michael Brychcy , Althaus solle sich freiwillig zurückziehen .
" Wenn man den Neuanfang will , dann geht es nicht anders " , wurde das langjährige CDU - Mitglied zitiert .
Auch der CDU - Landtagsabgeordnete Günter Grüner forderte
Althaus auf , notfalls zurückzutreten , um eine schwarz - rote Regierung zu ermöglichen .
Die Linken und die Grünen in Thüringen begrüßten den Schritt .
Linkspartei -Spitzenkandidat Bodo Ramelow bezeichnete den Rücktritt als " tragisches Ende eines tragischen Ministerpräsidenten " .
Er habe nicht die Größe gehabt , am Sonntag nach der Landtagswahl zurückzutreten .
Nach seiner Einschätzung musste Althaus auf Druck der eigenen Partei zurücktreten .
Auch die Grünen erklärten , der Rückzug sei " die richtige Konsequenz aus dem rundum verunglückten Wahlkampf der CDU Thüringen " .
Der hessische Ministerpräsident Roland Koch dankte Althaus für die Zusammenarbeit in den vergangenen Jahren .
" Es ist bedauerlich , dass die politischen Umstände so sind , dass Dieter Althaus es für nötig hielt , im Interesse seines Landes und seiner Partei diesen schwierigen Entschluss zu fassen . "
Zu den genauen Gründen für den Rücktritt war zunächst wenig bekannt .
Der Thüringer Bauminister und Vertraute von Althaus , Gerold Wucherpfennig , erklärte im Sender N24 : " Dieter Althaus wollte den Verhandlungen , die jetzt geführt werden , nicht im Wege stehen . "
Linkspartei -Kandidat Ramelow sieht nach eigenen Worten trotz des Rücktritts keine größeren Hürden für eine Koalition zwischen Linken und Sozialdemokraten .
Die Schnittmengen zwischen SPD und Linkspartei seien viel größer als mit der CDU , sagte er der Nachrichtenagentur AP .
" Die CDU muss in die Opposition .
Es kommt auf die Inhalte an und nicht auf das Personal . "
Die CDU stürzte bei der Wahl am Sonntag um zwölf Punkte auf 31,2 Prozent ab und ist erstmals seit zehn Jahren auf einen Koalitionspartner angewiesen .
Eine Regierungsmehrheit kann sie nur mit der SPD unter Spitzenkandidat Christoph Matschie erreichen .
Auch eine Koalition zwischen SPD und Linkspartei ist möglich .
Die Parteien blockieren sich bislang , weil sowohl Ramelow als auch Matschie Ministerpräsident werden wollen .
Ramelow betonte am Donnerstag aber , dass man am Freitag ohne Bedingungen in die Sondierung mit der SPD gehen werde .
Noch am Mittwoch erhielt Althaus Rückendeckung aus der CDU - Landtagsfraktion in Erfurt und von der Bundes - CDU .
Im vergangenen Jahr wurde er ohne Gegenstimmen zum Landesvorsitzenden wiedergewählt .
Allerdings verursachte der passionierte Sportler an Neujahr einen schweren Skiunfall in Österreich , bei dem eine Frau ums Leben kam und er schwer verletzt wurde .
Nach langem Klinikaufenthalt kehrte erst vor vier Monaten in die Politik zurück .
Sein Umgang mit dem Unfall sorgte bei der Opposition für großen Unmut .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A proposed health - care compromise by the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee lacks a government - run insurance option favored by Democrats and would tax the most expensive health insurance plans , a source close to the discussions told CNN Monday .
Sen . Max Baucus , D - Montana , is the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee .
As expected , the proposal from Sen. Max Baucus , D - Montana , excludes the public insurance option to compete with private insurers .
However , it would allow for the creation of nonprofit health care cooperatives -- an idea that some moderate Democrats and Republicans have expressed possible interest in supporting .
The potential compromise proposal was sent to key Finance Committee negotiators Saturday night .
It is considered a last - ditch effort to secure Republican votes for a health - care bill as President Obama pushes the issue with a planned speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night .
So far , none of the three Republican senators involved in talks with Baucus on the compromise have indicated whether they support the version he is proposing .
Congressional liberals are pushing strongly for inclusion of a public option ; conservatives are sharply opposed .
Obama has said he supports a public option but has not clearly indicated he will veto a bill that fails to include it .
On Monday , Obama reiterated his support for a public option in a Labor Day speech to a union gathering in Cincinnati .
He outlined Democratic health - care proposals that include a public option as part of a menu of insurance choices , including private health - care plans , that the legislation would create .
" I continue to believe that a public option within that basket of insurance choices would help improve quality and bring down costs , " Obama said to loud cheers .
The president also indicated he would push hard for the House and Senate to move forward on passing health - care legislation in his upcoming address to Congress .
" The Congress and the country have been engaged in a vigorous debate for many months , " Obama said .
" And the debate has been good , and that 's important because we have to get this right .
" But every debate at some point comes to an end , " he continued , to growing applause .
" At some point , it 's time to decide .
At some point , it 's time to act .
And Ohio , it 's time to act to get this done . "
Baucus ' bill would cost less than $ 900 billion over 10 years , according to the source who spoke to CNN .
The price tag is at least $ 100 billion less than any other health - care reform bill under consideration by Congress , the source said .
As with other reform proposals , the bill would bar insurance companies from dropping a policyholder in the event of illness as long as that person has paid his or her premium in full .
It adds new protections for people with pre-existing conditions and establishes tax credits to help low and middle - income families purchase insurance coverage , the source noted .
It creates health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small groups and individuals to buy insurance .
The bill would be paid for , in part , by a new tax on health insurance companies that provide high - end " Cadillac " insurance plans , the source added .
Supporters of such a tax -- initially proposed by Massachusetts Sen .
John Kerry and other Democrats several weeks ago -- say will it help curb the cost of health care by discouraging employers from offering such plans .
They also argue that consumers , in turn , will be discouraged from overusing the health care system .
Watch senators discuss health care talks »
Critics claim the new tax will cause insurance companies to raise rates on all of their customers , even those without more expensive plans .
The so - called " Gang of Six " Senate negotiators -- a group of three Democrats and three Republicans on the Finance Committee -- is scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss the proposal .
The source , while stressing that the proposed bill is not a final product , said it closely reflects the group 's work and areas of agreement .
Obama 's planned speech to Congress reflects how overhauling the nation 's ailing health - care system has become his top domestic priority .
He laced his speech Monday with references to health care costs rising at three times the rate of wages , and insurance industry practices that deny coverage for pre-existing conditions or prevent people from obtaining coverage if they lose their jobs .
Multiple sources told CNN Friday that the administration is preparing for the possibility of delivering its own legislation to Capitol Hill sometime after the president 's address .
One source called the possibility of new legislation a " contingency " approach if efforts by Baucus to craft a deal fall through .
A big open question is whether two Republican members of the Gang of Six -- Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming -- will support the bipartisan proposal .
White House and Democratic leadership sources have said for some time they do not think Grassley and Enzi will sign on .
A source close to the White House said Friday that the administration is leaning toward dropping the public option , and continues to zero in on trying to convince moderate Republican Sen.
Olympia Snowe , another of the Senate Finance Committee negotiators , to come on board .
Snowe and the White House have been discussing a trigger provision that would mandate creation of a public health insurance option if specific thresholds for expanded coverage and other changes are not met .
Support by Snowe would improve the chances of the Senate 's Democratic majority to compile the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster against a health care bill .
The Senate Finance Committee is the last of five congressional committees needed to approve health - care legislation before it can be taken up by the full Senate and House of Representatives .
Different forms of the legislation proposed by Democrats have already cleared three House committees , as well as the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee .
CNN 's Ted Barrett and Dana Bash contributed to this report .
All About Health Care Costs • U.S. Senate Committee on Finance
Just got a batch of shots and some info direct from the set of Collapse , a zombie movie filming in Iowa .
It looks to be a family drama about a man trying to provide for the family in the face of the zombie apocalypse .
Here ’s the official synopsis I received :
Chris Mulkey ( Saving Grace , Cloverfield , North Country , Radio ) stars as Robert Morgan , a farmer struggling to make ends meet .
When zombies invade , Roger must protect his wife Molly , played by Karen Landry ( Six Feet Under , St. Elsewhere ) and his son Will .
Roger fortifies his home , but as supplies dwindle , he is forced to fight his way through the small town of Plains Falls .
None of the images they sent had any zombies in them , but I know if there ’s anything zombie fans like almost as much as zombies , it ’s guns .
And we have guns :
After the break , more images and additional info …
Here ’s a few more tidbits to whet your appetites , courtesy of production intern Ronnie M. Williams :
You will be happy to know that the directors , Mike Saunders and Jason Bolinger , really want these to be slow zombies , although the want to depict that these zombies have heightened senses , like a blind zombie is able to smell out Roger and gunshots / noises attract more zombies .
In addition , a few zombies will use weapons like farming tools .
When I talked with Mike Saunders , he said that he and Jason have wanted to make a zombie film for quite some time , but they purposely waited until know .
Mike said that they didnâ€™t want to have to make another zombie film when they thought of new ideas , so they waited until they generated all of their zombie ideas .
At one point in the film , Roger discovers a severed zombie head .
He names the head â€ œBobâ€ and decides to take it with him .
Roger also creates a zombie killer bat with nails and a saw blade in it .
( Iâ€™ve included a photo )
One more casting tidbit : Linnea Quigley will appear as “ Coach Bell . ”
So , what do you think ?
You can find more images and info at the official Collapse Facebook page .
And check back here for more info as I receive it !

I run a small business selling software ( downloadable and online ) which lets parents and teachers make bingo cards .
It is October , which is the busiest season on the educational bingo calendar , largely because Halloween is coming up .
Kids in school + candy - fueled frenzy + secular ( ish ) holiday + desire for fun activity = bingo bonanza !
However , due to an IE CSS bug , my Halloween experience is best described as “ bobbing for poisoned apples ” .
The Design Improvement That Wasn’t
On September 21st my designer and I got together and we created a new candidate design for my sign up and login pages , which are both critical to conversions for my business .
The intent was to A/B test the new pages against the old design .
One critically important niggle that did n’t bother me at the time : while ideally an A/ B test would test exactly the old HTML against exactly the new HTML , for obscure implementation reasons we ended up testing the old HTML plus one little change versus the new HTML .
That one little change was replacing the old sign up button ( the stock HTML form submit one ) with a graphical button .
I thought this was such an obviously beneficial change that it was not worth taking on extra coding complexity to keep it the old way .
Stupid , stupid , stupid .
Thanks to the magic of subversion I was able to recover exactly the HTML that was displayed on my site after the upgrade .
( This is one of the two A / B alternatives but it is exactly identical to the other one in the area that is relevant . )
Feel free to open that in your browser and see if you can spot the problem .
At this point I have to mention that I generally use IE8 or Chrome , and my designer uses Firefox .
This means I had never seen the new version of my site in IE6 or IE7 until trying to do tech support from an Internet cafe last night .
( Being a proper Japanese salaryman , I had missed the last train and stopped at the cafe to answer customer emails prior to staying at a hotel . )
Whereupon I discovered a slight problem .
In IE7 , the site looked more like :
Hmm , the signup form has no visible sign up button .
The log in form also had no visible log in button .
I started panicking but was in no position to fix the bug at 2 AM in the morning from an Internet cafe , although I made a game attempt to do so .
( Word to the wise : trying to fix a Rails application by editing files in vi through a web console to your Slicehost VPS is not recommended . )
How Well Do Forms Without Buttons Convert ?
Answer : not well at all .
You can still submit a form by hitting the Enter button even if you ca n’t see the submit button .
This is , however , not standard user behavior in my niche .
Let ’s see what that did to conversion rates .
Using custom segments ( a power - user feature from Google Analytics that I ’ve literally never had any useful purpose for before ) , I ’ve graphed the conversion rates among IE8 users ( orange line ) , IE6 / 7 users ( green line ) , and the site average ( blue line ) .
As you can see , IE6 / 7 and IE8 are pretty much neck and neck in the month before the bug is introduced .
This makes sense , as we would not intuitively assume those two user populations would be very different from each other .
You can also see that they both track the site average reasonably well , which is practically true by definition as IE users make up the majority of visitors on my site ( about 65 % , give or take ) .
Then , after the bug gets introduced , the conversion rates for IE6 / 7 take a nosedive relative to IE8 .
The site average in blue also declines , solely because it is being pulled lower by the underperformance of the old IEs .
In concrete terms , the conversion rate of IE6 / IE7 users was 3.40 % after the bug .
( Note that this is not the conversion rate among people actually viewing the login / registration screens .
Google Analytics does n’t let me conveniently break the numbers down for that . )
The conversion of IE8 users , by comparison , was 9.53 % .
In other words , if you trust my intuition that IE6 / 7 users are about as likely to convert as IE8 users all else being equal ( which you should , just by eyeballing that graph ) , then I lost about 64 % of my conversions since September 21st .
Putting The Damage In Economic Terms
I ’m a glutton for punishment so I ’m going to do the painful math .
Between September 21st and October 23rd , when I fixed the bug , I had roughly $ 4,500 worth of sales , of which IE6 / 7 users comprised about $ 2,080 .
Since the IE6 / 7 bug is essentially meaningless after you get through registration ( since the overwhelming majority of users pick Remember Me and never see either the sign in or sign up forms again ) , I ’m going to make the simplifying assumption that the bug ripples straight to my bottom line .
We can then use simple math to figure out how much the 64 % of sales I threw away was probably worth .
Ouch , I am wincing as I type this : $ 3,750 in lost sales .
That unfortunately flows almost straight to the bottom line , since all of my major costs ( advertising , hosting , etc ) happen whether I make the sale or not — I probably lost in excess of $ 3,400 in profits .
That is more than my monthly salary .
How The Heck Do You Overlook That ?
I wish I could blame Microsoft for my stupidity on this one , but aside from not testing the page in IE6 / IE7 ( which would have shown the bug immediately ) , I had ample opportunities to discover that there was a problem somewhere .
However , other things in the chaotic , fractally complex system that is a small business concealed them from me .
Indication # 1 : There are two types of signups on my site , trial signups ( where I capture an email address ) and anonymous guest signups ( where I do n’t ) .
Historically , I push the trial signups much harder , and my users signed up for them at a multiple of the guest signups .
( Guest accounts scarcely convert for me at all , which is why I do n’t push them much .
However , an A/ B test proved that removing the option did n’t increase the number of trials or paying customers , so I left the option in . )
Thus , when the mix of trial and guest users suddenly went from 880 : 350 to 792 : 506 , I should have said “ Wait a minute , the guest accounts are getting much more popular .
Why is that ? ”
The answer to that is : Unsophisticated users , like the ones who make up most of my audience , will fill in their information and then see ‘ Sign in as guest ’ and ‘ Cancel ’ .
Given only these two choices , clearly they want to ‘ Sign in as guest ’ rather than figure , “ hmm , typically guest accounts do n’t have usernames or passwords associated with them , I should email Patrick and ask what happened to the real sign up button . ”
And indeed , I did see the explosion of guests on my stats , but I had changed the graphing option from showing daily counts to showing weekly counts , and the disparity was n’t big enough to catch my sustained attention .
( The inflection point on September 21st is immediately visible on the daily graph . )
After considering the matter for a few minutes I said “ Eh , Halloween is coming up , which always broadens my market .
Maybe it is bringing in some less interested folks .
Oh well , nothing to worry about . ”
Indication # 2 :
I check my conversion rates on AdWords roughly once a week , largely because if they start to suffer Google stops running my ads and I lose a lot of money .
I then noticed that the numbers were below where I expected them to be ( “ Hmm , that ’s funny , a few weeks ago I was getting 24 – 27 % , now it is saying 18 % … what is up ? ” ) but I never ran the following graph to see the full range .
Yeah , just from eyeballing that , you can see the problem right ?
Visualizations are wonderful for seeing problems that you already know to look for .
However , they are poor for informing you of problems that are n’t visible in the default visualization , since you wo n’t spend the time to slice the data to see the problem if you do n’t know it exists .
Honestly , I do n’t know why I did n’t immediately punch the panic button when I saw my AdWords conversion rates start declining .
Again , October always throws my numbers into a total mess , and I was very busy in my day job and in my various seasonal initiatives for taking advantage of Halloween .
So busy , in fact , that I offset most of the decline in sales , and so was n’t given any advance warning by , e.g. , having sales plunge to a fraction of normal .
Indication # 3 : What finally clued me into looking for this problem was a pattern in customer support requests , of all things .
As I mentioned earlier , guest accounts are historically rarer than trial accounts and they convert very , very poorly .
As a matter of fact , I think I probably had one sale to a guest account in history prior to the bug being introduced .
The code that I have which upgrades accounts in response to people paying me via Paypal and Google Checkout does n’t handle guest accounts very well , because they ’re anonymous .
It upgrades the account fine , but does n’t register the email address they used for their payment with the guest account , which means the account still can’t log in after logging out .
( Since the guest account is still anonymous . )
However , since the system knows that the Registration Key issued to the purchaser is in use ( on their guest account ) , if for some reason they log out or switch computers , they ’ll be both unable to register a new account ( because their Registration Key is in use ) and unable to log into their guest account ( because it is anonymous ) .
That is a pretty nasty Catch 22 .
I ’ve known about that Catch 22 for a while , but fixing it was not high on my list of priorities .
All of the following has to happen for it to actually bite a customer :
They start using a guest account .
They do n’t give an email address when prompted by the fairly frequent upsells within the guest account .
They nonetheless purchase the software within their guest session .
They choose to use the online version of the software rather than the downloadable version ( a not - insignificant portion of customers think the online version is the trial and the downloadable version is the “ real deal ” — well , if they pay me money , they can think whatever they please ) .
They clear their cookies .
They try to log in again .
Prior to the bug being introduced , I thought “ This sequence of events is about as likely as flipping a coin and having it land on edge . ”
And , indeed , it only ever happened to one person .
I fixed her record manually , looked at the code which caused the problem , and figured that an immediate fix was impossible .
Why not just set their email address to the one the payment processor just gave me ?
Well , Google Checkout has an option which it labels “ Opt out of marketing email from this merchant ” which , if the customer checks it , gives me an email address like “ John.234982385@checkout.google.com ” for them .
Obviously , my customers do n’t know those random addresses , so using them for a login name is out of the question .
I was also worried that many people ’s Paypal addresses are not the ones they use on a daily basis , so using them for logins was suboptimal , so I deferred finding a solution to the bug until later .
After all , it scarcely affected anyone , the cures were temporarily worse than the disease , and manually correcting their records was suboptimal but worked .
Then I got emails from three people in the same day who were hit by the guest - purchase bug .
That was finally the eight sigma event that convinced me that my process was really , really out of control .
Whereupon I started investigating , beginning ( fortuitously ) with trying to log into my admin page on the site while on the Internet cafe ’s IE7 , and noticing that there was no login button .
Technical Mumbo Jumbo
If you ’re a CSS geek , you might be interested in knowing why the buttons vanished .
Fair enough : the HTML input element had a background image specified and a text - indent :- 9000 px property applied to it , which puts the standard text for the button way off the screen , leaving only the background image visible .
However , IE6 / IE7 treat text - indent as moving the background image as well , so the entire control essentially vanished , leaving empty , unclickable space where it used to be .
The fix was fairly simple .
I am truly indebted to Laurence at My Drupal Blog for posting about it .
He probably saved me an ulcer .
Essentially , I identify which browsers are using IE and then apply some sort of hacky stylings to make the background image display visibly , but cause the Sign Up text to be invisible by blending it with the background .
It is very hacky — sort of like patching a wound to your artery with duct tape — but you ca n’t be too choosy when you ’re leaking over $ 100 a day and have the CSS skills of a vole rat .
On The Bright Side
I do n’t want to give you the wrong impression : despite this very , very serious issue , my business has been doing very well in October .
The usual seasonal fluctuation , my seasonal promotions , and all the various improvements I ’ve been making in the last few months will still make it my best month ever , and historically the last week of October sees a strong spurt in sales , so it might even be the best month ever by quite a margin .
I also got a much - needed kick in the pants to remind me to test all changes , even the stupid little one - line changes , in all the browsers my customers routinely use .
One positive lesson learned is that IE8 ’s compatibility mode reproduced this bug exactly , so that will be an easy way to do this going forward .
Ideally I ’d have some sort of automated test suite set up to catch this sort of thing ( using Selenium or what have you ) , but that is n’t in the cards at present .
At the very least , I ’m going to upgrade my automated stats tracking put big red warnings on my dashboard when the business starts to fail sanity checks .
An obnoxious red warning about conversion rates would have caught this a month ago , within less than 24 hours of the bug going into production .
I hope you learned something from my experience , and am quite willing to take additional lumps in the comments if you have any suggestions for good ways of preventing a similar bug in the future .
Happy Halloween !
Up to 100,000 civilians have fled the conflict zone Pakistani troops have captured the key Taliban town of Kotkai in South Waziristan , security officials say .
Troops took the town after days of bombardments , officials said .
Three soldiers and four Taliban were reported killed in the fighting overnight .
Kotkai , home to top Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud , has seen fierce fighting since Pakistan launched its South Waziristan offensive last week .
Journalists are being denied access to the area and cannot verify the reports .
Up to 100,000 civilians have fled the conflict zone , the army says .
FORCES IN WAZIRISTAN Pakistan army : Two divisions totalling 28,000 soldiers Frontier Corp : Paramilitary forces from tribal areas likely to support army Taliban militants : Estimated between 10,000 and 20,000 Uzbek fighters supporting militants : several hundred
Challenges in Waziristan Profile : South Waziristan South Waziristan is considered to be the main sanctuary for Islamic militants outside Afghanistan .
Pakistan launched its offensive after a wave of militant attacks , believed to have been orchestrated from South Waziristan , killed more than 150 people .
' Breakthrough ' Pakistani troops - backed by artillery , helicopters and fighter jets - were reported to have briefly taken control of Kotkai in the course of fighting earlier this week .
But on Tuesday morning the Taliban hit back , destroying army checkpoints and killing seven soldiers , local officials said .

However Pakistan 's army subsequently said it had secured the tactically important heights around Kotkai .
On Saturday , AFP quoted an official as saying : " Security forces took control of Kotkai overnight and a clearance operation is in progress .
" It is a major breakthrough because it was the stronghold of Taliban and hometown of Hakimullah Mehsud and Qari Hussain , " he added , referring to a reputed trainer of suicide bombers .
The BBC's Mark Dummett , in Islamabad , says the fighting is now expected to move into more remote and mountainous areas , as the army continues its drive deeper into this militant stronghold .
Meanwhile , at least 13 people were reported to have been killed by a US drone missile strike targeting a Taliban commander 's house in the tribal region of Bajaur .
Officials said the strike had hit the house of Maulvi Faqir in Damadola village .

What are these ?

Long before you 're consciously aware of making a decision , your mind has already made it .
If that 's the case , do people actually make decisions ?
Or is every choice – even the choice to prepare for future choices – an unthinking , mechanistic procedure over which an illusory self - awareness is laid ?
Those questions are raised by a study conducted by Max Planck Institute neuroscientists and published Sunday in Nature Neuroscience .
Test subjects chose whether to push a button with their right or left hand ;
seven seconds before they experienced making the choice , their brain activity already predicted their final decisions .
For more on the experiment , see my Wired.com story , for which I had the privilege of speaking to Martha Farah , director of the University of
Pennsylvania 's Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and a prominent neuroethicist .
As is so often the case in journalism , we had a fascinating ( email ) conversation that did n't fit into the article itself , and I decided – ha – to publish it here .
__
Me:__
The big question is how much people should feel comfortable extrapolating these results to other , more seemingly complex decisions about which we feel a deep personal connection – do I rent an apartment , get involved in a relationship , leave my job in search of another , and so on .
__
Martha Farah:__
The authors have taken an important first step toward understanding how we make decisions , and toward revealing the apparently prolonged cascade of unconscious processes that precede the conscious decisions we make with what seems like " free will . "
But of course there is always a trade - off in science between making a process scientifically tractable and making it realistic .
Remember , Galileo rolled balls down inclines and theorized about infinite frictionless planes ; he did n't set about trying to understand the fluttering , zig - zagging motion of a falling leaf !
The authors started with a very simple decision - making task , and their results now form the basis for some good working hypotheses to be tested with more complex decisions .
__
Me:__
How do these results square with our notion of free will ?
Do they obviate free will , which in that light is an illusion ; or might there still be a balance between free will and unconscious decisions ;
or is free will still paramount , but operating at some other level ?
__
MF:__
Let me start with a very general observation .
Neuroscience is changing the way we think about ourselves .
One of the hardest changes for people to assimilate is the idea that our intentional , voluntary behavior is the product of a physical system , the brain .
If physical processes in the brain cause our actions , then how can there be free will ?
How can we be held responsible for our behavior ?
Ca n't we just all plead " my brain made me do it " ?
The Soon et al paper jumps right into the middle of these issues .
It shows us how limited , even misleading , our introspections are .
According to the authors , many seconds before we are aware that we have made a decision , we have – or at least , our brain has !
All of the data of cognitive neuroscience are pushing us to replace the idea of mind - body duality , which is so intuitive , with the idea that mental processes are brain processes .
But these results on the neural processes underlying free decisions rub our noses in it !
One can assimilate findings about color vision or motor control being brain functions a lot more easily than findings about consciously experienced
" free will " being a brain function , and hence physically determined and not free at all !
I do n't think " free will " is a very sensible concept , and you do n't need neuroscience to reject it – any mechanistic view of the world is good enough , and indeed you could even argue on purely conceptual grounds that the opposite of determinism is randomness , not free will !
Most thoughtful neuroscientists I know have replaced the concept of free will with the concept of rationality – that we select our actions based on a kind of practical reasoning .
And there is no conflict between rationality and the mind as a physical system – After all , computers are rational physical systems !
__
Me:__
As I 'm sure you often hear , this makes my head spin a bit .
One follow - up : re : the replacement of free will with the concept of rationality , selecting actions based on practical reasoning – I can see how rationality and the mind as physical system do n't conflict , but does n't the very concept of selection ( and , arguably , reasoning ) imply an agency that is rendered illusory by findings like these ?
__
MF:__ Depends what you mean by agency ...
If you think of a computer selecting certain actions based on a combination of inputs and stored information about goals etc , then there is a ( not too head - spinny )
sense in which the computer is the agent selecting the actions .
( Of course , what makes the computer that kind of agent that it is , making the selections that it does , is its whole history – how it was designed , what kind of goals and knowledge have been programmed in , etc. –
But it is the computer , in its current state , that is selecting and so it seems reasonable to say it is the locus of the rational decision . )
Going back to the Nature Neuroscience findings , the parts of the brain whose activity are correlated with the decision and precede the person 's conscious awareness of having decided – as well as potentially other parts – are the analogs of the computer described above ...
And this happens well before the conscious experience of " free will " making the decision .
One advantage of focusing on rationality rather than free will is that it enables us to retain the concept of moral and legal responsibility .
If someone is rational and is not under coercion ( eg someone holds a gun to your head and says you 'll be shot if you do n't do X ) then it is reasonable to hold him or her responsible ...
Me : Still struggling a bit .
But not because of any deficiencies or illogic in your own excellent explanation – I suspect my response to all this is skewed by some instinctive ( subconscious – ha ) need to cling to the idea of free will .
Perhaps because my sense of free will is tied in some inexplicable way to my sense of self and ...
authenticity ?
That 's not the right word .
Maybe I should come right out and say ( non-religious ) soul , of which free will is a manifestation .
Somehow the computer does n't seem satisfactory , in the sense that a rational program would make the same decision again and again again .
Somehow that does n't seem alive .
I 'm always unsettled by computational analogies to the soul , in the sense that the appearance of self - awareness is not the same thing as self - awareness .
That the Turing test was devised by someone for whom disguising or transcending the body was so ( sadly ) necessary , and Norbert Wiener himself such a person of mind rather than body , adds to my unsettlement .
But that 's my own superstition , rather than a real critique .
Seen here : penguin suit .
Dark levels can get pretty tricky .
Yeah , this guy .
As much as I enjoyed the original New Super Mario Bros. on the DS , with its return to traditional 2D form , I could n't help wanting a little more .
Some new suits for Mario to power up with , the ability to fly , perhaps a return appearance by Kuribo 's Shoe .
The game hewed to Mario 's simpler platform beginnings , but at least it was a good blueprint for a new era of 2D Mario games .
Enter New Super Mario Bros .
Wii , which Ryan and I just got back from playing several new levels of .
Nintendo's Bill Trinen gave us an in - depth look at the main story mode -- I use " story " loosely here , since the story is " Hey , rescue the princess ! " -- to give us a better sense of how the game will work in between the up - to - four - player shenanigans that will occur in each action stage .
I think it 's fair to say that both of us started getting a distinct Super Mario Bros.
3 sort of vibe from the game after just a few minutes .
What would make me namedrop that most revered of all games ?
There are a lot of little elements in NSMB
Wii that make it seem like a more robust Mario adventure than its DS predecessor .
Like NSMB DS , this one operates with a simple world map that you navigate to get from stage to stage , but this time there seems to be a lot more side activities going on in between the actual stages .
Remember in Mario 3 , how you could go into mushroom houses to get new items ?
Or you 'd run into enemies on the world map from time to time and had to fight them ?
All that stuff is in here , and it works with all four players .
For example , we tried a four - player tile - matching game that let us reap all the items we were able to match before we matched the wrong cards and got booted out .
Then there 's the suits and power - ups .
There 's more of 'em !
Nintendo showed off the propeller and penguin suits at E3 ; the former lets you get lift with your helicopter head , and the latter gets you more traction on icy surfaces and gives you a belly slide maneuver .
Then there 's this other new one that we got to see today .
( At least , it was new to us . )
Allow me now to turn your world upside down , as mine was .
Ice flower .
I know , right ?
How did it take so long for them to come up with ?
It does pretty much what you 'd expect : you throw ice balls with the same bounce as a fireball , and those encase any enemies they touch in a big block of ice .
Then you can pick that ice block up and throw it , or use it as a stepping stone .
They 'll even float to the surface of water , so you could ice some cheep - cheeps and then use them as stepping stones to reach a higher platform .
Also like Mario 3 : this game is tough .
There 's a certain amount of controlled chaos that goes in on multiplayer games , mainly because the player characters have collision detection with each other .
So you might jump on somebody 's head at the wrong moment and send them straight down a pit , or fling a careless koopa shell right into your friend and kill them .
Even in single - player , though , the game is pretty tough -- I encountered some really tricky jumps involving big , rotating gears and a bunch of lava just in the castle at the end of world one .
Still another throwback : Koopa kids !
Those eight troublemakers introduced in SMB3 are back to cause trouble with their pops again , and I fought one of them at the end of that first castle .
I think it was Lemmy .
Or maybe Iggy .
He had crazy hair and a magic wand , and man , it was a nostalgic trip to be fighting a Koopa kid at the end of a castle again .
I jumped on him three times and he died .
Some things never change .
Perhaps you 've noticed , but I 'm pretty excited there 's more to New SMB
Wii than it seemed back at E3 .
I had a sense there that the game was , well , the DS game with four - player action crammed in , but it 's clear there 's plenty of new mechanics and a wonderfully nostalgic vibe about this game .
It looks great , too , with lots of little touches in the animation and special effects that give the game character .
They 're the sort of things that are hard to describe but instantly make sense when you see them .
And you 'll get your chance to do that when New Super Mario Bros .
Wii ships on November 15 .
Nintendo says a new video of all this business is on the way next week , so stay tuned for that .
Meanwhile , here 's an old one !

Gwynne Dyer ….salt lake city
September 2 , 2009
A quarter - century after a million Ethiopians died in the great hunger of 1984 - 85 , the country is heading into another famine .
The spring rains failed entirely and the summer rains were three weeks late .
But why is famine is stalking Ethiopia again ?
Read More
The Ethiopian government is authoritarian , but it is n’t incompetent .
It gives fertilizer to farmers and teaches best practices .
By the late 1990s the country was self - sufficient in food in good years , and the government had created a strategic food reserve for the bad years .
So why are we back here again ?
Infant deaths are already over two per 10,000 per day in Somali , the worst - hit region of Ethiopia .
( Four per day counts as full - scale famine . )
Country - wide , 20 percent of the population already depends on the dwindling flow of foreign food aid , and it will get worse for many months yet .
What have the Ethiopians done wrong ?
The real answer is they have had too many babies .
Ethiopia ’s population at the time of the last famine 25 years ago was 40 million .
Now it is 80 million .
You can do everything else right and if you do n’t control the population , you ’re spitting into the wind .
It is so obvious that this should be the start of every conversation about the country .
Even if the coming famine in Ethiopia kills a million people , the population will keep growing .
So the next famine , 10 or 15 years from now , will hit a country of a hundred million people , trying to make a living from farming on land where only 40 million faced starvation in the 1980s .
It is going to get much uglier in Ethiopia .
Yet it ’s taboo to say that .
The question of population , instead of being central to the debate about development , food and climate change , has been put on ice .
The reason is rich countries are secretly embarrassed , and poor countries are deeply resentful .
Suppose Ethiopia had been the first country to industrialize .
Suppose some mechanical genius in Tigray invented the world ’s first steam engine in 1710 .
The first railways were spreading across the country by the 1830s , and at the same time Ethiopian entrepreneurs and imperialists spread all over Africa .
By the end of the 19th century , they controlled half of Europe , too .
Never mind the improbabilities .
The point is Ethiopia with such a history would easily be rich enough to support 80 million people now — if it could not grow enough food it would import it , just like Britain ( where the industrial revolution actually started ) .
Money makes everything easy .
In 1710 , when the first practical steam engine was built in Devonshire , the population of Britain was 7 million .
It is now 61 million , but they do not fear famine .
They eat very well despite importing over a third of their food .
They got in first , so although they never worried about population growth , they got away with it .
Ethiopia has more than four times the land surface of Britain .
The rain is less reliable , but a rich Ethiopia would have no trouble feeding its people .
The problem is that it got the population growth without the wealth .
Stopping the population growth now would be very hard , but otherwise , famine will be a permanent resident in another 20 years .
The problem is well understood .
The population of the rich countries has grown about tenfold since the earliest days of the industrial revolution , but for the first half of that period it grew quite slowly .
Many babies died and there were no cures for most epidemic diseases .
Later the death rate dropped , but by then , with people feeling more secure in their lives , the birth rate was dropping , too .
In most of the poor countries the population hardly grew at all until the start of the 20th century .
But once the population did start to grow , thanks to basic public health measures that cut the death rate , it grew faster than it ever did in the rich countries .
Unfortunately , economies do n’t grow that fast , so these countries never achieved the level of comfort and security where most people will start to reduce their family size spontaneously .
At the current rate of growth , Ethiopia ’s population will double to 160 million people in just 32 years .
You ’re thinking :
That will never happen .
Famine will become normal in Ethiopia well before that .
No combination of wise domestic policies , and no amount of foreign aid , can stop it .
And you are right .
What applies to Ethiopia applies to many other African countries , including some that do not currently have famines .
Uganda , for example , had 5 million people in 1960 .
It now has 32 million , and at the current growth rate it will have 130 million by 2050 .
History is unfair .
Conversations between those who got lucky and those left holding the other end of the stick are awkward .
But we can not go on ignoring the elephant in the room .
We have to start talking about population again .
An emergency session was called specifically to address the US deal Left - wing South American leaders have condemned US plans to increase its military presence in Colombia at an emergency summit in Argentina .
Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez said it was part of a US strategy to dominate the region .
Bolivia and Ecuador also said the deal was a threat to peace .
But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe defended the plan , which will give US forces access to seven military bases .
Mr Uribe said it was needed to combat drug - traffickers and insurgents .
" We are not talking about a political game , we are talking about a threat that has spilled blood in Colombian society , " he said after holding up pictures of victims of attacks by leftist Farc rebels .
Final declaration Moderate leaders , including President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil , have expressed reservations about the plan but are trying to ease tensions between Colombia and its neighbours .
This is part of a global strategy of domination by the United States
Hugo Chavez
Venezuelan President President Lula again called for a meeting with US President Barack Obama and presidents of the Union of South American Nations ( Unasur ) grouping of South American leaders .
An attempt by Bolivian President Evo Morales to get the other presidents to sign a declaration rejecting the US deal with Colombia was itself rejected , the AFP news agency said .
Instead , the final declaration from the Unasur summit in the Argentine mountain resort of Bariloche said the 12 presidents " reaffirm that the presence of foreign military forces must not ... menace the sovereignty and integrity of a South American country and in consequence regional peace and stability , " AFP added .
The imminent US - Colombia pact has raised tensions on the continent , with Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez characterising it as a near declaration of war and questioning the motives behind it .
" This is part of a global strategy of domination by the United States .
That 's what 's this is , " Mr Chavez was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier sought to reassure Latin American nations about the planned 10 - year accord .
" It does provide the United States access to Colombian bases but command and control , administration and security will be Colombia 's responsibility , " she said earlier this month .
She said Washington has no intention of significantly increasing its troop numbers in Colombia or establishing a US base there .

Edgy comedian David Cross : Just how edgy is he ?
Edgy as a knife ( double - edged ) .
Sniffing coke while sitting near the President of the USA .
That 's what David Cross did , says David Cross .
Straight from Politico : Cross says he went to the White House Correspondents Association dinner and was sitting right up front and because he like to do crazy things to impress his friend , he did this :
" I 've got photos of all this .
...
I 'm there and the president is right here and with all these people at the table " Cross snorted some coke , he said .
" Maybe 40 feet from the president of the United States ! "
Pics or it did n't happen , David Cross .
This is the edgiest thing to happen at the White House Correspondents Association dinner since Steven Colbert devastatingly spoke truth to power , simultaneously bruising the egos of the White House lapdog press corps and making Bush squirm through a sparkling recounting of his tragic flaws .
This is a close second .
UPDATE : The friend he was trying to impress was Gavin McInnes , formerly of Vice .
Of course .

I wish I could say that Robbie Bach , the guy in charge of Microsoft 's mobile effort , told tales out of school during his roundtable discussion at Microsoft 's Open House Event last week .
He did not .
During the hour - long chat , which occurred just hours after the Windows Mobile 6.5 rollout , Bach , who serves as Microsoft 's President of Entertainment and Devices Division , stayed on message .
He did n't share about Windows Mobile 7 , and he scooted around questions regarding all future product plans .
Instead , he offered only that the company was pleased and excited with the day 's accomplishments : Windows Mobile 6.5 and a bunch of new phones .
That said , one part of the afternoon 's discussion stuck with me long after the weary - looking Bach ambled out of the room .
The more I thought about it , well , the more I could n't stop thinking about it .
It was when Bach got into the numbers .
No , not the total number of Windows Mobile phones sold last year ( I think he said 17 million ) and not the number of new Windows Mobile 6.5 devices launched that day ( by my count there were at least four ) .
It 's that other discussion the one we cannot get away from whenever we talk about smartphones :
How many mobile applications are there ?
Concurrent with the Windows Mobile 6.5 update is access to Microsoft 's brand - new application Marketplace .
This move surprised no one , since every single smartphone vendor has to have something to compete with Apple 's AppStore .
Bach talked about the current Window Mobile smartphone market ( the one that existed prior to the day 's launch ) .
According to Bach , there are 20,000 Windows Mobile apps on the market today .
This number , to be honest , shocked me , perhaps because I knew that Microsoft 's app marketplace had launched that day with just a bit over 260 applications .
The gap was so huge that I had to ask Bach about it , especially because he had also just told us that porting applications , which is , for the most part , pretty simple , " is not a major development effort . "
If there were so many apps and development is so simple , why did n't the Marketplace launch with 10,000 apps ?
That number , which I essentially plucked out of the air , was a bit unfair , but Bach 's answer was n't much better :
He told me that it " takes time to get the development environment out to people " and that " people were focusing on other things , " which is almost the same as saying , " people were busy . "
It 's what he said next , though , that really got me thinking .
I guess Bach felt a bit defensive , because he began to pick apart the very idea of application counting .
" The fascination with the absolute number is really nothing but a fascination , " said Bach .
He started using phrases like quality versus quantity .
" Sure there are 85,000 apps in Apple AppStore , how many of them are useful ? "
Bach asked .
" If you do the math on which apps get used , " Bach said , " there 's a relatively small number apps . "
Microsoft , he said , focused on delivering 200 useful apps in the Marketplace .
" Do you have the right apps ?
Do you have the apps that people are going to use ?
Do you have the apps are going to care about .
We 'll certainly have that . "
That sounds almost logical .
But another part of me was thinking about the fact that Apple has 85,000 apps and some of them are so much fun , like that virtual lighter and the Ocarina ( that thing is amazing ) .
There are other app stores , of course .
RIM 's app environment is a bit weak , still .
Google Android , well , that has , I think , 6,000 apps .
That 's pretty solid , though I do n't really know what any of them are .
Palm 's Web OS still only has a handful of apps :
That 's totally not cool .
Bach 's right .
It 's not the number of apps .
It 's , " Does the store , catalog , marketplace , whatever , have the apps you want and need ? "
I blame Apple for creating this app obsession .
No one counted applications in any space before the AppStore .
There used to be thousands of apps across countless categories , but that was for the PC and it was way back in the 80s and early 90s before Microsoft pushed competitors out of countless markets .
We never counted applications back then .
If we had , I could now tell you just how many there really were .
The problem is that obsession feeds on itself .
We not only talk about the number of apps in the AppStore , we report and people read about the number of downloads .
When Apple reported its one billionth download , I saw some outlets run stories that read as if there were one billion apps to download .
I know some people read it that way , because they started to run around saying that there were a billion apps .
Someday , there may be that many .
So what ?
There 's another school of thought that says this app market growth is unsustainable and , as I mentioned earlier , you know what happened in the PC app market .
Bach noted how difficult it is to find what you need in an application catalog as big as the AppStore ( quick , name 25 major applications ) .
That 's true , too .
Look , a rich mobile application store is a competitive advantage .
It makes every iPhone seem infinitely upgradeable and customizable .
It can be whatever you want it to be .
Apple 's built a whole marketing campaign around the notion : " Yeah , there 's an app for that . "
Microsoft 's would more likely be : " This is the app for that . "
There 's a subtle difference there .
Microsoft 's Bach believes it 's provided what you need to start .
Ah , but even Bach can't help but play the numbers game .
Ultimately , he did say that Microsoft , too , would have more apps and that they would arrive " in volume . "
Clearly , that 's a promise about numbers .
I guess it 's a game none of us can resist playing .
========== Cochrane Threatens Austrians More Than Krugman Ever Did
By Robert P. Murphy
Although some Austrian economists ( e.g. Mario Rizzo ) expressed disappointment with Chicago University economist John Cochrane ’s response to Paul Krugman ’s infamous NYT Magazine piece , for the most part the people on “ my side ” have high - fived Cochrane for kicking sand in Krugman ’s face .
This is a very short - sighted view .
Just because someone gets in a fight with someone who we ca n’t stand–and I ’ve criticized Krugman enough to have credibility on that score–does n’t mean we should endorse any old arguments .
There was quite a bit in Cochrane ’s response that should alarm an Austrian economist , and in fact his views are arguably more dangerous to the Austrian alternative than Krugman .
After all , all Krugman did was ignore us .
But Cochrane ignored us and defended himself from Krugman in a way that “ proves ” Austrian economics is a collection of second - rate ideas .
I do n’t see how any Austrian economist can overlook all of that , just because he likes Cochrane ’s conclusions that “ Keynesian economics is awful ” and “ Paul Krugman is a jerk , ” true those conclusions may be .
In this brief essay I ’ll quote from Cohrane and show how his ostensible attack on Krugman actually takes down Austrian economics as collateral damage .
Most of all , [ Krugman ’s article is ] sad .
Imagine this were n’t economics for a moment .
Imagine this were a respected scientist turned popular writer , who says , most basically , that everything everyone has done in his field since the mid 1960s is a complete waste of time .
Everything that fills its academic journals , is taught in its PhD programs , presented at its conferences , summarized in its graduate textbooks , and rewarded with the accolades a profession can bestow , including multiple Nobel prizes , is totally wrong .
Instead , he calls for a return to the eternal verities of a rather convoluted book written in the 1930s , as taught to our author in his undergraduate introductory courses .
If a scientist , he might be a global - warming skeptic , an AIDS - HIV disbeliever , a stalwart that maybe continents do n’t move after all , or that smoking is n’t that bad for you really .
I do n’t need to dwell on why Austrians should dismiss this opening salvo from Cochrane .
This is the incredibly naive
Whig theory of history .
Cochrane could just as easily blow up any Austrian who thinks Human Action contains better economic analysis than the latest edition of Mankiw .
( What ’s really ironic is that later in the essay , Cochrane says , “ Occasionally sciences , especially social sciences , do take a wrong turn for a decade or two .
I thought Keynesian economics was such a wrong turn .
So let ’s take a quick look at the ideas . ”
So I ’m not sure what to make of his opening paragraph .
It seems Cochrane finds it “ sad ” that today ’s Keynesians would dare to use arguments that Cochrane had deployed against yesterday ’s Keynesians .
A bit like the US government saying other countries should n’t have nuclear weapons , because after all some evil regime might use them against civilians one day . )
After lamenting the sad day when someone would dare to criticize Nobel laureates ( is n’t Krugman a Nobel laureate ? ) ,
Cochrane then says :
And that ’s the biggest and saddest news of this piece : Paul Krugman has no interesting ideas whatsoever about what caused our current financial and economic problems , what policies might have prevented it , or what might help us in the future , and he has no contact with people who do .
“ Irrationality ” and “ spend like a drunken sailor ” are pretty superficial compared to all the fascinating things economists are writing about it these days .
What is Cochrane talking about ?
Krugman has written boatloads on what could have prevented the current financial crisis .
For example , Krugman has pointed to various types of ( what he labels ) “ deregulation . ”
And as for the “ drunken sailor ” wisecrack , Krugman has put up formal models showing his views on aggregate demand and so forth .
Do n’t get me wrong –I think Krugman is completely wrong ( bordering on “ insane ” if that word is to have any meaning in reference to academics ) in his views .
But Cochrane ’s rude dismissal of Krugman is just as much a lie as anything Krugman said about Cochrane .
So again , for those Austrians who ca n’t stand what a dishonest thug Krugman is , you ca n’t very well think Cochrane did a great job taking him down .
Unless it ’s OK to lie for free markets ( or in Cochrane ’s case , significantly - less - socialized markets ) .
But the next paragraph is what really made me lose it :
It ’s fun to say we did n’t see the crisis coming , but the central empirical prediction of the efficient markets hypothesis is precisely that nobody can tell where markets are going – neither benevolent government bureaucrats , nor crafty hedge - fund managers , nor ivory - tower academics .
This is probably the best - tested proposition in all the social sciences .
Krugman knows this , so all he can do is huff and puff about his dislike for a theory whose central prediction is that nobody can be a reliable soothsayer .
How in the world can the proponents of the EMH continue to justify their belief in the EMH … by appeal to the EMH ?!!
I occasionally stop the radio channel seek on Christian stations , and it ’s hilarious during the short spots when they say things like , “ A lot of people wonder how we can trust the Bible .
But they need to read First Corinthians 5 where Paul writes … ” ( I am a Christian , by the way . )
There were plenty of economists ( especially the Austrians–see e.g. Mark Thornton back in 2004 ) who “ called ” the housing boom .
I do n’t know what exactly the EMH theorists make of this .
Yes , you could argue that at any given time , you will have no shortage of economists ( all of whom are ignorant of the EMH and the limits of their knowledge ) shouting out all kinds of predictions , and then simple statistics show that some of them will be “ proven right . ”
But on the other hand , what more could opponents of the EMH do than to point to the recent housing bubble ?!
When Cochrane says the EMH is the “ best tested proposition in the social sciences , ” it is only because it is a tautology .
Really , think about it :
Do we need to go test the proposition that “ if someone is making a bunch of money doing an activity , then other people will copy him and whittle away his returns , unless there is some reason that they do n’t ” ?
( I ’m exaggerating slightly , but when you read the actual empirical defenses of the EMH against its typical objections , you realize that it is a way of viewing the world .
It is not a conclusion derived from the facts ; it is a way of organizing the facts . )
Krugman writes as if the volatility of stock prices alone disproves market efficiency , and efficient marketers just ignored it all these years .
This is a canard that Paul knows better than to pass on , no matter how rhetorically convenient … .
Data from the great depression has been included in practically all the tests .
In fact , the great “ equity premium puzzle ” is that if efficient , stock markets do n’t seem risky enough to deter more people from investing !
Gene Fama ’s PhD thesis was on “ fat tails ” in stock returns .
I am a bit out of my league here , but I still suspect that Cochrane is once again defining away his opponents .
Again I ask :
What would the world look like if the EMH were false ?
Would n’t there be giant bubbles , during which many participants knew ( or were quite sure ) there was a bubble in progress–and invested and profited accordingly ?
( Of course that happened ; do n’t let Cochrane fool you into thinking otherwise with his “ best tested proposition in the social sciences ” bluff . )
As far as the equity premium puzzle , proponents of Mandelbrot ’s “ non-Gaussian ” approach to financial markets say that it is the standard neoclassical use of a Gaussian distribution ( calibrated with historical stock returns , yes including the Great Depression ) that makes investors appear far too risk averse than we think they really are .
What is happening is that the actual stock market is far more volatile than the calibrated models suggest .
The housing bubble that just burst–as well as the 1987 crash–should have been “ once - in - a - thousand - year events , ” according to the standard models that Krugman is attacking .
( Of course I am making up that number .
But the basic point is right . )
That ’s one of the main themes in Nassim Taleb ’s work , that the value - at - risk and other risk measures used by Wall Street quants gave a false sense of security .
I ’m not accusing Cochrane of being ignorant of this fact , but at best he is throwing out a non sequitur to evade the very real problem that Krugman pointed out .
Oh wait , it turns out Cochrane is n’t so sure about the usefulness of the EMH after all :
It is true and very well documented that asset prices move more than reasonable expectations of future cashflows .
This might be because people are prey to bursts of irrational optimism and pessimism .
It might also be because people ’s willingness to take on risk varies over time , and is sharply lower in bad economic times .
As Gene Fama pointed out in 1972 , these are observationally equivalent explanations at the superficial level of staring at prices and writing magazine articles and opeds .
Unless you are willing to elaborate your theory to the point that it can quantitatively describe how much and when risk premiums , or waves of “ optimism ” and “ pessimism , ” can vary , you know nothing .
No theory is particularly good at that right now .
Crying “ bubble ” is no good unless you have an operational procedure for identifying bubbles , distinguishing them from rationally low risk premiums , and not crying wolf too many years in a row .
There you have it , folks .
After telling us that Krugman is attacking the best tested proposition in the social sciences , Cochrane falls back on , “ Yeah we do n’t know anything , but neither do you .
Until you can predict when a bubble will burst , stop complaining about my theory that predicts bubbles are impossible . ”
( Again I am slightly exaggerating to make the point–but not much . )
In economics , stimulus spending ran aground on Robert Barro ’s Ricardian equivalence theorem .
This theorem says that debt - financed spending can’t have any effect because people , seeing the higher future taxes that must pay off the debt , will simply save more .
They will buy the new government debt and leave all spending decisions unaltered .
Is this theorem true ?
It ’s a logical connection from a set of “ if ” to a set of “ therefore . ”
Not even Paul can object to the connection .
Nope .
Again I ’m a bit out of my league here , but I am pretty sure that Cochrane is completely full of it on this point .
Ricardian equivalence says that if the government finances a tax cut by running a higher deficit , while holding total government spending constant , that this wo n’t change aggregate consumption , GDP , private sector investment , or interest rates .
Rational taxpayers realize they will face higher tax bills in the future , and so they put aside the tax refund to roll over at interest and pay the bills .
Thus , what the government gives back with the left hand , it borrows out of the private sector with the right .
( Interest rates do n’t change because the extra saving by the private sector cancels out the extra borrowing by the government . )
Now there are all sorts of caveats in my argument above ; it matters if it ’s a lump - sum tax cut versus a reduction in marginal tax rates , it matters if the current generation of workers will die before the higher taxes hit , etc .
That ’s the tweaking of assumptions that Cochrane is referring to .
However , as Brad DeLong and Krugman have pointed out many times ( in justified exasperation ) on their blogs , Ricardian equivalence does not say that an increase in government deficit spending will be perfectly offset by the private sector .
Think about it :
The government decides to borrow and spend $ 100 billion more .
Now for Ricardian “ equivalence ” to kick in , it means that the private sector must reduce its current consumption by $ 100 billion and increase savings by that amount , at the same interest rate .
[ UPDATE : I am assuming that the extra $ 100 billion in government spending is classified as “ consumption ” and not “ investment . ” ]
In other words , faced with a higher future tax bill , the present generation decides to deal with it by slashing current consumption by $ 100 billion , while maintaining all future levels of consumption at their pre-announcement levels .
Well why the heck would they do that ?
It would make a lot more sense to assume that consumers originally try to cushion the blow by reducing consumption across all future time periods .
Then interest rates have to rise in the present in order to force consumers to make present consumption ( and private - sector investment ) channel an extra $ 100 billion into the government ’s coffers .
So you can see , there is nothing “ equivalent ” going on here at all .
Do n’t misunderstand –Krugman and DeLong are totally wrong in my opinion for thinking it ’s a good idea to boost “ aggregate demand ” ( measured in nominal terms ) by having the government borrow money and spend it .
But Cochrane is totally wrong for invoking Ricardian equivalence to show that , to a first approximation , such a maneuver would n’t boost aggregate demand in the present .
( This is what Krugman is complaining about in the 7th paragraph here . )
Uh oh , now the Austrian reader is n’t sure he can continue down this path with me .
Suuuure , I did n’t actually endorse deficit spending , but I suspiciously agreed with Krugman and DeLong when they claimed to defang one of the most popular Chicago School critiques of it ( namely , that private sector reactions perfectly offset it in a frictionless world ) .
Well maybe I can win you back with this final quotation from Cochrane :
Third , and most surprising , is Krugman ’s Luddite attack on mathematics ; “ economists as a group , mistook beauty , clad in impressive - looking mathematics , for truth . ”
Models are “ gussied up with fancy equations . ” …
Again , what is the alternative ?
Does Krugman really think we can make progress on his – and my – agenda for economic and financial research — understanding frictions , imperfect markets , complex human behavior , institutional rigidities – by reverting to a literary style of exposition , and abandoning the attempt to compare theories quantitatively against data ?
Against the worldwide tide of quantification in all fields of human endeavor ( read “ Moneyball ” ) is there any real hope that this will work in economics ?
No , the problem is that we do n’t have enough math .
Math in economics serves to keep the logic straight , to make sure that the “ then ” really does follow the “ if , ” which it so frequently does not if you just write prose .
The challenge is how hard it is to write down explicit artificial economies with these ingredients , actually solve them , in order to see what makes them tick .
Frictions are just bloody hard with the mathematical tools we have now .
I rest my case .
Paul Krugman is a jerk and offers horrible policy advice .
But John Cochrane ’s response is no friend - of - the - court brief in the Austrian critique of Keynesianism .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
When one identical twin develops the developmental disorder autism , the risk of the other developing it is high -- substantially higher than it is for fraternal twins , a new study confirms .
The study , which gathered information from 277 twin pairs in which at least one had an autistic disorder , found that when one identical twin developed an autistic disorder , the other one also did 88 percent of the time .
That compared with 31 percent among fraternal twins .
Unlike identical twins , fraternal twins are no more genetically similar than non -twin siblings .
What ’s more , researchers found , identical twins also had greater similarities in the form of autism that they developed , their level of day - to - day functioning and the risk of intellectual impairment .
The findings , reported in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , confirm the importance of genes in autism development .
Autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) include several developmental brain disorders that hinder a person ’s ability to communicate and interact socially .
ASDs range from the more - severe cases of “ classic ” autism to Asperger ’s syndrome -- where a person has normal intelligence and verbal skills , but difficulty socializing and understanding subtler forms of communication , like body language and vocal tone .
“ Autism research has been guided by one important observation for the past several decades - that autism has a large genetic component , ” Dr. Paul Law , of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore , told Reuters Health in an email .
“ That observation was made through twin studies . ”
This new study confirms those findings using a much larger sample of twins , according to Law .
The data come from an online registry called the Interactive Autism Network , which Kennedy Krieger set up two years ago to connect parents of children with autism with researchers .
Of the twin pairs in the current study , 67 were identical and 210 were fraternal .
Among identical twins , all females had been diagnosed with an ASD , whereas the “ concordance ” was 86 percent among males .
The pattern was different among fraternal twins .
Among pairs in which at least one was female , when one sibling developed an ASD , the other did 20 percent of the time .
That figure was 40 percent when both twins were male .
The findings also go beyond confirming concordance in identical twins ’ odds of developing an ASD , Law pointed out .
“ We show that important characteristics of ASD , such as the type of ASD , level of functioning and presence of other psychiatric disorders are more similar ... among identical twins , ” he said .
“ Thus not only are they more concordant overall , but the pattern of their disease is more concordant . ”
The researchers also found that among identical twins , the second sibling was unlikely to be diagnosed with an ASD once a year had passed since the first sibling ’s diagnosis .
“ Basically , ” Law said , “ our data suggests that parents of identical twins can stop worrying after about 12 months have passed since the diagnosis of their first twin . ”
In contrast , he said , fraternal twins still seem to have “ some degree of risk ” as much as four years after the first twin is diagnosed .
While experts generally agree that genetics plays a major role in autism spectrum disorders , they also believe that environmental factors conspire with genes to make certain children vulnerable .
Researchers are still trying to figure out what those environmental factors are .

An article in Skeletal Radiology , a well - respected journal , created something of a sensation in Europe last year .
It reported that researchers from Danube Hospital in Austria examined the knees of marathon runners using M.R.I. imaging , before and after the 1997 Vienna marathon .
Ten years later , they scanned the same runners ’ knees again .
The results were striking .
“ No major new internal damage in the knee joints of marathon runners was found after a 10 - year interval , ” the researchers reported .
Only one of the participants had a knee that was truly a mess , and he ’d quit running before the 1997 marathon ( but had been included in that study anyway ) .
His 1997 knee M.R.I. revealed cartilage lesions , swelling and other abnormalities .
In the years that followed , the knee became worse , showing augmented tissue damage and more serious lesions .
His exam prompted the researchers to wonder whether he would have been better off persisting as a runner , because , as they speculate , “ continuous exercise is protective , rather than destructive , ” to knees .

You ca n’t be a runner past the age of 40 , as I am , without hearing that running will ruin your knees , by which doomsayers usually mean that we ’ll develop “ degeneration of the cartilage in the kneecap , which ­reduces its shock - absorbing capacity , ” says Ross Tucker , a physiologist in South Africa and co-author of the new book “ The Runner ’s Body : How the Latest Exercise Science Can Help You Run Stronger , Longer and Faster . ”
In other words , we ’ll be afflicted with arthritis .
It ’s not an unreasonable supposition ; other sports have been linked with early - onset arthritis in knees .
In a British study , almost half of the middle - aged , formerly elite soccer players were found to have crippling , bone - on - bone arthritis in at least one knee .
Former weight lifters also have a high incidence of the condition , as do retired N.F.L. players .
But despite entrenched mythology to the contrary , runners do n’t seem prone to degenerating knees .
An important 2008 study , this one from Stanford University , followed middle - aged , longtime distance runners ( not necessarily marathoners ) for nearly 20 years , beginning in 1984 , when most were in their 50s or 60s .
At that time , 6.7 percent of the runners had creaky , mildly arthritic knees , while none of an age - matched control group did .
After 20 years , however , the runners ’ knees were healthier ; only 20 percent showed arthritic changes , versus 32 percent of the control group ’s knees .
Barely 2 percent of the runners ’ knees were severely arthritic , while almost 10 percent of the control group ’s were .
“ We were quite surprised , ” says Eliza Chakravarty , an assistant professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine and lead author of the study .
“ Our hypothesis going in had been that runners , because of the repetitive pounding , would develop more frequent and more severe arthritis . ”
Instead , recent evidence suggests that running may actually shield somewhat against arthritis , in part because the knee develops a kind of motion groove .
A group of engineers and doctors at Stanford published a study in the February issue of The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery that showed that by moving and loading your knee joint , as you do when walking or running , you “ condition ” your cartilage to the load .
It grows accustomed to those particular movements .
You can run for miles , decades , a lifetime , without harming it .
But if this exquisite balance is disturbed , usually by an injury , the loading mechanisms shift , the moving parts of the knee are no longer in their accustomed alignment and a “ degenerative pathway ” seems to open .
The cartilage , like an unbalanced tire , wears away .
Pain , tissue disintegration and , eventually , arthritis can follow .
So , the best way to ensure that your knees are n’t hurt by running is not to hurt them in the first place .
“ The biggest predictor of injury is previous injury , ” Tucker says , and one of the best deterrents against a first ( or subsequent ) knee injury is targeted strength training .
“ The hip stabilizers , quads , hamstrings and core must all be strong enough .
As soon as there is weakness , some other muscle or joint must take over , and that ’s when injuries happen . ”
If you ’ve injured your knee in the past , particularly if you ’ve ever torn an A.C.L. ( an injury that , in the Stanford gait study , was closely associated with misalignment and cartilage degeneration ) , talk to your physician before running .
But for most runners , the scientific observations of Chakravarty will ring true .
“ What struck me , ” she says , “ is that the runners we studied were still running , well into their 70s and 80s . ”
They were n’t running far , she says .
They were n’t running frequently .
They averaged perhaps 90 minutes a week .
“ But they were still running . ”
A 49 - year - old man suspected in the killings of at least eight women over 21 years in Milwaukee has been charged in connection with two of the homicides , authorities announced Monday .
Walter E. Ellis of Milwaukee faces two counts of first - degree intentional homicide in the killings of Joyce Mims , 41 , and Ouithreaun Stokes , 28 , who were strangled a decade apart .
Ellis was arrested around noon Saturday at a motel in Franklin , one day after authorities linked DNA from his toothbrush with samples found on Mims ' and Stokes ' bodies , according to a criminal complaint .
Ellis could be charged this week in connection with some of the other killings , Milwaukee County District Attorney John T. Chisholm said .
Until a news conference Monday , police had not said publicly that Ellis had been linked to the 1992 killing of Irene Smith , 25 , and the 1994 murder of Carron D. Kilpatrick , 32 , whose bodies were found within a block of each other .
Both women were strangled and stabbed , police spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz said .
Their murders were linked to Ellis ' DNA in the past two weeks , Milwaukee Police Chief Edward A. Flynn said .
Ellis ' DNA has been found on at least nine females killed between 1986 and 2007 , Flynn said .
Police officials have said they think someone else killed one of those victims , a white 16 - year - old runaway whose throat was slashed .
The other victims , all prostitutes and African - American , were strangled .
And at least two were also stabbed .
The killings occurred in an area roughly bounded by N. King Drive , N. 27th St. , W. North Ave. and W. Capitol Drive .
One victim was found in the Menomonee River , but authorities believe she was killed elsewhere .
In two of the homicides linked to Ellis , other men had been charged in the slayings .
Curtis McCoy was charged in October 1994 with killing Kilpatrick , his live - in girlfriend and the mother of his daughter , but he was later acquitted by a jury .
Chaunte
Ott was convicted of killing Jessica Payne , the 16 - year - old runaway .
Ott served 13 years in prison before he was released in January , after DNA analysis showed semen found on the girl 's body was not his .
Authorities announced the link to a suspected serial killer in May after tests revealed DNA from the same person had been left at six homicide scenes dating from 1986 to 2007 .
A task force of local , state and federal law enforcement officials dedicated to investigating the linked homicides received 193 tips in its first three months of operation , Flynn said last month .
Some suspects were interviewed and ruled out , he said .
Investigators had run the DNA profile found on the murdered women against DNA databases nationally but did not get any hits .
That meant the suspect was not in prison and had not provided law enforcement with a genetic sample in any state .
Since 2000 , Wisconsin has required all felons to provide DNA .
Investigators began to focus on Ellis after his name surfaced in connection with a number of unsolved homicides , Flynn said .
" Good police work and good police science have led us to Walter Ellis , " Flynn said Monday .
Ellis was not home when police executed a search warrant at his duplex apartment in the 2800 block of W. Bobolink Ave. on Aug. 29 , officials said Monday .
Police took Ellis ' toothbrush and razors , according to the complaint against him .
Tests conducted on the toothbrush at the State Crime Laboratory showed that the DNA found on Mims and Stokes belonged to Ellis , the complaint says .
A warrant for Ellis ' arrest was issued Friday , and Milwaukee police sent out an alert notifying other police agencies of the vehicle Ellis was believed to be driving , Flynn said .
On Saturday , Franklin Police Officer Jason Fincel spotted the vehicle at the Park Motel , 7273 S. 27th St. in Franklin , Flynn said .
A swarm of police officers descended on the motel .
Ellis , who was not armed , was arrested after a struggle , Flynn said .
A woman living in the downstairs apartment at Ellis ' duplex said she learned of his arrest over the weekend but was not certain of the reason until contacted by the Journal Sentinel .
" He did n't seem like that type of person , " said the woman , who did not want to be identified .
" It 's so scary now .
I could have been a victim .
I 'm shaking right now . "
She saw Ellis and a woman who lived with him nearly every day but did not know much about them , she said .
Ellis never caused a disturbance during the several months that he lived there , the woman said .
The block of W. Bobolink Ave. contains a mix of duplexes and single family residences .
Ellis was criminally charged 12 times between 1981 and 1998 for violent and property crimes , according to online court records .
Flynn noted that although all felons incarcerated in Wisconsin have had to submit DNA samples , Ellis was last convicted of a felony in 1998 , two years before the samples were required .
Ellis was sentenced to five years in prison for recklessly endangering safety , according to court records .
Further details of that case were not available .
Of the nine victims who have been linked to Ellis , none was killed between 1998 and 2006 .
Online records show Ellis was released from federal prison in 1992 .
Details about that case were not available .
Court records show that Ellis lived for a time near N. 6th and W. Chambers streets , within a few blocks of most of the killings .
Relatives of Mims said she lived a few blocks from Ellis and was dating Ellis ' uncle when she was killed .
" He just seemed like a regular guy , " Mims ' son , Purvis Mims , said of Ellis .
" It goes to show you never know what 's going on behind closed doors . "
Purvis Mims said he did not know Ellis well but had met him about six times before his mother was killed .
Joyce Mims " probably knew him much better than we did , " Purvis Mims said .
" I always thought that she did know the ( killer ) , because of the environment they found her in .
I know she would n't have gone in an abandoned house with a stranger , regardless of the circumstances .
She probably had a rapport of some fashion with him . "
Mims , 30 , said he was always optimistic that his mother 's killer would be found , especially after authorities announced the DNA link earlier this year .
" I was pretty confident because a person who does those types of things , they do n't stop , " he said .
" You do n't just never do it again or never have any police interaction . "
Joyce Mims ' sister , Tara Noble , said Ellis ' name did not sound familiar , but she said she was eager to view his photo to see if she recognized him .
Flynn on Monday requested that the media not make public Ellis ' photo because investigators were still showing it to possible witnesses .
" I 'm glad they got this man , because I just feel sorry for what my sister went through , " Noble said .
" We just think about how she was killed . . .
My sister was found beaten and strangled .
Those are words you do n't ever want to tell somebody . "
The massive investigation into the killings linked by Ellis ' DNA , which included retesting of DNA samples from dozens of unsolved murders , led to hits in at least 10 unrelated cases .
Suspects since have been charged in two of those cases .
David W. Lewis , 47 , was charged in June with first - degree reckless homicide in connection with the 1990 strangulation of 45 - year - old Vernell Jeter .
William W. Phillips , 37 , was charged this month with first - degree intentional homicide in connection with the 1990 death of 26 - year - old Rhonda Hartwright , who was killed by a shotgun blast to her face .
Prosecutors expect to file charges in a third cold case soon , Chisholm said last month .
Police have identified suspects in five other homicides that occurred in Milwaukee from 1983 to 1994 , Flynn said last month .
Four of those suspects are already incarcerated in connection with other crimes , he said .
Finally , investigators have developed DNA profiles of suspects in two other unsolved killings but have not been able to match the DNA with suspects , Chisholm said last month .

THE 'URBAN MYTH ' GAMBIT
Apologists ' spin ' Israel 's spy operation in the US
T here is growing evidence that , prior to 9/11 , a rather impressive Israeli spy network in the US went into overdrive and launched a concerted effort to penetrate US law enforcement and military facilities : a recent flurry of news stories on the subject provoked an angry reaction from Israel 's apologists , who are loudly and insistently denying it .
The denialists range from the Justice Department , whose spokesperson derided the widely - reported story as " an urban myth , " to Daniel Pipes , the chief ideologue of anti-Arabism in the US , whose op ed for the New York Post this morning [ March 11 ] is , er , rather odd .
DO YOU HAVE TO ASK ?
To begin with , the title asks a question the obvious answer to which contradicts the article 's thesis : " An Israeli spy network in the United States ? "
After Jonathan Pollard 's arrest and imprisonment , is this a question that even needs to be asked ?
Only the terminally naïve believe that our wonderful allies do n't spy on us  and , in the case of the Israelis , you can bet they 're doing a good job of it .
THE BITTER TEARS OF JONATHAN POLLARD
The official response of the Israeli consulate to the allegations 
" Israel does not spy on the United States of America "  must 've provoked gales of bitter laughter from the federal prison in Butner , N.C. , where Pollard is serving a life sentence , and yet Pipes expects us to believe just that .
His piece merely reiterates the allegations without refuting them  and without acknowledging the accumulating body of evidence .
A disparaging tone is enough , he apparently believes , to dispel the cloud of suspicion that has hung over Israel since the first stories about a massive round - up of Israelis in the US began to appear last year .
" American journalists , " Pipes avers , " found not a shred of evidence to support the claim .
More important , it met with wall - to - wall derision from the U.S. and Israeli governments . "
More important , that is , as far as Mr. Pipes is concerned .
After all , governments do n't lie , especially about intelligence matters  right ?
Discounted by Pipes as legitimate evidence is a four - part series broadcast by Fox News last December that cited law enforcement sources  albeit anonymous  testifying to the existence of " a vast Israeli spy operation in the US . "
Also discounted is Le Monde , France 's leading daily :
" Le Monde 's account - with its crazy - quilt of unsourced allegations , drive - by innuendoes , and incoherent obscurities , but no hard facts - is nonsense . "
JUST THE FACTS , PLEASE
Here are a few of the facts that Pipes cannot be bothered to mention : that the US government 's National Counterintelligence Center put out an alert in March 2001 warning of persistent attempts by individuals identifying themselves as " art students " from Israel to penetrate US government facilities ,
that as many as 200 were arrested in the months prior to and after 9/11 ,
that the majority of these were members of the Israeli army 's intelligence and counter - terrorism unit ,
that some failed polygraph tests when asked if they were engaged in surveillance activities against the US ,
and that fully one - third lived within shouting distance of Hollywood , Florida , the 9/11 hijackers ' base .
CHANGING THE SUBJECT
But none of the above will satisfy or even interest Pipes .
He does n't deign to address any of these issues , and instead spends a lot of space changing the subject .
He mentions Gary Sick 's " October surprise " allegations about Ronald Reagan , attacks CNN 's controversial " Valley of Death " documentary , and rattles on about authors Gordon Thomas and Victor Ostrovsky  none of which have anything to do with the charge that the Israelis , as Carl Cameron of Fox News put it , " may have gathered intelligence about the [ 9/11 ] attacks in advance , and not shared it . "
When it comes to the issue of Israeli undercover activities in the US , that country 's legions of professional apologists automatically go into their " deny , deny , deny " mode , and smear anyone who dares to ask a few questions .
MORE TRUTH COMES OUT
Certainly these people will be unimpressed by the latest revelations , detailed in an article written by Paul Rodriguez for Insight  a magazine published by the Washington Times , editorially a staunch supporter of Israel .
For the rest of us , however , Rodriguez 's effort to get at the truth , regardless of politics , provides yet another fascinating window into the underground world of Israeli covert action in America .
He provides us with a few more " hard facts "  hard enough so that Pipes and his compadres will soon have to come up with a better " spin " than the " urban myth " gambit .
LIVING FOR THEIR ART
Citing internal DEA documents and unnamed senior federal officials , Rodriguez basically confirms the thesis first pursued in this space [ 11/28/01 ] , and also ( a few weeks later ) by Carl Cameron : that , starting last year , organized teams of young Israelis who described themselves as " art students " descended on federal facilities , including military bases , ostensibly selling their paintings , and aggressively seeking access  not only to public buildings , but to the private homes of senior officials .
Rodriguez writes that the students " claimed to be from either the University of Jerusalem or the Bezalel Academy of Arts in Jerusalem . "
However , an Associated Press account which otherwise pooh - poohs the whole affair as " murky " at best , and sprinkles the story liberally with denials from Abe Foxman and several government officials , nonetheless informs us that :
" Several of those questioned by investigators said they were students from Bezalel Academy of Art and Design .
But Pnina Calpen , spokeswoman for the Israeli school , said no one named in the report was a student there in the last 10 years . "
BLOWING THE LID OFF
Although these earnest young artists were supposedly peddling their own art , " information has been received which indicates the art is actually produced in China , " Rodriguez says , citing the DEA 's summary of the investigation .
A shady bunch , for sure , but that does n't mean they 're spies , fer chrissake  except that Rodriguez and Insight have gotten their hands on a nice little cache of government documents that blows the lid off the whole operation :
" One report , Suspicious Activities Involving Israeli Art Students at DEA Facilities , lists more than 180 documented - incident cases .
Analysts tell Insight they appear to be attempts ' to circumvent the access - control systems at DEA offices ' and to capture personal information about private lives of DEA law - enforcement officers , such as where they live , what cars they drive and how they behave outside of their official offices .
This was concluded , in part , based on photographs made of U.S. law officers and other materials seized by a variety of federal and local law - enforcement officers during searches . "
DRAGNET
Searches  of what , and whom ?
On September 14 , New Jersey police moved in on Urban Moving Systems , and the residences of some of its employees , most of them Israelis .
The raid was made in connection with the arrest of three men , all Israelis , eight hours after the World Trade Center was hit : they had been spotted cheering and jumping up and down in Liberty State Park as smoke from the burning WTC obscured the horizon .
Witnesses reported them to the police , and identified their van with the logo of " Urban Moving Systems " : they were picked up on Route 3 , in East Rutherford , and detained .
In an apparent follow - up raid , a dozen plainclothes cops , accompanied by bomb - sniffing dogs , entered the Urban Moving Systems warehouse " and began snapping pictures " :
" A few hours later , agents emerged from the building with more than 12 computer hard drives and files , piling them into the rear of a black Chevy Suburban . "
NOW WE KNOW .
If this doesnt imply some sort of Israeli connection to 9/11 , then its hard to say what else would at least provoke suspicion .
Ah , but what about motive ?
After all , Israel is our loyal ally : surely they wouldnt withhold knowledge of a devastating terrorist attack from their prime benefactors  would they ?
The [ New Jersey ] Bergen Record [ 11/15/01 ] , in an account of the Weehawken raid , reports the following : " An employee of Urban Moving Systems , who would not give his name , said the majority of his co-workers are Israelis and were joking on the day of the attacks .
" I was in tears ,  the man said .
 These guys were joking and that bothered me .
These guys were like , ' Now America knows what we go through .  "
There s your motive .
FROM A LEAK TO A TORRENT
The feds had picked up 60 Israeli " art students " in the months prior to 9/11 : they rounded up 120 more before the dust had settled , searching residences and interrogating the detainees  and this information is what is now leaking out , in dribs and drabs .
Rodriguez , however , unleashes a veritable torrent :
" Besides federal law - enforcement incidents , DEA's I[ nternal ] S[ecurity ] unit found that several military bases also had experienced unauthorized entries by some of the students , including two bases from which Stealth aircraft and other supersecret military units operate .
Unauthorized photographing of military sites and civilian industrial complexes , such as petroleum - storage facilities , also was reported to the DEA , the documents show and interviews confirm .
AN UNUSUAL ART PROJECT
Now these are " art students " of a certain caliber , apparently involved in an " art project " that includes photographing supersecret military installations .
While Rodriguez is careful to say there is no evidence that this pattern of suspicious activity was " state - sponsored , " I would be willing to bet these are graduates of the Mossad School of Art ( summa cum laude ) .
Certainly they seemed to be very well - organized , and quite single - minded .
As Rodriguez puts it :
" In virtually every incident of the many reported by the entire DEA field - office structure the pattern was similar : Students would attempt to enter secure buildings , take photographs , follow federal agents when they left buildings , show up at their homes , take pictures of their cars and circle their neighborhoods , visiting only their houses and then departing . "
PUSHING THE PANIC BUTTON
Behind the bland denials , federal law enforcement officials are in a panic .
Rodriguez quotes one high - ranking official who exclaims " it is a very alarming set of documents .
This shows how serious DEA and Justice consider this activity . "
A Justice Department official tells Rodriguez :
" We think there is something quite sinister here but are unable at this time to put our finger on it . "
Another fed tells him :
" The higher - ups do n't want to deal with this and neither does the FBI because it involves Israel . "
They can't quite put their finger on it , so let me do it for them .
These were a bunch of artists , alright  practicing the art of spying .
If we put together the various aspects of this story as reported by Fox News , LeMonde , Intelligenceonline.com , and Insight , as well as what we can glean from local news sources , the picture that emerges gives us the vital context in which the horrific events of 9/11 occurred : in the midst of a secret war waged by Israel against the US , right here on our own soil .
DEBUNKERS WITHOUT A CLUE
The Bush administration , for reasons of its own , is trying to hush it up : perhaps because exposure would compromise their ongoing investigation of 9/11 , although I am bound to be taken to task by some of my readers for letting the Bushies off the hook so easily .
In any event , skeptics should note that the administration has recently  and not coincidentally  taken measures to exclude Israeli nationals from access to sensitive information ,  a big blow to those who say there is nothing to this story .
So now naysayers like Pipes are trying to impugn the story 's sources without bothering to dispute  or even refer to  the known facts .
The same day the Pipes piece came out saw the Wall Street Journal 's resident online " blogger , " James Taranto , weigh in with his own spin on " the weird story of those Israeli ' art students . ' "
As it turns out , there 's nothing to see here , so we should all just move along :
" The 61 - page DEA report suggests the Israelis ' wanderings ' may well be an organized intelligence - gathering activity . '
Yet it mostly chronicles people selling overpriced paintings door to door . "
Taranto quotes government officials denying all and cites a few items from the DEA report selectively leaked to the Associated Press , " most of which sound utterly harmless . "
We are then treated to a two sentence description of a Dallas sighting torn out of a 61 - page report :
" Five people were selling art out of a van behind a small office complex that was closed for the holidays .
A Euless , Texas , police officer found 40 to 50 pieces of art .
' Neither the frames nor the artwork appeared to be high quality , per the officer . ' "
It seems Taranto and Rodriguez are reading from two very different DEA reports , but the former 's dishonesty is painfully apparent as we follow the link he provides .
For even in this sanitized version of what the internal security task force discovered , we get the following item from St. Louis :
" Suspected Palestinian or Middle Eastern art sellers were thought to be ' diagramming ' the inside of a DEA building .
Also , an agent said two people came to his house trying to sell art .
' What was unusual is that he watched them and they did not visit any other houses in the area , ' the security alert said . "
FACTS ARE STUBBORN THINGS
More than a dozen Israeli " students " were rounded up in Kansas and Missouri in the wake of 9/11 , and more than 50 throughout the Midwest .
In one Texas government building , they caught one of these phony " art students " wandering the halls with a floor plan of the building in hand .
WHAT , ME WORRY ?
Oh , but we need n't worry about any of that , because everybody knows our good friend Israel would never spy on us or conduct covert operations of any sort on our territory .
No need to bother Taranto with the facts , because he has all the information he needs , to wit :
" The best evidence that there 's nothing to this spy story , though , is that Justin Raimondo , who runs the crackpot Antiwar.com
Web site , has seized upon it as proof of ' Israel 's 9/11 connection . ' "
HIGH SCHOOL HIJINKS
Gee , I was under the impression  mistaken , as it turns out  that the old grey WSJ was a newspaper for adults .
Yet Taranto's lame idea of wit is strictly of the " Nyaah ! Nyaah ! " variety .
Besides that , a good two - thirds of his copy consists of quotes , and for this they pay him  proof positive that the recession never really hit Wall Street .
A SAD DECLINE
It 's absurd , really , that the WSJ 's " Best of the Web " online column has been turned over to some kid who intersperses spasms of adolescent name - calling with items largely gleaned from his " warblogger " friends and plugs for Jonah Goldberg 's column .
But , then again , perhaps this sad literary decline is not all that surprising .
War propaganda always has a certain crudeness about it , a quality exemplified by Taranto 's pedestrian prose and perfectly suited to the WSJ 's editorial stance .
To the War Street Journal , as Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr. , of the Ludwig von Mises Institute aptly dubbed it , being antiwar is " crackpot " by definition  whereas it is perfectly normal for WSJ editorial features editor Max Boot to write a piece bemoaning the lack of casualties in the Afghan war : " This is not a war being won with blood and guts , " he complained , perhaps a bit prematurely .
The idea that this growing scandal is going to go away , that cold hard facts can be dispersed or ignored with childish taunts and half - baked smears , is naïve in the extreme : this story is too big , and too solid , to be airily dismissed by the would - be gate - keepers of journalistic correctness .
In taking the media to task for discussing it even to a limited extent , Pipes calls down an imprecation on their heads :
" Shame , then , on those media outlets that contributed to this dangerous falsehood . "
THE REAL SHAME
What gall !
The real shame is that the story of Israel 's spy nest in the US wentunreported for so long  and that it was first taken up , not in the " mainstream " media , but by a alternative news source such as Antiwar.com .
It is telling that the networks wo n't touch this one with a ten - foot pole , but Fox , the brash young kid on the block , dared to break the embargo .
The news , no longer centrally - planned and directed by a few self - appointed " gate - keepers , " has been liberated , not only by the internet , but by the mindset that accompanies this technological breakthrough : one that challenges the conventional wisdom instead of enforcing it .
The truth will come out , not after fifty years of government cover - up , but in a matter of months , if not weeks .
And when it does  watch out .
For then the whole context of this rotten war  which is fast escalating into a horribly dangerous world war  will be seen in its entirety .
OUR EX - FRIENDS , THE ISRAELIS
Lifelong AA member David Barker , 58 , of Low Edges , Sheffield , died as he drove to a football match on 28 December .
When relatives went to move his car they found the battery was flat and called the AA , but were told they would have to take out a new policy .
The AA admitted it failed to show " the compassion and sensitivity " expected .
Mr Barker 's brother - in - law , Leonard Douglas , said when he called the AA he was told he would have to renew Mr Barker 's policy at a higher premium .
The AA was wrong to refuse service and did not show the compassion and sensitivity we expect in what was clearly an emotional situation
AA Road Operations Director , Steve Dewey
" We were in a situation where my brother - in - law had just died , " he said .
" They wanted to up his premium and I said why do you want to up his premium , he 's dead .
" We were devastated , he 'd always been in the AA .
I really do n't think it was right for them to treat us that way . "
AA Road Operations Director Steve Dewey said : " Our procedures allow for discretion to be used in sensitive situations such as this .
" Unfortunately , when dealing with thousands of calls each day human error occasionally happens , for which we apologise .
We have addressed this matter with the member of staff concerned .
" We apologise unreservedly for the distress caused to Mr Barker 's family at what was already an extremely difficult time .
" The AA was wrong to refuse service and did not show the compassion and sensitivity we expect in what was clearly an emotional situation . "
He said the AA had contacted the family and apologised for the mistake and the distress it had caused .
