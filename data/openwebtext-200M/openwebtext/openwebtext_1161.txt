Jack Herer , a nationally known activist for the return of hemp and the legalization of marijuana , remained in critical but stable condition at Legacy Emanual Medical Center after a Sept. 12 heart attack at Portland 's pro-pot Hempstalk festival .
The 70 - year - old author and lecturer collapsed on stage after delivering a speech to the festival at Kelley Point Park .
Herer is the author of the book " The Emperor Wears No Clothes , " a history of marijuana and hemp prohibition in the United States .
Herer fell into a coma shortly after he was stricken and has not awakened from it .
He is in an Emanual intensive care unit .
Herer 's family said anyone wishing to contribute to Herer 's medical costs can go to any USBank and make a donation in the name of Jack Herer .

TINY they may be , but carbon nanotubes have found a remarkable range of uses , from stretchy loudspeakers to artificial photosynthesis .
Now use as a fertiliser can be added to the list .
Plant biologist Mariya Khodakovskaya and nanotechnologist Alexandru Biris , both at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock , planted tomato seeds in a growth medium that contained carbon nanotubes .
They found that the seeds germinated sooner and seedlings grew faster than those in a non-treated medium ( ACS Nano , DOI : 10.1021/nn900887 m ) .
Nanostructures have been reported to boost germination before , but no explanation for the phenomenon has been offered until now . …

The proposed Xiaonanhai Dam would stand athwart the mighty Yangtze River some 30 kilometers upstream of the industrial metropolis of Chongqing .
The dam represents the single largest project in that municipality 's 11th five - year plan , costing roughly $ 3.5 billion .
The growing city hopes to harvest 1.7 gigawatts of electricity from the river current of the Chang Jiang , as the Chinese call the third longest river on Earth .
The dam is just one of 19 proposed dams on the upper reaches of the Yangtze , upstream from the massive Three Gorges project near Yichang — and one of nearly 200 proposed dams on the Yangtze and its tributaries .
China is building hydropower at a record pace that has resulted in more dams — 26,000 — than in any other country .
In the last decade more than 60 percent of all hydropower projects worldwide were in China and Three Gorges alone will avoid the emission of an estimated 95 million metric tons of carbon dioxide a year — more than the combined output of Norway and Sweden .
" Within 30 to 50 years , hydropower will be the main energy we should rely on , " Lai Hun Suen , a professor of sustainable development at Chongqing University and municipal government official , explained to me during a visit to the city in 2008 .
" It is a choice we made when we had no other choice . "
That choice has consequences :
At least 1.2 million people moved to Chongqing , displaced by the rising waters behind Three Gorges .
Decomposing submerged vegetation burps methane — a greenhouse gas which traps 25 times as much heat as CO2 over a century .
And a planned dam , Xiaonanhai , that would be built in the middle of the last remaining untouched habitat of the Yangtze sturgeon , giant salamander and 66 other fish species of concern , says Yan Xie , China Program director for the Wildlife Conservation Society .
In fact , the proposed dam borders the " core protected area " of the Upper Yangtze Native and Rare Fish Reserve — an area set aside to mitigate some of the impacts of the construction of Three Gorges Dam .
" There are 338 kinds of freshwater fish in the Yangtze River and 162 of them are endemic to the river — that is , found nowhere else , " says ecologist David Dudgeon of the University of Hong Kong .
" It seems obvious that many or all of them could be impacted by a dam in the middle of the reserve . "
The question is : Can hydropower in China be done more sustainably ?
A drop in the bucket
Xiaonanhai would generate 1,760 megawatts of electricity — three quarters the yield of the U.S. 's Hoover Dam , but just eight percent of Three Gorges potential 22 gigawatts , and three percent of the 60 gigawatts from the proposed dams planned along the upper Yangtze , also known as the Jinsha River .
That 's why The Nature Conservancy is working on a plan that would invest Chongqing 's dam - building money into making the other dams upstream slightly bigger .
" They could own as much as three times the kilowatts as they could ever get out of the little dam and keep all the fish , " says lawyer David Harrison , a senior advisor to the Conservancy 's Global Freshwater Program .
" Chongqing could get the economic development they want , and a fish reserve .
They may not appreciate it now but they will , as will their children . "
Already , the Chinese paddlefish , a six - meter - long endemic species , has not been spotted in more than three years in the region and may now be functionally extinct , much like the baiji — a freshwater dolphin — downriver .
" Four famous domestic fishes " — the grass , silver , black and big carps — provide protein and a livelihood to more than 10 million Chinese , yet they are dwindling in the stretch of river beneath the Three Gorges Dam , victims of the dam 's development and overfishing , says Daqing Chen of the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute .
The solution , according to the Conservancy , is to plan hydropower development on a watershed level rather than allowing the proliferation of projects from various levels of government : county , township , city , provincial and even national .
" There 's wildcat dam development going on .
At some level , it 's out of control , " says Brian Richter , director of the environmental group 's Global Freshwater Program , adding that the proliferation of dams of all sizes are " just getting built in an uncoordinated fashion . "
As a result , a coalition of Chinese scientists and environmentalists signed a petition this May calling for a halt to " overdevelopment " of hydropower in the Yangtze River Basin .
The central government 's Ministry of Environmental Protection responded in June , suspending the Xiaonanhai project pending further review — along with two other nearby dams in the Jinsha River already under construction .
The problem is not dams per se .
It is the lack of planning .
After all , building hydropower will also enable the proliferation of intermittent renewable energy sources , such as wind and solar .
" Xiluodu [ Dam ] could be used to stabilize against wind and solar to a very large degree because of its size and because it's got another reservoir downstream that can dampen out any fluctuations , " Harrison notes .
" How many kilowatts of other renewables can you enable if you develop smartly ?
Building small dams in small places does n't help you with that . "
Flood control
Of course , there is also the specter of floods .
Inundations in 1931 and 1954 killed hundreds of thousands along the lower Yangtze and a similar flood in 1998 displaced at least 1.8 million people .
Therefore , one of the primary reasons to build Three Gorges Dam , in addition to hydropower and improved shipping channels , was to restrain the periodic , devastating flooding of the Yangtze .
But a river basin regime that also restores some of the natural floodplains — without displacing the rich rice paddies and vegetable fields that provide 60 percent of the country 's food supply — could also generate more power .
After all , preparing for floods means lowering water levels in the reservoir to allow for extra water , resulting in reduced hydropower output .
Allowing the Three Gorges reservoir to remain at a higher water level , for example , by opening some flood storage downstream could " generate $ 1 billion more in hydropower revenue , " Richter argues .
The key would be to inundate several hundred thousand hectares of the agricultural lands periodically during times of flood to provide as much as 15 billion cubic meters of floodwater storage — three - quarters of the 20 billion cubic meters of flood control offered by the Three Gorges reservoir itself .
But it would also involve temporarily relocating the inhabitants of these lands through early warning and compensating them for lost harvest — something China already does , such as during the 1998 flood .
And some of the $ 1 billion in extra hydropower revenues could go into a proposed compensation fund for such displacement and lost crops , Richter argues , a plan for which Goldman Sachs is preparing a feasibility study .
" Using floodplains to store floods is more reliable , safer and more economical , " Richter says .
Such a plan would also more closely mimic the natural flow of the river , which is naturally high during spring and summer and low in winter , the opposite of the flow pattern imposed by dams such as Three Gorges that attempt to reserve room for floodwaters .
" Fish reproduction in the Yangtze and other rivers depends on the maintenance of natural flow patterns , because it is these that set the cues for breeding and stimulate breeding migrations , " Hong Kong 's Dudgeon notes .
Such river basin regimes could prove vital in other areas of the world undergoing a hydropower boom , as well , Richter says .
In Central America there are more than 300 dams of varying sizes planned or under construction .
" What we 're seeing is a very rapid proliferation of hydropower development in these countries , " he says .
" It 's a race to build dams and get them hooked up as quickly as possible , because the first in line are the first to be rewarded in terms of revenue . "
And it might help ameliorate or avoid some of the other impacts from dam construction now coming to the surface .
" More than 100 miles of [ Three Gorges ] reservoir banks are at risk of collapsing .
More than 50 percent of the reservoir area is affected by erosion and an additional 500,000 people will need to be relocated , " says Peter Bosshard , policy director at International Rivers , a dam watchdog group .
Further downstream there is also erosion in the Yangtze 's delta as well as seawater intrusion .
" Shanghai is subsiding .
All these factors need to be taken into account . "
Despite these concerns , dam construction continues .
Coffer dams — a temporary barrier that allows work on a permanent dam to proceed — are already in place for many projects , such as the Ahai Dam on the Jinsha River , closing off yet more sections of the waterway .
" It 's not just dams versus no dams , " Harrison adds .
" It 's about elegant dams — and if we can't do that , we should n't build them .
The proliferation of small - and middle - size ones is chewing up the whole place . "
A woman looks familiar , but you can't remember her name or where you met her .
New research by UC Irvine neuroscientists suggests the memory exists – you simply can't retrieve it .
Using advanced brain imaging techniques , the scientists discovered that a person 's brain activity while remembering an event is very similar to when it was first experienced , even if specifics can't be recalled .
" If the details are still there , hopefully we can find a way to access them , " said Jeff Johnson , postdoctoral researcher at UCI 's Center for the Neurobiology of Learning & Memory and lead author of the study , appearing Sept. 10 in the journal Neuron .
" By understanding how this works in young , healthy adults , we can potentially gain insight into situations where our memories fail more noticeably , such as when we get older , " he said .
" It also might shed light on the fate of vivid memories of traumatic events that we may want to forget . "
In collaboration with scientists at Princeton University , Johnson and colleague Michael Rugg , CNLM director , used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the brain activity of students .
Inside an fMRI scanner , the students were shown words and asked to perform various tasks : imagine how an artist would draw the object named by the word , think about how the object is used , or pronounce the word backward in their minds .
The scanner captured images of their brain activity during these exercises .
About 20 minutes later , the students viewed the words a second time and were asked to remember any details linked to them .
Again , brain activity was recorded .
Utilizing a mathematical method called pattern analysis , the scientists associated the different tasks with distinct patterns of brain activity .
When a student had a strong recollection of a word from a particular task , the pattern was very similar to the one generated during the task .
When recollection was weak or nonexistent , the pattern was not as prominent but still recognizable as belonging to that particular task .
" The pattern analyzer could accurately identify tasks based on the patterns generated , regardless of whether the subject remembered specific details , " Johnson said .
" This tells us the brain knew something about what had occurred , even though the subject was not aware of the information . "
In addition to Johnson and Rugg , Susan McDuff and Kenneth Norman of Princeton worked on the study , funded by the National Institutes of Health .
We love Ubuntu and we are Ubuntu users a long time ago but the next version Ubuntu 9.10 seems to focus on wallpapers and themes .
We do n’t like Ubuntu ’s way of development because it is just focusing on themes and ignoring important projects like PulseAudio and X.org .
In this article we will talk a little about the new features that will be in Mandriva 2010 .
The final version is expected to be available on the 3rd of November .
Mandriva Linux 2010 is aimed at improving the user experience for daily tasks .
let ’s have a look to what ’s new :
1- New design for installer
To better user experience of installation , the Mandriva developers thought that installer design is quite old now and need to be refreshed to stay ahead of competition .
The next screenshot shows the new design .
2- Live upgrade
Finally , Mandriva
Online will be able to notify user about the new version of the distribution and propose the system to upgrade it without using installer .
3- Moblin desktop
Mandriva 2010 will include the Moblin 2.0 environment designed for mobile desktop platforms , making Mandriva Linux the first distribution to integrate it in a free distribution .
This environment has been designed for mobile desktop platforms .
Netbooks are a given target but you can also use it when you want an ergonomic and simple environment for daily tasks .
Installing it is easy : install task - moblin package in rpmdrake and choose Moblin in connection manager .
4- Guest accounts
Guest accounts , based on the xguest package , can now be established to offer safe temporary access to the system via gdm or kdm .
5- 3G features request
The next version will have better hardware support for USB 3G keys like download ( and upload ) quotas , PIN / PUK code management , operator selection .
6- Improve wireless support
As Mandriva 2010 is based on Linux 2.6.31 , it will get the benefits of improving wireless support like enhancements for RTL 8187 wireless driver , include support for for RTL 8187 SE wireless driver and adopt Mesh utilities and test support for ralink , atheros and others .
7- Easier wifi key setup
This feature will allow to double check WEP / WPA keys .
From Technical specifications for Mandriva Linux 2010 : “ Typing wifi ( wep / wpa ) keys can be difficult , when entryfield are in password mode .
Mac OS
X allows to display keys ( with a checkbox ) so , you can be sure you did n’t make any typo , but can keep the key safe from other eyes around by default .
To improve WEP keys filling , OK / Next button should be disabled when key length is not valid and warn if it is too long ( this one is also valid for WPA ) . “
8- Improve boot time
Mandriva 2010 has improved both real boot time and way to give user faster boot time impression .
9- Improve rpmdrake start up speed
Rpmdrake ( packages manager ) was quite slow , due to rpm databases parsing .
In Mandriva 2010 , rpmdrake will start more quickly by caching some data .
10 - Urpmi media auto configuration in version Free
This feature will allow installer to auto configure installation media to make user life easier just like in One version .
11 - Improve user information in rpmdrake
The Developers worked hard to improve user information in rpmdrake by moving general messages from bottom of rpmdrake and finding proper way to provide it .
They also added support for screenshots .
12 - Drakguard improvements
Drakguard will have the following features :
– Prevent launching specific applications
– block / allow network connection based on system time
13 - krandr improvements
Krandr ( Desktop resolution dynamic changer ) will be more integrated into KDE4 .
14 - OpenOffice .
Org 3.1 & KDE 4 integration
Mandriva 2010 will include OpenOffice.org 3.1 ( based on the Go - OO branch ) and that means more features like SVG support , 3D transitions , VBA support , KDE 4 integration and Includes useful Extensions .
15 - Switch to gcc 4.4
As all major distributions have switched ( or are switching ) gcc 4.4 because it allows better performance for generated code , faster compile time ( specially on C++ ) and fixes some compilations bugs .
Mandriva 2010 has switched to gcc 4.4 .
16 - Boost diskdrake
Diskdrake is ported to libparted to save time , money and add support for GPT partitions .
The story behind that the venerable master boot record ( MBR ) partitioning scheme can’t fully handle disks larger than 2TB .
With 1TB - hard disks now common and 2TB - disks becoming available , forward - looking individuals are thinking about alternatives to the MBR partitioning scheme .
The heir apparent is the GUID Partition Table ( GPT ) .
Another feature in Diskdrake is helping user in partitioning his disks
When user reaches partition step , he frequently do not even recall what is exactly on each of these
existing partitions .
The new Installer will allow him to browse at least content for root of each partition .
This feature will increase simplicity of general use of Mandriva 2010 .
17 - GNOME 2.28
Mandriva 2010 will have GNOME 2.28 .
It contains the latest version of GTK + with client - side window .
This feature should reduce window flickering .
You will find in repository , GNote , a C++ port of Tomboy .
Alpha versions of Mutter , Zeitgeist are also available .
These will be the basis of the future version GNOME 3.0 .
A notable planned change will be improvements in GNOME Media with : Webcam support and Live streaming recording in sound - recorder or podcaster .
18 - KDE 4.3.2
For KDE lovers Mandriva comes with KDE 4.3.2 .
This is the best version of KDE4 .
Lots of bug fixes and improvements that make us think we have now a really innovative and stable desktop .
19 - Nepomuk : integration is improved
Mandriva 2010 comes with good Nepomuk integration .
The target of the Nepomuk project is to provide the user with facilities to create , manage , query , and thus , exploit this metadata in powerful ways .
This is a powerful tool and Mandriva developers introduce many features in Mandriva 2010 like :
– Files can be tagged and rated from Dolphin : this lets you get a transversal semantic view of your files , in addition to the classical folder view .
– Resources can be searched by tag , by hitting Ctrl+L in Dolphin and by typing the keyword nepomuksearch : / followed by one or several entries tag : xxx in the Dolphin address bar .
– Mandriva 2010 includes a plasmoid widget called Task switcher which makes it easy to create tasks and to select a current task meant to ease the linking of resources to a specific active task .
The task switcher lets you see all your active tasks and choose one of them as the current task .
To get more information have a look here to check how to use this innovative and powerful new functionalities for desktop .
20 - Plymouth boot splash
The Plymouth boot splash technology , which provides a graphical boot animation during the boot process , is now fully integrated , and replaces Splashy , which has been removed .
Right now , it appears that the biggest barrier to health care reform is people who think that it will hurt them .
According to a New York Times poll , “ 69 percent of respondents in the poll said they were concerned that the quality of their own care would decline if the government created a program that covers everyone . ”
Since most Americans currently have health insurance , they see reform as a poverty program – something that helps poor people and hurts them .
If that ’s what you think , then this post is for you .
You do not have health insurance .
Let me repeat that .
You do not have health insurance .
( Unless you are over 65 , in which case you do have health insurance .
I ’ll come back to that later . )
The point of insurance is to protect you against unlikely but damaging events .
You are generally happy to pay premiums in all the years that nothing goes wrong ( your house does n’t burn down ) , because in exchange your insurer promises to be there in the one year that things do go wrong ( your house burns down ) .
That ’s why , when shopping for insurance , you are supposed to look for a company that is financially sound – so they will be there when you need them .
If , like most people , your health coverage is through your employer or your spouse ’s employer , that is not what you have .
At some point in the future , you will get sick and need expensive health care .
What are some of the things that could happen between now and then ?
Your company could drop its health plan .
According to the U.S. Census Bureau ( see Table HIA - 1 ) , the percentage of the population covered by employer - based health insurance has fallen every year since 2000 , from 64.2 % to 59.3 % .*
You could lose your job .
I do n’t think I need to tell anyone what the unemployment rate is these days .**
You could voluntarily leave your job , for example because you have to move to take care of an elderly relative .
You could get divorced from the spouse you depend on for health coverage .
For all of these reasons , you ca n’t count on your health insurer being there when you need it .
That ’s not insurance ; that ’s employer - subsidized health care for the duration of your employment .
Once you lose your employer - based coverage , for whatever reason , you ’re in the individual market , where , you may be surprised to find , you have no right to affordable health insurance .
An insurer can refuse to insure you or can charge you a premium you ca n’t afford because of your medical history .
That ’s the way a free market works : an insurer would be crazy to charge you less than the expected cost of your medical care ( unless they can make it up on their healthy customers , which they ca n’t in the individual market ) .
In honor of the financial crisis , let ’s also point out that all of these risks are correlated : being sick increases your chances of losing your job ( and , probably , getting divorced ) ; losing your job reduces your ability to afford health insurance , either through COBRA or in the individual market ; if your employer drops its health plan , that ’s either because health care is getting more expensive ( meaning harder for you to afford individually ) or the economy is in bad shape ( making it harder for you to get a job that does offer health coverage ) .
In addition , there is the problem that even if you are nominally covered when you do get sick , your insurer could rescind your policy , or you may find out , as Karen Tumulty ’s brother did , that your insurance does n’t cover the treatment you need .
But while important , this is a second - order problem .
The first - order problem is that as long as your health insurance depends on your job , your health is only insured insofar as your job is insured – and your job is n’t insured .
The basic solution is very simple .
In Paul Krugman ’s words : “ regulation of insurers , so that they ca n’t cherry - pick only the healthy , and subsidies , so that all Americans can afford insurance . ”
I know that there are lots of details that consume people who know health care better than I do , and I know those details are important .
But as an individual who is worried about his or her own health insurance ( and that is the point of this post ) , that ’s what you want .
You want to know that if you lose your job , you wo n’t be shut out because you ’re too sick , *** and you wo n’t be shut out because you ’re too poor .
But we wo n’t get there as long as people remain convinced that health care reform is for poor people .
It ’s for everyone – everyone , that is , who is n’t independently wealthy or over the age of 65 .
Because all of us could lose our jobs .
( Have I repeated that point enough ? )
Now , I admit that if you are over 65 , health care reform is not for you , because you are in the one group in our society that enjoys true health insurance – insurance that you cannot lose , that is paid for by taxes , and that is effectively guaranteed by the government .
So maybe there ’s nothing in it for you , except perhaps an improvement to the prescription drug component of Medicare .
But I cannot believe that , as the only people who have reliable health insurance , you would oppose health care reform that would provide reliable insurance for the rest of us .
* This does n’t necessarily mean that all those people lost employer - based health coverage because their employers dropped their plans ; some of it could be that the employee contributions were increased to the point where they could n’t afford it anymore .
1.1 percentage points of the shift is due to people becoming eligible for Medicare or military health plans .
** If you lose your job , or you get divorced from a spouse through whom you get health coverage , you are eligible for continued coverage under COBRA .
However : ( a ) this only necessarily applies if your employer has 20 or more employees ; ( b ) you have to pay the full , unsubsidized cost of your health plan , which can be particularly difficult after losing your job ; and ( c ) it only lasts for eighteen months .
*** I said earlier that insurers can’t charge premiums that are less than the expected cost of your care unless they can make it up on the healthy customers , and they ca n’t in the individual market .
But if all insurers are prohibited from doing medical underwriting ( pricing based on healthiness ) , then they will all have to overcharge the healthy customers , and the system could work .
This is still a tricky issue – and single - payer ( like Medicare ) would be much simpler – but it can be made to work even in a competitive market .
Update : A couple of small things .
and one big thing :
First , I called rescission a “ second - order ” problem , which was probably surprising , given that my post on it got over 100,000 page views ( thanks to the Huffington Post ) .
I meant “ second - order ” not to mean that it is n’t important , but that it is logically subsequent to the question of whether you have health insurance in the first place , and this post is about whether you can count on having health insurance in the first place .
Second , J.D. points out in the comments that there is a problem with COBRA I did n’t mention :
If you relocate to an area where your employer does n’t have a plan , then you ca n’t count on it at all .
Third , a few people said that it was the fault of the administration ( or the Democrats generally ) that health care reform is framed as a “ poverty program . ”
There ’s something to that point , but I do n’t think it ’s quite right ( and I did n’t put it right in the first paragraph above ) .
I think it is a poverty program – but the vast majority of us are , actually , poor .
The combination of job loss and serious illness could wipe out almost anyone ( under the age of 65 – actually , anyone over 65 as well , since Medicare does n’t cover extended nursing home care ) , and we all suffer serious economic insecurity because of it .
The political problem is that the median American does n’t identify as poor ( although he probably thinks he needs more money ) and thinks that poverty programs are for “ other people . ”
I think that middle - class and upper - class people should support poverty programs for other people , but that ’s an unnecessary discussion .
My point here is that the vast majority of us are poor , when it comes to health care , and therefore we should get behind reform out of self - interest .

People in rooms freshly spritzed with Windex were more fair and generous than people in normal - smelling rooms .
Credit : Jaren Wilkey / BYU
People are unconsciously fairer and more generous when they are in clean - smelling environments , according to a soon - to - be published study led by a Brigham Young University professor .
The research found a dramatic improvement in ethical behavior with just a few spritzes of citrus - scented Windex .
Katie Liljenquist , assistant professor of organizational leadership at BYU 's Marriott School of Management , is the lead author on the piece in a forthcoming issue of Psychological Science .
Co-authors are Chen - Bo Zhong of the University of Toronto 's Rotman School of Management and Adam Galinsky of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University .
The researchers see implications for workplaces , retail stores and other organizations that have relied on traditional surveillance and security measures to enforce rules .
" Companies often employ heavy - handed interventions to regulate conduct , but they can be costly or oppressive , " said Liljenquist , whose office smells quite average .
" This is a very simple , unobtrusive way to promote ethical behavior . "
Perhaps the findings could be applied at home , too , Liljenquist said with a smile .
" Could be that getting our kids to clean up their rooms might help them clean up their acts , too . "
The study titled " The Smell of Virtue " was unusually simple and conclusive .
Participants engaged in several tasks , the only difference being that some worked in unscented rooms , while others worked in rooms freshly spritzed with Windex .
The first experiment evaluated fairness .
As a test of whether clean scents would enhance reciprocity , participants played a classic " trust game . "
Subjects received $ 12 of real money ( allegedly sent by an anonymous partner in another room ) .
They had to decide how much of it to either keep or return to their partners who had trusted them to divide it fairly .
Subjects in clean - scented rooms were less likely to exploit the trust of their partners , returning a significantly higher share of the money .
• The average amount of cash given back by the people in the " normal " room was $ 2.81 .
But the people in the clean - scented room gave back an average of $ 5.33 .
The second experiment evaluated whether clean scents would encourage charitable behavior .
Subjects indicated their interest in volunteering with a campus organization for a Habitat for Humanity service project and their interest in donating funds to the cause .
• Participants surveyed in a Windex - ed room were significantly more interested in volunteering ( 4.21 on a 7 - point scale ) than those in a normal room ( 3.29 ) .
• 22 percent of Windex - ed room participants said they'd like to donate money , compared to only 6 percent of those in a normal room .
Follow - up questions confirmed that participants did n't notice the scent in the room and that their mood at the time of the experiment did n't affect the outcomes .
" Basically , our study shows that morality and cleanliness can go hand - in - hand , " said Galinsky of the Kellogg School .
" Researchers have known for years that scents play an active role in reviving positive or negative experiences .
Now , our research can offer more insight into the links between people 's charitable actions and their surroundings . "
While this study examined the influence of the physical environment on morality , Zhong and Liljenquist previously published work that demonstrated an intimate link between morality and physical cleanliness .
Their 2006 paper in Science reported that transgressions activated a desire to be physically cleansed .
Liljenquist is now researching how perceptions of cleanliness shape our impressions of people and organizations .
" The data tell a compelling story about how much we rely upon cleanliness cues to make a wide range of judgments about others , " she said .

RELATED : Up to two million march to US Capitol to protest against Obama ’s spending in ‘ tea - party ’ demonstration
The Gray Lady of Operation Mockingbird , the New York Times , reports today that “ thousands ” of patriots protested against Obamacare , cap and trade , the bankster bailout , and unchecked federal government power in the District of Criminals yesterday .
“ The demonstrators numbered well into the tens of thousands , though the police declined to estimate the size of the crowd , ” the newspaper reports , attempting to downplay the historical significance of the protest .
The New York Times says the police declined to estimate the crowd — or rather the corporate media declined to report it — because the number was around two million , the largest protest in the capitol ’s history .
The protest out - numbered Martin Luther King ’s “ I Have a Dream ” speech delivered from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28 , 1963 .
That march was estimated at around 200,000 people .
ABC News did likewise , pegging the turnout in the thousands .
“ Thousands of conservative protesters from across the country converged on the Capitol Saturday morning to demonstrate against President Obama ’s proposals for health care reform and voicing opposition to big government , what they say is over - the - top spending , ” the corporate propaganda outlet claimed on Saturday .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Ditto the War Street Journal — excuse me , the Wall Street Journal — although they put the number at tens of thousands .
The Journal admitted the obvious : “ While some Republican officeholders were at the rally , not everybody there called themselves Republicans . ”
Fox News tried to spin the event as a Glenn Beck phenomenon .
NPR , the news service of Soros and the foundations , did the same parlor trick with the math , putting the number at tens of thousands .
NPR contradicted itself , however , and reported that as “ the demonstrators walked along Pennsylvania Avenue toward the U.S. Capitol , the line stretched as far as the eye could see in either direction .
The crowd was so thick in places that it was difficult to move . ”
As to be expected , the “ progressives ” ( left cover bankster faction ) attempted to portray two million patriotic Americans as racists .
Think Soros , formerly known as Think Progress , posted a blog entry supposedly revealing racist placards at the event — in fact , none of the signs showed were racist — the worst the Soros operatives produced was a photo of a woman with a Confederate flag .
The Soros clan said everybody at the event was white ( as if they had examined the skin color of two million people ) .
It ’s not going to work .
The two million people who showed up to voice their outrage at a federal government out of control and in violation of the Constitution was but a small sampling of the millions of people across the country in opposition to Obama and the corporate - fascist agenda of his one - world masters .
If Obama and the Democrats ram the deathcare bill through the House by way of “ reconciliation , ” the opposition will redouble its numbers and once again take to the streets .
Thousands ?

Comment on this article
Given at least 1/20th of a second to look at a man , you can probably guess whether he ’s gay — and be correct at least 70 percent of the time .
Remarkably , your first split - second assessment would be as accurate as your impression after a full minute .
That was the case , at least , in a study by Tufts University psychologists Nalini Ambady and Nicholas Rule when they asked male and female judges to guess the sexual orientation of 90 faces of gay and straight men ( without facial hair or piercings ) .
Regardless of their own sexual orientation , the judges were astoundingly swift and accurate when it came to identifying most men ’s sexual orientation .
( Women ’s faces were n’t tested . )
But the problem with gaydar — a contraction of “ gay ” and “ radar ” — is that identifying gay men and lesbians based on physical qualities alone is n’t always reliable .
Despite the high accuracy rate for most faces , several yielded no clue of sexual orientation and were consistently misjudged .
And when the judges were right , it was tough to pinpoint what clued them in .
Was it the set of an expression ?
The hairstyle , the lips , the lower jaw ?
The eyes ?
Nevertheless , the results were surprising because many gays and lesbians attribute their own gaydar to behavioral cues such as the way someone looks at them — a sliding glance or the hint of a wink — or certain postures , gestures , facial expressions , and ways of speaking .
As for straight women having gaydar , it might be evolutionarily advantageous — after all , it ’s helpful to know who is a potential mate and who is not .
Stripped of cultural influences , there are n’t clear - cut , consistent physical distinctions that would trigger gaydar .
Not that researchers have n’t found some very general biological differences between straights and gays .
As I detail in BLONDES :
* Prenatal testosterone levels , which are linked to sexual orientation , also influence traits such as finger ratios .
Gay men ’s ring and index fingers ( of the right hand especially ) are more likely to be the same length , like those of straight women , whereas a greater number of straight men have a ring finger that ’s longer than their index finger .
Women who identify themselves as “ butch ” lesbians are much more likely than “ femme ” lesbians or straight women to have a low digit ratio ( ring finger longer than index finger ) due to higher levels of prenatal testosterone .
* Depending upon the study ( one here ) , gay men have a 34 - 82 percent greater chance of being left - handed than straight men ( note : not all studies detect a bias ) , and lesbians are up to twice as likely to be lefties than straight women .
Bear in mind that even though a gay man or lesbian has a higher chance of being left - handed , the majority of lefties are straight .
* Sniffing t- shirts of gays and straights , gay men prefer the odor of other gay men more than straights of either gender do .
( Lesbians generally like the natural smell of other lesbians , straight women , and even straight men . )
* Gay men ’s hair whorl ( direction of scalp hair rotation ) is more likely to be counterclockwise than that of straights .
Nearly 30 percent of a sample of gay men had hair whorls that rotate counterclockwise , compared to fewer than 10 percent in a mixed group of men and women .
* A man ’s gait might be another clue — in one study , judges identified gay men by their walks with about 60 percent accuracy .
The reason is that some gay men have lower waist - to - hip ratios ( larger hips compared to waist ) than the average straight guy .
None of these traits proves a person is gay or lesbian , nor can their absence prove a person is straight .
They ’re just trends .
Yes , gaydar works , although it ’s as much an art as a science .
But someday , if MIT ’s Project Gaydar goes as expected , identifying who ’s gay may be mere computation .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Seven more banks failed Friday , pushing the 2009 total to 106 and marking the first year since 1992 that at least 100 have gone under .
Experts suggest we could be no more than 10 % of the way through this cycle of bank collapses , which is sure to be the worst run of closures since the Great Depression .
The parade of failures continued on Friday with closures of three banks in Florida , one each in Wisconsin , Georgia , Minnesota and Illinois .
See story .
So far 106 banks have failed in 2009 .
See FDIC timeline of 2009 's failed banks .
CreditSights , which tracks the dismal data , predicts that in the current cycle , from 2008 through 2011 , as many as 1,100 banks will fail .
That would wipe out 13.4 % of all U.S. banks , representing 7 % of U.S. banking assets .
The last year in which the FDIC had that many banks to deal with was in 1992 , at the tail end of the last real estate crisis .
The FDIC rescued 122 in 1992 , according to Keefe , Bruyette & Woods researchers .
The increasing stream of bank failures is likely to run through 2011 according to some industry experts , as the fallout from the credit crisis continues .
The panic that started in 2007 as a credit crisis quickly morphed into a full blown residential real estate collapse .
The problems blossomed as prices on mortgage securities backed by ill - conceived loans then collapsed , triggering capital destruction at banks and a fear among firms to lend to each other .
The crisis worsened as tighter credit forced firms to lay off millions of workers , hitting retailers hard and triggering further spikes in credit card and mortgage defaults .
Most of the high profile large banks likely to fail already have , and the backlog of troubled banks now is concentrated at the regional and community level , and is weighed down by commercial real estate and construction loans .
Many smaller banks gorged on commercial real estate lending in the go - go 2000s , amid low interest rates and rising property values .
The fallout has been fast , and furious .
CreditSights ' data show that commercial real estate loans made up almost half of all loans at most ( 80 % ) of the banks the research firm identified as troubled .
" Another wave of prolonged losses driven by weakness in commercial real estate could prove catastrophic to many of these weakened banks , " CreditSights said .
FDIC - insured institutions have set aside just over $ 338 billion in provisions for loan losses during the past six quarters , an amount that is about four times larger than their provisions during the prior six quarter period , FDIC data show .
" While banks and thrifts are now well along in the process of loss recognition and balance sheet repair , the process will continue well into next year , especially for commercial real estate , " FDIC chief Sheila Bair told Congress last week .
As a result , she said , the number of problem institutions increased significantly , to more than 400 during the second quarter .
Now , with unemployment near 10 % and credit card default rates about the same , prime mortgage delinquencies are rising , stoking worries among the nation 's banks that despite rising stock markets , fundamental banking industry health remains elusive .
Hundreds of billions of dollars of government support is helping to keep the biggest banks afloat , but many of the nation 's smaller regional and community banks face failure .
" We expect the numbers of problem institutions to increase and bank failures to remain high for the next several quarters , " Bair said .
That 's created a devilishly vexing issue for the FDIC , the federal agency charged with making depositors whole .
10 % of U.S. banks could fail
Before Friday 's bank failures , the year - to - date total assets of the failed banks was $ 107.14 billion .
By comparison , the nation 's four largest banks , excluding former investment banks Morgan Stanley MS , +2.35 % and Goldman Sachs GS , +2.12 % , Bank of America BAC , +1.34 % , J.P. Morgan Chase JPM , +0.96 % , Citigroup C , +1.62 % and Wells Fargo WFC , +1.07 % , have average annual revenue of about $ 100 billion .
By contrast , according to the FDIC , during the Great Depression , about 9,100 banks failed between 1931 and 1934 representing a full one - third of the nation 's then total banking system .
In modern times , the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s , defined by the years 1988 through 1992 , saw 818 banks , or just under 5 % of the industry at the time .
The 1988 - 1992 periods saw 4.4 % of the banking industry 's assets lost , according to data from CreditSights and the FDIC .
As in all crises , some areas fare worse than others for various reasons .
In this cycle , Georgia has been hit hardest , with 19 failures , followed by Illinois with 16 , and California with 10 .
By CreditSights estimates , Georgia , Florida and Illinois have the most potentially troubled banks among the states , followed by banks , followed by Texas , Minnesota , Washington State and California .
But if there is a bright side , it 's that some of the nation 's well - managed smaller banks stand to benefit from picking up assets on the cheap .
" We continue to believe a select group of regional banks with sufficient capital , credit quality , and management talent stand to benefit by expanding their banking franchise through either rolling up failed institutions or acquiring market share and / or key lenders from the dislocation , " analysts at Keefe Bruyette & Woods said earlier this month .
See story about how regional banks are taking advantage of competitors ' failures .
FDIC faces tough calls
The FDIC is facing its own money issues , as its Deposit Insurance Fund , which it uses to pay depositors ' claims , fell to just $ 10.4 billion at the end of the second quarter .
The FDIC estimates that its total cost for the 98 bank closings through Friday at $ 26.44 billion .
The problem the FDIC faces is that none of its options to raise money to fund its Deposit Insurance Fund are too appealing .
On the one hand , the FDIC has already hit banks with a special assessment earlier this year to beef up the fund , but that 's not nearly enough to fill the expected void .
Also earlier this year , the agency 's board approved a proposal to have the nation 's banks prepay 3 three years of insurance premiums , but that too is unlikely to fill the gap the fund faces under CreditSights worst - case scenario .
And , while the FDIC could tap an emergency $ 500 billion line of credit from the U.S.
Treasury , the agency appears loathe to do that given the likely political backlash .
" In the FDIC 's view , requiring that institutions prepay assessments is also preferable to borrowing from the U.S. Treasury .
Prepayment of assessments ensures that the deposit insurance system remains directly industry - funded and it preserves Treasury borrowing for emergency situations , " FDIC chair Sheila Bair told Congress in last week 's testimony .
See Bair 's full testimony .
" Additionally , " she added , " the FDIC believes that , unlike borrowing from the Treasury or the FFB , requiring prepaid assessments would not count toward the public debt limit . "
CreditSights ' analysts agreed that a Treasury deal could prove politically tricky , and the debate sure to surround it could actually prolong the crisis ,
" A request to draw down on the Treasury line may become yet another political football pitting banking interests versus small business interests .
These types of debates seem to have in the past delayed regulatory action and this could be the case as well with an undercapitalized FDIC , " the firm said .
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela Print This Venezuela Invests Surplus Oil Dollars in Education , Housing , and Industry By James Suggett Venezuela Analysis
Central Bank President Nelson Merentes
The increase in Venezuelan government spending on public housing and education , and the re-opening of a General Motors automobile factory are among signs that the Venezuelan economy may be set to recover from its contraction of 1 % in the first half of the year .
Meanwhile , monthly inflation rose slightly to 2.2 % in August .
In recent months , Venezuela 's National Assembly approved more than 20 billion bolivars ( US $ 9.3 billion ) in credits , increasing the estimated total budget for this year from 167 billion bolivars ( US $ 77.7 billion ) to 180 billion bolivars ( US $ 83.7 billion ) .
A fifth of the credits were granted to public education , for which a new Education Law that promises increased funding was passed last month , one tenth were granted to the Housing and Public Works Ministry , and nearly half of the credits were granted to the state and local governments , while the rest went to health care and agriculture , according to the Venezuelan daily El Universal .
This follows a period of conservative spending over the first half of the year , when the government adjusted its budget based on an expected average income of $ 40 per barrel of oil , and spent 5.2 % less than it did during the first half of last year .
It also raised the sales tax and increased its domestic debt to cope with a drop in oil prices from nearly $ 150 per barrel the previous year .
Since then , however , oil prices have risen .
The average price of oil produced by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) has hovered between $ 65 and $ 70 per barrel recently , and the average price of Venezuela 's crude over the course of this year is more than $ 50 per barrel , indicating a budget surplus for the Caribbean country whose oil accounts for more than 90 % of exports .
Meanwhile , General Motors announced it had reached an agreement with the Venezuelan government for the issuance of dollars at the official exchange rate of 2.15 bolivars , and will thus re-open its auto factory in Valencia , Carabobo state next Monday .
The factory had been closed in June due to a lack of auto parts which could not be imported because the supply of government - issued dollars had been tightened .
Nelson Merentes , the president of the Central Bank of Venezuela ( BCV ) , said the government 's resolution of a series of imbalances in the supply of government - issued dollars and its payments to solicitors of these dollars is a sign that the economy is poised for a turnaround .
" The reality is that the oil prices continue to rise , CADIVI [ the agency which manages the dollar supply ] is improving its operations , and there is a strong relationship between the BCV and the Finance and Planning Ministries , where we are working hard so that the economy continues to grow in the coming months , " said Merentes in a recent televised interview .
The president of the National Statistics Institute ( INE ) , Elias Eljuri , explained that " Venezuela during this whole period [ of the world economic downturn ] has maintained its growth and its savings of important resources that have allowed it to maintain social spending and not decrease its investments . "
Merentes also said the government is discussing measures to reduce the gap between the official value of the dollar and the informal market value of the dollar , which approached seven bolivars recently .
These measures are expected to be announced later this month .
" The parallel dollar has a great impact on inflation , " Merentes said .
In August , monthly inflation was 2.2 % , a slight acceleration relative to the 2.1 % monthly inflation in July , according to the INE .
This brought the accumulated inflation this year to 15.6 % , which is less than 19.4 % the accumulated inflation over the first eight months of last year .
In addition , the INE reports that Venezuela 's unemployment rate at the end of July was 8.5 % , an increase over the average unemployment rate of 7.9 % over the first half of the year .
Also , as of September 1st , Venezuela 's minimum wage officially increased by 10 % to 960 bolivars ( US $ 447 ) per month .
The increase completes the government 's promise to increase the minimum wage by a total of 20 % in two stages beginning last May 1st .
The minimum wage increase is understood to largely be an adjustment to Venezuela 's high inflation rate relative to the region .
Inflation was spurred by more than twenty quarters of consecutive GDP growth prior to this year 's contraction .
The wage increase was accompanied by a year - long prohibition of layoffs of workers earning the minimum wage without just cause .

Facebook became ' demanding and anti-social ' for Caroline Hocking
It 's become a daily ritual for millions , but what happens when you deactivate your Facebook account and go cold turkey ?
Caroline Hocking - a self - confessed obsessive - finds out .
I 'd done it .
My ( virtual ) life was over .
After two years on the online social networking site Facebook , I 'd taken the plunge and killed off my account - in Facebook speak , I was " deactivated " .
It had n't all been bad ; we 'd had some good times .
I 'd enjoyed a bit of snooping as much as the next person and found it useful enough as a way to check out potential love interests , flog unwanted stuff and organise the odd shindig or three .
As a newbie to online social networking , my first few forays into Facebook had been cautious and brief .
It had been a guilty pleasure - an enjoyable escape which tapped into a basic urge to share and compare .
Facebook has an estimated 250 million users worldwide
But over two years , I 'd turned into a Facebook fiend , uploading over 30 photograph albums , posting countless inane status updates and acquiring hundreds of online " friends " ( 350 , to be exact ) .
I 'd got sucked into semi-stalkerdom and felt something akin to separation anxiety if I ever found myself offline for more than a few hours .
What had been my favourite waste of time had morphed into a demanding and anti-social addiction .
The turning point came when I completely forgot about a long - planned reunion with a friend one evening because I 'd been sidetracked by mindless Facebook mulling .
This is ridiculous , I thought .
Surely social networking was supposed to enhance my social life , not to trash it ?
And the whole set - up had started to grate : so much pathetic posturing , fakery and careful cultivating of one 's online " brand " .
People posted anything and everything , surrendering their own privacy and that of their friends .
I did n't NEED to see pictures of strangers ' weddings or the drunken holiday antics of mates ' mates .
' Liberated '
I told myself that I 'd managed perfectly well pre-Facebook and resolved to return to simpler times .
I would still keep in touch with people I liked .
I had a mobile and I was perfectly capable of bashing out an e-mail or penning a letter .
And so I decided to deactivate .
It only took a few clicks and was pretty painless .
Facebook demanded to know why I 'd left - it even gave me a helpful little list of possible reasons why I might have fallen out of love and suggested ways around them .
But my mind had been made up .
I wanted to see if I could cope without - for at least a week .
It gave me the option to return at any time and resurrect my account , but I felt liberated .
Is sending a letter really such a hassle ?
One person , who thought I 'd removed them alone from my list of Facebook friends , sent me an anxious text message , citing - and apologising for - all the things they had done which might have offended me and prompted a " de- friending " .
Leaving Facebook was clearly seen as a BIG deal to them , indicative of something being " not quite right " .
I was flattered that people cared about me and felt a little ache for the ol ' Facebook camaraderie .
Of course , not everyone worried about my departure - or even noticed .
One of my flatmates was perplexed after seeing that their Facebook friend count reduced by one , but had n't investigated who might have gone AWOL .
But one day into Facebook cold turkey and my fingers had itched to log back on .
I felt bereft and out of the loop .
I missed the online chatter of which I had become so contemptuous .
' Lazy '
Sure , I could have messaged people direct , but that is the beauty of social networking sites - while they make spies / personal detectives of us all , they also cater to the lazy .
They allow you to be passive , throwing information at you which would otherwise take time and effort to seek out .
Facebook had made one - stop communication so easy and many of my friends were devotees ; some only communicated via the site .
Would people invite me to events if it meant they had to send me a separate invite rather than include me in a Facebook scattergun missive ?
I knew I could cope without Facebook - just
I thought I 'd enjoy bags of free time in a Facebook - free life , but instead I 've just reverted to other distractions , like trashy celeb magazines .
And , even though I could n't be actively involved in its machinations , I still found myself gassing about Facebook .
I might not have been frittering away hours browsing its pages , but the site - and my departure from it - became my favourite topics of conversation .
What did other people think about Facebook ?
What did they think about me leaving ?
I found myself leaping on any Facebook - related story in the news with disproportionate enthusiasm .
It proved hard to let go completely .
The break ( up ) was tough and eventually - well , after just 10 days to be honest - I found myself reactivating my account .
Caroline lasted just 10 days without a fix
My world had n't fallen apart by going offline .
I managed to stay in touch with the people I cared about , even if took a little more energy on my part ( although I never did get round to penning any letters ) .
But absence had made the heart grow a little fonder .
My package holiday - sized abstention reminded me how useful Facebook could be , particularly for organising and remembering events .
I confess my heartbeat had quickened a little when I logged in .
When my homepage fired up , I 'd felt a small surge of joy at being reunited with my long - lost friend (s ) .
I was back and I was downright curious : what had I missed ?
Not a huge amount as it turned out .
It was like I 'd never been away : acres of holiday snaps , numerous links to interesting news stories and YouTube marvels , and some funny / not - so - funny status updates .
I logged out within a few minutes .
I 've been back since , uploaded some pictures , dashed off a few messages , commented on a few links and acquired a couple of new Facebook friends .
But I no longer had the same urge to plunder the latest online goings - on and see what people are up to quite so regularly .
I knew I could cope without Facebook - just .
And if it all gets too much and I feel myself slipping back to my old ways , I can always take another break .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I ' disapperated ' after just a few weeks on Facebook , because I found myself spending an inordinate amount of time following up on chatter I was n't really interested in .
I realised I was hooked when I came in from the garden just to see if someone had replied to a comment I 'd made !
Like Caroline
I had several emails from people who took my departure personally .
A word of advice for others ; it maybe worth doing a farewell note explaining why you 're leaving .
The effects of departure are n't well explained .
In my case , probably because I 'd been a user for a much shorter time , within a week I 'd forgotten all about it and I do n't see myself re-activating .

It 's weird how something like Facebook can take over your life .
There are aspects of it that I really like , for instance being able to keep in touch with people who live overseas , arranging parties , remembering birthdays , posting links to people etc .
I have over time become a little addicted to it but I do n't see that necessarily as a bad thing .
Mostly I use it to keep in touch with people .
I do n't have hundreds of friends - just the people that I know and like .
I think it 's about how you use it and whether you get sucked into all the crap on it .
It can be very useful and fun if you use it properly .
Emma , Surrey I 've been using Facebook for a few months now , at the urging of my real life friends ( as opposed to the folk I 've acquired on my friends list now ) , as they basically could n't be bothered sending a Facebook message to some people and separate emails / texts to me !
It 's been really handy for getting back in touch with people that I otherwise would n't have had the opportunity to talk to , i.e. old school friends who 've since moved away , family living abroad etc .
I admit that it is the lazy way of interacting , but as long as there 's a balance between " social networking " via computer and also out in the actual world , it 's really not so bad ...
SuzieBlue , Inverclyde Surely it would have been a bit more sensible just to remove the people whose updates you were n't interested in ?
To cut yourself off from , say , pictures of a friend 's wedding , simply because you 're too lazy to delete someone whose wedding photos you did n't care about seems a bit simply .
A compromise seems better than totally removing yourself from a useful social tool .
It 's like being an alcoholic and then becoming tee - total .
Better to do everything in moderation ?
Tommy Long , Maidstone , Kent People no longer ask us for a card or our number , they discreetly add us on Facebook .
I too am guilty of this : almost every day I stalk certain pages , check out pictures and the new comments " mutual friends " have left .
So , out of the blue I decided to cut the cord and quit my online presence .
Myspace and studivz were easy , hardly anyone noticed I was a goner .
But Facebook ?
The minute I clicked on the confirmation button that nullified all e-connections and links I had built up over the course of four years , hell broke lose .
Astonished , I watched as GoogleNotifier pinged me with emails .
28 messages along the lines of " What happened with your profile ? "
" You deleted me AGAIN ? " " Colleen , are you alright ? " flooded my inbox within the next two hours .
The world was freaking out .
My global neighbourhood was in panic .
What was happening ?
My leaving a social network suddenly left a void that became personal to many , and they were n't letting me off the hook .
Colleen Yorke , Berlin / Los Angeles
I tend to ignore the social networking aspect of Facebook as I 'm usually playing the silly games that are a part of it .
Paul , Goole , UK Never quite got why Facebook is so attractive , and addictive , to so many people .
Never realised there 's so many exhibitionists amongst us , either .
Oh , and you can't really delete yourself either .
Facebook patiently waits for you to re-offend .
Spooky .
Vladimir Oka , Reading , UK I hate it and I hardly ever use it .
I just use it for staying in touch with a few people , like family abroad and ex-work colleagues .
I do n't add people I have n't met personally ( why on earth would I ? )
I 'm amazed that some people have so much time that they can post 10 or more things a day .
Rob , London , UK
Wow , this article has actually made me think .
I 'm going to deactivate my account to see how I do .
Dan , UK I do n't think people are " actually " hooked on Facebook , and I certainly do n't believe that we should make a song and dance about leaving the social networking site .
Essential it boils down to the fact that some people just can't handle too much of a good thing ( aka the author ) I still speak to my friends via text ( and god forbid ! ) in person too , and this has been facilitated by the use of Facebook .
I have made friends on certain issues I believe in through the site as well as enjoying the plethora of time wasting activities it offers .
I think there a big " hoo - ha " over nothing and people should just grow up and be responsible for their online usage , rather than making out it 's a " drug " or something that is a pain to quit ...
Grow up , please ?

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The recession has taken its toll on the nation 's super rich , whose collective net worth fell for only the fifth time in 28 years , according to a survey released Wednesday .
The collective worth of the 400 richest people fell by $ 300 billion , or 19 % , to $ 1.27 trillion , according to the survey released by Forbes magazine .
As a result , the price of admission to appear on the list this year dropped to $ 950 million from $ 1.3 billion in the 2008 list .
The losses were driven by turmoil in the capital markets and plunging real estate values , according to the magazine .
but fraud and divorce also took a toll .
The number of members who experienced year - over - year declines was more than double the number in 2008 , with 314 of this year 's list members declining in wealth compared to 126 last year .
Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) 's Bill Gates , with assets worth $ 50 billion , topped the list of richest Americans .
That 's despite a $ 7 billion hit .
Investor Warren Buffett came in second , with assets totaling $ 40 billion , after a $ 10 billion loss this year .
Oracle ( ORCL , Fortune 500 ) founder Lawrence Ellison was the only top ten member to avoid major losses .
Ellison , who was third overall , saw his net worth remain unchanged at $ 27 billion .
Among the 32 members who were booted off the list this year was disgraced financier R. Allen Stanford , who is accused of operating a Ponzi scheme .
Omid Kordestani , who made billions working for Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) , was forced off the list because of his divorce , according to Forbes .
However , the lower threshold resulted in the addition of 19 new members .
Among the newbies is Jeffry Picower , who the magazine describes as " a longtime investor with Bernard Madoff who is alleged to have extracted billions of dollars from Madoff 's fund before it collapsed . "
This year only 28 members added to their wealth , including banker Andrew Beal , who tripled his net worth to $ 4.5 billion buying cheap loans and assets .
FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski made his pitch this morning for network neutrality , and he did it in the most business - friendly language he could muster .
But that did n't stop him from arguing that an open Internet must be the rule no matter how one gets on it — wired and wireless connections should both be nondiscriminatory towards content and applications .
Genachowski delivered a major address this morning at the Brookings Institution in Washington , laying out his vision of an open Internet and rehashing the many ways that an open Internet is a spur to innovation of all kinds .
Today , Internet access suffers from three problems , he said .
First is the limited competition among ISPs , which is " simply a fact about today 's marketplace . "
Second is the perverse economic incentives faced by the major US ISPs , which also sell separate phone and TV service to the same customers who buy Internet access ( and can increasingly access such services over the ' Net ) .
Finally , the growth of Internet traffic can put pressure on ISPs .
The resulting situation is n't about " bad guys " vs. " good guys , " but about the " inevitable tensions built into our system . "
That system has already led to ISP blocking of VoIP , degradation of P2P connections , and even a denial of access to certain political content ( all examples cited by Genachoswki ) .
To preserve the Internet 's unique innovation engine , where the intelligence exists at the edges and where entrepreneurs do n't need permission to build the next Skype or Google , Genachowski promises a fair proceeding that is driven by data and that listens to everyone .
But when it 's over , he wants the FCC to add two new principles to its existing " four freedoms " ( PDF ) : nondiscrimination and transparency .
The nondiscrimination principle says that ISPs can't " discriminate against particular Internet content or applications , " which means that traffic throttling of particular apps and protocols would be forbidden , even in cases where an ISP does not block access entirely .
The transparency principle states that ISPs must inform subscribers about their network management practices .
" Why does the FCC need to adopt this principle ? " Genachowski asked .
" The Internet evolved through open standards .
It was conceived as a tool whose user manual would be free and available to all .
But new network management practices and technologies challenge this original understanding .
Today , broadband providers have the technical ability to change how the Internet works for millions of users — with profound consequences for those users and content , application , and service providers around the world . "
The canonical example , of course , was Comcast 's degradation of BitTorrent , which came to light in 2008 .
The cable ISP used TCP reset packets to disrupt certain P2P connections , changing the purpose and use of reset packets unilaterally .
But when that Comcast case was finally ruled on by the FCC , and the company was told to stop its practice , a dispute erupted : did the FCC even have the authority to act on its " four freedoms " ?
Those Internet freedoms were explicitly not rules , and Comcast has since gone to court over the issue .
Genachowski wants to make all six of his proposed Internet principles into official agency rules to make clear to ISPs exactly what 's required of them , and to make sure the FCC has the authority to act if problems arise .
As his speech neared its end , Genachowski turned to the most common criticisms of the plan — that it amounts to " government regulation of the Internet , " that it 's largely based on overheated conspiracy theories that exist only in the minds of groups like Free Press , and that it 's anti-business and therefore ( in the long run ) anti-consumer as well .
This is not about government regulation of the Internet .
It ’s about fair rules of the road for companies that control access to the Internet .
We will do as much as we need to do , and no more , to ensure that the Internet remains an unfettered platform for competition , creativity , and entrepreneurial activity .
This is not about protecting the Internet against imaginary dangers .
We ’re seeing the breaks and cracks emerge , and they threaten to change the Internet ’s fundamental architecture of openness .
This would shrink opportunities for innovators , content creators , and small businesses around the country , and limit the full and free expression the Internet promises .
This is about preserving and maintaining something profoundly successful and ensuring that it ’s not distorted or undermined .
If we wait too long to preserve a free and open Internet , it will be too late .
Some will seek to invoke innovation and investment as reasons not to adopt open Internet rules .
But history ’s lesson is clear : Ensuring a robust and open Internet is the best thing we can do to promote investment and innovation .
And while there are some who see every policy decision as either pro-business or pro-consumer , I reject that approach ; it ’s not the right way to see technology ’s role in America .
An open Internet will benefit both consumers and businesses .
The principles that will protect the open Internet are an essential step to maximize investment and innovation in the network and on the edge of it -- by establishing rules of the road that incentivize competition , empower entrepreneurs , and grow the economic pie to the benefit of all .
Throughout , Genachowski stressed his own background in business and his concern for innovation .
He decried " detailed rules " that would be immediately outdated and made clear that ISPs could still throttle heavy users at peak times and take reasonable measures to manage their networks .
But he is absolutely committed to broad principles of openness , and his background at both the FCC and in the private sector make him the sort of figure who might actually be able to push the idea through .
Defining moments
Genachowski has picked his battle .
The network neutrality fight will consume much of his energy as chairman and wo n't be resolved any time soon , but if Genachowski gets his six broad rules and applies them to all forms of Internet access , he will leave a pretty serious stamp on the direction of the Internet in the US .
Google has come out in support of the idea , as have groups like Free Press .
But Genachowski can't wave his magic " I was in business too ! " wand and make resistance disappear .
Wireless carriers , especially , despite a new commitment to openness on the part of Verizon Wireless and others , are worried .
Chris Guttman - McCabe , VP of regulatory affairs for CTIA - The Wireless Association , expressed his concern " about the unintended consequences that net neutrality regulation would have on investments from the very industry that 's helping to drive the US economy .
We believe that this kind of regulation is unnecessary in the competitive wireless space as it would prevent carriers from managing their networks — such as curtailing viruses and other harmful content — to the benefit of their consumers . "
The Progress & Freedom Foundation upped the rhetorical ante with this pithy nugget from president Ken Ferree : " I find myself at a loss to understand why the administration wants to start meddling with a sector of the economy that , despite a challenging macro-economic environment , is performing pretty well by any rational standard .
What exactly is the problem they are trying to remedy ?
It 's almost as if they are trying to turn a story of success into one of failure . "
But , to Genachowski , the openness of the ' Net has been the most crucial factor in its tremendous success , and he 's ready to take on all comers in the battle that may define his time as head of the FCC .

The international media report that citizens from across the world are travelling , or seeking to travel , to Switzerland , where they hope to be helped to die .
But this ' suicide tourism ' presents distinctive ethical , legal and practical challenges .
In a paper published online in the Journal of Bioethical Inquiry , Dr Richard Huxtable from the University of Bristol explores three issues associated with this phenomenon :
• how to define ' suicide tourism ' and ' assisted suicide tourism '— where the suicidal individual is helped to travel to take up the option of assisted dying ;
• the legality of assisted suicide tourism , particularly in the English legal system where there has been considerable recent activity ;
• and the ethical dimensions of the practice .
He argues that the suicide tourist — and specifically any accomplice thereof -- risks springing a legal trap , but that there is good reason to prefer a more tolerant policy , premised on compromise and ethical pluralism .
Richard Huxtable is Deputy Director of the Centre for Ethics in Medicine at the University of Bristol .
His primary research is in the areas of end - of - life decision - making and surgical ethics , and he has published widely in medical , legal and bioethical journals , in addition to authoring the book Euthanasia , Ethics and the Law : From Conflict to Compromise ( 2007 , Routledge - Cavendish ) .

You 're an ass , but I still love you : Donkey chews sheep 's ears off - but they remain best friends
With the benefit of hindsight , putting the donkey in with the sheep might have been a touch , well , ear - responsible .
Just three hours after this ewe was born , her ears were chewed off by her stablemate .
But since the unfortunate incident ten years ago , Earless the Poll Dorset sheep and Jess have become best friends .
Earmarked : Despite the damage , Jess and Earless remain good friends
Jess was a 25th wedding anniversary present in 1999 to Rob Jesse from his wife Nicky , 51 , a shepherdess .
Because donkeys are said to suffer from loneliness , the couple put Looby Loo the sheep in with her , and she soon gave birth .
Postman Mr Jesse , 59 , said : ' We had left Looby Loo and Earless alone to bond , but when we got back a couple of hours later the newborn 's ears were gone . '
Though Earless is still able to hear perfectly well , the couple have taken precautions to ensure there is no repeat .
' Every time a lamb is born in that shed we cover their ears with pine tar so that Jess does n't go for them again , ' said Mr Jess .
If you want to make programs go faster on parallel hardware , then you need some kind of concurrency .
Right ?
In this article I ’d like to explain why the above statement is false , and why we should be very clear about the distinction between concurrency and parallelism .
I should stress that these ideas are not mine , and are by no means new , but I think it ’s important that this issue is well understood if we ’re to find a way to enable everyday programmers to use multicore CPUs .
I was moved to write about this after reading Tim Bray ’s articles on Concur.next : while I agree with a lot of what ’s said there , particularly statements like
Exposing real pre-emptive threading with shared mutable data structures to application programmers is wrong
it seems that parallelism and concurrency are still being conflated .
Yes we need concurrency in our languages , but if all we want to do is make programs run faster on a multicore , concurrency should be a last resort .
First , I ’ll try to establish the terminology .
A concurrent program is one with multiple threads of control .
Each thread of control has effects on the world , and those threads are interleaved in some arbitrary way by the scheduler .
We say that a concurrent programming language is non-deterministic , because the total effect of the program may depend on the particular interleaving at runtime .
The programmer has the tricky task of controlling this non-determinism using synchronisation , to make sure that the program ends up doing what it was supposed to do regardless of the scheduling order .
And that ’s no mean feat , because there ’s no reasonable way to test that you have covered all the cases .
This is regardless of what synchronisation technology you ’re using : yes , STM is better than locks , and message passing has its advantages , but all of these are just ways to communicate between threads in a non-deterministic language .
A parallel program , on the other hand , is one that merely runs on multiple processors , with the goal of hopefully running faster than it would on a single CPU .
So where did this dangerous assumption that Parallelism == Concurrency come from ?
It ’s a natural consequence of languages with side - effects : when your language has side - effects everywhere , then any time you try to do more than one thing at a time you essentially have non-determinism caused by the interleaving of the effects from each operation .
So in side - effecty languages , the only way to get parallelism is concurrency ; it ’s therefore not surprising that we often see the two conflated .
However , in a side - effect - free language , you are free to run different parts of the program at the same time without observing any difference in the result .
This is one reason that our salvation lies in programming languages with controlled side - effects .
The way forward for those side - effecty languages is to start being more explicit about the effects , so that the effect - free parts can be identified and exploited .
It pains me to see Haskell ’s concurrency compared against the concurrency support in other languages , when the goal is simply to make use of multicore CPUs ( Edit : Ted followed up with a clarification ) .
It ’s missing the point : yes of course Haskell has the best concurrency support :-) , but for this problem domain it has something even better : deterministic parallelism .
In Haskell you can use multicore CPUs without getting your hands dirty with concurrency and non-determinism , without having to get the synchronisation right , and with a guarantee that the parallel program gives the same answer every time , just more quickly .
There are two facets to Haskell ’s determinstic parallelism support :
par / pseq and Strategies .
These give you a way to add parallelism to an existing program , usually without requiring much restructuring .
For instance , there ’s a parallel version of ‘ map ’ .
Support for this kind of parallelism is maturing with the soon to be released GHC 6.12.1 , where we made some significant performance improvements over previous versions .
Nested Data Parallelism .
This is for taking advantage of parallelism in algorithms that are best expressed by composing operations on ( possibly nested ) arrays .
The compiler takes care of flattening the array structure , fusing array operations , and dividing the work amongst the available CPUs .
Data - Parallel
Haskell will let us take advantage of GPUs and many - core machines for large - scale data - parallelism in the future .
Right now , DPH support in GHC is experimental , but work on it continues .
That ’s not to say that concurrency does n’t have its place .
So when should you use concurrency ?
Concurrency is most useful as a method for structuring a program that needs to communicate with multiple external clients simultaneously , or respond to multiple asynchronous inputs .
It ’s perfect for a GUI that needs to respond to user input while talking to a database and updating the display at the same time , for a network application that talks to multiple clients simultaneously , or a program that communicates with multiple hardware devices , for example .
Concurrency lets you structure the program as if each individual communication is a sequential task , or a thread , and in these kinds of settings it ’s often the ideal abstraction .
STM is vitally important for making this kind of programming more tractable .
As luck would have it , we can run concurrent programs in parallel without changing their semantics .
However , concurrent programs are often not compute - bound , so there ’s not a great deal to be gained by actually running them in parallel , except perhaps for lower latency .
Having said all this , there is some overlap between concurrency and parallelism .
Some algorithms use multiple threads for parallelism deliberately ; for example , search - type problems in which multiple threads search branches of a problem space , where knowledge gained in one branch may be exploited in other concurrent searches .
SAT - solvers and game - playing algorithms are good examples .
An open problem is how to incorporate this kind of non-deterministic parallelism in a safe way : in Haskell these algorithms would end up in the IO monad , despite the fact that the result could be deterministic .
Still , I believe these kinds of problems are in the minority , and we can get a long way with purely deterministic parallelism .
You ’ll be glad to know that with GHC you can freely mix parallelism and concurrency on multicore CPUs to your heart ’s content .
Knock yourself out 🙂
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , whose signature manifesto swept Republicans to power in the mid-1990s , called Wednesday for conservatives to recruit Democrats who oppose tax increases and big government and form a coalition to do battle with President Obama ’s “ fantasy wing of the American left . ”
Mr. Gingrich in an interview pointedly left the door wide open for a 2012 run for the White House , proposing a specific prescription for the ailing conservative wing of the Republican Party .
He offered stark alternatives to the Obama agenda on health care , spending , education and national security that could build a framework for what he called a “ potential ” run for the presidency .
“ If you look at California on the recent vote against raising taxes or spending , when you get 64 percent of the state voting with you , it tells you that in the most Democratic districts of the state , there was a solid majority against raising taxes and spending , ” Mr. Gingrich told editors and reporters at The Washington Times .
“ So I would urge , for example , conservatives in California to find a Democrat to run in every Assembly and Senate seat in California that ca n’t be contested by Republicans , and then to run a Republican in every seat they could possibly win , and then have an overt goal of creating a bipartisan conservative coalition , ” he said .
“ I ’d do the same thing nationally . ”
He said Republicans need to broaden their base to all conservatives , especially in light of a Gallup Poll this month that found 40 percent of Americans describe their political views as conservative , 35 percent as moderate , and just 21 percent as liberal .
“ You need to have a national movement that focuses not on the presidency .
It focuses on 513,000 elected offices , because this is a very densely , freely elected society , and you ca n’t get the changes just from the top , ” he said .
Then , he added , build a “ tri-partisan ” coalition of conservatives , independents and even moderate liberals - “ a red , white and blue majority . ”
To the Republican National Committee chairman , Mr. Gingrich delivered the same directive .
“ I would say to Michael Steele and others , ‘ The first duty is , for the next eight months , do n’t worry about the message , worry about recruitment . ’
A rising tide only lifts the boats that are in the water .
…
Barring some extraordinary change in the economy , we ’re going to have a relatively good election in 2010 because high taxes , big government [ and ] politically corrupt systems do n’t lead to economic growth , ” he said .
With President Obama expanding government at an unprecedented rate - and pushing the national deficits to unseen heights - Mr. Gingrich said the country wo n’t toe the line for long .
“ You have a very left - wing government trying to impose its will on essentially a center - right country , ” he said .
Several polls in the past week have reported a decline in public support for Mr. Obama ’s economic stimulus and other spending measures , reinforcing Mr. Gingrich ’s claim that a bolder conservative agenda could have widespread appeal in next year ’s midterm elections .
A Washington Post / ABC
News poll released Monday found support for the stimulus program in states that were decided by fewer than 10 percentage points in the 2008 presidential election had fallen to 50 percent , down from 63 percent at the 100 - day point in his presidency .
That poll also found that a 54 percent majority of Americans - including 61 percent of independents - favored “ smaller government with fewer services ” over “ larger government with more services . ”
Notably , a Wall Street Journal / NBC
News poll published last week found that 58 percent of its respondents said Congress and the president should focus more on reducing the deficit , “ even if it takes longer for the economy to recover . ”
The former House speaker , who authored the “ Contract With America ” that helped Republicans win control of Congress just two years after Democrat Bill Clinton won the White House , said rumors of the party ’s death are premature .
“ As a historian , I lived through this in 1965 , ‘ 66 ; we gained 47 House seats and swept the governorships .
And in 1968 , we began 40 years in which no overt liberal could win the presidency , ” the Georgia Republican said .
Watergate pushed Republicans back down , but by 1980 , “ the left had collapsed and we elected Ronald Reagan and began a quarter - century of economic growth and the Soviet Union disappeared . ”
“ In 1993 , I was the Republican whip , we had lost the presidency , the Democrats were on offense , they were going to give us national health care and the ‘ Hillarycare ’ model .
They had the largest tax increase in American history .
They were going to be social liberals - nirvana had arrived - and for the first time in 40 years , we swept control of the House , ” he said .
As to whether the Republican Party can attract moderates and even center - left members , Mr. Gingrich , as he did several times during the hourlong interview , quoted former President Reagan .
“ As Reagan would have told them , ‘ You can be a majority , in which case you ’re going to have arguments set inside the room , or you can stay a minority .
But what you ca n’t do is have a majority that ’s only people you understand and agree with . ’ ”
Mr. Gingrich made no excuses for a Republican Party that often appears to be in disarray , but said the massive agenda liberals are pushing through makes crafting a cohesive message difficult .
“ The biggest characteristic of the left - wing machine that is currently running the city … is that they ’re doing so many destructive things in parallel simultaneously that it disperses the opposition .
Their goal , almost like Lyndon Johnson in ‘ 65 , is to try to ram through as much bad stuff as they can as fast as they can before the natural conservatism of the country rebounds and rights the system , ” he said .
Still , he said “ conservatives in general and Republicans in particular ” should focus on what he called “ a massive tax on investments , a massive tax increase on energy , a massive tax increase to pay for government - run health care and a dramatic expansion of the power of politicians and bureaucrats . ”
He urged Republicans to key in on issues like the energy bill , set to come to the House floor on Friday , which calls for the government to cap greenhouse - gas emissions , leading to increased prices Americans would pay on energy .
Mr. Gingrich called it “ the largest energy - tax increase in history . ”
“ Every person who votes for this energy tax ought to expect an opponent next year because this is such a clearly irrational bill to pass in the middle of this kind of unemployment , ” he said .
Mr. Gingrich has been raising his profile of late , weighing in on issues such as the closing of the detention facility for terrorism suspects at the U.S. Naval Base Guantanamo Bay , Cuba ; Mr. Obama ’s nominee for the Supreme Court ; and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s assertion that the CIA lies to Congress “ all the time . ”
He has also become somewhat the de facto leader of the Republican Party - when Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin pulled out of an appearance at the Republican congressional fundraiser in Washington this month , Mr. Gingrich stepped in .
When asked who is emerging as a Republican leader able to step up onto the national stage , Mr. Gingrich cited not Mrs. Palin , but Wisconsin Rep. Paul D. Ryan , “ a brilliant young guy , ” and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , whom he called “ an amazing leader . ”
Mr. Jindal , he noted , will be around for a long time : “ He will be John McCain ’s age in 2044 . ”
The former speaker also defended former President George W. Bush , saying that after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , “ He responded with an almost single - minded focus to try to design strategies and institutions that would defend this country . ”
“ And he left his successor a seven - year record of having stopped every terrorist effort .
And his successor had better get very serious about all this civil libertarian stuff that is going to rapidly make this country more vulnerable . ”

While on a recent trip to Japan , I stopped at the Ueno Zoo for part of a day where I had the pleasure of seeing the Flying Foxes in person .
They were just hanging around in the trees above our heads ; pretty cool and creepy all at the same time .
In the rodent exhibit , there were also rodents that had the body and head of a mouse , and the legs and hooves of a deer .
I checked for Deer Mouse over google image search , but I do n't think that 's what it was , as it looked even more like a mouse .
Pretty weird whatever it was .
Politico's story this morning suggests Pelosi does n't have the votes , but our sources insist the leadership is n't yet at that stage .
The Democratic whip 's office has been surveying members on the public option for the last several days to get a sense of where they stand on different elements of the bill , a strategy that will inform the final version of what the House introduces .
Mike Allen knew it was fake and false yet he published it because
House sources think Democrats may have spoken with Allen to apply pressure on Pelosi at this late stage in the game .
Also the White house quickly and effectively put an end to this and the other rumors that has been floating around that Obama prefers a trigger .
In denouncing the report Presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett went further when she jabbed at the Politico story while appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe today , saying of the reporter who penned the piece , " I do n't know whether Mike Allen can actually count votes or not . "
This is not a coincidence .
It is a coordinated attack by the opponents of the Public Option .
They want to control the story in order to kill the Public Option .
I am glad that the quick reaction from the Whitehouse and the House has put that to an end .
But they will stop here .
Politico's Mike Allen an ineffective Whitehouse reporter for the Washington Post during the Bush administration is back to his old tricks of fake news reporting .
Coroners and medical examiners across the country are reporting spikes in the number of unclaimed bodies and indigent burials , with states , counties and private funeral homes having to foot the bill when families cannot .
The increase comes as governments short on cash are cutting other social service programs , with some municipalities dipping into emergency and reserve funds to help cover the costs of burials or cremations .
Oregon , for example , has seen a 50 percent increase in the number of unclaimed bodies over the past few years , the majority left by families who say they cannot afford services .
“ There are more people in our cooler for a longer period of time , ” said Dr. Karen Gunson , the state ’s medical examiner .
“ It ’s not that we ’re not finding families , but that the families are having a harder time coming up with funds to cover burial or cremation costs . ”
About a dozen states now subsidize the burial or cremation of unclaimed bodies , including Illinois , Massachusetts , West Virginia and Wisconsin .
Most of the state programs provide disposition services to people on Medicaid , a cost that has grown along with Medicaid rolls .
Victoria ’s brown coal reserves look set to be opened up to export on a mass scale — prompting claims the state is putting commercial opportunity ahead of its responsibility to curb greenhouse gas emissions .

WASHINGTON -- Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee closed ranks Wednesday in the face of Republican attacks over proposed Medicare cuts at the heart of health - care legislation .
The second day of debate in the influential panel underscored the political difficulties ahead for the health bill , which would wring big savings from Medicare to help finance President Barack Obama 's goal of expanding health coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans .

Last week Joel Spolsky wrote a blog post entitled The Duct Tape Programmer where he praises developers who favor simple programming practices to complex ones .
This blog post strongly resonated with me and made me recall some related thoughts on complexity and solving problems in software projects .
Some key excerpts from his which I 'll use as a jumping off point are below
Jamie Zawinski is what I would call a duct - tape programmer .
And I say that with a great deal of respect .
He is the kind of programmer who is hard at work building the future , and making useful things so that people can do stuff .
...
Duct tape programmers are pragmatic .
Zawinski popularized Richard Gabriel ’s precept of Worse is Better .
A 50 % - good solution that people actually have solves more problems and survives longer than a 99 % solution that nobody has because it ’s in your lab where you ’re endlessly polishing the damn thing .
Shipping is a feature .
A really important feature .
Your product must have it .
One principle duct tape programmers understand well is that any kind of coding technique that ’s even slightly complicated is going to doom your project .
Duct tape programmers tend to avoid C++ , templates , multiple inheritance , multithreading , COM , CORBA , and a host of other technologies that are all totally reasonable , when you think long and hard about them , but are , honestly , just a little bit too hard for the human brain .
The urge the reduce the complexity of the tools used to solve software problems is one that every software developer should share .
However even more important is reducing the complexity of the actual solutions that are delivered to your customers at the end of the day .
End users can't tell if you used complicated C++ techniques like template metaprogramming and mixins to build the application .
They can tell when your application fails to solve their actual problems in a straightforward way or is so late to ship due to project delays that they lose interest in waiting for you to solve their problems .
There are many famous and everyday examples of this culture of complexity in software projects which are eventually trumped by solutions that solve 80 % of the problem in a simple way .
My favorite example is contrasting the World Wide Web invented by Tim Berners - Lee with Project Xanadu as envisioned by Ted Nelson .
Today the WWW is used by over a billion people to enrich their lives in myriad ways on a daily basis and has created hundreds of billions dollars in value by minting an entire new industry .
Project Xanadu is a sad footnote spoken about in hushed tones by fans of hypertext who bewail the success of the Web and how it has forced us to settle for less ( i.e. Worse Is Better ) .
If you are n't familiar with Project Xanadu you can think of it as a networked system of hyperlinked documents and media just like the WWW which had to satisfy the following seventeen rules
Every Xanadu server is uniquely and securely identified .
Every Xanadu server can be operated independently or in a network .
Every user is uniquely and securely identified .

The bottom line is that a lot of the time it 's OK to create a solution that solves 80 % of the problem .

The idea of a ginger festival may sound like little more than a bit of fun , but when 3,000 redheads came together for a recent gathering it became a bonding experience .
Bart Rouwenhorst steps on to his crane and slowly rises above his ginger empire .
A sea of redheads all dressed in white look up from the park below and follow his instructions to wave at the 20 or so photographers and cameramen .
The photo shoot is the culmination of celebrations for Redhead Day - an annual day - which has spilled across a weekend - to mark all things ginger , paid for by the local government in Breda , a city in the south east of the Netherlands .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But for its founder , Mr Rouwenhorst , who is notable for his blond rather than ginger locks , it is the pinnacle of his efforts so far to champion the ginger - hued among us .
A mechanical engineer by day , Mr Rouwenhorst is also an amateur painter and it's this sideline which first awoke his interest in those of fair skin and flame hair .
Finding himself drawn to the aesthetic qualities of redheads , he advertised for 15 ginger models to paint - only to be deluged with e-mail responses .
The 15 turned into 150 , whom he photographed .
But when many of those who did n't get selected voiced their disappointment , Mr Rouwenhorst decided to make an annual event of the redhead gathering .
Five years on , it has grown into a huge festival of ginger self - affirmation , overtaking the city centre for one weekend every September .
" We have families with children , we have older people who were teased as children and then we have many proud women who come to the festival .
They know they are fantastic and they just come to feel great . "
Driven out
The promise of this amber spectacle also appeals to the more muted - mopped mainstream - with an estimated 7,000 non-redhead spectators attending .
Strength in numbers - many redheads find the festival empowering
But the initiative is firmly with the redheads .
And there is much common ground .
Men and women sporting a spectrum of ginger , from strawberry blonde to rich ochre , swap stories of being picked on in the playground , discrimination in the wider world - a family in Newcastle claimed they were driven from their home because of anti-ginger abuse in 2007 - and the whys and wherefores of raising a ginger brood .
Walking round the city , redheads smile and laugh with one another .
Since this is a celebration of gingerism , an army of hairdressers , makeup artists and cameramen have been drafted in to prepare for the fashion shoot , treating redheads like celebrities .
The dermatologist 's class - redheads tend to have very fair skin - is so popular it has to move to the main part of Breda 's cathedral to accommodate all those who want to attend .
Mr Rouwenhorst marvels at the innate connection between members of one of the most genetically distinctive yet disparate groups in the world .
" When people come together as redheads , they just look at each other , " he says .
" They have a certain bond .
And I think this whole event will some day expand to multiple events , maybe across the world .
I think the ginger community will start . "
Strong people
It 's a far - sighted pronouncement .
Do people with red hair really want to seek out the company of those with similar colouring ?
This exclusive community is already functioning and making money for Brigitte van Hengel .
She runs a ginger modelling agency and is looking to add a ginger - only theatre company .
Whether or not to raise a ginger brood - one topic of conversation Ms van Hengel , whose reddish locks are somewhat faded , seeks out redheads not just for their aesthetic qualities - but their character traits too .
Most have had to put up with bullying , she says , which in turn has made them strong and proud characters .
Behind the scenes at the fashion show civil servant Anneloes Rynders is preparing for the catwalk .
While being sown into her dress by the designer Marian Kastelein , she tells a story of an uncomfortable childhood that is shared by many at the festival .
" In my youth it was n't nice to be different .
It changed around the age of 16 or 17 .
I got more confidence , I went out and got attention - because I 'm a redhead .
I stopped being ashamed .
It 's actually nice to stand out in a crowd . "
Ms Rynders prefers being unusual and does n't like the idea of an exclusively ginger community .
However , she is disappointed that none of her children has ginger hair , so welcomes the idea that such a place may spawn more ginger offspring .
Alan Petrie has travelled from Aberdeen to research the possibility of starting a ginger community in Scotland .
Curiosity drove him to the event but he is going away with a sense of belonging .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I came here because I wanted to see if people with red hair would like to meet each other - we could take that back home and see if it worked on a more local level .
I think redheads do enjoy being together and not being the odd one out . "
He is particularly concerned about discrimination against his ilk , which he thinks is n't taken seriously .
" After an anti-ginger South Park episode , Kick a Ginger Day started in Canada and someone was seriously hurt .
When it was revealed that one of the Big Brother contestants was dying his hair and underneath he was ginger he got shouted abuse I can't repeat , when he was evicted .
If he was black the people shouting this would have been arrested . "
Ironically , claims of racial discrimination were also invoked when Mr Rouwenhorst investigated the possibility of getting his festival noted in the Guinness World Records .
Redheads , he was told , were considered a minority by its editors , who will not record events based on racial characteristics .
Certainly , there 's little taste for any sort of genetic purity at the event .
The majority of redheads appear happy to accommodate those of the brown , black and fair - haired persuasion .
Even the organisers insist that cafes do n't restrict their free drink offers to natural redheads - but include those who dyed their hair for the day .
So has this year 's festival helped foster a sense of ginger belonging ?
Thorger Enge Herrara , who grew up in Mexico , says redheads are so unusual in his homeland that when he sees one they exchange pleasantries and he buys them a drink .
" It does n't happen so often .
It 's not a community where I 'm from because it 's so rare . "
For this weekend , though , Mr Herrara is understanding what it 's like to be one of a crowd rather than a curiosity .
Below are a selection of your comments .
I used to be called " Ginger " when I was being made fun of , but three years ago I adopted it as my nickname and now I encourage people to call me Ginger instead of my real name .
I hope that this festival will spread to North America and that we too , here in Canada , give Kick a Ginger Day a " kick " in the rear and replace it with Ginger Fest .
Ginger , Vancouver , Canada
There is a serious point underlining all this .
It 's easy to make derogatory comments about someone with ginger hair .
But what if the same comment were aimed at someone with black skin ?
Celine Hagbard , London , England
It is true that when I see another ginger there is a connection .
You know that they grew up like you , being picked on , being self - conscious , being different , and are now stronger for it .
Kristil Baker , Lake Arrowhead , CA USA I 'm a 13 year old red - head ( and I often get picked on for it ) and I think this is a fantastic idea .
All my life I 've been told by my peers I should be embarrassed by my red hair and people say they avoid me as they do n't want to get ' gingivitis ' .
I would never change my hair colour , I love to stand out from the crowd so does every red head I think .
Ellie , England
My red hair has gone from a bright ginger to an almost sandy blonde over the years .
Even though I was horribly bullied as a child I kind of miss being red .
Danny Wiltshire , Bath I 'm a redhead and would love it if there were a ginger fest here .
I would definitely go and celebrate with all of the other proud , confident gingers .
Amy Klous , Twin Cities , MN USA
It is so funny because of the surreal nature of the discrimination portrayed .
Andre , Amsterdam
My own very beautiful little girl has long thick locks of red hair that started from birth and I could n't be prouder .
I would love to bring her to an event like this some day .
Jeri Polacek , Madison , WI USA
When I was younger I was ginger and during my first few years at school I was bullied because of it .
I have got darker as I grew older but have always been attracted to red heads and I am looking to find a partner with red / ginger hair .
Teddy , Oxford , England I wish I had known about this .
I love being a redhead and am interested in speaking out for my people .
Polly Annabelle Snell , Bristol Is n't picking on Redheads a form of racial abuse ?
It 's all down to genetics - and therefore I wonder why it seems to be socially acceptable to ostracise a subset of out population ?
Ben Marshalsea , Bristol
The very fact that the BBC considered this story worthy of a light - hearted piece like the one above ( instead of , say , a proper news item ) suggests that they do n't take this very seriously either .
Michael , Edinburgh
When I was young I hated having red hair .
At one point I would n't date a really nice young man because he had red hair and I thought I might like him , get married and have redheaded kids .
Ann Sell , Ft Myers FL USA
Surely the notion of a " redhead community " will only further attach more prejudice towards the world 's gingers .
Mark Spencer , Dundee
All I see is " gingers are so down - trodden " in the media .
Truth is , as with anything rare and distinctive , it is both revered and feared in extremes .
Regardless of the admiration and scorn I have received for my red hair colour , I am confident enough within myself to not to let other peoples attitudes towards my hair colour effect my self esteem either way .

Enlarge Reuters U.S. soldiers and members of the Philippine National Police carry relief goods off a Chinook helicopter at Baguio city airport , north of Manila on Sunday .
BAGUIO , Philippines ( AP )  U.S. Marine CH - 46 helicopters loaded with rice , sardines and drinking water flew Sunday into a stricken Philippine mountain city where supplies are running short after landslides triggered by a storm blocked roads and buried dozens of residents .
Three days after tons of mud and rock cascaded down hillsides in Baguio because of heavy rains , rescuers were still digging for survivors .
Meanwhile , panic buying of canned goods emptied several stores in the city , and authorities were forced to ration gasoline .
" There is nearly zero gasoline supply now , and we 're running low on food , " city police chief Agrifino Javier told The Associated Press .
But as Tropical Depression Parma blew out late Saturday after drenching the country 's north for a week , the overwhelmed government , helped by the U.S. military , was able to step up relief efforts .
Back - to - back typhoons in the past two weeks have killed more than 600 people in the northern Philippines , posing a severe test to the authorities .
Hundreds of thousands are still displaced from their homes , and the damage caused runs into hundreds of millions of dollars .
Baguio lies in a swath of the north where Parma 's rains have left at least 276 people dead .
Some 53 of them died in Baguio , a summer tourist destination , 130 miles north of the capital Manila , known for its cool climate and winding , pine tree - lined roads .
Flooding and mudslides have blocked three key roads to the area , isolating the upland region for three days , said Marine Capt .
Jorge Escatell , a U.S. military spokesman .
Police chief Javier said many foreign tourists were among those stranded .
On Sunday , four twin - rotor CH - 46 helicopters flew in the supplies to Baguio .
President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo also came by helicopter and ordered officials to hasten efforts to reopen the roads .
One was reopened Sunday , but only partly , allowing cars but not relief trucks to pass , Philippine disaster - response agency spokesman Lt. Col. Ernesto Torres said .
In nearby Benguet province , police and volunteer gold miners pulled more bodies overnight from houses buried by mudslides late Thursday and early Friday , bringing the province - wide death toll from Parma to 175 .
At least 20 people remain missing , provincial police chief Loreto Espineli said .
Most of the dead were recovered in a mountainside community called Little Kibungan , where tons of mud and floodwaters buried or swept away houses as people slept .
Marsman Diang said he wept as he frantically dug into the mud Friday for his five nieces and nephews .
Four were found dead , wrapped in a bedsheet .
One was pulled out barely breathing and did not make it to the hospital alive .
The children 's father , Diang 's brother , left to work in Japan two months ago to raise money for the kids ' education .
He heard about their deaths in a phone call from Diang .
" He could n't talk .
I heard him weeping with his wife when I called to tell them that their children were gone , " Diang said .
Apart from shortage of gasoline , the province has run out of coffins .
Volunteers were busy making wooden coffins for six bodies found in Benguet 's capital town of La Trinidad , Espineli said .
American and Filipino forces also fanned out in Pangasinan , a rice - producing province to its south , to help provide medical treatment .
Nearly all of Pangasinan was inundated by flooding and water released from a major dam .
With large expanses of land still under water , officials said damage to agriculture and infrastructure caused by the two typhoons in the northern Philippines has reached $ 312 million .
In all , about 700 U.S. Marines and sailors are on land and at sea to help out with the relief effort .
Before Parma struck , the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit , based in Okinawa , Japan , had been helping in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Ketsana which caused the worst flooding in over 40 years in and around Manila on Sept. 26 .
That storm killed some 337 people in the capital and nearby provinces .
More than 241,000 remain in evacuation centers .
Parma made landfall Oct. 3 , then roared back and forth across the north for a week , as it reacted to Typhoon Melor that skirted the country from the Pacific Ocean , chief government forecaster Nathaniel Cruz said .
" During the first pass , Parma brought winds , nothing happened and some people thought the worst was over , " Cruz said .
" Then it returned with heavy rains and many were devastated . "
The Philippines has been lashed with 17 typhoons and storms so far this year and about three more are expected , according to Cruz .

Editor 's note : Fareed Zakaria is an author and foreign affairs analyst who hosts " Fareed Zakaria GPS " on CNN on Sundays at 1 and 5 p.m. ET .
Fareed Zakaria says we still have a problem with Iran , and we have to have a strategy in dealing with the country .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Three leading Iranian reformists who have rejected the results of last month 's election questioned the legitimacy of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government Wednesday .
This comes as Ahmadinejad is set to take office at the end of the month .
Presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi wrote a letter in his party 's newspaper , saying he would not recognize the government and vowing to " stand by the people and the revolution , until the end of my life . "
His statement prompted Iran 's government to block publication of the newspaper .
Ahmadinejad 's main political rival , Mir Hossein Moussavi , also released a statement Wednesday criticizing the government and its crackdown on the media , which he said has created a " bitter , coup d'etat atmosphere " in Iran .
Iran 's former reformist President Mohammad Khatami called on Iranians to keep up the struggle , noting that " all doors are not yet closed . "
Author and foreign affairs analyst Fareed Zakaria spoke to CNN about this week 's events in Iran .
CNN : What is the likely outcome of events in Iran ?
Fareed Zakaria GPS
Fareed Zakaria analyzes the latest on the situation in Iran on this week 's GPS
Sunday , 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. ET see full schedule »
Fareed Zakaria :
The situation is fluid .
The challenger , Mir Hossein Moussavi , and the former president , Khatami , are still criticizing the government for stealing the election .
That is an extraordinary level of dissent at the highest levels of the establishment .
But the most likely outcome remains that for now , the regime will be able to reassert order .
But it has become a naked dictatorship , losing the facade of the Islamic and democratic political ideals that are important to it .
CNN : But the nuclear program continues ?
Zakaria : Exactly .
We still have a problem with Iran , and we have to have a strategy in dealing with it .
The nuclear program continues to grow , and refusing to negotiate will not do anything to stop it .
On the other hand , it seems wrong to pretend that nothing has happened in Iran .
And it also disregards the reality of a divided leadership .
CNN : So , what to do ?
Zakaria : I would say do nothing .
Inaction can be a strategy .
The five major powers on the U.N. Security Council ( plus Germany ) have given Iran a very generous offer to restart the nuclear negotiations .
It has not responded .
So , the ball is in its court .
Until it does , the West should build support for tougher sanctions and more isolation .
Until we hear from Tehran , there is no reason for the United States or the others to get engaged .
CNN : Is this from a position of weakness , because the West has so few options ?
Zakaria :
Not really , because while it might seem like the West has few options , in reality , Iran has fewer .
Its economy is doing badly , the regime is facing its greatest challenge since its founding , and its proxies in Lebanon , Iraq and elsewhere are all faring worse than it had expected .
Let the supreme leader and President Ahmadinejad figure out what they should do first .
Time might not be on their side .
CNN : What about a military strike ?
Zakaria :
It would be bizarre to bomb Iran -- which means bombing Iranians -- now that we have seen the inside of that country .
Moussavi and his supporters want a less confrontational approach to the world .
So do many members of the establishment .
Moussavi attacked Ahmadinejad repeatedly for his aggressive foreign policy .
So we now know the answer to the question , " Are there moderates in Iran ? "
Yes , millions of them .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
White House communications director Anita Dunn fired back at criticism from TV commentator Glenn Beck on Friday , saying that a Mao Tse - tung quote Beck took issue with was picked up from legendary GOP strategist Lee Atwater .
White House communications director Anita Dunn says she picked up a Mao quote from a legendary Republican .
" The Mao quote is one I picked up from the late Republican strategist Lee Atwater from something I read in the late 1980s , so I hope I do n't get my progressive friends mad at me , " Dunn told CNN .
As for Beck 's criticism : " The use of the phrase ' favorite political philosophers ' was intended as irony , but clearly the effort fell flat -- at least with a certain Fox commentator whose sense of irony may be missing . "
On Thursday night 's program , Beck showed exclusive video of Dunn discussing the communist leader , who was responsible for a cultural revolution in 1966 that included re-education camps and setting the army and students on witch hunts against his opponents .
Millions of Chinese suffered or died , most notably teachers , writers , political opponents or anyone deemed a " reactionary . "
Dunn , taped in a speech in what appears to be a church , said the leader 's philosophies were a guidepost for her own strategy on politics .
She also praised the philosophy used by religious icon Mother Teresa .
" The third lesson and tip actually comes from two of my favorite political philosophers : Mao Tse-tung and Mother Theresa -- not often coupled with each other , but the two people I turn to most to basically deliver a simple point which is ' you 're going to make choices ; you 're going to challenge ; you 're going to say why not ; you 're going to figure out how to do things that have never been done before . "
The comments set Beck into a tirade .
" It 's insanity .
This is her hero 's work , " he said .
" She thinks of this man 's work all the time ?
" It would be like me saying to you , ' you know who my favorite political philosopher is ?
Adolf Hitler . '
Have you read Mein Kampf ?
[ She wants to ] fight your fight like Hitler did , " Beck said .
Dunn recently blasted Fox News saying that the cable news organization often operates as either " the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party . "
" When he [ Obama ] goes on Fox , he understands that he's not really going on it as a news network at this point .
He 's going to debate the opposition .
And that 's fine .
He never minds doing that .
" They 're widely viewed as a part of the Republican Party .
Take [ the GOP 's ] talking points , put them on the air , take [ the GOP 's ] opposition research , put them on the air , " Dunn said .
Fox News in a statement to CNN said its programming was comparable to the editorial page of a newspaper .
Still , Beck wasted no time Thursday in using Dunn 's comments to blast the Obama administration for promoting what he deems a radical agenda .
" America , how many radicals is it going to take ?
How many radicals surrounding our president before you understand that when the president said he wants to transform the country , he wants to transform it all right , " Beck said .
Dunn pointed out that during his presidential campaign and since being elected President Obama has been interviewed by Fox News and will be again in the future .
Watch more of Dunn 's comments »
" He 'll go on Fox because he engages with ideological opponents , " Dunn said .
" He has done that before , and he 'll do it again . "
But it 's not just Dunn , a Democrat , who has used Mao as someone she reads .
Media Matters for America , a liberal media watchdog group , points out that former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich , also a Fox News contributor , quoted Mao in a 1995 Roll Call profile .
" War is politics with blood ; politics is war without blood , " Gingrich said , citing Mao .
Karl Rove , another Fox News contributor , wrote in a December 2008 Wall Street Journal op - ed that President Bush " encouraged me to read a Mao biography . "
Beck led the charge against Obama 's former green jobs czar Van Jones over a petition Jones signed in 2004 calling for an investigation into whether government officials deliberately allowed the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks to occur .
Jones said of the petition on the Web site 911truth.org : " I do not agree with this statement and it certainly does not reflect my views now or ever . "
Jones has also come under fire for comments he made , also before his White House job , including those in a video on YouTube .
In it , he uses a vulgar expression to describe Republicans .
Jones resigned from his post in September , saying in a statement that he came to Washington to " fight for others , not for myself . "
" I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past .
We need all hands on deck , fighting for the future , " Jones ' statement said .
Jones is a co-founder of colorofchange.org , a group that recently has been pressing advertisers to boycott Beck 's program after Beck called Obama a racist .

Is the rally ending , or does it have more to go ?
This is a guest post by Barry Ritholtz , editor of The Big Picture Blog and author of the popular book , Bailout Nation .
OK , it ’s time for round 2 , Shedlock vs. Ritholtz .
You may recall that last time , Mish & I disagreed as to whether this was a recession ( Me ) or a depression ( He ) .
This time , the debate is over the current rally .
On Monday this week on Yahoo Tech Ticker , I discussed that we did not see evidence that the rally was ending ( see “ Rally May Only Be in 6th or 7th Inning , Ritholtz Says “ ) .
Shedlock pens a response – “ Rally in 6th Inning or Top of the 12th ? ” – and discusses the reasons he thinks the market rally should be ending soon :
“ The flip side of the coin is this market has advanced so far , so fast that if downside momentum does develop , there is nothing but air pockets below .
Air pockets are thus a two - way street .
If anything , there is far more air below than above . ”
That may be .
However , none of the various metrics we track suggest the rally is about to run out of gas anytime soon .
That does n’t mean it ca n’t end to tomorrow , but we would rather play the high probability , rather than low probability outcomes .
Here are the four most important reasons why I think we can have more upside , plus a look at some grim economic realty .
1 ) Individual investors remain under-invested .
2 ) Market breadth and momentum are each positive ( i.e. supportive of further upside ) .
3 ) Sentiment has not yet reached extreme levels .
4 ) The broader investment community believes – incorrectly in my opinion – that a recovery is upon us , profits are getting better .
5 ) History shows that secular bear markets have deep selloffs and huge rallies ; this current rally still has room to run based upon a composite of prior cycles ( see “ Four Stages of Secular Bear Markets “ ) .
Now , about that economy .
Here is my dirty little secret .
FOR TWO THIRDS OF THE TIME , THE ECONOMY REALLY DOES NOT MATTER .
I know that sounds insane , but consider the following :
In the middle of secular bull markets , economic info seems to have the greatest correlation with market performance .
Good data , more profits , better market action .
At market tops , the economy looks great .
Valuations are rich , but record profits support the multiple .
Then it all goes to hell .
At bottoms , it looks awful .
It looks like these companies will never make another dime , that layoffs wo n’t ever end , that we can never escape the tar pit .
And then we do .
This must be perplexing , maddening , infuriating to pure economists .
But that is Mr. Market ’s job – to frustrate the maximum number of players .

A real bolt from the blue :
The moment 300,000 volt lightning tore open night sky

This spectacular image shows the awesome moment when a 300,000 volt bolt of lightning tore open the night sky .
Briton Vince Narduzzo was enjoying a glass of red wine in the garden of his second home in France when blasts of thunder shattered the evening calm .
The 49 - year - old from Hertfordshire dashed inside to grab a camera , in time to capture the progress of one of the streaks of lightning over the hamlet in Charente Maratime , near La Rochelle .
Spectacular : Caught on camera is the amazing lightning strike near La Rochelle , France
' I was shaking from sheer awe at it - then it occurred to me that the lighting bolt was so close to me that it might have been my last ever picture , ' he said .
In his photograph the branches on the lightning bolt appear thinner .
In fact , they are simply less bright .
The digital camera was unable to cope with the brightness of the main streak and turned it into a thick blurry line .
Lightning is the discharge of electricity from clouds .
A bolt can travel at speeds of 130,000 mph and – for a few millionths of a second - it produces one million , million watts of power .
It can heat up the surrounding air to 55,000 f – five times hotter than the surface of the Sun .
It is triggered when electrical charges build up in storm clouds .
Scientists are unsure what causes this build - up but believe it may be caused by the movement of ice crystals .
Once the charge is powerful enough , an invisible flow of electrons flows from the cloud to the ground in a zig - zag pattern .
As it approaches the ground , positively charged particles are attracted upwards .
It is this current , called the return stroke , that appears as a bright flash .
Save us , O Lord , save us all .
Save us from the Pope. Joseph Ratzinger is coming to Britain .
Gordon Brown is " delighted " .
David Cameron is " delighted " .
I am " repelled " .
Let him come ; I applaud freedom of speech .
But no red carpets , please .
No biscuits .
No Queen .
In his actions on child abuse and Aids , Joseph Ratzinger has colluded in the protection of paedophiles and the deaths of millions of Africans .
As Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ( Pope John Paul II 's chief enforcer ) , it was Ratzinger 's job to investigate the child abuse scandal that plagued the Catholic church for decades .
And how did he do it ?
In May 2001 he wrote a confidential letter to Catholic bishops , ordering them not to notify the police – or anyone else – about the allegations , on pain of excommunication .
He referred to a previous ( confidential ) Vatican document that ordered that investigations should be handled " in the most secretive way . . . restrained by a perpetual silence " .
Excommunication is a joke to me , perhaps to you , but to a Catholic it means exclusion and perhaps hellfire – for trying to protect a child .
Well , God is love .
He also waved aside calls to discipline Marcial Maciel Degollado , the Mexican founder of the global Legion of Christ movement .
Allegations of child abuse have stalked Maciel since the 1970s .
His victims petitioned Ratzinger , only for his secretary to inform them the matter was closed .
" One ca n't put on trial such a close friend of the Pope as Marcial Maciel , " Ratzinger said .
Two abuse victims sued him personally for obstruction of justice , but he claimed diplomatic immunity .
Eventually , when the allegations could no longer be denied , Ratzinger apologised , and sent Maciel off " to a life of prayer and penitence " .
Why not prison ?
He did n't say .
" It is a great suffering for the church . . . and for me personally , " was Ratzinger 's comment about the wider child abuse scandal .
Great suffering ?
I thought to be raped as a child was great suffering .
To be exposed as complicit in a cover - up is surely merely . . . embarrassing ?
Ratzinger added that he believed the Catholic church had been the victim of a " planned " media campaign .
By whom ?
By gays ?
By Jews ?
By Jedi ?
He instructed that prayers be said in perpetuity for the victims – thanks , I feel better now !
– along with a push to ensure that men " with deep - seated homosexual tendencies " do not enter the priesthood , thereby turning all responsibility for the scandal into – the laps of the evil gays !
Ratzinger is also active in the suppression of Liberation Theology , a Latin American movement that insists that social justice is the central purpose of Christianity ; that good Catholics should also be political activists who fight for the rights of the slum - living poor .
Ratzinger was repelled , and dismissed it as " a fundamental threat to the faith of the Church " .
And so to the church 's own holocaust – in Africa .
Condoms can protect Africans from Aids .
But who can protect them from Ratzinger ?
The Catholic church has long pursued a no -condoms policy .
In El Salvador the church got a law passed , ensuring that condoms were only sold with a warning stating they did not protect the user from Aids .
In Kenya , Cardinal Maurice Otunga staged public burnings of condoms .
The former Archbishop of Nairobi , Raphael Ndingi Mwana a 'Nzeki told his flock that condoms , far from protecting them , contribute to the spread of the disease .
Well , God is love .
Some local priests in Africa counsel contraception , because they care about their parishioners .
But the Vatican , on its Roman cloud , disagrees .
Aids , Ratzinger says , " cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which even aggravates the problems " .
That is a lie .
Not a fantasy , like the virgin birth and all the other magical , mystical nonsense , but a dangerous lie .
There are , Your Holiness , more than 12 million Aids orphans in Africa .
Twenty - two million Africans have Aids and the UN fears that eventually 90 million could die .
Ratzinger presides over a church that calls homosexuality " a deviation , an irregularity , a wound " .
Catholic reformers have tried to liberalise this view but Ratzinger slapped them down .
In a 1986 letter , he complained that , " Even within the Church , [ people ] are bringing enormous pressure to bear . . . to accept the homosexual condition as though it were not disordered . "
He added that homosexuality is " an intrinsic moral evil " .
Care to know the suicide statistics for teenage gays , Your Holiness ?
They are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual fellows .
In 1998 , a 39 - year - old gay man called Alfredo Ormando set fire to himself in St Peter 's Square , in protest at your policies .
He died .
Ratzinger is no better on women ; he opposes women priests , of course , and demands the criminilisation of abortion even for women who have been raped or are very sick ; gin and wire coathangers , anyone ?
His friend , the theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg , has said that Ratzinger sees the push for female priests as driven by " spokeswomen for radical feminists , especially lesbians " .
So this is the man who is coming to lecture us about morality .
Welcome , Benedict XVI , Episcopus Romae , Vicar of Jesus Christ , Successor of the Prince of the Apostles , Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church , Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City , Servant of the Servants of God .
Do n't tread on the corpses .
October 15 , 2009 ( by Asif Shamim ) - Both F - 16s were on a night training exercise at the time .
According to officials one of the pilots ( Capt. Lee Bryant ) was able to bring his damaged F - 16 back to Charleston Air Force Base and was seen by medical teams before being discharged .
The whereabouts of the other pilot ( Capt. Nicholas Giglio ) is unknown .
The crash happened " 40 miles east of Folly Beach , " said Rob Sexton , the chief of public affairs at Shaw .
Units from the US Coast Guard , US Navy and aircraft based out of Charleston Air Force Base are all participating in the search for the missing pilot .
The searching area being covered is 10 nautical miles off Bulls Bay .
Earlier this week , Shaw Air Force Base had announced that pilots would be conducting nighttime exercises to get pilots proficient with night vision equipment and practice tactics critical to surviving in combatThe airforce has set up a board of enquiry to investigate the accident .
Speeding up Firefox seems to be a meme going around the blogsphere lately .
Most of the tips I ’ve seen , though , are only for broadband connections with the latest hardware and only include some of the settings that would affect performance .
The Firefox Tweak Guide has the full details on how to speed up Firefox regardless of your connection or hardware , reprinted in part below .
Do n’t forget that the easiest way to tweak user files is with chromEdit extension .
Common to all configurations
These are the settings that seem to be common to all configuration files regardless of connection speed or computer speed with a couple of additions – plugin paths can be found with about : plugins and the bookmark menu delay is turned off .

A couple settings of note – Firefox is allocated 4096 KB of memory by default and in this configuration we give it roughly 65 MB as denoted by the last line .
This can be changed according to what is used .

Bangladesh 's power plants have not kept pace with a rising population
The prime minister of Bangladesh has ordered male government employees to stop wearing suits , jackets and ties to save electricity .
Sheikh Hasina told officials that doing so would minimise their use of air - conditioners .
Bangladesh suffers from daily power cuts as power plants are unable to meet the country 's demand .
A senior official told the BBC the government would soon encourage businesses to follow its example .
Bangladesh 's official dress code has been rewritten - after Sheikh Hasina ordered government employees to do more to ease the country 's energy shortage .
Even ministers now will no longer be expected to wear suits and ties .
During the hot months between March and November , men have been ordered to wear trousers and shirts instead , and these do not have to be tucked in any more .
Officials and ministers have also been told not to turn their air - conditioners below 24C .
In June , the government introduced daylight saving , and the clocks moved forward by one hour , in another attempt to cut energy consumption .
It has said it will also soon spend $ 6 bn ( £ 3.6 bn ) on new power plants , operated by private companies .
The current state - owned plants have not been able to keep up with Bangladesh 's large population and its economy , which has been growing at about 6 % annually for the past five years .
The energy sector in the country has been beset by allegations of mismanagement and corruption .
Scientists have long known that DNA is arranged in a double helix .
But if the double helix did not fold further , each cell 's genome would be two meters long — far too large to fit into the nucleus of a human cell , which is about a hundredth of a millimeter in diameter .
A new paper from scientists at MIT , the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT , University of Massachusetts Medical School and Harvard University reveals the three - dimensional structure of the human genome and answers the thorny question of how each of our cells stows some three billion base pairs of DNA .
The work , reported in this week 's issue of Science , may also explain how cells control which stretches of DNA are transcribed and which remain silent .
Furthermore , the new technique could allow researchers to study how gene expression changes as cells develop or become cancerous , says Thomas Tullius , professor of chemistry at Boston University , who was not part of the research team .
" It 's a whole new view of the chromosome and its place in the cell , and it's a view we 've never had before , " says Tullius , who studies the structure of DNA .
The new structural data reveal that the human genome is organized into two separate compartments , keeping active genes accessible while sequestering unused DNA in a denser storage compartment .
Each chromosome alternates between regions of active , gene - rich DNA and inactive , gene - poor stretches .
Collaborating with physicists at MIT , genome scientists established that the genome adopts an unusual organization known in mathematics as a fractal .
This architecture , called a " fractal globule , " enables the cell to pack DNA incredibly tightly while avoiding the knots and tangles that might interfere with the cell 's ability to read its own genome .
Moreover , the DNA can easily unfold and refold during gene activation , gene repression and cell replication .
" Nature 's devised a stunningly elegant solution to storing information — a super - dense , knot - free structure , " says senior author Eric Lander , director of the Broad Institute , who is also professor of biology at MIT and professor of systems biology at Harvard Medical School .
Theoretical biophysicist Alexander Grosberg of New York University originally proposed a fractal globule structure for DNA in 1993 .
" Now it is beautifully confirmed , which is very exciting , " Grosberg says .
Form follows function
Just as the 1953 discovery of the DNA double helix by James Watson and Francis Crick revealed how genetic information is stored and copied , the discovery of DNA 's 3 - D structure offers new insights into how cells control which sections of DNA are translated into proteins .
" It 's very suggestive as to how basic cellular processes are taking place , in terms of information storage and retrieval , " says co-first author of the Science paper Erez Lieberman - Aiden , a graduate student in the Harvard - MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology ( HST ) and a researcher in Lander 's laboratory .
" It gives us a lot of ideas about how genes are turned on and off . "
For example , computer simulations in the lab of MIT physicist ( and HST associate professor ) Leonid Mirny demonstrated that sections of a fractal globule structure can be easily opened up by chemical modification , suggesting that cells could use such modifications to control transcription of related genes located near each other .
In the past , many scientists had thought that DNA was compressed into a different architecture called an " equilibrium globule , " a configuration that is problematic because it can become densely knotted and does not easily open up .
Key to deciphering the genome 's structure was the development of the new Hi-C technique , which permits genome - wide analysis of the proximity of individual genes .
The scientists first used formaldehyde to link together DNA strands that are nearby in the cell 's nucleus .
They then determined the identity of the neighboring segments by shredding the DNA into many tiny pieces , attaching the linked DNA into small loops , and performing massively parallel DNA sequencing .
Lieberman - Aiden observed that the data suggest a fractal globule .
He then teamed up with Mirny and Mirny 's student Maxim Imakaev to confirm his hypothesis and demonstrate conclusively that the Hi-C data matched fractal globule behavior .
Computer simulations further helped to reveal biologically important features of such a DNA architecture .
In future experiments , the researchers hope to follow the development of stem cells into mature cell types such as kidney cells , says Lieberman - Aiden .
" We want to understand how that process takes place , because it clearly involves some 3 - D remodeling of the nucleus . "
( Material from a press release issued by Harvard University and the UMass Medical School was used in this story . )
Several fundamental security mechanisms for restricting access to network resources rely on the ability of a reference monitor to inspect the contents of traffic as it traverses the network .
However , with the increasing popularity of cryptographic protocols , the traditional means of inspecting packet contents to enforce security policies is no longer a viable approach as message contents are concealed by encryption .
In this paper , we investigate the extent to which common application protocols can be identified using only the features that remain intact after encryption --- namely packet size , timing , and direction .
We first present what we believe to be the first exploratory look at protocol identification in encrypted tunnels which carry traffic from many TCP connections simultaneously , using only post - encryption observable features .
We then explore the problem of protocol identification in individual encrypted TCP connections , using much less data than in other recent approaches .
The results of our evaluation show that our classifiers achieve accuracy greater than 90 % for several protocols in aggregate traffic , and , for most protocols , greater than 80 % when making fine - grained classifications on single connections .
Moreover , perhaps most surprisingly , we show that one can even estimate the number of live connections in certain classes of encrypted tunnels to within , on average , better than 20 % .
I ’m Intervening Into This Intervention
Hi…How ’s everybody doing ?
I realize this is awkward – me barging in here uninvited like this , but I could n’t stay away .
I really think I have something to contribute here .
It ’s obvious that I was n’t invited to participate because you ’ve got me on some “ enabler ” list and everything , but I need you guys to hear me out – especially you Jeremy .
I know that you ’re all here because you love Jeremy very much and you want to see him stop drinking so he can live a long healthy life and realize his full potential .
I get that .
I want to see that too … the long life thing anyway .
Shit , Jeremy ’s my best friend .
Unfortunately , you ’re the last bunch of motherfuckers that need to be intervening into another person ’s life .
I mean seriously …
Jeremy ’s aunt Susan : Remember that time around the holidays about three years ago ?
You were mad at Jeremy ’s uncle Barry ’ cause he went all crazy after Carson Palmer got knocked out of the game ?
He got loaded and just kept mumbling “ pantywaist ” under his breath until he passed out in Jeremy ’s dad ’s chair ?
Remember that ?
You could n’t go home because Barry would n’t wake up … and his keys were tucked under his scrotum for safe keeping ?
Remember ?
So Kimo von Oelhoffen could n’t get ’em , use them to steal Barry ’s car , go over to his house and ruin the rest of his life ?
So then we said we ’d take you home on our way to One Eyed Jack ’s Bar and Grill .
Remember how you asked if we ’d mind if you joined us for a couple ?
And then four hours later you were dancing with that 400 - pound guy ?
And then you put your head between his massive chestal fat deposits and slapped them up against your face ?
The whole bar completely forgot about Carson Palmer and roared with laughter .
Now look at you Aunt Susan … wearing that cheap sun dress from the discount store , holding hands with Uncle Barry with a serious and concerned look on your face .
You do n’t look the least bit disheveled .
In fact , you look downright sheveled .
You ’re not fooling anyone Aunt Susan .
Once you ’ve made drunken motorboat sounds from deep within a morbidly obese man ’s bosom , you are no longer allowed to take part in alcohol - related interventions .
Jeremy ’s mom Dottie : Remember that time you came home from Belterra with the giant novelty check for $ 9,000 ?
Remember how Jeremy invited me along to celebrate with you later that night ?
Remember how you were all quiet the whole night and drinking wiskey sours like it was your primary occupation and some mystical boss appeared with a blast of smoke like Batman and told you that if you did n’t drink those wiskey sours faster and better and quieter than you ever did before that you were going to lose your job as a professional wiskey sour drinker ?
Remember how Jeremy and I were fighting about whether or not Tinker Bell on “ Peter Pan ” actually needed the pixie dust so she could fly ?
I said that she did n’t ’ cause she ’s got wings and Jeremy said she did ’ cause that ’s how everybody flies and then you started screaming really loud for us to shut up and then you started crying ?
Remember how you told us between sobs that you did n’t really win the jackpot ?
How you were playing next to that old lady with the oxygen tank who smokes the filterless Pall Mall ’s when she won the jackpot ?
Remember how you told her that all the bells were going off because T.V. ’s “ Matlock ” had just walked into the casio ?
And then you slid into her chair when she went to look for him ?
Remember how you blew all the money on designer handbags like the one on the floor next to you ?
If I were Jeremy I would spend this whole intervention staring at that handbag and wondering why I should listen to a fraud like you .
Jeremy ’s dad Carlo : Remember that time you got arrested at St. Xavier when Jeremy was a kid ?
‘ Cause the varsity game was at Elder and the JV game was at St. Xavier ?
C’mon … you gotta remember … Jeremy was on the mound that day ?
It was the biggest game of his life ?
Hello ?
Remember , you stopped off for a few drinks after a tough day at work ?
Your boss was all pissed at you on account of you accidentally painting the wrong sides of the things ?
Remember trying to get to the game after drowning your sorrows , getting confused and driving to St. Xavier ?
Then do you remember when the JV kid with the same number as Jeremy came up to bat for the Panthers ?
Oh , and the St. Xavier kid beaned him and you freaked out and started yelling ?
Remember when the pitcher ’s dad heard you and started yelling back ?
Oh , and then he beat the everloving shit out of you and made you drunkenly beg for mercy until the cops got there ?
Remember how you freaked out again when you found out that everybody said you started it so the cops decided to take you to jail ?
Remember how the cops started kicking your ass again ?
Then you had to wait until everyone got home from Jeremy ’s actual game at Elder before they could come bail you out ?
If I was Jeremy , I ’d be remembering the time you missed the game of his life so that you could end up drunk , beaten and incarcerated .
Jeremy ’s uncle Barry : Remember the time about 3 or 4 years ago around the holidays that you got so mad at Carson Palmer ?
Wait …we kind of did you already , did n’t we ?
Well anyway , nobody wants to take intervention advice from a guy that has permanent , key - shaped impressions in his testicles .
Seriously guys , I like you and all … but Jeremy ’s the only one of you that ’s actually any good at drinking .
He does n’t drive drunk , he makes it to work the next day and he ’s funny when he ’s loaded .
Hell , he ’s even gotten me closer to the ladies a couple of times by being such a cool drunk .
Why do n’t you guys go ahead and take your own advice and get to work on your problems first ?
Jeremy – go ahead and hop up brother … we ’re goin ’ to Jack’s .

At The Mandel Law Firm , “ cookie - cutter ” is not our approach .
For Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein , an embarrassment of riches has turned into embarrassing riches .
Goldman ’s bonus pool is expected to swell to an estimated $ 16 billion after what ’s expected to be another stellar quarter , and Blankfein is struggling to figure out how to pay his employees in a way that keeps them happy while avoiding another round of populist and political outrage like the bank experienced over the summer .
According to people familiar with the matter , Goldman ’s human - resources department is toying with a number of changes to employee compensation , including imposing longer vesting periods for stock options .
Also under consideration is paying top executives ’ bonuses almost entirely in stock to keep from making the biggest cash payments .
Sources speculated that the cash cut out of the bonus pool might be used to buy back stock .
A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment .
While the end of the third quarter is n’t until Wednesday , and Goldman ’s not expected to report earnings until mid-October , sources tell The Post that a resurgence in the capital markets and renewed deal volume have bolstered what was already shaping up to be one of the bank ’s best years ever .
And while a typical CEO would be cheering such news , for Blankfein another gold - plated quarter represents a huge headache , as the firm ’s success has been greeted with intense scorn on both Wall Street and Main Street .
In an attempt to beat back the tide of bad press , Blankfein has publicly advocated that the industry should make a number of changes to compensation on Wall Street , including adding clawbacks and moving away from making salary guarantees to new hires .
He ’s also called for employees to hold more stock until they retire .
Goldman ’s bonus payments have been a hot - button issue since the summer , when a strong second quarter inflated the bank ’s bonus pool to $ 11.3 billion .
The eye - popping figure spawned a p.r. nightmare for the bank , and led Blankfein to repeatedly admonish workers to forgo making big - ticket purchases in order to keep a low profile .
Now with the bonus bucket potentially reaching $ 16 billion , and another quarter to go before the year is out , Goldman quite possibly could beat 2007 ’s bonus - pool record of $ 18.8 billion , leaving the CEO to find a balance between motivating his employees and sidestepping more public angst , said one source .
Goldman has endured a withering barrage of negative press reports over the past few months over its uncanny ability to make mountains of money both in good times and in bad .
A Rolling Stone article referred to the firm as “ a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity . ”
Another article in New York magazine suggested that Goldman might have benefited from Uncle Sam ’s rescue of giant insurer American International Group .
Goldman accepted $ 10 billion in government rescue funds to help it stay afloat last year as the credit crisis roiled the entire market .
The bank , however , bounced back sooner than its rivals , leading some observers to think the bank leveraged its government subsidies to churn out bigger profits .

Al - Qaeda is in its worst financial state for years , the US says Al - Qaeda is in its worst financial state for many years while the Taliban 's funding is flourishing , according to the US Treasury .
Senior Treasury official David Cohen said al - Qaeda had made several appeals for funds already this year .
The influence of the network - damaged by US efforts to choke funding - is waning , he said .
The Taliban , meanwhile , are in better financial shape , bolstered by Afghanistan 's booming trade in drugs .
According to Mr Cohen , the al - Qaeda leadership has already warned that a lack of funds was hurting the group 's recruitment and training efforts .
ANALYSIS Gordon Corera , BBC Security Correspondent
After 9/11 much emphasis was placed on dealing with terrorist finance , since it was something tangible that governments could try to tackle and was far easier than the bigger challenge of dealing with the ideology that sustains terrorism .
But do groups like al - Qaeda need money ?
Terrorist attacks are not in themselves expensive .
Estimates vary but 9/11 might have cost around half a million dollars , the 2004 Madrid bombings $ 10,000 and the London attacks of 7 July 2005 only a few thousand .
However , al - Qaeda does need resources to operate effectively - for instance its leaders will be paying off local villagers and tribes to ensure their location is not revealed .
So restricting the money flow can make it harder for them to operate .
" We assess that al - Qaeda is in its weakest financial condition in several years and that , as a result , its influence is waning , " Mr Cohen said from Washington .
But he added that as the organisation had multiple donors who were " ready , willing and able to contribute " the situation could be rapidly reversed .
However , the assistant secretary for terrorist financing said that the Taliban were in a better financial position , despite efforts to control the movement 's cash supply .
The US administration 's Special Envoy to Afghanistan , Richard Holbrooke , has said that the Taliban get most of their funding from private benefactors in the Gulf .
The many sources of funding for the Taliban make it more difficult to intercept and interrupt money flows , Mr Cohen said .
He also noted a trend in militant organisations turning to criminal activities to finance themselves .
Hezbollah , he alleged , is involved in making and selling illegal copies of music and computer software , as well as cigarette smuggling .

100 protesters assembled outside the BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast on Thursday 15th October to show their opposition to the BBC ’s decision to invite Nick Griffin onto Question Time .
A number of BNP supporters showed up in an attempt to intimidate protesters but failed .
The protest drowned out the BNP supporters with chants of “ Nazis ’s OUT ! ”
Paddy Meehan from Youth Against Racism said :
“ The protest showed people ’s anger against the BNP being gifted the opportunity to stoke up racist division on Question Time .
This is in contrast to the complete black out of our protest by the BBC .
The BBC seems more interested in ratings than the effects of their actions .
This follows the BBC ’s decision earlier this year which prevented YAR representatives announcing a protest attacks on Romanian families .
“ The protest was a success as it shone the spotlight on the BBC and by drawing out BNP supporters exposing them for what they are – thugs who have no interest in debates .
“ We are determined to increase pressure on the BBC to withdraw the invitation to the BNP to participate on Question Time . ”

Both of these gentlemen have written excellent Rock - Paper - Scissors players that dominated their respective categories .
The field was very strong , but Greenberg clearly demonstrated that it was a cut above the rest .
MemBot finished a remarkable fourth overall , behind Doug 's main entry , MEMinator , and in a virtual tie with last year 's champion , Iocaine Powder by Dan Egnor .
Doug also wrote LittleMemBot , which is only nine C statements long , but still would have won the mini- bot competition !
In the match - play component of the competition the top ten finishers were all competitive , with Greenberg and MEMinator tying for highest honours .
That result was overturned in the " Best of the Best " series , as TinyMetaDave by David Ozenne and Land War in Asia by Jeff Wilkinson eventually rose to the top , against progressively stronger opposition .
TinyMetaDave was another entry in the surprisingly tough mini- bot category ( 40 statements or less ) .
The round - robin event was n't as close , with Greenberg winning by an impressive margin , ahead of General Predictor by Don Beal .
Greenberg 's decisive victories against certain opponents , and overall aggregate score , make it clear that it is the best RoShamBo program to date .
Several thousand Swiss - system tournaments were also conducted to compute numerical ratings , like those in chess , using a program provided by Michael Gherrity for this purpose .
Although emphasizing match - play strength rather than margin of victory , Greenberg again emerged as the highest rated player .
Eight programs have now achieved master status .
On average , the Second International RoShamBo Programming Competition produced much stronger programs than the first .
For instance , improved versions of MegaHAL and Russrocker4 , which finished 3rd and 4th in the first contest , were relegated to 19th and 22nd in this year 's event ; and Roshambot_Off dropped from 9th place into the bottom half of the crosstable .
This is a natural progression , of course , since this year 's contestants had the advantage of a strong test suite , comprised of last year 's best programs .
Statistics vs Direct History
To date , two major approaches have been used to produce strong RoShamBo players : purely statistical techniques , and the " direct history " method .
The statistical approach , which can be thought of as generalized pattern matching , is intuitive and popular .
Programs based on this method include MegaHAL and Simple Predictor .
In contrast , " history bots " like Iocaine Powder and Phasenbott search for specific patterns , matching the current context with the best fit occurring previously in the match .
They also encorporate the notion of " Sicilian reasoning " ( i.e. the six levels of meta - reasoning for any particular prediction method ) .
This was very successful , and they easily outdistanced the other competitors in the first contest .
Naturally , many of the entries in the second contest were modeled on Iocaine Powder .
Somewhat surprisingly , Dan Egnor 's original program still finished third overall , despite the fact that everyone had access to documented source code , plus a nice description of the underlying ideas .
Trying to beat Iocaine Powder is a daunting task , and many people did not enter because of the difficulty of writing a competitive bot .
In fact , there was only a modest increase in the total number of entries for this year 's contest , despite a much broader exposure ( there were over 20000 visitors to the website after an announcement on SlashDot ) .
The presense of a strong champion , and the realization that the problem is not trivial , probably discouraged dozens of would - be participants .
Of course , it was not necessary to defeat Iocaine Powder directly ( it turned out to be possible to win by a small margin , but that alone is not sufficient to ensure a high finish ) .
It is much more important for a program to be more successful against the rest of the field .
This was n't a minor challenge either , and the authors who succeeded can be proud of their accomplishment .
Several participants read Dan Egnor 's description of " Sicilian reasoning " , and incorporated that into their own programs .
But ironically , this may not be the main strength of Iocaine Powder .
Less appreciated , but at least as important , is the direct history algorithm which provides a powerful predictor as a foundation .
To fully understand this aspect of the program , one must dissect and analyze the actual code .
The most obvious " direct descendant " of Iocaine Powder was Greenberg .
Andrzej Nagorko clearly understood the algorithm at its lowest level , and constructed an improved version using a number of new ideas .
This is not easy , as the embellishments must be fully integrated , rather than just added piece by piece .
( This point is clearly demonstrated by Michael Callahan 's meta- program Concat , discussed below ) .
Doug Meserve developed a new history matching method that was the basis of MEMinator , which finished second overall , and MemBot , which won the mini- bot competition .
The technique , which he calls " associative memory " , is a faster and more compact method for specific pattern matching .
In fact , a toy version called LittleMemBot , which does not use " Sicilian reasoning " and is only nine C statements long , still would have won the mini- bot competition in MemBot 's place !
This very elegant procedure will be discussed in more detail later .
Before the competition , one might have speculated that the given methods of direct history and meta- reasoning would be difficult to improve .
That suggests that the most significant improvements would come from better statistical analysis ( which can always be refined further ) .
Don Beal 's General Predictor was a healthy step in that direction .
It was written immediately after the first competition , and played on par with Iocaine Powder despite being purely statistical in its approach .
This is an intriguing result , and suggests that future RoShamBo players should not neglect this aspect of good strategy .
Nevertheless , the primary reason for the success of Greenberg and MemBot were improvements to the direct history approach .
It seems that there is room for future improvement in this form of analysis as well .
It should be feasible to overtake the new champions by synthesizing the best of both worlds , but that will likely be an even tougher chore than it was to outperform Iocaine Powder .
The magnitude of improvement may also decrease , so we may be approaching a point of diminishing returns in the strength of computer RoShamBo players .
Bigger is not better !
The RoShamBo programming competition is a contest of algorithms .
The best ideas have been expressed with short , elegant implementations .
While a sophisticated algorithm will generally outperform a simplistic one , the best players have all been written with striking economy and efficiency .
In this year 's contest , several authors wrote a smaller version of their submission , or a second entry to qualify for the mini- bot side competition .
In a number of cases , the smaller program performed comparably , or sometimes even better than the full - sized version .
Specific examples include Mini LZ
Bot vs LZ
Bot ( 26th , 25th ) , El vs Newton ( 49th , 59th ) , and Henny vs Littlestone ( 35th , 48th ) .
MEMinator was the fourth largest program in the tournament , but it outperformed its predecessor , MemBot , by only a small margin ( albeit an important difference in the final result ) .
Another good RoShamBo player , finishing tenth in two exhibition events , was NeuroHog , by game designer Frank Nestel .
This program is a complex composition of ideas , starting as a neural net and later evolving to encorporate pattern recognition , online learning , and adaptive parameter optimization .
It is over 700 lines , and pushes the limits of time and memory utilization .
Unfortunately , added complexity often carries hidden costs , and a sporadic memory overwrite error caused occasional segmentation faults .
We failed to track down the bug despite numerous attempts , and it had to be relegated to the unofficial events .
The exhibition program Concat weighs in at over 3000 lines , including copies of selected bots from the first test suite .
It did well , but not nearly as well as one might have expected , given the nature of this meta - program ( more on this later ) .
However , the grand champion of oversized programs was unquestionably Bitlbot , produced by a trio of computing science graduate students in Bristol , England : Nigel Jewell , Chris Setchell , and Jackson Pope .
They built a large neural network , and packaged it up in a submission that was more than 22000 lines in length , with over 88000 commas and 1600 C statements , and requiring more than 1.2 megabytes of disk storage .
While predominantly filled with large tables of numbers , the sheer mass of this program exceeded all other submissions from the first and second competitions combined .
Unfortunately ( or fortunately , depending how you look at it : ) , Bitlbot did not qualify because it required twice the allotted time on average .
In an exhibition event , it was an above average player , but did not rank among the top contenders , finishing 29th in points and 24th in match - play .
I expect these three authors are quite knowledgeble about the construction of neural nets , but it may not be a particularly viable technique for computer RoShamBo players .
At the opposite end of the scale were the top mini-bots : MemBot , LittleMemBot , TinyMetaDave , Black Box , SonOfPsychoRock , and AbRisiF , all under 40 C statements in length .
Add to that list Doug Meserve 's latest creation , TinyMemBot which is only five C statements , and may be stronger than LittleMemBot , at least in match - play .
But the winner in the " most for the least " category is the very cute one - liner called , appropriately , Henny , by Johannes Fuernkranz :
int henny ( ) { return ((*opp_history?opp_history[random ( ) %*opp_history +1]+1:random ( ) )
%3 ) ; }
This is a solid positive expectation RoShamBo player , in both point collection and match - play .
It narrowly missed the cut for the top 16 in the " Best of the Best " series , and might have gone much further with a bit of luck .
What it does is left as an exercise to the reader .
Programs and Authors
Last week I testified before the House Financial Services Committee in support of HR 1207 , the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009 .
Speaking on behalf of HR 1207 is particularly tricky because ( 1 ) what the Fed might be up to is entirely speculative , and thus can hardly be admitted into testimony ; and ( 2 ) the bill is not opposed to the Fed per se , so arguments about the Fed ’s performance as an economic stabilizer are also out of bounds ( unless a congressman happens to raise them ) .
Thus when the opposition argues that the Fed needs to maintain its secrecy in order to be able to keep up the super job it ’s been doing , it would be considered “ political ” to argue that the Fed ’s record has in fact been terrible .
I eventually had to do so anyway , since there was no other way to answer some of the congressmen ’s questions .
But you see how delicate it is .
The most contentious moment for me came right at the beginning , when Congressman Mel Watt ( D - NC ) demanded to know if I supported a “ policy audit ” or a “ numbers audit . ”
I was caught off guard because I could n’t tell if he was asking for my personal opinion of what would be better or if he was seeking clarification of the meaning of HR 1207 , which was presumably the point of the hearing .
If the latter , I did n’t understand why he could n’t simply have asked Dr. Paul this question sometime over the past seven months , the bill having been introduced on February 26 .
What I was trying to say , and I think at least the first part came through before being cut off multiple times , was this : because the Fed , unlike other entities subject to audit , is a creation of Congress exercising a government - granted monopoly privilege , an audit of such an institution will need to disclose more information than we would need ( or have a right to ) from a normal firm .
But although we would like to see documentation of Fed meetings made available more promptly , and it would be nice to know the rationales for some of the Fed ’s more inscrutable decisions , the purpose of the audit would not be to substitute the judgment of Congress for that of the Fed in the execution of monetary policy .
I do n’t see how that could be summed up in a two - word answer .
And any two - word answer I did give , I could tell from Congressman Watt ’s demeanor , would be followed by a harangue that would use up the rest of his time .
( The witness does not have a separate allotment of time in which to answer ; the congressman has five minutes , and any answer the witness is permitted to give is included in that five minutes . )
Congressman
Watt chose to take my preface as an evasion , and then dismissed me for giving too “ philosophical ” an answer .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details ) Congressman Ron Paul then asked me about whether secrecy or transparency was better for the markets .
A good question .
The Fed is trying to argue that transparency would spook the markets and create debilitating uncertainty .
But is n’t the opposite in fact the case ?
The more people know what the Fed is doing , the better foundation they have for making sound decisions .
Secrecy , on the other hand , encourages potentially damaging rumors and speculation as people try to figure out what ’s really going on .
Dr. Paul further asked about the historical significance of the hearing , to which I replied that the hearing was indeed historic , given how successful the Fed has been since 1913 in keeping itself out of the spotlight .
Congressmen in the past who ranked higher on the committee than Dr. Paul had tried numerous times without success to bring similar bills to a hearing .
In my opening remarks I added to my written statement , which I was n’t strictly reading , a phrase for which Barney Frank ( D - MA ) would take me to task .
In my written statement , I noted that the Fed is indeed independent in the sense that it can make trillions of dollars available to unknown friends on unknown terms .
I then wrote that I could n’t imagine any self - respecting American hesitating for a moment to challenge that kind of independence .
In my oral remarks , after “ self - respecting American ” I added the words “ who is n’t bought and paid for . ”
Note that I was n’t saying that anyone who opposes HR 1207 is necessarily in the pay of anyone .
I was suggesting that people who thought it was just fine for the Fed to have such extraordinary discretionary powers might have a material interest at stake in the question .
As surely true as those words are , whether I should have said them is obviously debatable .
But Barney Frank ’s shocked and indignant reply was still a bit over the top .
Who is bought and paid for , he demanded to know .
Well , how about the firms on the receiving end of Fed largesse , for one ?
How many of those oppose this kind of Fed independence ( and how many support 1207 ) ?
I did n’t want to get into this particular subject , but I mentioned the work of Professor Lawrence H. White of George Mason University , who has shown the economics profession to be completely in thrall to the Fed — what with millions of dollars in research grants ( one of the points I made to Congressman Frank ) and countless other levers of influence .
( See his [ .pdf ] article “ The Federal Reserve ’s Influence on Research in Monetary Economics . ”
You might also note the more recent article on the Huffington Post , “ Priceless : How the Federal Reserve Bought the Economics Profession , ” making the same point . )
When we read about monetary economists urging the maintenance of Fed “ independence , ” therefore , surely it ’s not unreasonable to bear these factors in mind .
Yet Congressman
Watt dutifully inserted into the record their absurd warnings about inflation fears if 1207 should pass .
Now I ’m told a few people are concerned about these semi-hostile exchanges ( initiated by the congressmen , not by me ) with a couple members of the committee .
Naturally one wants to avoid hostile exchanges when possible , and I do not claim infallibility in my choice of words .
But it is delusional to think the point of these hearings is to persuade congressmen .
Everyone knows the hearings are of symbolic significance only .
Their political effect has nothing to do with persuading congressmen , who have already made up their minds and are obviously not going to change them because of one person ’s six - word turn of phrase at a hearing .
If they have any political effect at all , it involves persuading the general public , if indeed the general public sees footage from the hearing .
I hardly think it a stretch for me to suggest that the people who most wish to preserve the Fed ’s “ independence ” to shovel money to well - placed firms would be those who stand to lose the most if that power were curtailed .
And I rather doubt the American public would be quite as shocked and offended by this common - sense observation as Barney Frank claimed to be .
Meltdown : A Free - Marke ...
Thomas E. Woods Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 20.00 ( as of 02:20 EST - Details )
Another thing is that I can’t answer questions I ’m not asked .
A critic might say I should have stuck more closely to the pure question of the audit .
Well , that ’s exactly what my opening statement was about .
My opening statement had nothing to do with whether the Fed was doing a good or a poor job .
But after that point , all I can do is answer questions I ’m asked .
If I ’m asked about whether I think the Fed is contributing to our economic problems , a question I got several times , I have to answer even though the question does not directly pertain to the audit .
Likewise , it would have been nice to make the point that we want HR 1207 to be a stand - alone bill , rather than being absorbed into a larger regulatory reform package .
For pedagogical reasons alone , it would be good for the country to see the Fed being discussed as a separate issue , and it would be good to know which congressmen favor Fed transparency and which do not .
But none of the congressmen gave me the opportunity to address that issue , and there is extremely limited time to answer questions as it is .
Moreover , it ’s not even clear that such a clearly political question is an appropriate one for a witness to address .
The rest of the hearing was entirely friendly .
Congressman Ed Royce ( R - CA ) , who introduced himself to me afterward , mentioned Ludwig von Mises and the Austrian theory of the business cycle , which he had also done during his questioning of the Fed ’s general counsel .
Again , that is partly off topic , but going a bit off topic is not exactly unheard of in the history of congressional hearings .
He was concerned that the Fed was both contributing to the moral hazard problem , which it obviously is , and setting interest rates too low and thereby feeding into asset bubbles .
I in turn elaborated on these points , noting that although we hear a great deal about the need for higher capital requirements , no one asks the more fundamental question : why are equity ratios so low in the financial sector ?
Why do we not have this problem elsewhere ?
And the answer , of course , is that the very existence of the Fed encourages the financial sector to rely on the central bank for its liquidity problems .
Even the International Monetary Fund noted ( in an April 2008 report I cited in the hearing ) that financial firms had become “ more complacent about their liquidity risk management systems and u2018underinsure [ d ] ’ against an adverse liquidity event , depending more heavily on central bank intervention for their liquidity problems . ”
Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) graciously held up a copy of my book Meltdown , which she said she was reading and enjoying very much .
She was likewise concerned about the extent of the Fed ’s discretionary powers , and the extent to which the taxpayer winds up on the hook for things he does n’t even know about .
I took the opportunity to clarify a point she already understood , but which is sometimes obscured in the shorthand we use : the impact on the taxpayer is really an impact on him in his capacity as a holder of dollars .
If the Fed ’s arrangements with private firms leave the central bank with lower - quality assets than before , then its ability to carry out its policies while preventing price inflation from getting out of hand is impaired .
The Fed ’s ability to sterilize its injections — i.e. , taking dollars out of one sector of the economy as it injects them into another — is compromised when there is a decline in the quality of the assets it intends to sell to withdraw the dollars .
In other words , it can still inject dollars , but it ’s now harder to remove them ( since its assets no longer fetch as many dollars ) .
The hearing was symbolically very significant .
It was an extremely unusual thing to see so many members of Congress critical of the Fed , and generally for the right reasons .
Barney Frank opened the hearing with an exceedingly gracious statement about Ron Paul and his persistent efforts over the years to bring about legislation of this kind .
The whole thing was gratifying to observe , both for Ron Paul and , I dare say , for America .

From FreeThoughtPedia
The Free Money Movement is a campaign to encourage people living in the United States to cross out the word ' god ' on their currency , as a protest against the invocation and promotion of supernatural beliefs on public money , and as a reminder for the need for the secular society that was originally intended by the founding fathers .
The Free Money Movement ( FMM ) officially started on August 3rd , 2009 on reddit.com .
The original post was a picture of $ 525 USD with the word " GOD " crossed out of the motto " IN GOD WE TRUST " in sharpie submitted by the user Krizutch ( which was in response to an earlier post by the user jeremyflavored who highlighted a bill he had found in circulation with the phrase blanked out ) .
The movement was thus conceived as a form of protest to be used to raise awareness about atheists and to spark a discussion about whether or not the motto is constitutional .
What is most poignant about this campaign is that it uses the very article of our offence as a means to carry our message forward directly into the hands of the general public who we wish to reach with our message .
The video has a growing fan base seen on Youtube made by user Freemoneymovement .
Though people have been doing this in protest individually for some time this is possibly the first concerted effort .
The most influential post in the original thread was made by the user col381 and is quoted below .
Free Money Movement Manifesto
Aims / Why ?
A Non-violent , non-offensive , form of social political protest .
The aim is to raise the consciousness of people that this is against everything that the founders wanted America to become .
The aim is to get people talking , stuff like this is very controversial , this is what we want .
Controversy starts discussion of the issue , discussion forces people to think about it and form an opinion about it , and eventually opinions form policy .
To raise awareness of the need for secularism
To increase awareness of intolerance against atheists - when ' innocent ' people start getting abused because they are using marked money , this will increase their awareness about how atheists are treated / perceived by society .
Usage :
Start spending more cash !
I do n't mean go out and blow your budgets , but start using your credit cards less and cash more .
Be sure to hand over bills with the marked side down ; it 's always better to avoid problems than to deal with them .
Keep a few unmarked ( larger denomination ) bills handy in case you have problems at the till , if someone does raise it say something like " man , I keep seeing that everywhere " and then feign innocence .
Do n't waste your marked bills by using them at the bank as they will only separate them out for disposal .
Spend them at places where cash is king ; bars , supermarkets , small shops , etc .
Smaller bills such as $ 20 , $ 10 , $ 5 & $ 1's are much more likely to be handed back to people as change .
Larger bills will mostly always find their way back to the banks where there is a chance the note will be taken out of circulation .
Please do n't feel tempted to write anything offensive on the bills , a simple mark through the G - word is enough .
This is a form of passive political protest , our aim is to educate and raise awareness of the importance of secularism - not to be offensive .
Awareness Tactics :
For those of you out there that write blogs , please write something about this .
For those of you that do youtube videos , please do the same .
Start threads on other atheist websites about this to get the message out to other atheists
If you are a member of an atheist group , raise consciousness about this there .
We need a web site as a central focus for this and we need volunteers to help set up the site and put together the message .
Once we have a website , multiple press releases are needed to alert the media .
Guerrilla Tactics :
Write letters to your local newspaper ' complaining ' about the number of bills you keep seeing with god crossed off - pretend to be outraged , and send them photos of a marked bill as part of your letter ; newspapers just love that kind of thing .
This not only spreads the word , it increases awareness of the campaign and starts discussion about the secularisation of money ( which is the PRIMARY aim after all ) .
Do not use your real name for this .
Massive kudos awaits anyone that manages to get something printed about this and then posts it back here .
If anything does get printed , we of course need to be sure to respond in support of this .
Place comments on Christian websites about this and get them aware of the campaign ( again , pretend to be ' outraged ' by this when you do it ) .
For this campaign to spread we need controversy and our super tolerant friends the Christians can ( and will happily ) do all the hard work we need for this ( Poe 's law works both ways , let 's use this to our advantage ) .
Legality of Marking Bills
The US law that pertains to the marking of currency is stated as follows :
United States currency and coinage are governed by federal law through the U.S. Treasury Department .
Generally , it is illegal to fraudulently deface , mutilate , impair , diminish , falsify , scales or lightens any coins minted or " coined " in the United States or any foreign coins which are by law made current or are in use or circulation as money within the U.S. ( 18 U.S.C. 331 )
It is also a crime to fraudulently possess , pass , publish , sell or attempt to possess , pass , publish , sell or bring into the U.S. any such coin with knowledge that the coin has been altered , mutilated , defaced , etc. ( 18 U.S.C. 331 )
The key word here in relation to the matter of defacing currency is FRAUDULENT .
Provided that the marks do not attempt to alter the value of or render the bills useless as currency ( marks to key features such as serial numbers would constitute this ) making markings on currency is legal .
The FMM urges anybody engaging in this practice NOT to write words or otherwise damage bills , except to simply cross out the word ' god ' in the phrase " In God We Trust " where it appears .
Protesters demonstrated in the rain outside of the University of Chicago lecture hall where activists inside disrupted Olmert ’s speech , 15 October 2009 .
( Maureen Clare Murphy )
But confronting a political leader suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity cannot be viewed the same way .
The report of the UN Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict last winter , headed by Judge Richard Goldstone , found that Israel engaged in willful , widespread and wanton destruction of civilian property and infrastructure , causing deliberate suffering to the civilian population .
It found “ that the incidents and patterns of events considered in the report are the result of deliberate planning and policy decisions ” and that many may amount to “ war crimes ” and “ crimes against humanity . ”
If that proves true , then the individual with primary responsibility is Ehud Olmert , who , as prime minister and the top civilian commander of Israel ’s armed forces , was involved in virtually every aspect of planning and execution .
The killings of more than 3,000 Palestinians and Lebanese during Olmert ’s three years in office are not mere differences of opinion to be challenged with a polite question written on a pre-screened note card .
They are crimes for which Olmert is accountable before international law and public opinion .
Israel , unlike Hamas ( also accused of war crimes by Goldstone ) , completely refused to cooperate with the Goldstone Mission .
Instead of accountability , Olmert is , obscenely , traveling around the United States offering justifications for these appalling crimes , collecting large speaking fees , and being feted as a “ courageous ” statesman .
In their 20 October email to the University of Chicago community , President Robert Zimmer and Provost Thomas Rosenbaum condemned the “ disruptions ” during Olmert ’s speech .
“ Any stifling of debate , ” they wrote , “ runs counter to the primary values of the University of Chicago and to our long - standing position as an exemplar of academic freedom . ”
Was it in order to promote debate that the University insisted on pre-screening questions and imposed a recording ban for students and media ?
In the name of promoting debate , will the University now invite Hamas leader Khaled Meshal — perhaps by video link — to lecture on leadership to its students , and offer him a large honorarium ?
Can we soon expect Sudan ’s President Omar Bashir to make an appearance at Mandel Hall ?
When I and others verbally confronted Olmert , we stood for academic freedom , human rights , and justice , especially for hundreds of thousands of students deprived of those same rights by Olmert ’s actions .
During Israel ’s attack on Gaza last winter , schools and universities were among the primary targets .
According to the Goldstone report , Israeli military attacks destroyed or damaged at least 280 schools and kindergartens .
In total , 164 pupils and 12 teachers were killed , and 454 pupils and five teachers injured .
After the bombing , Olmert and Israel continued their attack on academic freedom , blocking educational supplies from reaching Gaza .
Textbooks , notebooks , stationery and computers are among the forbidden items .
In September , Chris Gunness , spokesman for UNRWA , the UN agency for Palestine refugees , publicly appealed to Israel to lift its ban on books and other supplies from reaching Gaza ’s traumatized students .
Israel destroyed buildings at the Islamic University and other universities .
According to the Goldstone report , these “ were civilian , educational buildings and the Mission did not find any information about their use as a military facility or their contribution to a military effort that might have made them a legitimate target in the eyes of the Israeli armed forces . ”
Gaza ’s university students — 60 percent of them women — study all the things that students do at the University of Chicago .
Their motivations , aspirations , and abilities are just as high , but their lives are suffocated by unimaginable violence , trauma , and Israel ’s blockade , itself a war crime .
Olmert is the person who ordered these acts and must be held accountable .
Crimes against humanity are defined as “ crimes that shock the conscience . ”
When the institutions with the moral and legal responsibility to punish and prevent the crimes choose complicit silence — or , worse , harbor a suspected war criminal , already on trial for corruption in Israel , and present him to students as a paragon of “ leadership ” — then disobedience , if that is what it takes to break the silence , is an ethical duty .
Instead of condemning them , the University should be proud that its students were among those who had the courage to stand up .
For the first time in recorded history , an Israeli prime minister was publicly confronted with the names of his victims .
It was a symbolic crack in the wall of impunity and a foretaste of the public justice victims have a right to receive when Olmert is tried in a court of law .

Obese people and public - health scolds have one thing in common : a compulsion to keep behaving in a way that does not produce helpful results .
The obese tend to keep eating too much and exercising too little regardless of what others say .
Disciples of maternal government persist in meddling in individual choices whether it works or not .
One of the pet campaigns of the second group , ostensibly on behalf of the first one , is forcing restaurants to provide accessible nutritional information about their offerings .
In 2008 , the city of New York passed a law mandating calorie data on fast - foot menus and menu boards , on the assumption that better knowledge would make for healthier eating .
" Presenting nutrition information on restaurant menus empowers consumers and influences food choices , " the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene promised .
Let people know that a McDonald 's Angus Deluxe is larded with enough calories to sustain a family of four for a month , the thinking went , and they 'll gravitate to something more slimming .
But the early evidence suggests that people do n't choose high - calorie fast foods because they do n't know any better .
They choose them because they like them , and they do n't really care if others disapprove .
That 's the implication of a new study in the journal Health Affairs conducted by researchers at New York University and Yale University .
They asked questions of and collected receipts from customers at McDonald's , Burger King , Wendy's , and KFC outlets in the city before and after the law took effect , and did the same in Newark , N.J. , which has no such law .
The impact of the ordinance did n't quite fulfill those fond expectations .
To start with , only about half of the fast - food customers in New York said they noticed all this helpful information , and only a quarter of the patrons in this group said it made any difference in their choices .
Even those who said the data affected their decisions were fooling themselves .
Before the law was implemented , the average customer in New York bought items containing 825 calories .
Afterward , the figure was 846 .
In Newark , during the same time period , the typical patron went from 823 calories to 826 .
In neither place did diners cut back on saturated fat , sodium , or sugar .
The labeling law was the moral equivalent of the Chicago Olympics bid — lots of hype to little effect .
How to explain this outcome ?
" New York City health officials said that because the study was conducted immediately after the law took effect , it might not have captured changes in people 's behavior that have taken hold more gradually , " reported The New York Times .
Nice try .
The authors of the study considered that possibility and gave it little credence .
" Consumers in our sample reported frequenting fast - food restaurants approximately five times per week , " they noted , " which indicates that they likely had repeated experiences with calorie labels before our follow - up data collection . "
Moreover , said the report , " It is not clear whether continued extensive exposure beyond a month would have made consumers more or less likely to respond to labels . "
Maybe the information would sink in over time .
Or maybe customers who noticed at first would soon tune it out .
But it 's not hard to find likely reasons for the failure of this approach .
One is that the sort of people who make a habit of eating at Burger King generally do n't put a high priority on a sound diet .
Giving them nutritional information is a bit like recruiting for Greenpeace at a rifle range — a doomed enterprise .
The people who are most likely to act on fast - food nutritional information are the ones least likely to encounter it , because they 're packing a lunch or eating at home .
Rebecca Krukowski , an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences , says another factor may be at work — what might be called the coals - to - Newcastle problem .
" Oftentimes , when people are interested , they already have the information , " she told me .
" Maybe they 've already been through a weight - control program and become well - educated about nutrition and have become pretty good at estimating calories . "
So the menu labels tell them little they did n't already know .
Meanwhile , it seems , the people who lack the needed information generally prefer to ignore it when it 's foisted on them .
Architects of intrusive policies , like those at the New York health department , may wonder how on earth someone could be given valuable information and not use it to make better decisions .
But we could ask the same thing about them .

Hi guys ,
My story is n’t necessarily about discrimination , but I do feel like I have to put the whole thing out in the universe , and in writing it down , maybe it will help to relieve some of my anxiety about what is to come .
I should start from the beginning .
I have always fluctuated in weight , in a range of 50 pounds or so .
When I was 16 , I got pregnant , which caused me to become extremely sick , way beyond the scope of normal .
I lost about 30 pounds in the three months that I was pregnant , which brought me down to about 110 .
A lot of tests were run , and they ended up telling me that it was a “ fluke ” that I got pregnant in the first place , that I would n’t be able to carry to term , and that if I ever got pregnant again , which would be highly unlikely , it would almost certainly end in a miscarriage .
All I remember them telling me at the time for the reason is that my uterus is tipped - if there was another cause , they did n’t tell me or I do n’t remember .
The reason for this portion of the story is because I stayed really sick for several months after .
My doctor got frustrated with not finding out the cause and told me that I was making it up .
Three years later , when I was 19 , my weight was up ( at 165 or so , gained over about 2 years ) and I had skipped my period for an entire year .
I went to the same doctor and he put me on Depo - Provera , and that was the last time I went to see a doctor .
It was shortly after that that I started getting man - like facial hair on my chin .
I am 32 now .
I lost that weight when I was 20 over a three or four month period , which brought me back down to about 110 .
I stayed steady for about a year and a half and then I gained weight over the following two years , maxing at 185 .
I did n’t keep that top weight for more than 6 months or so , and I lost it over a few months leveled out in a 135 - 145 range for the next 6 years .
That puts me a few months before my 30th birthday .
Out of nowhere , I gained 50 pounds in a month and a half and another 30 pounds over the next month and a half , for a total gain of 80 pounds in three months !
I immediately lost about 20 of it over 2 weeks or so , bringing me to hover around 200 .
I jumped from 140 pounds to 220 pounds , and I was devastated .
I literally wore a pair of jeans , did laundry , and could n’t pull them up past my thighs the next day .
I did n’t have insurance , and I have an irrational distrust of the medical field , so I did n’t go to the doctor right away .
Several things have happened over the last two years that made this time so much different than any before .
First , I still weigh 200 - 210 .
I have never gained that much , or gained that fast , or kept it on for this long .
My ankles started swelling like crazy , and then I got a kidney stone ( two , I think ) .
I still did n’t go .
I have developed sores on my legs and skin lesions that do n’t heal ( my saving grace is that people ca n’t see it ) .
Several months ago , My pinky and ring finger on my left hand went numb .
It stayed that way for a while , and the sensation is still a little bit less in those fingers than the rest of them .
A few months ago , I woke up and went to get coffee and I almost dropped my cup because my hands just kind of decided that gripping things was not going to work .
That lasted for about two weeks , and my hands were so swollen and sore I felt like an invalid .
I ’m sure there are things that I am forgetting .
I recently signed up for insurance through my job , and I finally went to the doctor a couple of weeks ago - an internist .
He did end up listening to me , but I had to convince him that I was n’t just a fast food eating fat girl whining about being fat and not wanting to diet .
He ran blood tests for thyroid , diabetes , and cholesterol , and had me schedule an ultrasound .
My thyroid levels were slightly elevated , and my blood sugar and cholesterol were both on the high side of a normal range .
They called me this week and said that the ultrasound did n’t show any ovarian cysts , but they need me to come back in right away to discuss the results .
When I was there for my initial appointment , he said that he thought I probably have hypothyroid and polycystic ovarian syndrome , which is what I have thought for years .
He said he wanted to rule them in or out before he tested for Cushing ’s .
I ’m kind of scared .
Not of cancer or a tumor or dying - I can accept that .
I am scared of being sick for the rest of my life .
Of having to possibly come to terms with the fact that I just turned 32 , do n’t have any children , and might have to have a hysterectomy .
And , the vainest of them all , of staying fat permanently .
Through the years and my personal experience , though , I have noticed that the way people treat women is directly linked to their weight bracket .
Interestingly , it is n’t the men that treat you like garbage .
It is the women that judge you and talk about you and exclude you .
It does n’t really matter that you * used * to be a pretty girl .
What matters is that you are now the fat girl .
That is my story up to now .
I have an appointment scheduled for Tuesday , so I guess it is a waiting game .
It does n’t really matter to me if you publish it or not .
I really just needed to release it , because it is destroying me .

iSmashPhone : 15 Apps Rendered Obsolete By The New iPhone 3GS
When independent software developers create utilities , add - ons , or applications that fill a hole in their platform vendor ’s offering , they like to think that they ’re doing the vendor a huge favor .
Oh , look , the iPhone does n’t have cut and paste , they say .
Business opportunity !
They might imagine that this business will be around forever .
Some of them even like to daydream about the platform vendor buying them up .
Payday !
The trouble is that only a tiny percentage of iPhone users are going to pay for that little cut and paste application .
With any kind of add - on , selling to 1 % of the platform is a huge success .
For Apple , that ’s a problem .
That means that the cut and paste problem is n’t solved for 99 % of their customers .
They will solve it , if it ’s really a problem .
And you ’ll be out of business .
Filling little gaps in another company ’s product lineup is snatching nickels from the path of an oncoming steam roller .
A good platform always has opportunities for applications that are n’t just gap - fillers .
These are the kind of application that the vendor is unlikely ever to consider a core feature , usually because it ’s vertical — it ’s not something everyone is going to want .
There is exactly zero chance that Apple is ever going to add a feature to the iPhone for dentists .
Zero .
NEW DELHI , India — Days before President Barack Obama told the United Nations that he hoped to push through a universal treaty to ban all nuclear weapons testing by the end of 2010 , a top Indian scientist threw New Delhi 's security establishment for an atomic loop .
Kasturiranga Santhanam , the coordinator of India 's 1998 nuclear tests , went public with allegations that India 's much heralded Pokhran II test of a thermonuclear bomb 11 years ago was actually a fizzle .
“ We are totally naked vis -a - vis China , which has an inventory of 200 nuclear bombs , the vast majority of which are giant H - bombs of power equal to three million tons of TNT , ” Santhanam told reporters in New Delhi this week .
Naturally , the bizarre exercise in reverse brinkmanship ( “ About that bomb we told you we have ... ” ) did not go down well .
India 's 1998 demonstration of thermonuclear capability — a
fusion - based , Hydrogen bomb — was the cause of great celebration in a country still fighting for a voice in global affairs and sandwiched between a belligerent , hereditary enemy in Pakistan and a frightening potential future adversary in China .
By calling its success into question , scientist K. Santhanam , who was director of test site preparations for Pokhran II , shook the country 's confidence in its nuclear deterrent at a moment when the long , frustrating peace process with Pakistan seems as futile as ever .
But for the rest of the world , Santhanam 's bombshell amounts to a colossal preemptive strike against Obama 's push for the nations of the world to sign a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) by the end of next year — not to mention a potentially debilitating assault on last year 's Indo - U.S. civilian nuclear agreement .
Already , opponents to the deal have begun echoing Santhanam 's call for further testing of India 's thermonuclear arsenal , and the lingering doubts about the efficacy of the country 's bombs looks likely to tie Manmohan Singh 's somewhat fragile coalition government 's hands when the time comes to sign Obama 's CTBT .
“ We need to test again ; it 's just a question of when , not if , ” said Bharat Karnad , a former member of India 's National Security Advisory board and part of the group that drafted India 's nuclear doctrine .
Of course , that may not have been true if Santhanam had kept his mouth shut .
Since nuclear weapons are supposedly never to be used , whether the rest of the world believes they will work is more important than whether they actually do .
And that 's the simple fact that has flummoxed India 's foreign policy experts , who are scratching their heads and asking , “ Why now ? ”
After all , Santhanam kept mum during the vociferous , three - year debate over the Indo - U.S. nuclear deal , which also mandates an end to testing .
“ [ Now ] the whole thing becomes unnecessarily subject to controversy and doubts and questions , and the public loses confidence in what the government is saying about the nuclear deterrent — which is totally pointless , ” said Kanwal Sibal , who was foreign secretary in the BJP - led government that proceeded Singh 's Congress - led coalition .
The Singh government subscribes to the theory that a “ minimum deterrent ” is sufficient to protect India from its nuclear neighbors , and even though that theory was predicated on the existence of a small number of effective thermonuclear missiles , most observers believe that Singh will not begin preparations of any kind for a resumption of testing .
The big question is whether he can sell the country on agreeing to Obama 's full - fledged moratorium .
Some say yes , others no .
“ I can not see India testing at all , unless the U.S. itself tests or China tests or Pakistan tests , ” Sibal said .
“ Unilaterally testing makes no sense to me .
The cost would be intolerable , not merely in terms of the Indo - U.S. nuclear deal , but we'd be isolated internationally .
We'd be seen as wrecking the international nonproliferation regime for no good reason . ”
“ Manmohan Singh may not be inclined to test during his tenure , which is another four years , ” Karnad said .
“ But the idea is to nevertheless keep the testing option open . ”
The implications of both testing and not testing are murky .
Even if India never tests another nuke , Santhanam 's accusation that Pokhran II was a fizzle is n't as damning as it might sound .
For nuclear scientists , fizzle is a technical term for detonations that yield 30 percent less concussive force than expected , and Santhanam himself acknowledges that India 's thermonuclear device yielded an explosion equivalent to 15 to 20 kilotons of TNT — the rub is that it was intended to generate 45 kilotons .
The minimum deterrent lobby argues that 's powerful enough to dissuade Pakistan from getting any crazy ideas , and even if India 's nukes pale in comparison with China 's , they 're still devastating enough to give any rational adversary pause .
But for others , the niggling fear remains that doubts about the capacity of India 's nuclear bombs make it all the more likely that one day it may have to use them .
On the other hand , the global reaction to a new test is equally unpredictable .
It would almost certainly spell an end to the Indo - U.S. agreement on civilian nuclear projects , and likely put its power projects with countries like France and Russia in jeopardy .
“ I would expect that India would be placed in an international penalty box for some period of time and would be blamed for ' scuttling ' efforts to bring a CTBT into force , ” Henry Sokolski , executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington , confirmed in an email interview .
The last time , India stayed in the penalty box for a decade , but U.S. sanctions prohibiting economic and military aid were waived after only a year .
The hawks in India 's security establishment are growing more firm in their belief that the U.S. and Europe will not be comfortable isolating India from the global community for long this time , either , because it has emerged as Asia 's only credible counterweight to China 's growing military and economic might .
“ They might thrash about a bit and sound off a bit , but what option do they have ? ” Karnad said .
Apart from the paranoid , what developing nations hope to gain from their nuclear weapons is not so much security — though the contrasting treatment that the U.S. meted out to Iraq and Pakistan shows the value of deterrence in that realm — but a seat at the table .
And that means Obama and the West have one big bargaining chip left to bring India into the nonproliferation fold :
Sign the CTBT , get a seat on the U.N. Security Council .

POLAND’S president appears poised to sign the Lisbon Treaty in the near future , but his Czech counterpart insists he will resist mounting international pressure on him to ratify the document .
After a close adviser to Poland ’s Lech Kaczynski said on Monday that he was in no hurry to initial a treaty for which he has little enthusiasm , another leading aide announced yesterday that he would sign the charter in the coming days .
“ There is no hidden agenda , a date just has n’t been fixed .
The right moment and the right context must be picked for the signature , ” said Mariusz Handzlik , under - secretary of state in the president ’s office .
“ It is a matter of days , not weeks , ” he said , adding that “ on Wednesday it is impossible ” .
Polish newspaper daily Dziennik cited another presidential aide , Pawel Wypych , as saying Mr Kaczynski would put pen to paper tonight after visiting Romania .
Czech president Václav Klaus remains the strongest hold - out against the treaty , and shows no inclination to sign the document despite the urging of the Czech prime minister and other EU leaders .
Mr Klaus insists that he must wait for the Czech constitutional court to rule on a complaint against the treaty lodged by his eurosceptic allies , who share his belief that the treaty will transfer too much power from national governments to non-elected officials in Brussels .
“ I could not sign the treaty even if I wanted to very much , ” Mr Klaus said during a visit to Albania , a country that fears its EU accession hopes could be dashed if the treaty is not ratified .
He said advocates of the treaty were spreading the “ untruth ” that EU expansion would grind to a halt without it .
“ In this respect nothing stands and falls with the Lisbon Treaty , ” he said .
Why I loathe feminism ... and believe it will ultimately destroy the family
ERIN PIZZEY set up the world 's first refuge for battered women in 1971 - and went on to establish an international movement for victims of domestic violence .
But what she has never made public before is that her own childhood was scarred by the shocking cruelty of both her parents .
Here , for the first time , she tells the full harrowing story - and how it led her to a surprising , but deeply felt , conclusion ...
Tortured childhood : Erin Pizzey was abused by both her mother and father
Though I remember little of my earliest years , I grew up in a world of extraordinary violence .
I was born in 1939 in Tsingtao , China , and shortly after my family moved to Shanghai with my diplomat father , we were captured by the invading Japanese army .
It was 1942 , the war was raging and we were held under house arrest until we were exchanged for Japanese prisoners of war and put on the last boat out of China .
My father was ordered to Beirut by the diplomatic service , and we were left as refugees in Kokstad , South Africa .
From living in an enormous house with a fleet of servants and a nanny , my twin sister Rosaleen and I were suddenly at the mercy of my mother Pat 's temper .
And it was ferocious .
Having escaped the brutality of the war , we were introduced to a new brand domestic cruelty .
Indeed , my mother 's explosive temper and abusive behaviour shaped the person I later became like no other event in my life .
Thirty years later , when feminism exploded onto the scene , I was often mistaken for a supporter of the movement .
But I have never been a feminist , because , having experienced my mother 's violence , I always knew that women can be as vicious and irresponsible as men .
Emotionally abused : Baby Erin ( left ) and twin sister Rosaleen with their parents
Indeed , I would go so far as to say that the movement , which proclaimed that all men are potential rapists and batterers , was based on a lie that , if allowed to flourish , would result in the complete destruction of family life .
From the very beginning , I waged war against my mother and quickly learned to disassociate myself from the pain of her beatings .
Her words , however , stayed with me all my life .
' You are lazy , useless , and ugly , ' she would scream .
' You look like your father 's side of the family - Irish trash . '
They were vicious words that I have heard repeated over and over by mothers everywhere .
Indeed , when I later opened my refuge for battered women , 62 of the first 100 to come through the door were as abusive as the men they had left .
She was , however , right : I did look like my father , Cyril .
While my twin sister was slim and had long dark hair , and my mother 's deep blue eyes , I was fat and fair - haired , clumsy , noisy and brash .
I was only five but I knew my mother did n't like me
I was only five years old , but I knew my mother did n't like me .
And with no servants to restrain her now , she lashed out whenever she felt like it .
When we finally joined my father in a flat in Beirut , I soon realised that he was no saint either .
He would constantly scream and rage at all of us .
He was particularly consumed by jealousy .
Even though he verbally abused my mother and rarely showed her affection , he seemed compelled to follow her around like a guard dog .
If she spoke on the telephone , he grilled her until she burst into tears .
If she went out shopping , he paced the room until she got back and exploded with rage if she were more than a few minutes late .
I hated my father with all my childish heart - and was truly terrified by him .
He was 6ft 4in tall , massively built and had a huge paunch that hung over his belt .
He stared out of piggy , pale blue eyes and had a big sloppy mouth that slobbered over my lips when he kissed me .
He did n't believe in baths , which he said were ' weakening ' , and smoked tins of Players Cigarettes , which made him smell like an ashtray .
His rages were explosive and unpredictable .
Fresh - faced : Erin Pizzey , founder of the domestic violence charity Refuge , pictured here when she aged just 11
But despite his clumsy , predictable form of macho brutality - born out of his being the 17th child of a violent Irish father - it was my mother 's more emotional , verbal form of abuse that scarred me most deeply .
She indulged in a particular kind of soul murder - and it was her cruelty that , even 60 years on , still reduces me to tears and leaves me convinced that feminism is a cynical , misguided ploy .
Unfortunately , at that time , what I wanted more than anything was for my mother to love me - something I never felt she truly did .
And so , when my father was posted to Chicago , and I followed my mother to Toronto , to live with my godparents , I was initially hopeful .
I believed that without my father 's presence , she would have the time be a real mother .
But once in the bosom of this normal family , my own dysfunctional behaviour soon became apparent .
I had , it seems , already been too badly damaged by my mother 's hatred of me .
I was always in trouble at school , encouraging the other children to behave as badly as I did .
On one occasion , I was caught sitting on the doorstep giving away the money I 'd stolen from my mother 's bag .
Needless to say , my mother went berserk .
She took me upstairs and beat me with an ironing cord until the blood ran down my legs .
I showed my injuries to my teacher the next morning - but she just stared back impassively and did nothing .
Many years later , when feminists started demonising all fathers , these stark images continually reminded me of the truth - that domestic violence is not a gender issue .
She beat me until the blood ran down my legs
Shortly after the war , my father was posted to Tehran and we all went to live with him .
It was only when I saw him again that I remembered how much I hated him .
He would come home from the office , and as he put the key in the door I would freeze .
I would often hear him coughing outside the door - he was still a heavy smoker - and spitting phlegm into the flower bed .
His eyes were windows into his violent moods .
If they were narrowed and red , I knew he was in a rage and it would only be a matter of time before he erupted .
But my hatred of my father was pure and uncontaminated by any other emotions .
My feelings about my mother , however , were far more complicated .
As much as I was devastated by her hatred of me , I still genuinely strove for her love .
In fact , I had moments of great compassion for her when I saw her weeping and wailing in front of my father .
Occasionally , she fought back against his brutality .
She was only 4ft 9in , but my mother was extremely strong and her tongue was lethal .
She accused him of being an oaf and an idiot .
She called his mother a prostitute and his father a common Irish drunk .
Growing old gracefully : Erin Pizzey as she looks these days
Unsurprisingly , my brother and sister were both withdrawn and silent children .
My sister suffered from headaches , weeping eczema and mysterious days of paralysis when she was unable to get up from her bed .
To outsiders , my father was a genial , intelligent man and my mother a famous party hostess with three beautiful children and a perfect diplomatic family .
In fact , my parents were both violent , cruel people and we were all deeply damaged .
In 1949 , my father was posted back to Tien Sien , in China .
I was left with my twin sister in a boarding school - Leweston , near Sherborne in Dorset - and my brother accompanied my parents .
Very shortly after they took up their post , however , my parents were captured again - this time by the communists - and held under house arrest for three years .
Without them , I felt an abiding sense of peace and loved my holidays at St Mary 's in Uplyme , a holiday home for children whose parents were abroad .
Miss Williams , who ran the place , was the first adult that I really admired and respected .
She became my mentor .
But this idyll was shattered when I heard that my parents had been released .
I remember being called to the telephone in the convent to speak to my mother .
I had completely blotted my parents out of my life and so when I heard her Canadian accent , I just screamed down the phone .
' You 're not my mother ! '
I yelled , all too aware that the whole circus was about to start again .
When my mother first returned , to a house outside Axminster , we enjoyed an uneasy truce .
I was much taller than her now , and too big for her to batter .
Instead , she began to list my father 's faults , and the atrocities he had inflicted on us all , as if I were now her confidante .
She would tell me how much she hated him and that they never should have married .
' But I stayed for you , ' she told me .
' I stayed because I wanted you to go to a private school and enjoy a comfortable way of life . '
I took the decision that I would have to stab my father
Once again , she was unleashing her peculiar brand of emotional cruelty , and placing all the responsibility - and guilt - on me .
It was a pattern of behaviour I would witness again and again among some of the women in my refuge .
The day my father was due to join us in the new house , my mother was a nervous wreck .
She was crying and clinging on to me , demanding that I protect her .
' I do n't want him anywhere near me , ' she said .
In dysfunctional families , children , no matter how badly they are treated , will try to take on the parenting role .
For me , this still meant protecting and comforting my mother .
And so , on the night of my father 's return , I took a large carving knife from the kitchen and went up to my parents ' bedroom , which I peered into through a gap in the door .
They slept in separate , single beds and I took the extraordinary decision that I would stab him if he tried to force himself on her .
I was , on reflection , following my mother 's unspoken orders .
Remarkably , she had manipulated me to such a degree that I was now willing to murder for her .
My father certainly tried to talk his way into her bed .
Fortunately , however , he did n't become physical .
If he had , he would now be dead and my life would have turned out very differently .
In the 1950s , while I was working in Hong Kong , my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer .
I returned to our house near Axminster - and found my father unchanged .
By now , he was trying to force my mother to sign her money - she had received a sizeable inheritance from her father - over to him .
Week after week , in the local cottage hospital , she refused , and week after week , he ranted and raved at her while she writhed in pain .
I begged the nurses to stop him , but they said no one could come between a man and his wife .
At first , my mother refused to believe she was dying .
But when my father finally broke her down , and bullied her into signing the papers , her life began to ebb away in earnest .
She died on September 16 , 1958 , and my father had the body brought home and placed in the dining room .
That night , as she lay next door , we sat down to have supper at the table in the hall .
He made us stand vigil over her visibly decomposing body
After supper , my father ordered us into the dining room , where my mother 's open coffin was draped with a red cloth .
My brother , sister and I begged my father not to remove the cloth , but when we closed our eyes for a moment to say a prayer for her , we opened them to be confronted by her pale face .
I vividly remember that there was cotton wool sticking out of her nose .
Every night , we would stand vigil over my mother 's body , and every night she would be exposed to the humiliation of having her children see her visibly decomposing .
At last , six days later , my father buried her .
I left home the next day and only saw him once more - when I took his ashes to my mother 's grave in 1982 .
I only decided to talk about my traumatic childhood last week - on a BBC radio programme called The House Where I Grew Up - but I decided long ago I would not repeat the toxic lessons I learned as a child .
Instead , I would become a survivor .
Feminism , I realised , was a lie .
Women and men are both capable of extraordinary cruelty .
Indeed , the only thing a child really needs - two biological parents under one roof - was being undermined by the very ideology which claimed to speak up for women 's rights .
This country is now on the brink of serious moral collapse .
We must stop demonising men and start healing the rift that feminism has created between men and women .
Harriet Harman 's insidious and manipulative philosophy that women are always victims and men always oppressors can only continue this unspeakable cycle of violence .
And it 's our children who will suffer .
A 20th anniversary teardown of the first mobile Mac - - and some reflections on how far we 've come .
A Misunderstood Machine
On September 20th , 1989 , Apple released the Macintosh Portable , the first true mobile Mac and a much - maligned machine .
It did n’t sell well and is very rare today – not due to any particular design failure , but because the original price was a whopping $ 6,500 - $ 7,300 ( $ 11,288 to $ 12,677 in 2009 dollars ) .
It was n’t the only Mac to cost that much , but others in that price range offered top - of - the - line performance .
The Portable was both too expensive and too underpowered to catch on .
Its large size did n’t help , either .
Apple vastly improved upon the design two years later with the PowerBook 100 , the first true Mac notebook .
For now , though , it ’s time to honor the design achievements of Apple ’s first battery - powered computer .
I ’ve found there ’s no better way to do that than take it apart on my trusty workbench .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The Obama administration will impose stiff tariffs on imports of Chinese - made tires after finding that a surge of imports has disrupted the U.S. domestic market .
President Barack Obama signed an order on Friday to impose the special punitive tariffs for three years , the White House announced .
The action is the first major trade enforcement action of his presidency and comes less than two weeks before a high - profile summit of the leaders of the Group of 20 nations , including China .
It is the first time the U.S. government has imposed special " safeguard " provisions to protect a U.S. industry from Chinese competition .
" The president decided to remedy the clear disruption to the U.S. tire industry based on the facts and the law in this case , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said in a statement .
In the first year , the tariff will be 35 % , falling to 30 % in the second year and 25 % in the third year .
The tariff would be on top of the current 4 % tariff .
The tariffs will take effect in 15 days .
U.S. imports of Chinese tires have risen from 14.6 million in 2004 to 46 million last year , accounting for about one - sixth of the U.S. market .
Four U.S. tire plants have closed in the past two years , and more than 5,000 workers have lost their jobs .
The United Steelworkers union had complained to the U.S. International Trade Commission about the disruption .
The ITC had recommended a 55 % tariff .
The Chinese government and some U.S. industry groups had objected to the tariffs .
" This administration is doing what is necessary to enforce trade agreements on behalf of American workers and manufacturers , " said U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk .
" Enforcing trade laws is key to maintaining an open and free trading system . "
Kirk said China had agreed that its trading partners could impose such sanctions when it entered the World Trade Organization .
UPDATE ( at bottom ) : Cop who assaulted teen now in jail on rape charge ; shot ex-wife ’s new husband 24 times in ‘ self defense ’
For the offense of not having his shirt tucked in , 15 - year - old special needs student Marshawn Pitts was slammed into a wall of lockers and pounded repeatedly in the face by a police officer who broke the boy ’s nose and bloodied his mouth .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Dolton , Illinois teen told a local CBS affiliate that the officer was cursing at him as he complied with the order to tuck in his shirt .
Then , “ it was just like , boom ! ” he said .
The assault , which took place in May , was recorded on a security camera at the Chicago suburb ’s Academy for Learning .
“ The academy is a high school for special - needs students who are emotionally disturbed or struggle with behavioral disorders , ” noted Chicago Breaking News .
“ Marshawn was a student there because he suffered brain injuries when he was hit by a car years ago , [ family attorney Edward ]
Manzke said . ”
During the recording , the officer stoops down and places a cup of coffee on the floor , then threw the teen into the lockers before pummeling him and pinning him to the floor in a maneuver known as the “ face - down take - down . ”
“ Zena Naiditch of Equip for Equality , a legal advocacy group that fights for the rights of people with disabilities , looked at the video and said the type of physical restraint used by the officer has killed students , ” CBS News reported .

Naiditch added that the hold can be lethal because those trapped by it are left unable to breathe .
CBS noted that seven states currently prohibit officers from using the “ face - down take - down . ”
The officer has not been identified , but due to the filmed evidence of the assault he has been terminated from the force .
Manzke told WBBM
News Radio 780 that Marshawn has since transferred to a new school and the family is planning to file a lawsuit .

This video is from CBS 2 in Chicago , broadcast Oct. 7 , 2009 .

UPDATE : Cop who assaulted teen now in jail on rape charge ; shot ex-wife ’s new husband 24 times in ‘ self defense ’
The officer who brutally beat special needs student Marshawn Pitts has been identified as 38 - year - old Christopher Lloyd , according to Chicago Breaking News , which spoke to Lloyd ’s father .
The news agency reported that Lloyd is currently in jail after being charged with the rape of a woman he knew and is facing a 20 - year sentence should he be convicted .

The Chicago Tribune - backed service adds : “ A lawsuit filed by his ex-wife , Nicole McKinney , last summer alleges he gunned down her new husband Cornel McKinney in front of their children outside their home on the 6100 block of South Langley Avenue on Feb. 17 , 2008 . ”
An autopsy revealed Lloyd shot the man 24 times , the agency found .
He was not jailed at the time as Chicago police accepted his explanation that the killing was in self - defense .
Lloyd also reportedly told his father that the boy he was filmed assaulting had a history of behavioral problems and had cursed at him when told to tuck in his shirt .

Subject : Business Proposal !
Hi ,
I am Larry Smith , an international financial consultant and currently resident in the UK .
I have an interesting business proposal for you and it will be of immense benefit to both of us .
I will give you my contact details on your reply to this letter .
My aim of contacting you is to solicit your co-operation and assistance in executing this business deal in respect of one of the accounts under my management valued $ 12,000,000.00 , which has remained dormant for the past 6 years .
I facilitated the initial deposit of the funds in a finance company in Shanghai , China , then moved same through secret ( code ) account before transferring it to a very discreet deposit company somewhere in Europe .
The funds came from an Iraqi national whom I later discovered was an aide to the late Iraqi dictator , Saddam Hussein .
He , who for purpose of this transaction shall be referred to as ( aide ) was killed during the raid on Iraq by coalition forces .
I had since comfirmed this fact but decided to wait a while before doing anything about the funds which was deposted in a numbered account to avoid any trace .
I also personally ensured the movement of the funds through different accounts to wipe off any trace .
You would agree with me that sending the funds back to Iraq is out of the question as that would raise the following issues :
Who would be the beneficiary in Iraq ?
Would the funds not be diverted to funding the raging insurgency thereby endangering the lives of coalition forces and Iraqis ?
From past experiences , I know that no one will ever come forward to claim the funds .
I am therefore seeking your assistance to have the funds transferred to your nominated account (s ) .
I now seek your permission to allow a trusted attorney prepare the necessary legal documents in your name , so that the funds would be released to you as the original beneficiary and , without any link to the initial depositor .
I am writing you because , as an insider , I cannot transfer the funds directly to myself .
But my questions for you are :
1 . Can you handle this project ?
2 . Can you assure me that you would not cheat or betray me on receipt of the funds ?
If the answers to the above are in the affirmative , then we`ve almost concluded the transaction and we may proceed .
I will like you to provide immediately your information :
1. Full Name
2. Address
3. Phone / Fax numbers .
4. Sex
5 . Age
With the above info , an Attorney will prepare the necessary legal documents to back up the transfer of the fund to you as the real beneficiary .
It will then be released to you , for us to split .
The Attorney will do all the paperwork and this will guarantee the legality of the transaction .
Please respond only via : larrysmith.inc@yahoo.com
Upon your response , I shall then provide you with more details including my identification , and further explanations that will help you understand .
I wish to propose that we share the funds in this order :
You will receive 40 % of the funds , I will be entitled to 50 % , while 10 % will be set aside for anticipated expenses .
I urgently await your response .
Regards ,
Larry Smith .
Matilda Gottrocks Dear Mr Smith ,
I 've received your interesting offer but surely there must be a mistake .
You see , because I am famous for my philanthropic work I receive many requests asking me for money .
Yours , however , is the first one ever to offer me money .
Surely you can understand my amazement and curiousity upon receiving your email .
Sir , I find your question " can you handle this project " to be insulting .
I am renowned for my annual Charity Ball which honors designer evening wear .
My first husband Kensworthy founded the Hampton 's Polo Field Preservation Society which prserves the zoning laws .
My second husband Kendleton started many charities which I could list , but the Gottrocks are noted for our humility .
Must I assure you that the Gottrocks Philanthropic Foundation will not " cheat or betray me on receipt of the funds " ?
Really , sir , this is beyond the pale .
When you issue a full apology for these demeaning insults we can then proceed to discussing the project .
Do not contact me again unless you sorry for such abject insults .
It 's time for my tea .
I see my butler , Jeeves , coming up the steps .
Your dismissed ,
Lady Matilda Matilda Gottrocks Monday , September 15 , 2008
I await your apology so we can get the project back on track .
Lady Matilda Gottrocks Larry Smith Wednesday , September 17 , 2008
I send my esteem apology , send me your requested informations , which includes Full Name , address , telephone number and scanned copy of identity card , so that i can send this to the bank to get the documents covering these funds to be transffered to your datas , and the swift transfer .
Thanks ,
Larry Smith Matilda Gottrocks Thursday , September 18 , 2008
Dear Mr Smith ,
I accept your apology meager as it is , however .
My personal information is below :
Lady Matilda Gottrocks
1000 Beacon Hill Estates
Boston , Ma 02114
I no longer use the telephone as my hearing is failing .
I rely on my butler , Jeeves , to assist me .
We could send each other letters if e-mail does n't suffice .
Please let me know your preference .
I 'll have my family lawyer , Benjamin Robb , draw up any papers that are required .
My second husband , Kendleton , placed the firm Robb , Steele , and Finagle on retainer a long time ago .
They handle all my affairs .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Lady Matilda Larry Smith September 19 , 2008
Thanks for the information , the bank incharge of the funds is demanding of a scanned copy of your driver 's license or international passport , so that they can legalise the funds in your name , and datas .
I await the scanned copy .
Thanks ,
Larry Smith .
Matilda Gottrocks Mon Sep 22
Dear Mr Smith ,
Thank you for your quick response .
I 'm afraid I no longer have access to my passport .
Benjamin Robb has taken over my affairs ever since I sent $ 5,000 to that nice Mr Patrice Colins in Africa to pay a security fee .
Benjamin was quite upset when he found out .
I still think that he just did n't give Mr Colins enough time to the transfer the money he promised me .
Anyway , I will have Benjamin contact you if that identification is a necessity .
I do n't understand all this high finance so I 'll leave it to him .
Jeeves is here with my tea and a seditive to calm my nerves .
Sincerely , Lady Matilda Larry Smith Mon Sep 22 2008
I will be having a meeting with the manager of the bank and all stake holders , before the end of this week , so i will keep you informed .
Thanks .
Matilda Gottrocks Tue Sep 23 2008
Dear Larry ,
Thank you for taking charge of all this paperwork .
I do not want Benjamin Robb to get involved if at all possible .
After my little incident with Mr Colins , Benjamin was downright insolent over a paltry $ 5,000 .
I also do not like the tone of that bank " demanding " paperwork from me .
Gottrocks do not work , that is why one has servants .
The nerve !
Fondly ,
Lady Matilda Larry Smith Tue Sep 23 2008
Thanks for your email , but this is an entirely ddifferent transaction and as such i want you to put behind your past delaings .
or else it will hinder the success of this .
However , if you are not ready to conclude the transaction you let me know and i back out .
Larry Smith Wed Sep 24 2008
Dear Lady Matilda ,
Am in response to the last email conversation in question in regard to this huge amount of funds involve here , like i did stated on my previous email to you i will be very glad if you keep this top secret in your dearest heart and did not reveal the true nature of this transaction to anyone one this earth .
However , Please Lady Matilda
I want you to know that you need not worried much concerning this matter as we will perfect it well by his Grace , So tell me which is the best means you will like to get this money in question as i need to know the best and convenience way for you since you have Robb looking into your affairs .
I will be looking forward to hear from you soon
Sincerely Yours
Larry Matilda Gottrocks Wed Sep 24 2008
Dear Larry ,
I am so glad that I did not respond in haste to your email of the 23rd .
I do n't know what I have done or said to cause you to think that I wish to " back out " , as you put it , of our deal .
Larry , your very next email warmed my heart , I must say .
I have n't had anyone speak of my " dearest heart " since Kendleton passed away .
Of course it will be no problem to keep our little affair a secret .
I only mentioned Benjamin Robb because he handles all my finances .
Lawyers are n't needed when love is in the air .
Until you write again ,
Fondly , Millie Larry Smith Thu Sep 25 2008
Dearest Lady Matilda ,
Its a Pleasure to hear from you again concerning our little secret affair and transaction at hand , my lovely Lady Matilda i will like you to know that i will not like a situation where Robb look into all issues or Jeeves because that will make me feel insecure with you as i do not like my private life been seen by other men who are self center .
So anything related to this matter should be kept top secret and i will not lie to you , i most comment , i dont like when Robb handle most of your financial issues because Robb my hinder this transaction with jealousy or something .
Reason with me and i will be looking forward to hear from you .
Yours Only
Larry Matilda Gottrocks
Thu Sep 25 2008
My Dearest Larry ,
It thrilled my heart to read " our little secret affair " .
I 've been so lonely since Kendleton died .
All alone in such a big house with just my servants as company .
Now Jeeves is my trusted butler , but I have n't told him anything about us .
Benjamin Robb could become a problem .
While he does n't know anything of this , he does control my finances .
I do have some mad money for myself , but Benjamin handles all my finances .
I 'll have to be very careful in my dealings with him .
Larry , my love , please do n't worry .
We 'll find a way to work this all out .
Breathlessly Awaiting You ,
Millie Larry Smith Fri Sep 26 2008
My Dearest Lady Matilda ,
Its a warmest atmosphere here today my lady , I came to read your lovely mail which really gives my heart joy and pleasure .
However , My Dearest one i will like you to know that as long you never reveal the true nature of this our little secret love affair to Jeeves or Benjamin Robb we both will leave our life in a garden full of roses and love , because you have touch the deepest path of my heart , which i will never forget as long as we both are together .
Nevertheless , first we need to resolve this financial problem that Robb have all his eyes on so try all possible best to make sure he did not know where your spending goes or when you required cash or need something to be done that required money because i will need you to clear that link between him so that our transaction can be handle perfectly with passion and affection between us .
Yours Only Love
Larry Matilda Gottrocks Fri Sep 26 2008
My Dearest Love ,
Let us proceed in earnest down the garden path life has chosen for us .
It is time to consummate our partnership .
I will do everything in my power to ensure that you receive what 's coming to you .
I am puzzled by this sentence " or need something to be done that required money " .
What needs to be done that requires money , my love ?
Surely , the 10 % set aside for expenses will cover anything out of pocket .
Please write with good news .
I will be off to Rome for the fall season fashion tour so we need to get this project finished soon .
With my love ,
Millie Larry Smith Fri Sep 26 2008
Dearest Love ,
Am in response to the last email conversation concerning the project at hand which we need to get it done before your your trip to Rome for the Season Fashion tour , my dearest love am thinking of moving the project down to United State which is best for you to handle because of its closeness .
However , what i did mean by the word that puzzled you was you need to have your own opinion , freedom to use money when ever you want it and buy what please you without consulting Robb for advice or him asking what is the money needed for .
My Dearest heart , i need you to understand with me because my heart skip for you every second , and your love will remain in me forever as we proceed to execute this project at hand and remember to put Jeeves out of this love affair .
Your Love
Larry Matilda Gottrocks Mon Sep 29 2008
Dear Larry My Love ,
You silly !
Whatever do you mean by " remember to put Jeeves out of this love affair " .
Jeeves is my old and trusted butler .
Of course he knows nothing of our secret affair .
He simply manages my household and supervises the servants .
I 'd be lost without him .
I think is high time you got this project moving .
I 'm glad that you are finally using the good old USA .
I hear there are some very good deals on Wall St right now if you 're interested .
v
Til we meet at last
Millie Larry Smith Tue Sep 30 2008
Dearest Love ,
Thanks for the email concerning this project at hand , i will like you to know that i have made all the arrangement for the project to be move to United State like i did mention to you early , well my dearest heart the company responsible for this project are requesting for Nine Thousand United State dollar lodged into their representative account before the project can be move to United State Because the funds will be used for insurances cover and tax 's , And come to think of this if this great project is moved to United State we have better chances of making a good deal in Wall Str .
However , As you Know i have my eyes on that Wall Street for long now , if we get this project executed , it will be a great thing for use both and come to think of it you and i working together like two great couple that are business oriented to secure this project and get to meet one on one and use the resources we have now to purchase some good stocks in Wall Str , what do you think my love ?
I will wait to hear from you soon so that we can get this executed fast , my great reason to move this project is because i do not trust Spanish Bank that much so I believe banks in my home country United State will best to use aslo i will like some real Estate business in Wall Str. too .
With Love
Larry Matilda Gottrocks Tue Sep 30 2008
Dearest Larry my love ,
My heart thrills to read your latest missive .
The $ 9,000 could be a problem .
I 'll have to think up a plan to trick Benjamin Robb into giving me the money under false pretenses .
I 'll get right to work on it .
My dear , how much money do you have to invest in Wall Street ?
I have a list of hot investment opportunities for us to sink all our cash into : Bear - Stearns , Lehman Brothers , Wachovia , Fannie Mae & Freddy Mac , plus others to come .
Put your faith in me , dear .
Together we cannot lose .
Your flower child ,

Thu Oct 2 2008
Mr Larry Smith ;
Jeeves , the butler , here sir .
I 'm terribly sorry to be writing you uninvited , but my mistress , Lady Matilda , has instructed me to do so .
She left today on an ocean cruise to Italy for the fall fashion shows .
She 's terribly smitten with you , sir , and regretted not being able to continue correspondence .
Lady Matilda has confided her plans and instructed me to devise a way to get money under false pretenses from the family lawyer , Benjamin Robb .
Although I consider this to be an unwise decision , I have been a devoted servant for over 35 years and will do my mistress 's bidding .
Benjamin Robb is a crafty fellow , and unlike some , will be difficult to fool .
He has controlled the Gottrocks estate finances every since M'lady sent that African gentleman $ 5,000 for a security fee .
While Madam can certainly afford such piccadillos if she so desires , Mr Robb petitioned the courts to be her Conservator and Guardian .
As such all monies are tightly controlled by him .
I am working on a plan and will contact you when it is fully concocted .

I have spoken with Benjamin Robb as he was verifying Lady Matilda 's trip expenses .
I casually mentioned that Madam had to send you money , but that I did not know why .
Mr Robb said that he will email you on Monday .

Monday , October 6 , 2008
Dear Jeeve ,
Following your last email concerning Mr Robb , I will like to know if Mr Robb will write me through his personal Email or Lady Matilda Email Address .
Get Back soon
Because I believe lady Matilda will not be happy the way you hand issues here , because she told me you are her trusted Butler .
Looking forward to hear from Robb , When Is she coming Back anyway ?
Best Regard
Larry Jeeves Monday , October 6 , 2008
Dear Mr Smith ;
Jeeves here , sir .
Mr Robb that said he would email you on Monday .
I presume he will use either his corporate account or his private email account .
I do not know when the Mistess will return from her shopping trip .
I suspect she will be gone for several weeks .
It will depend upon how long it takes to acquire her fall fashion wardrobe .
I am sorry to hear that I have disappointed you .
Although I serve Lady Gottrocks I strive to accommodate everyone .
Jeeves , the Butler Benjamin Robb Dear Mr Smith ;
Lady Gottrocks butler , Jeeves , has informed me that you are to be paid an unknown sum of money .
Jeeves said he did not know the details and that Lady Gottrocks had specifically requested to not be bothered while on her cruise .
That is why I am writing you .
I have been the Gottrocks family lawyer for over thirty years and I handle all of Matilda 's finances as her Conservator and Guardian .
Please send me a detailed explanation of the money owed .
Sincerely ,

Dear Jeeves ,
Following the last email from you well i accept your apology , However I will like to know if Mr B. Robb have right to My Lady Email box like you before i try to convince him on what my lady ask me to tell him .
Because I do not want problem between my dearest Matilda and Mr Robb , Your urgent attention is needed also send me telephone number that i can reach you on 24/7 so that i can discuss some issues My Lady told me about you .
Looking forward to hear from you soon .
Best Regard
Larry Larry Smith Dear Mr.Benjamin ,
Its a Pleasure to hear from you as the family Lawyer , Well i will like to bring to your understanding that I and My Dearest Lady Matilda have been together for a while now and we both have lot in common which we share to kill the pass sorrow in our life and that have been our greatest joy since she lost her husband way back .
Also I understand you handle all finances of my lady Matilda , that is good i most say but am afraid i can not disclose privacy like affair like this to you because it can not be share with 3rd party because it is like a bridge of contract which i believe you understand better as you are in the field already , I guess you understand better sooner or later when we both walk hand in hand or call you to share it with you but now am sorry i can not tell you .
Thank You
Larry Smith Benjamin Robb Dear Mr Smith ;
Thank you for your quick response .
It is rewarding to deal with a businessman who knows the value of promptness .
I must say that I am taken aback by your letter .
Am I to understand that you are romantically involved with Lady Gottrocks ?
And that you met at the contact bridge table ?
It does come as a shock as this is the first that I have heard anything of this .
After her first two husbands , Kendleton and Kensington , each had suffered macabre and mysterious deaths I naturally assumed that Lady Matilda had forsworn love forever .
Even though she profited handsomely from their wills , the ensuing legal investigations did leave a blemish on her reputation .
But , no matter .
Love springs eternal .
You say you are unable to tell me the amount nor the reason for needing money .
Well then , we 'll just have to wait for Lady Gottrocks to return unless Jeeves knows something .
And he just may the way he 's always lurking in the shadows with his ear to the ground .
I remember how surprised the detectives were during their investigations .
They always said there should have been more evidence at the scenes , but that someone had cleaned them up .
I dislike dealing with the man but I suppose it is my duty .
Keep a stiff upper lip , Smith .
I shall get to the bottom of this .
Benjamin Robb
Attorney at Law Jeeves Wednesday , October 8 , 2008
Dear Mr Smith ;
Jeeves here , sir .
I can assure you that Benjamin Robb does not have access to Lady Matilda 's emails .
I have served my Mistress for over thirty years and enjoy the privilege of her confidence .
She instructed me to contact you through her email account because she did n't want you to worry about her absence .
I am sorry to inform you that Lady Gottrocks had all the telephones removed from the estate a few years ago when she lost her hearing .
I believe that everytime she saw them they had become a painful reminder of that sad loss .
It is an inconvenience for the staff , but we serve at the Mistress 's pleasure .
Jeeves , the Butler Larry Smith What Is Wrong With Mr Robb !

Or the Amount she is willing to help me with for Medication ?
Clear yourself .

Larry Smith Benjamin Robb
Good God man you have cancer !
No wonder Lady Gottrocks wants to marry you so fast to inherit your money .
How many weeks or months do you have left ?
I imagine you are loaded as both of her previous husbands were very well to do .
Well it 's your funeral , no pun intended .
But seriously be very alert to that insidious butler Jeeves .
He 's always sneaking around doing who knows what .
You 've been forewarned .
Now about that money .
The health insurance industry is sure in a sad state .
I take it you do n't have any coverage .
Have you filled out all the forms properly ?
Well , I hope your medication holds out until Lady Gottrocks returns as I can do nothing without her signature on the proper forms .
I know that Jeeves has forged her name in the past , but I 'm onto that game now so there will be no hankey pank this time .
What on earth does this mean ?
Have I offended you in some inadvertent way ?

Dear Mr Smith ;
Jeeves here , sir .
I 'm afraid I have unfortunate news .
It appears Lady Matilda has fallen in love with a gentleman she met on the cruise ship .
She states that they plan on being wed on board ship by the captain and will honeymoon on the French Riveria after her shopping is finished .
I 've taken the liberty of including the email as I am aware of your fondness for my Mistress .
I hope this news is not too distressing for you .

His name is Kensington Charlesworth III and he is a retired banker .
Now I know this is a whirlwind romance so please do n't start lecturing me .
I can't wait until you meet him .
He looks very well to do .
I plan on having the Captain marry us on board and then honeymooning on the Riveria after I 've shopped for the latest designer wear in Milan .
Please do n't tell Benjamin .
I 'll break it to him when we return . "
Matilda
ps I 'm looking for new outfits for the servants .
I hope to find something for you also .

Then !

Dear Jeeves ,
Thanks for the news !
Well I most say i have successfully talk to Benjamin and you need to ask my lady to write Benjamin so that him can approved the money because he did stated he needs her signature on the form before the money can come out .
So relate with My lady and tell her to contact Benjamin that i need the money for cancer treatment and Benjamin needs her to let him know if he can do without her signature on the form .
I will be waiting to hear from you soon .
Best Regard

Dear Mr Smith ;
I am using Kensie 's email account on his laptop as we 're still at sea .
I am getting married tomorrow by the ship 's Captain .
I 'm afraid our little online romance has ended .
Jeeves tells me that you have cancer and need money for medication .
How could you be so deceitful and never tell me that you are dying !
Well , you 're not getting any money from me .
I suggest you try the power of positive thinking if you can't get the lifesaving drugs you need .
I think it worked for Norman Vincent Peale .
And by the way , Kensington is loaded .
He was the bank president and took all the money with him when he retired .
So I no longer need your paltry offer .
Goodbye forever Larry Smith Am Farious With You !

Dear Jeeves , Following the last email to me concerning Lady Matilda Engagement to the man on the Cruise , Jeeves Did i mention to you that i have Cancer ?
I only told you i use the trick on Mr Robb since you did stated that you can not devise plan to get the money from him which lady Matilda ask you to collect from Him .
I want you to clear lady Matilda about my statement because i did mention to you that i have Cancer .. i only told you that the only way i can convince Benjamin is to make some foolish statement like to him why do you want to rain my life about false story to lady Matilda ?
Clear her up and and get back to me soon .

Larry Larry Smith RE : Lady Matilda Gottrocks ( Secret Is No Longer Secret )
Dear Benjamin Robb ,
Thanks for all the advice coming this lady Matilda and Jeeves , I most tell you that Jeeves send me an email last week stating that Lady Matilda have found a gentleman on the boat Cruise and she is getting married on Saturday which is last week .
However , What really surprise me is when lady Matilda wrote me about the whole issues concerning the new Gentleman on the cruise boat to Rome is she want to conspire with Jeeves to get the gentle kill and inherit his wealth because the gentleman is a retired bank president , I think measure sure be taken before worst come to worst .
Hoping to hear from you soon .

Dear Lady Matilda ,
Congratulation !
on your marriage to Kensington Charlesworth I will like you to know that i did not mention any thing to Jeeves that i have Cancer or need the money for treatment Jeeves wrote me and told me he can not devise plan to Mr Robb and when straight to Mr Benjamin that you ask him to get some funds from him and send to me but did not know why and Mr Robb wrote me on Monday asking what the money was needed for and all that .
So i need to devise plan to him that i needed the money for Cancer treatment before he did agree to sign the paper and approved the funds for me so i see not reason why you think i will lie to you because of Money here when i have eyes on good investment at Wall Str with my net - worth of six billions Dollars from the UAE stock market .

Dear Larry ,
Good God , man , not again !
I though after Kensworthy & Kendleton that this whole business was over .
You say she 's marrying a banker .
Why has n't Lady Matilda said anything to me about her marriage ?
You 're right , this does sound suspicious .
Now , did she actually say she was going to kill her new husband or was it just hinted at ?
I will need you to fill out and sign a Certificate of Verified Authenticity so that I can begin the process of usurping Lady Matilda 's money .
I know that this money is badly needed for your cancer medication .
Do n't despair , hang in there until I can send you the needed form .
I just hope your delicate health holds up .

Dear Mr Smith ;
Pure poppycock I say !
How dare you besmirch my true love and new bride Lady Matilda .
Of course I know that she has been widowed twice and that Kendleton and Kensworthy each met bizarre untimely deaths .
But to infer that Lady Matilda or her devoted butler Jeeves had any hand in it is beyond the pale .
As a matter of fact , Jeeves told me he has a smashing homecoming planned for us when we return to the mansion stateside .

Subject : Robb is deadSun
19/10/2008 Dear Larry , Good God man you were right after all !is dead .
I fell lucky to have escaped with my life .
I 've attached the Daily Beacon 's account .
Their news story is below : Transcript : Notable attorney Benjamin Robb , senior partner of the law firm Robb , Steele , and Finagle , died Friday evening at the Beacon Hill mansion of the famous philanthropist and socialite Lady Matilda Gottrocks .
He was sixty four years old .
Robb , the longtime family lawyer for the Gottrock 's estate , was attending a homecoming celebration for the newly wed Lady Matilda .
His body was found by the butler , Jeeves , around 9:00 PM .
Police said the death appeared to be a heart attack , but are awaiting full autopsy results from the coroner .
Speaking on the condition of anonymity , police Sargent Bilko said the death appears to be mysterious .
" We 've recovered Robb 's briefcase from the scene .
It contains legal documents which would have transfered the bulk of the estate 's wealth to a Mr Larry Smith if the paperwork had been signed .
Evidently Robb died before getting Lady Matilda 's required signature .
We also have forensics examining emails on Robb 's laptop computer .
Luckily for us Jeeves was n't his usual efficient self this time . "
Bilko was referring to two previous tragedies at 100 Beacon Hill .
Each of Lady Matilda 's previous husbands , Kensington Gottrocks and Kendleton Munybaggs , had died of apparent heart attacks .
Both deaths were eventually deemed natural , but the demise of Robb raises nagging suspicions .
Police had combed the death scenes , but were foiled by Jeeves .
Hazel , the head of the estate 's housekeeping unit , told police that Jeeves had ordered a thorough housecleaning after each death .
Lacking any evidence police were forced to end their investigations .

Kensington Charlesworth III Tue 21/10/2008
Dear Larry ,
Good show old chap !
It was a damnable bother trying to remember if my name is Kensington , Kendleton , or Kensworthy .
I hope I did n't slip up too many times .
Jeeves here , sir .
I hope your day has been a pleasant one .
Benjamin Robb here .
My secretary is sending you an invoice for my billable hours .
Do not hesitate to call upon Robb , Steele , and Finagle for all your legal needs .
Oh Dear , Larry .
We 've had such a whirlwind romance my head is starting to spin just thinking about it .
But remember , dear , we have a class system for a reason .
It just would n't do for a Gottrock to be seen with a commoner .
Mobile Defense
Losing your smartphone can be as scary and stressful as losing your wallet , especially if you store passwords , financial data , and other sensitive material on you handset .
Fortunately , Mobile Defense is a new Google Android application that aims to protect your personal information and privacy while helping you to recover a lost phone .
Mobile Defense works by installing a small tracking code on your device .
Think of it as LoJack for your phone .
The easy setup process only requires you to create an account to register your phone .
After you install the app it will remain dormant until you activate it remotely .
Since you control Mobile Defense through a Web site you can hide the program 's icon on your phone .
Hopefully , most users will install Mobile Defense and never have to use it .
In the event your phone is lost or stolen , just login to the Mobile Defense site from any computer .
After connecting , the service should connect to your phone in under 30 seconds .
Once connected , the location of your phone will appear on a Google map with Street View .
Mobile Defense uses GPS , Wi-Fi , and cell towers to determine an accurate location .
When connected , users have the option to lock their phone and send an alert to it .
You also can display a custom message with you contact information for anyone who finds the phone .
Future upgrades to the service will also include the ability to back up your data and remotely wipe it .
I have n't lost my phone since installing Mobile Defense , but I 've heard of several success stories .
One user was riding the train after work and realized that he lost his phone when he got home .
By logging onto the service , he was able to track his handset to another train station about 10 miles away .
When he got there , he recovered his device from the lost and found box .
Another user had left his phone with the power off at a public pool .
He contacted Mobile Defense , which sent an emergency command to his phone that would track and lock it on its next boot .
After several weeks he received an alert that someone had started the phone with a new SIM card .
Mobile Defense captured the thief 's mobile phone number and their subscriber ID .
What 's more , the device was immediately locked , protecting the user 's private data .
From there , Mobile Defense began tracking the phone 's location and eventually pinpointed the device to within 24 feet .
Given that Mobile Defense is a free service , I would suggest installing it on every Android phone .
The app only runs when activated , so you 're likely to forget it is even installed until you need it .
OCTOBER 13 --Happy anniversary , Bill O'Reilly !
On this date five years ago , the Fox News Channel host was named in a sexual harassment lawsuit brimming with lurid details about vibrators , phone sex , threesomes , masturbation , Caribbean shower fantasies , a Thai sex show , falafel , stewardess trysts , vehicular coupling , and Al Franken .
The New York State Supreme Court lawsuit filed by Andrea Mackris , a former Fox News producer , quoted O'Reilly verbatim and at length , leaving readers to believe that the TV star 's dirty soliloquies were surreptitiously recorded ( an impression reinforced when the lawsuit was settled within two weeks ) .
A copy of Mackris 's complaint , drafted by lawyer Benedict Morelli , can be found here .
Time has not robbed the document of any of its page - turning entertainment value .
It is unknown how the litigants will mark today 's anniversary , though were it a marriage , tradition would call for gifts of wood .
But we 'd wager that the volcanic O'Reilly , 60 , is still incensed about writing that hefty check .
For her part , Mackris , 38 , has stayed mum , presumably pursuant to some kind of confidentiality agreement .
She has relocated from Manhattan to Missouri , where she was recently named to St. Louis Magazine 's best dressed list .
According to the monthly , Mackris ( seen above ) volunteers at Planned Parenthood and her closet is stocked with Prada , Gucci , Valentino , and Manolo Blahnik .
She is pictured in the magazine wearing a Halston gown .

Nintendo Entertainment System Architecture version 2.6 ( 01/24/2005 )
by Marat Fayzullin Unauthorized distribution prohibited .
Link to this page , not copy it .
The following document describes the hardware architecture of Nintendo Entertainment System videogame console , also known as Famicom in the East ( Korea , Japan ) , and Dandy in Europe ( Russia , etc. ) .
Note that this document is mainly based on experimentation and may be incomplete and incorrect in many places .
" Nintendo Entertainment System " , " Famicom " , and ( most likely ) " Dandy " are registered trademarks of Nintendo .
This document has also been translated to Japanese ( by Bero ) , French ( by Guillaume Tuloup ) , and Portugese ( by Daniel Loureiro ) .
I would like to thank following people for their help in obtaining this information and writing a NES emulator , as well as moral support from some of them : ( sorted alphabetically ) Pascal Felber Patrick Lesaard Tink Goroh Pan of Anthrox Bas Vijfwinkel Kawasedo Paul Robson Marcel de Kogel Serge Skorobogatov Alex Krasivsky John Stiles

What Is Covered And What Not ?
The 6502 CPU used in NES is not covered in this document though , as there is enough information on it in other literature .
You are assumed to know how 6502 works .
Also not covered are some more exotic memory mappers , Famicom DiskSystem , and some other esoteric pieces of hardware , as I do n't have enough information about them .
If you have any information on NES which is not in this manual , feel free to write to marat at server komkon dot org .
Your help will be appreciated .
In this manual , you may encounter notation of the form " Nth bit " ( 5th , 3rd , etc. ) .
Bits are counted from the least significant ( 0th ) to the most significant ( 7th ) .
All hexadecimal numbers are prepended with a dollar sign ( $ 2002 , $ 4016 , etc. ) which is a common notation used in 6502 CPU assembler .
General Architecture
Cartridges may contain both ROM appearing in the CPU address space at $ 8000 - $ FFFF , and VROM or VRAM appearing in the PPU address space at $ 0000 - $ 1FFF .
In smaller cartridges , which only have 16 kB ROM , it takes place at $ C000 - $ FFFF leaving $ 8000 - $ BFFF area unused .
In cartridges with > 32 kB ROM , it is paged into address space with special circuitry ( see " Mappers " ) .
Some cartridges also have RAM at $ 6000 - $ 7FFF which may or may not be battery - backed .
Cartridge VROM ( VRAM ) is used for Pattern Tables ( aka Tile Tables , Character Generators , etc. ) .
The usual amount is 8 kB which contain 2 Pattern Tables .
In cartridges with > 8 kB VROM ( VRAM ) , it is paged into address space with special circuitry ( see " Mappers " ) .
Internal NES VRAM is located at addresses $ 2000 - $ 3FFF in the PPU memory and used to store Name Tables ( aka Screen Buffers , etc. ) .
Although PPU supports 4 Name Tables , there is only enough memory for two of them .
Other two mirror the first two ( see " PPU Details " ) .

Interrupts
When a VBlank interrupt occurs , CPU pushes return address and the status register on stack , then jumps to the address stored at location $ FFFA ( ROM in NES ) .
The interrupt handler is supposed to finish its execution with RTI command which returns CPU to the main program execution .
More information on the interrupt handling can be found in a decent book on 6502 CPU .
Maskable interrupts ( aka IRQs ) can be generated by external circuitry on the cart ( see " Mappers " ) , but most carts do not generate them .

PPU Memory
Accessing PPU Memory
In a real NES , reading / writing PPU memory should only be attempted during VBlank period .
Attempts to access PPU memory during screen refresh will corrupt refresh address registers in a certain way which is often used to implement " split screen " effects ( see " PPU Details " ) .
Many smaller ROMs have read - only memory ( VROM ) for the Pattern Tables .
In this case , you wo n't be able to write into this part of PPU address space , only read from it .
Writing to PPU memory : a ) Write upper address byte into $ 2006 b)
Write lower address byte into $ 2006 c ) Write data into $ 2007 .
After each write , the address will increment either by 1 ( bit 2 of $ 2000 is 0 ) or by 32 ( bit 2 of $ 2000 is 1 ) .
Reading from PPU memory : a ) Write upper address byte into $ 2006 b)
Write lower address byte into $ 2006 c ) Read data from $ 2007 .
The first byte read from $ 2007 will be invalid ( see " PPU Details " ) .
Then , the address will increment by 1 after each read .
Name Tables PPU supports 4 Name Tables at addresses $ 2000 , $ 2400 , $ 2800 , and $ 2C00 .
A Name Table is very similar to the text mode screen buffer which contains codes of characters to display on the screen .
It contains tile ( character ) codes organized into 30 rows of 32 bytes each .
Tiles are 8x8 pixels each .
Thus , the whole Name Table is 32x30 tiles or 256x240 pixels .
On NTSC TVs , upper and lower 8 pixels are usually shown off screen leaving you with 256x224 pixels .
In the PAL standard , the screen is whole 256x240 pixels .
It is necessary to say that although PPU supports 4 Name Tables , NES only has enough internal VRAM for 2 Name Tables .
Two others are mirrored .
Pattern Tables PPU supports 2 Pattern Tables at addresses $ 0000 and $ 1000 .
A Pattern Table contains tile images ( patterns ) in the following format : Character Colors Contents of Pattern Table ...*....
00010000 00010000 $ 10 +-> 00000000 $ 00 .. O.O ... 00202000 00000000 $ 00 | 00101000 $ 28 .#...#..
03000300 01000100 $ 44 | 01000100 $ 44 O.....O. 20000020 00000000 $ 00 | 10000010 $ 82 *******. ->
11111110 -> 11111110 $ FE | 00000000 $ 00 O..... O. 20000020 00000000 $ 00 | 10000010 $ 82 #.....#. 30000030 10000010 $ 82 | 10000010 $ 82 ........
00000000 00000000 $ 00 | 00000000 $ 00 +---------+
Note that only two bits for each pixel of each tile are stored in the Pattern Table .
Other two are taken from the Attribute Table .
Thus , the total number of simultaneous colors on the NES screen is 16 , although each tile has only 4 colors .
Attribute Tables Each Name Table has its own Attribute Table .
A byte in this table represents a group of 4x4 tiles on screen which makes an 8x8 Attribute Table .
Each 4x4 tile group is subdivided into four 2x2 squares as follows : ( 0,0 ) ( 1,0 ) 0 | ( 2,0 ) ( 3,0 ) 1 ( 0,1 ) ( 1,1 ) | ( 2,1 ) ( 3,1 ) --------------+----------------
( 0,2 ) ( 1,2 ) 2 | ( 2,2 ) ( 3,2 ) 3 ( 0,3 ) ( 1,3 ) | ( 2,3 ) ( 3,3 ) The attribute byte contains upper two bits of the color number for each 2x2 square ( the lower two bits are stored in the Pattern Table ) : Bits Function Tiles -------------------------------------------------------------- 7,6
Upper color bits for square 3 ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,2 ) , ( 2,3 ) , ( 3,3 ) 5,4 Upper color bits for square 2 ( 0,2 ) , ( 1,2 ) , ( 0,3 ) , ( 1,3 ) 3,2 Upper color bits for square 1 ( 2,0 ) , ( 3,0 ) , ( 2,1 ) , ( 3,1 ) 1,0 Upper color bits for square 0 ( 0,0 ) , ( 1,0 ) , ( 0,1 ) , ( 1,1 ) Palettes
There are two 16 - byte Palettes .
The one at $ 3F00 used for the picture .
Another one , at $ 3F10 , contains sprite colors .
The $ 3F00 and $ 3F10 locations in VRAM mirror each other ( i.e. it is the same memory cell ) and define the background color of the picture .
PPU Details
Mirroring
As you may have noticed , PPU supports 4 Name Tables with corresponding Attribute Tables .
Nevertheless , there is only enough internal VRAM for 2 Name Tables .
Other 2 tables are going to be mirrors of the first 2 .
Which pages are mirrored depends on the cartiridge circuitry .
Each cartridge has control of the PPU address bits A10 and A11 .
It may set them in one of four possible ways : A11 A10 Effect ----------------------------------------------------------
0 0
All four screen buffers are mapped to the same area of memory which repeats at $ 2000 , $ 2400 , $ 2800 , and $ 2C00 .
0 x " Upper " and " lower " screen buffers are mapped to separate areas of memory at $ 2000 , $ 2400 and $ 2800 , $ 2C00 .
x 0 " Left " and " right " screen buffers are mapped to separate areas of memory at $ 2000 , $ 2800 and $ 2400 , $ 2C00 .
x x
All four screen buffers are mapped to separate areas of memory .
In this case , the cartridge must contain 2 kB of additional VRAM .
VBlank Flag
The VBlank Flag is contained in the 7th bit of the PPU Status Register ( $ 2002 ) .
It indicates whether PPU is refreshing the screen or generating a Vertical Blanking Impulse .
It goes up in the end of each frame and stays on until a next screen refresh starts .
When VBlank Flag is up , you can access PPU memory via $ 2006 / $ 2007 .
The program can reset VBlank Flag prematurely by reading from the PPU Status Register ( $ 2002 ) .
Hit Flag The Hit Flag is contained in the 6th bit of the PPU Status Register ( $ 2002 ) .
It goes up when PPU starts displaying sprite # 0 and its first non-transparent pixel coincides with the first non-transparent pixel of the background .
For example , if the screen is filled with the non-transparent color ( > 0 ) , sprite # 0's coordinates are [ 12,34 ] , and it only has pixels in the 4th line from the top , then the Hit Flag will be set when screen refresh reaches location [ 12,37 ] .
The Hit Flag allows to implement both horizontal and vertical screen splits , as well as variety of other interesting effects .
It is not reset by reading from the PPU Status Register .
Instead , it appears to go down on its own every time PPU starts refreshing screen .
Accessing VRAM During Refresh
As was said before , accessing VRAM address ( $ 2006 ) and data ( $ 2007 ) registers during screen refresh is officially considered illegal .
A lot of programs access these registers to produce various scrolling effects .
For example , if some game has a scrolling playfield and a stationary status bar at the bottom of the screen , it may write to $ 2006 at the first line of the status bar to reset screen scroll .
The idea behind this trick is that PPU uses the VRAM address register to store current address during screen refresh .
By writing into $ 2006 you effectively modify this address and make PPU continue screen refresh from a different location .
Details on how $ 2007 affects screen refresh are unknown .
While it is not clear how exactly values written into $ 2006 relate to the screen locations , they seem to follow this diagram : Address Written into $ 2006 xxYYSSYYYYYXXXXX | | | | | | | +----

IRQ
Counter FDS provides a 16 bit IRQ counter connected to the CPU clock generator .
This counter starts from a value preset in $ 4020 - $ 4021 when you write into $ 4021 .
It will then decrement by one on each CPU clock cycle .
When the counter reaches zero , it reloads from the preset value and continues counting .
An IRQ is generated at this moment .
It may occur during VBlank as well as during screen refresh .
The 2nd bit of $ 4022 allows to control IRQ counter .
When it is set to 0 , the counter stops and a pending IRQ request is reset ( if there is such request ) .
The counting can then be resumed by setting 2nd bit of $ 4022 to 1 .
Sound Hardware
To be written Disk Format Each disk has two sides , A and B , each of them containing exactly 65000 bytes of data .
To change an active side , the disk has to be removed , flipped , and inserted back into the drive .
The data on each side is stored in several types of blocks in a sequence [ 1,2,3,4,3,4 , ... 3,4 ] where ------------------------------------------------------
1 . Side Header Block ( 56 bytes ) 0 $ 01 1 - 14 " * NINTENDO-HVC * " 15 Maker ID 16 - 19 Side Name 20 Version Number 21 Side Number $ 00 = Side A $ 01 = Side B 22 - 24 Additional Disk Data 25 $ 08 26-56 Reserved Space ( not used by BIOS )

------------------------------------------------------
4 . File Data Block ( variable length ) 0 $ 04 1 - ... Data ( see File Header Block for size )
------------------------------------------------------
All two - byte fields are written with the most significant byte first .
Side names may be different for different sides of the same game floppy , but they are usually the same .
Starting addresses are actual addresses in RAM or VRAM where files are loaded .
Disk Access
Following diagrams show how FDS performs reads and writes from a floppy disk .
These diagrams have been created by Goroh in his document on the FDS hardware .
I am providing them here with only minor cosmetic changes , with all credit going to Goroh : READ : $ 4025 | A | B | C | D || E | A ) Initialization 7bit |___|______|___|---||------___|

It is not clear from the diagrams how actual reading and writing is done .
It is quite clear though that FDS generates an IRQ every time a byte is read from the disk .
FDS IRQ handler ( which is a part of the FDS BIOS ) reads this byte from $ 4031 while the head is advanced to the next byte .
Disk Errors FDS BIOS may display different errors when accessing a floppy disk .
The list of errors given below has been taken from Goroh 's document and verified on an FDS emulator to the best of my abilities .

Favre said that the injury that required surgery on his biceps tendon and then finding out that he had a tear in his rotator cuff led him to think he should n't play anymore .
" I just kept thinking I did n't want to go through what I did last year , " he said .
" Between three weeks ago and the phone conversation yesterday [ with Childress ] , I talked to Dr. [ James ]
Andrews and he assured me it would n't be an issue .
I felt if everyone was going to take that chance , I was to . "
Dr. Andrews detected a slight tear in his right rotator cuff in May while performing arthroscopic surgery on the quarterback 's passing shoulder .
During practice sessions in Mississippi , Favre said that " the arm has felt , not 100 percent , but pretty good , good enough to make the throws I need to make . "
That led him to decide to go for it .
" As friends and family has told me , you never know until you take the chance , " he said .
Favre , who holds almost all of the NFL 's career passing records , has never been much of a fan of offseason practices , though .
Last summer , he ended his retirement with the Packers and forced a trade to the Jets , where he faded down the stretch amid problems with his throwing arm .
But Favre remained in regular communication with the Vikings ' coaching staff the past three weeks , and a source told ESPN's Ed Werder that owner Zygi Wilf had to do very little convincing when the two met this week near Favre 's home in Hattiesburg .
" He had a lot of aches and pains and they basically needed a commitment from him before he felt he was ready to play , '' a source told Werder .
" He wants to be able to do the best he can do and does n't want to disappoint them . ''
Favre has been working out regularly with Oak Grove High School players in Hattiesburg , according to WDAM -TV , and has not missed a practice even after telling the Vikings he would remain retired .
The fact that the Vikings have a chance to make a deep run in the playoffs factored heavily in Favre 's decision .
" I felt from my standpoint that I could offer some experience and leadership , and I have to admit through this whole process after I said no three weeks ago , sometimes I was OK with it , and other times I said .
I can really help this team . "
The Vikings finished training camp last week and beat Indianapolis 13 - 3 in their preseason opener Friday .
They got a strong performance from quarterback Sage Rosenfels , who has been competing with Tarvaris Jackson for the starting job since Favre jilted the team July 28 .
When Favre arrived at training camp , third - string quarterback John David Booty graciously gave him his jersey number .
Booty , who had been wearing No. 4 , was assigned No. 9 .
Jackson and Rosenfels were a little more begrudging in handing over the starting job .
" It 's not a good feeling , but you have to take it for what it 's worth and try and get better from it , " said Jackson , who was hoping to assert himself and live up to the label of quarterback of the future he received when coach Brad Childress drafted him in 2006 .
It may be even more difficult for Rosenfels , who spent the first eight seasons of his career as a backup in Washington , Miami and Houston .
When the Texans traded him to the Vikings this offseason , the 31 - year - old thought he was finally getting a chance to be the man .
Now he 'll have to take a seat on the bench , again .
" It 's something that was n't a total shock , " said Rosenfels , who had a strong preseason debut when he completed 10 of 13 passes and led two scoring drives against the Colts on Friday .
" Obviously this has been three months in the ongoing sort of thing .
So for me personally , this was n't what I was hoping for .
I tried to get traded here and got traded here .
" But in my nine years this is the best football team I 've ever been on .
We have so much talent .
If the team needs me this year , when the team needs me this year , I 'm going to be ready . "
The Vikings are expected to challenge for the NFC North title this season , with whoever is behind center .
Rosenfels and Jackson have had some rough moments during practice .
Jackson hurt his knee , missed a few workouts and then returned , but he was out of sync last week against the Colts .
Rosenfels did well , but preseason games are tough to evaluate and Indianapolis held out all four starting defensive backs .
Linebacker Ben Leber had nothing but sympathy for two veterans he watched work so hard during the most grueling part of training camp as they tried to assume control of the team .
He was n't sure if either player could be consoled at this point .
" I do n't know what you say to them , " Leber said .
" It 's hard to sit there and say , ' Hey , keep competing . '
I think it 's pretty clear who is going to be the No. 1 guy .
I guess you have to compete for No. 2 and it will figure itself out . "
Childress sat down with all three incumbent quarterbacks on Tuesday morning before going to the airport to personally pick up Favre .
He said it was " a hard conversation to have " with them all after only three weeks ago telling them they were moving on without Favre .
" But our game is about competing , " Childress said .
" Just like I told our team today again , whatever position you 're at , you 're fighting for the 53 spots on this football team .
You make a huge mistake to count the number in lines or how many are we going to keep .
" The fact is we 've used a couple of quarterbacks every year I 've been here from an injury standpoint .
I think those guys will keep their eye on what they need to do . "
When the possibility of Favre joining the Vikings first arose earlier this offseason , there were reports that Jackson would request a trade .
" I never said that , " Jackson said Tuesday .
" I never said anything like that at all . "
Rosenfels , who has missed two straight practices with a sprained right ankle , was a little more coy when asked if he would seek a trade .
" I do n't know .
I have n't really thought about that , " Rosenfels said .
" I 'm just trying to get my ankle fixed right now .
It 's feeling pretty good for the most part but just trying to get that right .
I have n't even really thought about that stuff . "
Favre also could have to smooth things over with some of the veterans who reported to camp on time , were spurned by him initially , then spent the next two weeks sleeping in those uncomfortable dorm beds at Minnesota State University , Mankato and enduring two - a - day practices .
" Brett Favre is a different player .
He 's a Hall of Fame player , " tight end Visanthe Shiancoe said .
" He can kind of stretch the limits a little bit .
No hard feelings .
He 's here .
It is what it is . "
For his part , Favre said he 's ready to start getting to know his teammates and will ease into a leadership role when the time is right .
" Even though I 've played a long time and been around and played against a lot of guys and played under a lot of coaches and against a lot of coaches , you still have to earn the respect of this team , " Favre said .
" What you 've done in the past is great , but it means nothing here .
...
You earn the respect of these guys and that 's what I intend to do . "
Packers coach Mike McCarthy said after practice Tuesday he was not surprised by Favre 's return .
" I do n't think anybody should be surprised by it , " McCarthy said .
Green Bay visits Minnesota on Oct. 5 , and the Packers host the Vikings on Nov. 1 .
" The bottom line is it 's football , " Favre said .
" Once you step into the huddle , I do n't look at the helmets .
I look at the faces and the guys will know I 'm in it for the right reasons because I still love to play . "
Aaron Rodgers , who inherited the starting quarterback position after Favre retired -- then unretired -- said , " I do n't have a reaction .
It does n't pertain to me .
It has absolutely nothing to do with me .
It does n't change anything .
It has nothing to do with the Green Bay Packers . "
Packers general manager Ted Thompson also did n't want any part
of the Favre situation , which caused a major distraction during the
Packers ' training camp a year ago and lingered on well after Favre
was traded to the Jets .
After dodging a few questions about Favre on Tuesday , Thompson
refused to bite on a question about whether it's wise for a team to
tie its fortunes to a player with commitment issues so late in
training camp .
" You guys just try to get me in trouble , " Thompson said ,
smiling .
Packers linebacker Nick Barnett told the newspaper : " After all those years of not being able to hit him , do I want to hit him ?
Of course I want to hit him .
He 's an awesome guy .
I wish him the best . "

Anti-ableism ?
Ms. Feigelson , who works as a political organizer and volunteer , explained : “ It means against the oppression of those who are physically or mentally disabled , and extends to language .
Like you would n’t use the word ‘ lame . ’ ”
O.K. , then .
Ms. Feigelson was at home with some of her housemates , including Robin Markle , 23 , who works at a community college teaching seniors computer skills , and Gauge , 30 , who is transitioning from he to she and works in an S&M store , and also declined to give a last name .
( “ My family has no idea where I am  or if I ’m even alive  and I ’d like to keep it that way , ” she said . )
They were passing the phone around the afternoon before the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh , where a few of them were planning a trip , intending to protest , Ms. Markle said .
Ms. Feigelson explained that they were being “ super - selective , ” because an activist house , which is what she hopes theirs will be , she said , “ can create tension . ”
But were their hopes too high ?
Their criteria too stringent ?
Helen Fisher , a biological anthropologist at Rutgers University and a relationship expert ( she is the scientific adviser to Chemistry.com , a spinoff of the dating site Match.com ) , took a gander at a few of the ads , including the ones written by Ms. Berger and Ms. Hazard and the gang in Philadelphia .
The idealized , small - scale communities they described reminded her of the hunting and gathering bands of pre-history .
So she was a bit concerned that their creators did n’t seem to be searching for individuals with different skill sets .
Dr. Fisher , whose new book , “ Why Him ?

In the midst of the longest , and probably deepest , postwar recession last year , the U.S. investment position with the rest of the world sharply deteriorated .
At the end of 2008 , America ’s net international investment position was minus $ 3.47 trillion , the Commerce Department reported Friday .
That represents the difference between the value of U.S. assets owned by foreigners ( $ 23.36 trillion ) and the value of foreign assets owned by Americans ( $ 19.89 trillion ) .
At the end of 2007 , the U.S. net international investment position was minus $ 2.14 trillion .
Thus , America ’s net indebtedness with the rest of the world increased by $ 1.33 trillion , or 62 percent , during 2008 .
It was by far the biggest annual increase in data that go back to 1976 .
Foreigners now hold nearly 50 percent of the federal government ’s publicly held debt .
If foreign investors significantly reduce their purchase of future U.S. Treasury debt securities , without even dumping their current holdings , U.S. interest rates could soar and the dollar could collapse , analysts fear .
At minus $ 3.47 trillion , America ’s net debtor status with foreigners represents nearly 25 percent of U.S. gross domestic product , the highest level in history .
“ Three decades of massive [ trade ] deficits have converted the United States from the world ’s banker - able to ‘ pay any price and bear any burden in the cause of freedom ’ - to the world ’s largest debtor , utterly dependent on China and other foreign interests , ” said Charles McMillion , chief economist of Washington - based MBG Information Services .
Essentially , America ’s net international investment position is driven by what the United States borrows from the rest of the world to finance its ongoing trade deficit , said Brad Setser , a fellow for geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations .
Over the 2003 - 07 period , however , foreign equity markets outperformed the U.S. stock market , and the dollar steadily depreciated .
These two factors reduced the annual deterioration in America ’s investment position that otherwise would have been dictated by massive U.S. trade deficits during this period .
“ Both of those factors reversed themselves last year , ” Mr. Setser said .
The dollar appreciated , and foreign stock markets suffered bigger declines than America’s .
As a result , America ’s net debtor status worsened significantly more during 2008 than its nearly $ 700 billion trade deficit would have dictated , Mr. Setser explained .
Over the years , America ’s status as a creditor or debtor has changed enormously .
In the early 1980s , America ’s net international investment position averaged $ 350 billion , or 11 percent of GDP , making the United States the world ’s largest creditor .
Today , it is the world ’s largest debtor - by far .
As recently as 1996 , America ’s net debtor status was minus $ 456 billion .
Since 1996 , it has increased by more than $ 3 trillion , or 660 percent , as America ’s 12 - year cumulative trade deficit soared by $ 5.7 trillion .
Foreign governments have taken notice - in particular , China , which now holds more U.S. Treasury debt than any other country .
In the 12 months through April , China ’s portfolio of Treasury debt securities has soared by more than a quarter of a trillion dollars to nearly $ 800 billion .
In its annual financial stability report issued on Friday , China ’s central bank once again declared there were serious problems with the global monetary system ’s reliance on a single dominant currency - the dollar .
An estimated 65 percent to 70 percent of China ’s $ 2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves , the world ’s largest stockpile , is held in dollar - denominated assets .
The People ’s Bank of China also warned the United States on Friday about its very expansionary monetary and fiscal policies .
“ We are so deeply in debt and this money is so liquid that it hamstrings our monetary , fiscal and trade policies , ” Mr. McMillion said .
“ We ’ve really mortgaged our financial future . ”

A colossal new ring has been identified around Saturn .
The dusty hoop lies some 13 million km ( eight million miles ) from the planet , about 50 times more distant than the other rings and in a different plane .
Scientists tell the journal Nature that the tenuous ring is probably made up of debris kicked off Saturn 's moon Phoebe by small impacts .
They think this dust then migrates towards the planet where it is picked up by another Saturnian moon , Iapetus .
The particles smack Iapetus like bugs on a windshield
Dr Anne Verbiscer , University of Virginia Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The discovery would appear to resolve a longstanding mystery in planetary science : why the walnut - shaped Iapetus has a two - tone complexion , with one side of the moon significantly darker than the other .
" It has essentially a head - on collision .
The particles smack Iapetus like bugs on a windshield , " said Anne Verbiscer from the University of Virginia , US .
Observations of the material coating the dark face of Iapetus indicate it has a similar composition to the surface material on Phoebe .
The scale of the new ring feature is astonishing .
Nothing like it has been seen elsewhere in the Solar System .
The more easily visible outlier in Saturn 's famous bands of ice and dust is its E-ring , which encompasses the orbit of the moon Enceladus .
This circles the planet at a distance of just 240,000 km .
The newly identified torus is not only much broader and further out , it is also tilted at an angle of 27 degrees to the plane on which the more traditional rings sit .
This in itself strongly links the ring 's origin to Phoebe , which also takes a highly inclined path around Saturn .
Scientists suspected the ring might be present and had the perfect tool in the Spitzer space telescope to confirm it .
The US space agency observatory is well suited to picking up the infrared signal expected from cold grains of dust about 10 microns ( millionths of a metre ) in size .
Impacts on the moon Phoebe are probably supplying the ring

The ring would probably have a range of particle sizes - some bigger than this , and some smaller .
Modelling indicates the pressure of sunlight would push the smallest of these grains towards the orbit of Iapetus , which is circling Saturn at a distance of 3.5 million km .
" The particles are very , very tiny , so the ring is very , very tenuous ; and actually if you were standing in the ring itself , you would n't even know it , " Dr Verbiscer told BBC News .
" In a cubic km of space , there are all of 10 - 20 particles . "
Indeed , so feeble is the ring that scientists have calculated that if all the material were gathered up , it would fill a crater on Phoebe no more than a kilometre across .
The moon is certainly a credible source for the dust .
It is heavily pockmarked .
It is clear that throughout its history , Phoebe has been hit many , many times by space rocks and clumps of ice .
" We 've got a ' smoking gun ' , " said Professor Carl Murray , a scientist working on the US - European Cassini probe , which is currently touring the Saturnian system .
" We know now that this is where this coating at Iapetus comes from .
Phoebe is the source .
Something has hit Phoebe , produced lots of material that moves around the orbit of Phoebe and then gradually spirals in .
We 've solved several mysteries with this observation , " the UK researcher told BBC News .

Editor 's note : Blue Demon , an icon in Mexican wrestling and culture , kicked off his career without the use of a mask in Laredo , Texas , wrestling under the names El Tosco and El Manotas .
He started to forge his legend in September 1948 , designing a blue mask with silver trimming near his eyes , nose and mouth , and fighting under the name that to this day is known in Mexico and various parts of the world .
His career took off in 1952 when he avenged a loss suffered by his tag - team partner , Black Shadow , against The Saint -- El Santo , a figure widely recognized in the Aztec country and with whom he developed a fierce rivalry .
Blue Demon beat the silver - masked man for the National Wrestling Alliance World Welterweight title , which increased his popularity among wrestling fans .
Eventually , the rivalry and popularity of both grapplers transcended the ropes and reached the movie studios .
Although they were athletic rivals , they starred together in about 10 films , transforming themselves into authentic movie stars and icons in Mexican culture .
Blue Demon died in 2000 at the age of 78 .
His adopted son Blue Demon Jr. continued the legacy by building his own successful career in the squared circle , where he currently is the NWA World Heavyweight Champion .
Blue Demon Jr. also has found success outside the ring .
His character is that of a villain , but his selfless charity work , especially with children stricken with cancer , shows that not all demons are bad .
He wrote this first - person account of his father and his craft in Spanish for ESPNdeportes.com .
It is translated into English here .
October 2009 in Mexico City
This is your friend Blue Demon Jr. , and before anything , I would like to thank all of you for your awareness in the celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month .
It 's my duty and honor to continue the legend that my father , Blue Demon , built in Mexican wrestling .
Here 's the legend , the original Blue Demon , a worthy role model .
Courtesy of bluedemon.com.mx
Talking about my father is like talking about 1,000 things and would take up a lot of time .
But I will be brief in telling you about my dad as a human being , the part of him least known .
He was a calm person , quiet and very dry in his way of life .
As the years satisfyingly went on , I tried to adopt that aspect of my dad ; thus I came away with a tender part of his personality , if it can be said that way .
I feel that as an athlete , he was one of the best figures in the world of wrestling ; and I think the way he handled his skills , and the way he handled his image and his trajectory were simply very admirable .
He is n't with us any longer , but I can tell you he's one of the most complete wrestlers in the history of wrestling .
The story of how I found out my dad was a wrestler is simple .
When I was five years old , we were in the car on our way to Cortijo in Romero Rubio colony .
My mother , Goyita , was driving and my dad was in the front seat as the co-pilot , while I was in the back , distracted ; and even though I knew we were on our way to the wrestling match , I really did n't have it in my mind what was going on back home .
I saw masks and magazines , but I could n't imagine anything else .
And by sheer chance , I liked watching the Blue Demon wrestle .
Of all the wrestlers , he was the one who got my attention , without my ever imagining he was my dad .
But that day , specifically , I was thinking about other things , playing , and all of a sudden as we approached the arena , the fans started pounding on the car and screaming , " Blue Demon ! Blue Demon ! "
I saw that my father already had the mask , and in that moment , I got the picture that my idol was my dad , and I 'd had him there for so long without noticing .
I can tell you that what I admired most about my dad as an athlete and as a person was his sense of responsibility .
Most people know wrestling can cause injuries and traveling from one place to another will get you tired .
Add both together , and they will cause a great level of physical exhaustion .
But even at that , my dad made sure never to miss a show .
And in his time , the life was n't like it is now .
Now , you travel more comfortably , but he traveled in trucks and in uncertain conditions , and being in it for a long time was really grueling .
Nonetheless , his sense of responsibility always made him comply with all his commitments .
As the years passed and as I inherited his image , I knew there were a lot of responsibilities and I learned how to situate where I am .
Feeding the ego is very important for most people , and it was even more important to me , being the heir to the Blue Demon .
I did n't want to tell anyone I was his son , but fortunately , the wrestling magic makes us overcome the obstacle of not being able to say who we are , feeding that ego .
People see a mask , and it 's simply a mask .
The person under it , whoever it is , does n't matter .
The mask and the character -- not the person -- are the motor that drives the people 's passion .
And I think a lot of us , deep inside , want to say , " I am so - and - so , " and be recognized .
Before a Cinco de Mayo match in Los Angeles this year , Blue Demon Jr. gets in the proper frame of mind .

The biggest responsibility in keeping with my dad 's legacy is staying in that line , with the trajectory and the tradition .
You have to follow a line as far as carrying yourself in society .
You are a role model to a lot of people , and many will follow your example .
You need to have a good path , a good image .
Be honest .
You can't be a person with scandals that 's what was instilled in me to keep up with this dynasty .
Not only is it jumping into the legacy and seeing what happens , but it 's working it , too , not only physically but also mentally , so you can bring out a sense of being in all meanings .
Since I took on the continuation of the legacy my dad forged , I 've known that a lot of people say wrestling is n't a sport , and I respect everyone 's opinions -- those of the true expert and those of they who think they know .
It 's obvious that the less knowledgeable always will say , when the wrestling is real and there is a maneuver and maneuver - breaker on the canvas , that that is not real wrestling .
They want to see high - flying moves .
They want to see blood .
But that 's not the essence of wrestling .
They think the sport is aerial .
That 's a joke .
Well , I consider wrestling to be like a circus , stunts , theater and a sport .
It 's a circus because it originates from the Roman circus .
It 's theater because it involves masked characters .
The Greeks did it that way , and to this day , you still see a happy mask and a sad one .
Even more , it represents the good and the bad , black and white , cold and hot .
It represents the daily fight of the good versus the bad , and it's a sport in which you have to cultivate yourself physically and mentally in order to sustain the physical wear and tear in a match .
It is n't just stepping into the ring and jumping around .
You have to learn how to wrestle in different styles : freestyle , Greco - Roman , submission and professionally .
You actually have to learn how to fall .
You have to position the body when you fall , because even God wo n't take away the blow if you are n't positioned properly .
We learn how to fall as evenly as possible .
But people keep thinking wrestling is fake , that in some fights all you see is ketchup or paint and not blood .
People think we do n't hurt ourselves .
But our sport is the same as any other in that there is a physical risk .
Wrestling is a not a contact sport ; wrestling is a sport of physical impact .
There always are injuries that disfigure the body to the degree that a majority of old wrestlers carry canes or have back injuries .
I think that reflects two things : ( 1 ) the wrestlers ' professionalism to keep working while hurt and being there for the public ; and ( 2 ) their love for this sport .
This move against El Hijo Del Santo in London last year is proof that Blue Demon Jr. knows how to position his body to fall .

It saddens me that Mexican wrestling is going through a bad time .
I foretold this would happen when American wrestling , World Wrestling Entertainment , arrived via television .
I think the sport is being overexposed on television .
You turn to a channel , and there is a wrestling show .
Two days later , you turn to another channel , and there is a wrestling show .
You turn to cable television , and there is another show .
The show is overexposed .
Therefore , people wo n't go to the arenas .
And , yes , to that we add that the WWE has produced mega - shows with lights , fireworks , video , beautiful women , " monsters " in the ring who are physical specimens .
Obviously , they attract the people 's attention .
It is n't like that in Mexico , but that 's what we are up against .
I think the problem is with the companies that have the resources to compete with the American companies but do n't .
They 're sleeping on it .
This hurts , because I have seen fellow wrestlers who have dedicated themselves 100 percent to wrestling , and it is putting their way of life in danger .
Wrestling has allowed me to combine my passion for the sport with the mission of helping those who need it .
In my case , I consider myself an antihero , since my ring name does n't allow me to have the image of someone who is good .
I 'm a demon , and I have to be that way in the ring .
But underneath , I do n't care about that path .
I know I have to follow it to get what I want .
That 's why I 'm happy to have the Blue Foundation -- Fundación Azul -- which helps kids who have cancer by being an intermediary between donors and the sick .
And I help to assemble conferences where we invite college students to develop awareness about health issues .
We want to educate people to have a preventative culture with diseases so that they see a doctor before they are sick .
They will go when they are healthy or at an early stage of an illness to detect anything that 's wrong .
We want to make people healthy , and above all , we want to make people smile , because kids should n't worry about anything other than being kids and having happy childhoods .
As you can see , I try to appreciate life .
I like to help others .
I would like my dad 's legacy to continue , the character to be maintained , be it by a family member or by someone else , so that it keeps on going with a representative who has dignity .
My dad knew how to prepare me to be who I am now , and I prepared myself during certain stages of my life .
Inside , I think I was the person destined to carry on the Blue Demon name , and that 's why I got it in the ring .
I will definitely do what my father did to find the next person to keep the character alive .
Google 's digital library plans have met with strong opposition .
Google co-founder Sergey Brin has hit out at critics of the company 's plans to create what could be the world 's largest virtual library .
Writing in the New York Times , Mr Brin said he wanted to " dispel some myths " surrounding the project .
He said the plan would make millions of " out - of - print " books available to the public online .
Those against the idea fear it would give Google a monopoly over access to the world 's information .
" In reality , nothing in this agreement precludes any other company or organisation from pursuing their own similar effort , " he wrote .
" The agreement limits consumer choice in out - of - print books about as much as it limits consumer choice in unicorns .
" Today , if you want to access a typical out - of - print book , you have only one choice  fly to one of a handful of leading libraries in the country and hope to find it in the stacks . "
' No deal ' Google Books - formerly known as Google print - was first launched in 2004 .
It aims to scan millions of the world 's books and make them available - and searchable - online .
However , in 2005 the Authors Guild of America and Association of American Publishers sued Google over " massive copyright infringement " .
Google countered that its project represented " fair use " .
Many of us are objecting because we have been working together for years on the mass scanning of out - of - print books ... and Google 's ' settlement ' could hurt our efforts
Brewster Khale , Internet Archive
The search giant settled the lawsuit in 2008 .
In that deal , Google agreed to pay $ 125 m ( £ 76 m ) to create a Book Rights Registry , where authors and publishers could register works and receive compensation .
Authors and publishers would get 70 % from the sale of these books with Google keeping the remaining 30 % .
Google would also be given the right to digitise orphan works , titles where the authors can not be found .
There are thought to be around five million of these works .
A decision on whether the deal could go through was originally scheduled for early October .
But , after an outpouring of criticism - from governments , technology companies , privacy advocates and consumer watchdogs - as well as formal objections from the US Department of Justice , the presiding Judge sent the deal back to the drawing board .
" Many of us are objecting because we have been working together for years on the mass scanning of out - of - print books - and have worked to get books online for far longer than Google - and Google 's ' settlement ' could hurt our efforts , " wrote Brewster Khale of the Internet Archive in a blog post earlier this week .
The Internet Archive has a competing project , which aims to offer a free digital library .
It scans around 1000 books a day .
" A major part of our efforts have concentrated on changing the law so everyone would benefit . "
On Wednesday , the judge said the hearing on the reworked settlement would begin on 9 November .
' History lesson '
Is Google safeguarding our cultural heritage ?
Mr Brin addressed three major criticisms in his column in the New York Times about the terms of the Book Rights Registry , the quality of the scans Google would offer and concerns about competition .
Whilst he admitted in the short term Google would effectively dominate the market , he said ultimately other projects would benefit from the firm 's work .
" If Google Books is successful , others will follow , " he wrote .
" They will have an easier path : this agreement creates a books rights registry that will encourage rights holders to come forward and will provide a convenient way for other projects to obtain permissions .
" While new projects will not immediately have the same rights to orphan works , the agreement will be a beacon of compromise in case of a similar lawsuit . "
He also argued that the firm was safeguarding the world 's cultural heritage .
" The famous library at Alexandria burned three times , in 48 BC , AD 273 and AD 640 , as did the Library of Congress , where a fire in 1851 destroyed two - thirds of the collection , " he wrote .
" I hope such destruction never happens again , but history would suggest otherwise . "

" DO PEOPLE’S FIRST NAMES MATCH THEIR FACES ? "
ALAMIR
Many people think that someone they know look like they are better suited for another name .
One study set out to find the correlation between faces ... more ...
To a list of glittering ­accolades which already ­includes " owner of a £ 225 biro " , ­Manchester Gorton MP Gerald Kaufman recently added the status of clinician .
" I 've got this ­self - diagnosed OCD , " Gerald announced blithely , which makes him do things like request taxpayer reimbursement for an £ 8,865 state of the art Bang & ­Olufsen television .
Indeed , it is Gerald 's condition that forces him to eat the grapefruit part of his daily breakfast from one of a pair of £ 220 Waterford Crystal bowls , and when his cleaner broke said cut - glass vessel , he promptly claimed for another one .
I do beg your pardon : he claimed for another pair .
How have you found this week ?
Forgive the presumption , for I lack Gerald 's skills as a medical diagnostician , but it would seem the British public is in need of anger management .
Not anger management in the conventional sense of the term , whereby sufferers are encouraged to temper their rage in rational statements such as : " I feel sad when you spend my taxes clearing your moat .
I understand you might have a different point of view .
Let 's try to work through this coming from a place of love . "
No , we have been so extraordinarily provoked on so many different levels that it is becoming difficult to manage one 's anger in - tray .
There are simply too many righteous furies piling up .
In the old days , one might have got one 's MP on the case , but for luminously obvious reasons that avenue seems rather defunct now .
I found myself losing the will to live during a phone call to my MP Mark Field 's office yesterday , in which I noted the vital importance to his work as an MP of book purchases such as Peter Shilton 's autobiography , but wondered after the £ 3,000 commission for shelves in a home office .
Who had built them ?
Chippendale ?
His assistant 's response was to giggle .
We 're all nihilists now .
For many the experience of daily horror began fairly early on in Tony Blair 's administration – with his conception , in hindsight – but the pace picked up for all and sundry last year as the spectacular follies of the banking system were revealed .
Yet how quickly did credit default swaps give way to duck houses , and other forms of common larceny rather easier to understand .
And this tumultuous period does n't feel remotely over .
Loth as I am to add to that anger in - tray , those of you who had an establishment trifecta are in luck .
In a week in which unemployment hit 2.26 million , it emerges that Prince Charles , a man who does not even put the toothpaste on his own toothbrush , got Richard Rogers sacked from the Chelsea Barracks development after two - and - a - half years on a project which the architect estimates could have provided 10,000 jobs .
And where do you even start on the repulsively indolent Prince Andrew , who has just blown yet another few grand being helicoptered to a party at his golf club ?
If the royal family 's ludicrous drain on the public purse is not next in line for scrutiny and outcry , then there will be something seriously wrong with us .
Already the serfs seem restless , with former planning minister Nick Raynsford describing Prince Charles 's intervention as " almost feudal " .
And so it is .
That the prince should judge now to be the time to be misusing his power confirms that those famously outsized ears are made of tin , and suggests the same ghastly confidence that allowed the rot to set in at Westminster .
It 's all so après moi le déluge .
But will the deluge come ?
Are we at that defining moment where the demand for serious constitutional change becomes a business imperative for anyone seeking power , or will things continue as they have before ?
The signs tend ominously toward the latter .
David Cameron has been judged within Westminster to have had a good expenses crisis , which tells you all you need to know about how completely that rotten enclave still fails to get it .
It simply will not be sufficiently boil - lancing to flip the government and the opposition , installing as chancellor a man who claimed £ 47 for two DVDs of his own speech on " value for taxpayers ' money " .
The noises off are the ones to listen to .
" Is he going to be a new Thatcher , which is what the country really needs ? " asked Rupert Murdoch of ­Cameron this week .
" The UK ­desperately needs less government and freer markets , " is ­Murdoch 's ruling .
Meanwhile Vince Cable voices amazement that ­self - regulation is still deemed the answer , warning that the bankers are getting back to their old ways , delighted to have been superseded in the public outrage by MPs .
And all the while unemployment and the fear of it looms , leaving many too harried and distracted to apply pressure on the governing class .
What a savage irony it would be if a system whose intrinsic failings caused these fiascos were to be saved by default , as people struggle to simply weather the misery those same fiascos have caused .
But manage our anger we must .
Call it a revolution if you like , but the only thing that can fix this hideous , ­many - headed mess is wholesale constitutional change , and those seeking a direction for their fury should be demanding it as rabidly as they dare .
Rachel reports on the latest revelations to come out of the U.S. Attorney firings scandal .
Maddow :
In 2006 , nine U.S. federal attorneys , prosecutors , were surprisingly and suddenly fired by the Department of Justice under George W. Bush .
U.S. Attorney Paulson Charlton of Arizona was fired while he was in the midst of building a case against Republican Congressman Rick Renzi for an allegedly illegal land swap deal that would eventually lead to a 35 - count indictment , including charges of conspiracy , wire fraud , money laundering and extortion .
And in San Diego , U.S. Attorney Carol Lam had spearheaded the corruption investigation that brought down Republican Congressman Duke Cunningham , who eventually pled guilty to accepting at least $ 2.4 million in bribes .
The " Dukester " is still doing more than eight years in prison for that .
And then there was U.S. attorney David Iglesias .
And Mr. Iglesias ' dismissal really caught people 's attention and the House Judiciary Committee has been looking into his case and the cases of the eight attorneys for more than two years now .
Well , today , that committee released emails and transcripts of closed - door testimony by Bush 's White House counsel , Harriet Miers , and Bush 's political guru , Karl Rove .
Ms. Miers testified that the White House , specifically Karl Rove and his staff , were intimately involved in the decision - making process about whether or not the supposedly independent U.S. attorneys , the supposedly apolitical prosecutors , were going to be allowed to keep their jobs .

This Week in HTML5 – Episode 36
Since I started publishing these weekly summaries over a year ago , I 've watched the HTML5 specification grow up .
In episode 1 , the big news of the week was the birth of an entirely new specification ( Web Workers ) .
Slowly , steadily , and sometimes painstakingly , the HTML5 specification has matured to the point where the hottest topic last week was the removal of a little - used element ( < dialog > ) and the struggle to find a suitable replacement for marking up conversations .
This week 's changes are mundane , and I expect ( and hope ! ) that future summaries will be even more mundane .
That 's a good thing ; it tells me that , as implementors continue implementing and authors continue authoring , there are no show - stoppers and fewer and fewer " gotchas " to trip them up .
Thus , the overarching theme this week -- and I use the term " theme " very loosely -- is " the never - ending struggle to get the details right . "
Parsing
HTML5 is full of algorithms .
Most of them are small parts of one mega- algorithm , called Parsing HTML Documents .
Contrary to popular belief , the HTML parsing algorithm is deterministic : for any sequence of bytes , there is one ( and only one ) " correct " way to interpret it as HTML .
Notice I said " any sequence of bytes , " not just " any sequence of bytes that conforms to a specific DTD or schema . "
This is intentional ; HTML5 not only defines what constitutes " valid " HTML markup ( for the benefit of conformance checkers ) , it also defines how to parse " invalid " markup ( for the benefit of browsers and other HTML consumers that take existing web content as input ) .
And sweet honey on a stick , there sure is a lot of invalid markup out there .
Accessibility
As with so many things in the accessibility world , all of this week 's changes revolve around the thorny problem of focus .
I previously explained why focus is so important in episode 24 .
r3887 specifies that each < area > in a client - side image map should be focusable .
in a client - side image map should be focusable .
r3919 encourages browser vendors to expose tooltips to keyboard - only users .
For example , in Firefox 3.5 , if you hover your cursor over a hyperlink that defines a title attribute , you will see the title attribute as a tooltip .
But if you tab to the same link with the keyboard , no tooltip appears .
Now imagine that you 're physically unable to use a mouse , and you begin to see the problem .

Now imagine that you 're physically unable to use a mouse , and you begin to see the problem .
[ Background : Bug 7362 and Issue 80 ] r3928 defines an intriguing proposal about canvas accessibility , which probably deserves its own article .
Here 's the short version : you can already define " fallback content " within a < canvas > element that is shown to browsers that do n't support the canvas API .
This change dictates that the " fallback content " should remain keyboard - focusable even in browsers that do support the canvas API .
To quote the spec : " This allows authors to make an interactive canvas keyboard - focusable : authors should have a one - to - one mapping of interactive regions to focusable elements in the fallback content . "
This is a draft proposal ; as far as I know , no browser actually supports it yet , and it may get reverted in the future .

Security
All of this week 's security - related changes revolve around document .
domain .
As you might expect from its name , this property returns the domain name of the current document .
Unfortunately ( for security ) , the property is not read - only ; you can also set document .
domain to pretty much anything .
This can cause all sorts of horrible side effects , since so many things ( cookies , local storage , same - origin restrictions on XMLHttpRequest ) rely on the domain of the document .
This set of changes attempts to reduce the nasty side effects ( and the possible attack surface ) in case you absolutely must set document .
domain to something other than its default calcuated value .
Semantics
Video
As regular readers of this column are aware , one of the big new user - visible features of HTML5 is native video support without plugins .
As video is incredibly complicated , so to is the video support in HTML5 .
( Although not related to this week 's changes , you may be interested to read my series , A gentle introduction to video encoding . )
Web Forms
Forms continue to be difficult .
r3874 allows browsers to reset the list of selected files of an < input type = " file " > element by setting its value attribute to the empty string .

Leading senators say ambitious climate change bill will give America a chance to reclaim its energy independence
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Democratic leaders took on the epic challenge of getting the US Senate to act on global warming today with the formal unveiling of a bill proposing an ambitious 20 % cut in greenhouse gas emissions .
Senate Democrats turned out in strength for today 's launch , which was seen at home and abroad as a crucial moment for advancing Barack Obama 's agenda .
But the difficulties ahead were underscored by the senators ' deep reluctance to use the words ' climate change ' — even in the title of the bill , which is called the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act .
Instead , senators John Kerry and Barbara Boxer couched their bill as a chance for America to reclaim its energy independence by reducing oil imports .
" This is a security bill that puts Americans back in charge of our energy future , " said Kerry .
" It is our country 's defence against the harms of pollution and the security risks of global climate change . "
Today 's bill sets out a more ambitious target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions than the 17 % cut from 2005 levels by 2020 passed by the House of Representatives in June .
The draft would push for a 20 % reduction from 2005 levels by 2020 and an 83 % reduction by 2050 .
The targets appear chosen for their resonance with European and Asian leaders .
International negotiators have been looking to America to demonstrate commitment to action on climate change ahead of a meeting at Copenhagen in December cast by the United Nations as a last chance to avoid catastrophic warming .
Otherwise , the bill appeared constructed according to advice of pollsters , which have regularly advised Democrats to cloak climate change action in the language of green job creation and national security .
In a summary released today , Kerry and Boxer said their bill was aimed at " putting America back in control of our energy future , reasserting American economic leadership and competitiveness , protecting our families from pollution , and ensuring our national security " .
They began by laying out $ 10 bn ( £ 6.3 bn ) over 10 years for research into carbon capture technology and for pledging a greater role for nuclear power in America 's energy mix .
The summary promised " robust border measures " against states which do not act to cut carbon emissions , presumably China and India .
It also sought to downplay the significance of its emissions cuts , arguing that fewer than 2 % of American businesses would be affected .
" The system applies only to the largest polluters in the country - initially around 7,500 facilities that account for nearly three - quarters of US carbon pollution .
Over 98 % of American businesses , including farmers , are not covered by this programme , " the summary said .
Despite such manoeuvring , it is far from clear that the Senate will be able to pivot from its battles over healthcare to climate change and make significant progress before the Copenhagen meeting .
The 800 - page draft bill , which is still being worked on , is almost certain to undergo significant changes in the coming weeks with Democrats struggling to build support even from within their own ranks .
" Complex processes are part and parcel of passing major legislation , " Tony Kreindler of the Environmental Defence Fund said .
" The most important thing is that the draft be taken for what it is : a starting point that Senators can work with , tailor and pass . "
Republicans , who are expected to largely oppose the bill , organised their own counter - press conference today .
Negotiation Tips For Beginners – A Real Life Example Of How I Saved $ 150 With Just A Few Questions
Tweet
Let me be blunt .
I ’m no master negotiator .
Of course , the title of this essay is n’t “ Negotiation Tips for Masters ” !
Over the last few years though , I have slowly picked up a few tips and tricks that I try to use from time to time to save money .
Most of these techniques are best utilized to negotiate products or services .
However , they can easily be adapted and used to negotiate salaries , job opportunities , or even help resolve an everyday argument .
While I had my Real Estate business , they often came in handy when negotiating everything from short sales to lease - options and from tenant complaints to refinances .
This is n’t a definitive guide , rather an invitation to open a discussion .
My ultimate hope is that a couple of the tips demonstrate how everyday negotiating does n’t have to be a sleazy , awkward process .
We all negotiate everyday whether we like it or not .
Up until recent years , I simply chose to ignore that fact , which has cost me more money than I want to think about .
As part of the discussion , please feel welcome to add your own tips , suggestions , and criticisms !
I look forward to hearing your responses .
How to morph from “ scared ” into “ comfortable ” when negotiating
Most people who are comfortable negotiating will tell you that the hardest part of the transition was overcoming the unjustified fear we attach to the negotiating process .
Obviously , very few people intentionally strive to get into awkward social situations .
But the truth is there ’s no rule that everyday negotiating has to be awkward .
More times than not this fear is self - perpetuating .
Here are a couple truisms that I adopted that quickly and radically shifted my view of the negotiating process :
The true value of an item is what someone is willing to pay for it .
If you want to quickly realize how true this really is , get into Real Estate .
Stop looking at price tags , service charges , and listing prices as set in stone !
These numbers are simply the high - end starting point .
People give discounts all the time for all sorts of creative reasons .
There are very few places and very few situations where you ca n’t negotiate .
Not the other way around .
Realize that you have the RIGHT to negotiate .
Embrace this .
Seriously .
Chances are you ’ve worked very hard for your money .
It ’s your RIGHT to ask for a better price , more benefits , a free warranty , or a 20 % first - time - customer discount .
Your business is extremely valuable !
And here ’s another little secret : most vendors want you to negotiate .
They ’d love to give a quick 10 - 20 % discount if it means retaining you as a customer .
Most pay far more than that on average to get a new customer .
Show them your value and exercise your right to negotiate !
Once I adapted these two truisms into my daily life , my fear of negotiating all but dissipated .
I have to admit , it feels empowering to comfortably ask and receive a discount on an item that I would have normally paid full price for anyway .
Ensuring that we do n’t overpay for no reason ( a.k.a. consistently pay advertised price ) has become an integral part of Courtney and I ’s financial plan .
The Story : How I saved $ 150 with a few simple questions !
I feel like it ’s important to be open and honest about both successes and failures .
Therefore , I ’ve decided to share this story even though parts of it are embarrassing !
A couple weeks ago , as we continued to prepare ourselves for our move overseas we realized that we would soon lose our decent health and dental coverage .
I knew I needed to get in to see the dentist before we left .
To be honest , I was pretty scared of what the results would be .
Even since leaving home for college , I ’ve neglected my dental hygiene .
Sure , I brushed my teeth regularly , but nowhere close to two times per day .
I ’ve realized that what I call “ brushing ” really was n’t doing much at all .
I was n’t using the proper technique and certainly was n’t being as thorough as I needed to .
And let ’s not even talk about flossing .
To be honest , I just did n’t view it as necessary .
It was n’t part of my routine , and I was just too lazy to realize the damage I was doing .
Big mistake !
I sat down for a basic examination of what inevitable work I would need only 3 days before we were to leave for Australia .
I had backed myself into a big corner .
Quickly , I realized the gravity of the situation as the dentist reviewed the x-rays and photos they had taken .
I had the early stages of gum disease , along with a couple minor cavities .
Gum disease , even in the early stages , at age 25 is nothing you really wanted to write home about .
However , the good news is that it was very treatable and just the slap in the face I needed to re-commit to proper dental hygiene .
I knew even more bad news was around the corner , though !
We had basic dental coverage which only paid for 80 % of all work .
In addition , I knew that some other procedures where only covered at 50 % ( or not at all ) depending on whether they were classified as “ cosmetic ” .
Around the corner came the billing receptionist :
Billing : Here ’s a quote on the services that are recommended .
Look it over and I ’ll help explain how it ’s set up and answer any questions you have .
The initial quote contained non-insured charges of $ 587 dollars ( and another $ 1300 + in insured ) .
We went over the suggested plan item - by - item so she could explain how each charge corresponded to my conversation with the dentist .
The was nothing extra we had n’t discussed and I quickly realized that I desperately needed to get this work done before it became worse and at least while a portion was covered by insurance .
One thing that did jump out at me was five $ 38.00 charges for an antibiotic injection that was n’t covered at all .
I asked the billing receptionist about the charges :
Baker : Hmmm , I see that there are 5 different antibiotic injections here for $ 38 dollars each that are n’t covered at all .
Do you guys have any other options available for me ?
Can we use a different antibiotic that may be more affordable or partially covered by my insurance ?
Billing : Ummm , let me check on that for you …
[ After a couple minutes , she re-enters with a new printed quote ]
Billing : Well , we do n’t have any generic options for that antibiotic and your insurance does n’t have any coverage .
However , due to your situation I was able to get those reduced to $ 20 each instead of the $ 38 .
That immediately knocked $ 90 off the bill !
Since it only took a couple seconds to inquire about any other options , I was quite pleased with that reduction .
I spent the next couple minutes talking about some of the other procedures , including the difference between grey fillings and white fillings and how they were viewed by insurance .
I made sure I understood each item and that I truly needed everything listed ( which I did , unfortunately ) .
Baker :
Thanks for all the help .
One last question …
I ’ve talked to the nurses about potentially doing these procedures as early as tomorrow .
What is your discount for paying the entire bill up front and in cash ?
Billing : Ummmm … [ 3 long seconds ]
If you can do it tomorrow , we could probably do 10 % off your fees .
Baker :
That would make it much easier to show to my wife .
Can you print out a new quote reflecting those changes ?
Billing : Sure , I ’ll be right back .
Another $ 50 bucks knocked off with a simple question .
Remembering that I absolutely needed the work done and was working under a time - frame of around 48 hours , I was very pleased .
Despite popular belief , it was n’t awkward at all .
That brought the total to just over $ 447 , just under 24 % off .
Sure 24 % off is n’t going to win any Master Negotiator awards , but most people are too afraid even to ask in the first place .
I might have even been able to push for more , but honestly I had received fantastic customer service and they were rearranging things in order to get me in before the trip .
Both parties were happy .
Even just a few years ago , I would have just paid the bill without inquiring much about it .
I would have been timid and would have shied away from negotiating from fear of rejection .
For the average person , just a few tips can make a big difference .
There are a couple that I consistently try to remember when negotiating purchases like the one above .
Basic Negotiation Tips I Did Well
Find common ground early … return often … –
This is a simple rapport - building tip , however so much of negotiating is simply having great rapport .
I try to utilize this in all new situation , not only ones I intend to negotiate .
While at the dentist , we had conversations about my family , my upcoming trip , and even my blog all before discussing the bill .
Turns out several of the nurses and the dentist all love travel , too !
Who does n’t really ?
Quickly try to isolate the shot - caller –
It ’s important that you are negotiating with someone who has the power to actually make the needed changes .
It ’s o.k. to politely ask to speak to someone whom is able to grant the discount .
Look for mangers , owners , and people who directly handle billing .
In my case , I got lucky that the “ billing receptionist ” had the ability to provide the discounts on the spot .
Establish the “ Man Behind The Curtain ” early – On the flip side of the above point , if at all possible try to establish early that you will have to discuss all final decisions with another party .
In my case , I told the receptionist very early that “ I will , of course , have to run everything by my wife before finalizing anything . ”
You can use a wife , business partner , or attorney depending on the situation .
Companies have been using this on you for years ( think car sales ) .
Do n’t feel bad for providing yourself an out .
Hmmm … Wow… Gasp… –
This one takes a little more finesse , but has been very effective for me .
The basic idea is to respond with a reaction of “ surprise ” upon reading or hearing an offer .
I tend to use “ hmmm … ” to imply that I ’m a little uncomfortable and am thinking about the figure .
It ’s a little less intense than using “ wow ” or gasping slightly .
The key is to provide a subtle indication to the other party that you are looking for something different .
Inquire about alternative “ more affordable ” options – This is a great way to be non-confrontational while still “ asking ” for a discount .
This is one of my favorite ways to start negotiating .
In the example above , this helped me save the first $ 90 by asking about alternative antibiotic options .
Service providers often have many different methods and / or materials they use to do similar jobs .
You wo n’t know your options unless you ask !
Shut up and ask !
–
At some point , all the fancy tips in the world wo n’t net you what simply asking for a discount will .
Although asking about alternative options is a great way to be non-confrontational , being too vague is a great way to make a situation awkward .
At some point in the negotiation you need to just get over it and ask .
I ’ve found that 9 times out of 10 , I ’m amazed at the results !
Frame desires / benefits as concessions if possible –
This is another tip that requires a little practice and finesse .
The key here is to demonstrate the value you bring in the most positive way .
In my personal example , I implied that I would pay the bill in full up - front and very quickly ( tomorrow ) .
In reality , I only had 48 hours to get the work done before I was going to leave , so I was in a time crunch anyway .
There was nothing dishonest in this approach .
Getting paid quickly and upfront is still of great value to the dentist office .
I just wanted to frame this fact in the most positive light for myself !
Imply a discount – This is a simple tip that only requires changing a couple words , but that is very powerful .
Instead of asking “ Do you offer a discount for active military personnel ? ”
You replace that with “ What is your discount for active military personnel ? ”
Of course , the first can simply be answered with “ no… sorry ” , while the latter is often much more difficult to quickly dismiss .
I used this example this past Christmas when my brother was home shopping for clothes ( he is currently serving in Afghanistan ) !
Do n’t negotiate against yourself .
Just be quiet .
–
You ’ve just asked for a discount .
You framed your value properly and implied a discount .
The quickest way to shoot yourself in the foot is to talk before the other party .
Just keep your mouth shut .
I ’ll admit sometime the silence can get a little weird , but opening your mouth will cost you money in the long run .
Once again , I ’ve learned this the hard way .
The best negotiators listen far more than they talk .
Make people invest time / energy into you before negotiation starts – Vendors spend a lot of money advertising to get you into the store and in front of a product or sales rep .
A person who has shown active interest for the last 20 minutes is worth far more than the person who just called on the phone , who is worth far more than the person browsing on the internet .
The further you are in the process the more value you hold .
In my example , I was sitting in the chair after having around an hour of x-rays , photos , and discussions under my belt .
I desperately needed there services and was willing to execute quickly .
Towards the end I was very valuable to them .
Offer to pay up front and in cash – Often times , “ paying up front ” will be your biggest bargaining chip .
This is especially true for service - based vendors .
One of the worst parts of a service - based business is chasing defaulted accounts and managing payment plans ( again I know from experience ) .
In my experience , the smaller the business the more valuable paying up front will be .
Do n’t overlook the value of paying cash , though .
Vendors pay credit / debit card fees to throw their charges on your card .
Some of those pass that directly onto you , but other eat it as part of their costs .
It might not work every time , but it ’s certainly worth offering .
Negotiate individual before group discounts –
This is another “ bread & butter ” negotiating technique .
I find it most comfortable to start this process by examining each item in a quote .
For example , as I went down through each item I had the uncovered antibiotics I discussed in length above .
Had I asked for the overall discount first , it would have been much more unlikely to go back and get the antibiotics marked down .
Alternatively , you can negotiate the price of a single item and then discount it even further by asking for a group discount on multiple purchases .
Get everything in writing –
When it comes to spending your hard earned money , do n’t take people ’s word for it .
Whether buying a house or negotiating dental work , ask them to politely provide you with a new quote or evidence of the offer in writing .
In my short time on this planet , I ’ve already seen more than my fair share “ handshake ” or verbal deals go horribly sour .
Do n’t get emotionally involved .
Always be able to walk - away .
– Remember , negotiating should n’t be personal .
It ’s a business transaction where each party attempts to highlight their value and come to a mutually beneficial compromise .
It ’s really that simple , unless you start bringing personal emotions into the process .
Especially with larger purchases ( car , house , lease , etc… ) it ’s easy to get attached to the item .
This is the quickest way to either get taken advantage of or to quickly become offended and angry .
You do n’t want either .
Do whatever it takes to remain impartial and level - headed .
Do n’t let the other party feel abused or scammed .
Even if you are n’t abusing or scamming anyone , it ’s important that the other party does n’t feel like they are being mistreated .
The best negotiations create win-win situations , where both parties feel like they gained something .
Even if we set aside the vital concepts of morals and karma , taking advantage of people is just a dumb business move .
Burning bridges and tarnishing your reputation will cost you far more in the long run than the money you saved .
Negotiation Tips I Overlooked Or Did Poorly
Decide on your breakpoint –
It ’s a fantastic idea to settle on your “ worst case scenario ” before beginning the negotiation process .
This is effectively the highest you ’d be willing to pay for a specific item .
This will keep you from overspending due to ineffective negotiating .
Bottom line :
You are n’t paying over or selling for under your break point .
Because of the nature of the services I needed were so unknown , I did n’t enter into my negotiations with a break point of any kind .
This might have cost me money .
Start with a extremely low shocker offer …
–
This is another technique that requires both rapport and finesse .
In my Real Estate ventures , I certainly saw this both backfire miserably and succeed wonderfully .
Most of the time I would only really suggest this to someone in a very strong opening position .
It ’s strength lies in its ability to shatter unfounded expectations from the very start .
Depending on the situation this can be a great way to kick things off .
In my situation , I did n’t think it was appropriate to “ offer low ” , although once again properly using the technique could have saved me even more .
“ I ’d love to work with you , but unfortunately … ” – Before stating you needs , it can help to reiterate that you are ready and willing to continue the relationship .
This subtle , yet effective statement reinforces that you are serious about the purchase or sale , but that you still have crucial needs that are unmet .
It ’s a polite way to refocus the negotiation once it has hit a speed bump or simply stalled .
“ Unfortunately , I ’m absolutely not a buyer at that price ” – Another phrase I have used from time to time to jump - start a stalled negotiation .
This one is more direct , but still not rude .
I usually will utilize this type of saying when the discussion has become cloudy or when the other party is insisting on a specific term that I ’m unable to overcome .
Upfront Justification – I often use this tip on the selling end .
“ Considering the amount of work that I ’ve put into this … ”
Providing justification before a statement can often times help the other party see value they might not have realized .
Savvy buyers and sellers both know that the amount of time / energy / love you ’ve invested has nothing to do with the actual worth of the item .
Still it ’s a great technique to help demonstrate why you ’ve attached value to an item or service .
The “ what - would - you - do - in - my - shoes ” question – My favorite way to initiate this question is to say , “ Here ’s the main issue … [ restate problem plainly ] … what would you do in my shoes ? ”
Asking questions like this is an effective way to generate all sorts of creative ideas that you would never even thought to ask .
I often ask this to customer service representatives after being told “ no ” .
If you are completely uninsured , make it known – Doctors and dentists will negotiate even further the more you are uninsured .
I ’m assuming that the main reason my dentist office discounted my antibiotic was that I had no coverage for that specific item .
I ’ve heard stories of medical professionals offering discounts of 50 - 75 % for individuals whom have absolutely no coverage and who negotiate the services up front .
Obtain a basic understanding of competition .
A little research into rental rates , car values , second opinions , and even competitor ’s sales can go a long way in ensure you are getting a great deal .
The effectiveness of this technique can be magnified if you can bring proof .
The more information you have the better position you start the the negotiation in .
You can help prevent yourself and others from being victim of scams and schemes .
3 Common Phrases You Should AVOID At All Costs
“ I ’m going to be honest with you ” – I used to use this one all the time before realizing that it was having the negative effect that I desired .
I wanted to show that I was being honest , but did n’t realize I was implying that I had not been being honest all along .
Even just starting with “ Honestly , I do n’t feel … ” has a slightly better implication .
I ’ve noticed that my outcomes are much more satisfactory when I eliminate that sort of phrasing altogether , though .
“ Take it or leave it ” – Ultimatums will rarely get you anywhere .
In fact , they most often will blow up in beginner ’s faces .
I use to think I was demonstrating “ power ” by issuing a statement like this .
What I came to realize is that I rarely ended up with anything more than a soured relationship .
There are much more effective techniques at your disposal .
“ What ’s the lowest price you ’ll take ? ” –
When I was selling my car , I talked to roughly 20 - 25 people .
At least 90 % of them asked this question ( usually before demonstrating any value to me ) .
I can tell you from recent experience that it automatically made me lose respect for the person as soon as it left their lips .
Do not start here .
Start by demonstrating your value and fully identifying the other parties needs .
I ’ve listed numerous tips that are much more effective above .
Bringing It All Together !
This has turned into a rather long essay , however I wanted to reiterate what I believe to be the most essential concepts .
Although I do n’t claim to have mastered the fine art of negotiation , I ’ve certainly have enable myself to feel comfortable with the process in a short amount of time .
It is my hope that my story and the personal tips I ’ve experimented with help shift some of you from the “ awkward ” phase to “ comfortable ” phase .
If you ’ve experienced this shift already , I hope you ’ve picked up a few more techniques or at least will help share your own successes with those of us still learning ( myself included ) !
Be sure to leave your own negotiation tips , tricks , techniques , truisms , and phrases you ’ve learned to avoid below !

- Nella marea di articoli sul caso Berlusconi pubblicati oggi dalla stampa internazionale , spiccano gli editoriali non firmati , dunque espressione del pensiero della direzione del giornale , come usa nel mondo anglosassone , di quattro dei più autorevoli quotidiani del mondo : .
Quello del più importante quotidiano finanziario d'Europa suggerisce senza mezzi termini agli alleati del presidente del Consiglio di liberarsi di lui per il bene dell ' Italia .
Una valutazione condivisa dall ' altra parte dell ' Atlantico dal , secondo il quale " l'era Berlusconi è durata troppo " .
L'editoriale del giornale newyorkese , intitolato " La Legge e Silvio Berlusconi " , inizia con un giudizio tranciante : " Mercoled ì è stato un brutto giorno per Silvio Berlusconi ma un bel giorno per la democrazia italiana " .
Il riferimento è alla sentenza della Corte costituzionale su quella che ildefinisce " la vergognosa legge approvata dopo le elezioni dello scorso anno che garantiva a Berlusconi l'immunità dai processi per tutto il tempo in cui rimaneva in carica " .
Il quotidiano osserva poi che " la Corte Costituzionale ha ricordato il principio fondamentale della democrazia che nessuno , neppure il più ricco o il più potente , può ergersi sopra la legge , anche se un Parlamenteo compiacente gli costruisce per legge l'immunità " .
Dopo aver ricordato i processi che riprenderanno , il Nyt scrive : " Gli avvocati di Berlusconi sostengono che la necessità di difendersi nei processi distrarrano il premier dai suoi doveri .
Ma lui già sembra aver speso molta più energia a difendersi dai suoi controversi casi personali che a reagire ai problemi che attanagliano l'Italia ...
Non è una situazione accetabile per l'Italia e per l'Europa .
L'era Berlusconi è durata troppo a lungo , con troppi pochi risultati positivi .
E ' tempo per entrambe le coalizioni di sviluppare una nuova generazione di leader più costruttivi e competenti da presentare agli elettori " .
" La sentenza della Corte Costituzionale ( che gli ha tolto l'immunità ) è il più serio smacco subito da Berlusconi nel suoi 15 anni in politica " , afferma l'editoriale del .
" Da un anno il premier è coinvolto in uno scandalo di prostitute e veline , ma la decisione della Corte lo colpisce dove fa più male .
Il premier dovrà ora affrontare una serie di processi in cui è accusato di corruzione ed evasione fiscale " .
Il giornale della City ricorda la reazione di Berlusconi secondo cui si tratta di un complotto politico orchestrato contro di lui dalla sinistra , ma obietta : " Il giudizio della Corte è giusto .
Il capo di governo , in una democrazia , non può essere al di sopra della legge " .
Il risultato è che Berlusconi , " chiaramente indebolito " , dovrà passare più tempo a occuparsi dei suoi problemi legali e meno a occuparsi degli affari di governo , mentre l'immagine internazionale dell ' Italia " soffrirà ulteriormente " .
Berlusconi entrò in politica dopo la crisi creata da Tangentopoli , " per darsi una piattaforma da cui difendersi dalle accuse di corruzione " che già lo riguardavano , scrive il , " ed è una tragedia , per l'Italia e per l'Europa , che lo abbia fatto " .
L'Italia , per causa sua , " non è riuscita a maturare politicamente " .
Molti italiani ancora appoggiano Berlusconi , conclude l'editoriale del , " ma i suoi alleati di centrodestra dovrebbero contemplare l'idea di disfarsi di lui .
L'Italia starebbe certamente meglio senza Berlusconi " .
Anche la principale agenzia di stampa europea , la , dedica un editoriale alla vicenda , a firma del columnist europeo Paul Taylor e sotto il titolo : " Berlusconi non deve trascinare l'Italia giù con lui " .
" Silvio Berlusconi sembra determinato a trascinare leistituzioni giù con lui ora che lentamente affonda in una palude di processi e di scandali .
Ma i suoi alleati politici non dovrebbero legare il proprio destino irrevocabilmente al suo " .
Dopo aver ricordato i processi che si riaprono e la reazione del premier ( " vere farse " ) il columnist attacca : " Queste non sono parole degne di un uomo che è stato eletto per seguire la costituzione e la legge .
Del resto , ciascuna delle tre volte in cui Berlusconi nell ' ultimo quindicennio ha preso il potere , ha speso il primo anno e anche più ad attuare leggi self - service , che gli garantissero l'immunità , decriminalizzando le accuse di frode ecambiando lo statuto della prescrizione .
I suoi interessi personali e i suoi affari hanno avuto la precedenza sul governo dell ' Italia , che ha seriamente bisogno di riforme " .
E ancora : " Berlusconi ha dichiarato che nonha alcuna intenzione di lasciare volontariamente .
Ma i suoi alleati dovrebbero considerare se il magnate miliardario dei media è diventato più un peso che un elemento prezioso per il loro futuro " .
Come ?
Ambiziosi politici conservatori come il presidente della Camera Fini dovrebbero soppesare i rischi del regicidio contro i pericoli di essere trascinati giù con Berlusconi .
Per la salvezza dell ' Italia , dovrebbero trovare il coraggio , e farlo velocemente " .
Anche l'editoriale del , uno dei più autorevoli quotidiani britannici , rammenta la tesi di Berlusconi di un complotto della sinistra contro di lui che coinvolgerebbe i tre ultimi presidenti della Repubblica , uno dei quali , Scalfaro , era " un fervente cattolico anticomunista " , e un altro , Ciampi , " un banchiere e un tecnocrate " .
E allora , osserva il , di che cospirazione si tratta ?
" Non c'è stato alcun complotto .
La persona che è pericolosa , nel senso che sta attivamente danneggiando le istituzioni italiane , è Berlusconi " .
Per questo , afferma il giornale londinese , è necessario che ora , abolita l'immunità , i processi contro di lui riprendano e vadano avanti : " Ogni altro corso di eventi spingerebbe ancora di più l'Italia lontano dal suo presente democratico e indietro verso il suo passato fascista " .
Con un titolo che parafrasa il famoso romanzo di Kundera , " L'insostenibile nudità legale di Silvio Berlusconi " , l'editoriale delriassume quello che è accaduto e fa le ipotesi su quel che accadrà , inclusa la possibilità che i processi avanzino lentamente , che il premier non venga condannato per la scadenza dei termini processuali e che tutto continui più o meno come ora .
Ma in tal caso , conclude il quotidiano finanziario americano , " il vero perdente sarebbe il popolo italiano " .
Ildedica alla vicenda anche un'intera pagina di servizi , con un'ampia infografica sulla galassia del potere economico di Berlusconi , notando la ridda di supposizioni sui mercati all ' indomani della sentenza che ha condannato la Finivest a pagare 750 milioni di euro di risarcimento alla Cir di Carlo De Benedetti come conseguenza della corruzione con cui Berlusconi ottenne il possesso della Mondadori .
Una possibilità , scrive ilcitando un " senior Milan banker " , un importante banchiere milanese , che chiede di restare anonimo , è che " le ambizioni di espansione all 'estero " del Cavaliere saranno ridotte , per esempio per quanto riguarda il tentato acquisto di TeleCinco in Spagna .
Un'altra è che Berlusconi decida di vendere il Milan , come lo spingerebbe a fare , secondo il , " sua figlia Marina " .
In un altro articolo , il giornale nota che , nonostante le affermazioni ufficiali di solidarietà al premier da parte dei suoi alleati , la sentenza della Corte " ha esposto divisioni nella coalizione di maggioranza " .
Ilnota che Gianfranco Fini ha preso seccamente le distanze dalle critiche di Berlusconi al presidente della repubblica Napolitano .
E nota che anche il ministro del Tesoro Giulio Tremonti , " come Fini un possibile contendente per la successione a Berlusconi " , ha evitato di criticare il capo dello Stato .
Quale che sia l'esito dei processi contro il premier , osserva l'articolo , " un governo indebolito , in conflitto con il potere giudiziario e con il Quirinale , esaspererebbe una lotta intestina per il potere , rischiando di trasformare Berlusconi in un'anatra zoppa " .
E ' la medesima previsione di una news analyses del corrispondente da Roma deldi Londra , Richard Owen : " L'Houdini della politica italiana potrebbe finire per diventare un'anatra zoppa " .
Anche il quotidiano londinese dedica una pagina intera alle conseguenze della sentenza della Consulta , condividendo l'impressione di " divisioni " crescenti all ' interno della maggioranza .
Un analogo corsivo sul , uno dei principali quotidiani conservatori britannici , rammenta che " in Occidente il concetto di uguaglianza di tutti davanti alla legge è uno dei capisaldi della democrazia " e l'idea che un leader voglia mettersi al di sopra della legge " crea paralleli con dittatori di mezzo mondo " .
E in ogni caso la linea di difesa del premier italiano , secondo cui i processi toglierebbero tempo prezioso alla sua attività di governo , non regge , ironizza Adrian Michels , il caporedattore esteri del , considerato che Berlusconi " sembra avere trovato un sacco di tempo per le attività extra- governative che hanno spinto sua moglie a chiedere il divorzio " .
Ildi Londra scrive che , dopo la sentenza , nel breve spazio di 24 ore , Berlusconi ha " insultato la Corte Costituzionale , messo in dubbio l'imparzialità del presidente della Repubblica e dei suoi predecessori , e ridicolizzato una parlamentare in diretta tivù " .
Lo spagnoloafferma che Berlusconi ha risposto alla decisione della Corte " attaccando i poteri istituzionali con isteria , brutalità e insulti " ; e in un altro articolo ricorda che il parlamento europeo ha criticato la concentrazione dei media in Italia .
Ci sono moltissimi altri articoli e commenti sulla Berlusconi- story , dal tedescoal francese , dall ' alla svizzera , dalall ' .
Una segnalazione la merita un editoriale sul quotidiano parigino , che partendo dalle frasi pronunciate dal premier subito dopo la sentenza , " Viva l'Italia , Viva Berlusconi " , commenta parafrasando il celebre motto del Re Sole : " Berlusconi dice , l'Italia sono io .
Poveri italiani " .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - The Labour Party ’s traditional lead over the Conservatives in northern England , its electoral stronghold , has collapsed under Prime Minister Gordon Brown , according to research by the Financial Times newspaper .
The FT said on Thursday David Cameron was on course for a clear majority of English seats in the next general election , expected in May 2010 .
The business daily ’s analysis of recent polling data indicates the Tories have a four - point lead in the north of England , wiping out the 19 - point Labour lead in the region that helped keep Tony Blair in power in the last election .
Cameron has built a big lead among the wealthy , his party ’s traditional supporters , and has seen a big swing at the other end of the social spectrum , converting a 12 - point deficit to Labour in the 2005 election into a 14 - point advantage , the FT said .
On Tuesday , the latest Guardian / ICM poll showed only 26 percent of voters in Britain would vote Labour in the next election , compared to 43 percent for the Conservatives .

Many companies are making the move from on - premises SharePoint to the cloud .
There are many advantages of making the move – resource requirements are lessened , cost , features , accessibility , and more .
It ’s great once you are there , but the biggest challenge can be the work getting there .
Migration to the cloud requires careful planning , knowledge and experience to take advantage of the cloud for the different types of content .
Nintex Workflows are one of the best additions to Office 365 and migrating your existing on - premises workflows successfully is n’t a problem with the following considerations .
Missing Actions
Unfortunately , the cloud version of Nintex Workflows is not a 1 - to - 1 implementation of on - premises Nintex Workflow 2010 or 2013 .
The reason for this is because of Microsoft ’s Workflow Manager model in Office 365 which does not support all of the actions from on - premises .
At the time of this writing , there are 40 out - of - the - box Nintex actions unavailable in Nintex for Office 365 .
Custom workflow actions are also not supported .
While most of the Nintex out - of - the - box actions have been replicated , they do not necessarily work the same as it does on - premises .
This is due to the architectural differences between the two environments .
Nintex Workflow 2016 has the unique option of creating workflows that are fully compatible with Nintex Workflow for Office 365 .
As you begin to create a new workflow in SharePoint 2016 , you can choose between creating an on- premises version with the extra 40 actions available or create an Office 365 compatible version that does not .
While there are less actions available with the compatible option , it does ensure that your workflow will be compatible with Office 365 when you migrate .
SharePoint Online Limitations
There are also some key differences with SharePoint Online versus on - premises .
One limitation is that a workflow file cannot not exceed 5 MB in size after it is exported .
When checking for a file size , know that a Nintex workflow is compressed when exported .
To obtain the actual size , you will need to expand the NWP file to see what the total size is .
Workflows exceeding this limit may have issues online .
To reduce the risk of error , any large workflow may have to be rearchitected before moving to the cloud .
There are many other differences with the cloud that should be known .
For example , one of the issues most clients run into is the immovable 5000 item List View Threshold limit .
This is the maximum number of items that can exist in a list view and keep good performance .
In SharePoint on - premises , an administrator can raise the limit or set Daily Time Windows where the limits are raised .
In Office 365 , this limit cannot be changed and is in place 24×7 .
It may be necessary to create new lists to address this issue which may affect workflows .
This is one example where knowledge of the limitations within SharePoint Online is paramount to a successful migration .
Other Considerations
Because of the differences in Office 365 , issues can arise with workflows when implementing features .
Turning on something like two - factor authentication may cause significant issues with Nintex workflows .
Knowing the limitations of Nintex ’s different implementations in relation to Office 365 features prevents downtime by using workarounds .
The architecture of your workflows should be reviewed .
Some actions affect performance more than others ( e.g. Execute SQL , Query LDAP , etc. ) .
Excessive looping can significantly slow down , stall , or have their execution throttled .
Unfortunately , you cannot modify or increase the hardware running the workflows like you could on - premises .
Also , the SharePoint Online Workflow Engine controls workflow throttling which Nintex has no control over .
The only option is to increase efficiency through design with the workflow .
How Do I Get There ?
All of these considerations can seem very daunting when approaching a migration to the cloud for the first time .
This stress is increased since the cloud is always changing .
Finding experts that are focused on this activity with experience of various requirements with solutions can help mitigate the unknowns .
A third - party migration tool like Sharegate can greatly assist with the move .
Sharegate works directly with Nintex to improve their ability to produce successful migrations .
Sharegate will move all Nintex workflows , including those with actions that are not supported .
Placeholders are put where the actions would normally be .
The placeholders are labeled with the comments of the original action for easy identification .
This allows for a workaround to be developed within Office 365 which also helps with testing in the target environment .
Conclusion
Migrations are a complex process .
The recipe for success is investigation of the existing environment , planning , knowledge of the current target environment , and a good 3rd - party tool .
Experience with the cloud and tools involved is also desired .
With that combination , getting your Nintex workflows to the cloud will be a success for you and your organization .
Much news and excitement has derived from BlizzCon today but a release for Diablo III next year is not happening .
CEO Mike Morhaime has confirmed that the just - revealed World of Warcraft expansion Cataclysmand StarCraft II are the two titles the company expects to hit in 2010 .
Not sure about most of you folks but , these World of Warcraft expansions are coming out rather pretty quick and it just keeps coming .
Just one year after their release of Lich King , they plan for a second , and in less than another year apart it ’ll be out again .
This comes in no surprise to me but it still is a huge disappointment .
Its become a trend of Blizzard to announce their games at least 2 years before the actual release date , forcing us to wait in agony .
Not sure if this would actually build hype or lost of interest but their games has always hit at full force .
With the “ Next Gen MMO ” and a new IP , I would n’t be surprised if Diablo 3 gets pushed back to 2012 , but lets keep our fingers crossed and hope for 2011 .
If you ’ve missed it , Blizzard also revealed the Monk class with a new trailer and gameplay video .

This informative article from CBS News about the government ’s claim that there is no need for medical patients to access cannabis , when there is a ‘ fake ’ cannabis pill on the market , features remarks from NORML advisory board member , professor and author
Mitch Earleywine , and former deputy drug czar under Bush 1.0 Herb Kleber , which strongly underlines the differences between credible and not credible on the topic of cannabis .
Credible :
[ One ] problem with Marinol is that it ’s orally administered , ” Dr. Mitch Earleywine , an associate professor of Clinical Psychology at the State University of New York at Albany , said in an email .
“ Therefore , it takes longer to work than cannabis inhaled from a vaporizer .
( Usually 90 minutes at best rather than 15 seconds – a meaningful amount of time to the nauseated . ) ”
“ It ’s harder to control dosage , too , so folks end up discombobulated or without symptom relief , ” he added .
“ In addition , folks who are vomiting ca n’t hold down the pills . ”
Earleywine also said that a dose Marinol costs three to five times as much as a comparable dose of medical marijuana .
Not Credible :
“ Are there actions in the whole plant that you do n’t get from just the Marinol ?
I would be surprised if there was n’t , ” he continued .
“ The problem is that most of the data about the potential medical actions of the smoked form are anecdotal . ”
Dr. Kleber , who said he has prescribed Marinol to a patient and found it to be effective , points to what he characterizes as a significant advantage of the pill over traditional marijuana : “ People do n’t abuse it . ”
“ Marijuana addiction is becoming common and as a result I ’m seeing an increasing number of people who have trouble stopping marijuana , ” he said .
“ Contrary to popular beliefs that there is no marijuana withdrawal , there is marijuana withdrawal .
It ’s very clear cut . ”
Talk about anecdotal !
Dr. Kleber would have readers believe , that cannabis today , as compared to the prior 2,000 years of documented cannabis use by humans is that “ Marijuana addiction is becoming common ” .
Really ?
“ I ’m seeing an increasing number of people who have trouble stopping marijuana ”
Of course you are Herb because as it has been well documented by NORML that the criminal justice system throughout most of the United States presents minor cannabis offenders with the Hobson ’s Choice of either going to jail or to visit the offices of the ‘ Dr. Klebers ’ in America for ‘ treatment ’ .
Dr. Kleber well knows this , so his statement is for me the working definition of disingenuous !
Lastly , there is nothing new about Marinol as it has been legal and available for medical patients since the mid 1980s .
If the pill worked as Dr. Kleber claims , voters and legislators in the 13 states with medical cannabis laws would not have opted for a whole plant solution .
Marinol was supposed to be the government ’s great ‘ silver bullet ’ back in the mid 1980s to end the public debate about patients ’ need for whole - smoked cannabis–an analog of one of the plant ’s major ingredients isolated in pill form .

Does the Pot Pill Work ?
The Government Says a Pill Called Marinol Offers the Same Benefits as
Medical Marijuana .
Is it True ?
By Brian Montopoli
August 4 , 2009
( CBS ) “ Medical marijuana , ” the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says , “ already exists . ”
They do n’t just mean in California .
A pill known as Marinol has been legal and approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use with a prescription anywhere in America since 1985 .
It ’s active ingredient ?
Dronabinol , better known as THC , the primary psychoactive element of the cannabis plant .
“ Marinol provides standardized THC concentrations , does not contain the other 400 uncharacterized substances found in smoked marijuana , such as carcinogens or fungal spores , and is not associated with the quick high of smoked marijuana , ” said Neil Hirsch , a spokesman for Marinol manufacturer Solvay Pharmaceuticals .
But Marinol is not the same thing as traditional , smokable marijuana .
It is a less complex substance lacking both some of the good components found in traditional marijuana ( such as cannabidiol , which has been found to have anti-seizure effects ) and the bad or not - yet - fully - understood components ( among them potential carcinogens ) that can also come with the drug .
Ken Trainer , a 60 - year - old Massachusetts resident who has battled Multiple Sclerosis for 25 years , said he has long been smoking marijuana to deal with the regular tremors he gets in his arms and legs .
“ If I smoke a joint , the tremors go away most times before the joint is gone , ” he said .
“ It makes my life a little easier . ” Marinol , by contrast , “ did n’t really do much of anything for me , ” he said .
56 - year - old Des Moines resident Jeff Elton , who was diagnosed with gastroparesis six years ago , had a similar experience when he was prescribed Marinol to deal with his chronic nausea and vomiting .
“ I felt no relief , I did n’t feel ill , I felt nothing , ” he said .
“ It might as well be M& M’s . ”
Elton said he switched to marijuana , which he smokes through a vaporizer – a device that heats the active ingredients into a vapor instead of burning them .
He said it allows him to keep down his food and regain some of the weight he lost while on Marinol .
“ [ One ] problem with Marinol is that it ’s orally administered , ” Dr. Mitch Earleywine , an associate professor of Clinical Psychology at the State University of New York at Albany , said in an email .
“ Therefore , it takes longer to work than cannabis inhaled from a vaporizer .
( Usually 90
minutes at best rather than 15 seconds – a meaningful amount of time to the nauseated . ) ”
“ It ’s harder to control dosage , too , so folks end up discombobulated or without symptom relief , ” he added .
“ In addition , folks who are vomiting ca n’t hold down the pills . ”
Earleywine also said that a dose Marinol costs three to five times as much as a comparable dose of medical marijuana .
Defenders note that Marinol is not meant to be a cure - all :
It has been approved specifically for treating nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy and for treating anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS .
“ When the whole push for the smoked product came along , it was often for those two indications , ” said Dr. Herbert Kleber , a professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University and the former deputy drug czar under President George H.W. Bush .
“ And in general , I ’ve not seen any need for the smoked form of marijuana for those two indications .
Marinol had already been shown to be quite effective for those two things . ”
“ Are there actions in the whole plant that you do n’t get from just the Marinol ?
I would be surprised if there was n’t , ” he continued .
“ The problem is that most of the data about the potential medical actions of the smoked form are anecdotal . ”
Research into the effects of medical marijuana is ongoing : The University of California , San Diego , for example , boasts a Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research engaged in “ focused controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of cannabis in patients diagnosed with HIV / AIDS ,
cancer , seizures or muscle spasms associated with a chronic debilitating condition , or any other serious condition providing sufficient theoretical justification . ”
( The director of the UCSD program , Dr. Igor Grant , was out of the country and could not be reached for this story . )
The Los Angeles Times , which offers a nice overview of the current research , writes that “ a growing body of research supports [ medical marijuana ’s ] medical usage , but some of it is cautionary . ”
Marijuana has been found to be effective in counteracting severe pain , nausea and loss of appetite , though questions remain about the drawbacks , among them possible respiratory damage and increased cancer risk .
Dr. Kleber , who said he has prescribed Marinol to a patient and found it to be effective , points to what he characterizes as a significant advantage of the pill over traditional marijuana : “ People do n’t abuse it . ”
“ Marijuana addiction is becoming common and as a result I ’m seeing an increasing number of people who have trouble stopping marijuana , ” he said .
“ Contrary to popular beliefs that there is no marijuana withdrawal , there is marijuana withdrawal .
It ’s very clear cut . ”
The calculus , then , is n’t quite as simple as the Drug Enforcement Administration suggests : Marinol and medical marijuana may share an active ingredient , but they offer somewhat different benefits and different drawbacks .
Proponents of medicinal marijuana say it ’s disingenuous to hold up Marinol as a direct alternative to the more traditional form of the plant .
“ I just do n’t understand how they wo n’t let me smoke a joint , but they ’re more than happy to write me out prescriptions for anything that I want , ” Trainer said .

A pair of legal cases coming soon to the B.C. Supreme Court may greatly change the way health care is delivered in the province and across Canada .
Copeman Clinic : The Tipping Point ? read more
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners Hurrah !
Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
Disgruntled former patients who say the province 's for - profit clinics are regularly breaking the law on extra billing went to court last December demanding the government properly enforce the Medicare Protection Act and end the alleged extra billing by private sector clinics .
Meanwhile , in January , a group of these same clinics launched a court action against some of the government players targeted in the patients ' litigation .
This second action , brought by , among others , Vancouver 's Cambie Surgeries Corporation and the for - profit clinic umbrella group the Canadian Independent Medical Clinics Association , is arguing that the law that underlies the delivery of health services in B.C. is unconstitutional .
They are calling on the Supreme Court of B.C. to rule that provisions of the Medicare Protection Act of 1996 , which they claim " directly or indirectly prohibit or impede access to private health care and patient choice in primary health care , " are in violation of sections 7 and 15 of the Charter of Rights .
The clinics also call on the courts to stop the B.C. Government from auditing the books of Vancouver 's Cambie Surgeries Corporation and the Specialist Referral Clinic .
( The Specialist Referral Clinic has been added as a Defendant by Counterclaim to the case as it has evolved this year ) .
The audit is intended to determine whether those companies , both partly owned by privatization advocate Dr. Brian Day , have been involved , as alleged , in illegal extra billing .
Court documents say that Day 's two clinics so far have actively refused access to government auditors .
Sources close to the case have told The Tyee that the two legal actions , which have become more complex as more interested parties apply to be added as respondents and interveners and additional affidavit material is submitted , may be joined and tried together this fall or winter .
Either way , the implications for the delivery of health care in B.C.
Are immense .
Private clinics argue Canadians ' rights are violated
If the suit initiated by patients against the government and the clinics is successful , it will represent a setback for those in the business and medical world such as Day , who is past president of the Canadian Medical Association .
Day is the stock - owning medical director for Cambie Sugery Centre and the Specialist Referral Clinic in Vancouver .
The for - profit clinics argue in their action that the Canadian health care system is grievously flawed because of its reliance on government funding and primarily public delivery .
Privatization proponents like Day would like to see a ruling that the current status quo in health care operates to deny Canadians their Charter right to timely health care under section 7 ( the right to life , liberty and security of the person ) and section 15 ( equal protection of the law without discrimination ) .
They are calling on the courts to open the doors to more extensive use of private payment and for - profit clinics as a way to end wait lists and make health care delivery more efficient .
In doing so , they rely on the landmark Chaoulli case in Quebec in 2005 , which ruled in a 4 - 3 decision that a ban in that province on private health insurance violated the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms .
Only a minority of the justices in the Chaoulli case agreed that the ban violated the Canadian Charter as well .
The Chaoulli ruling currently is binding only in Quebec .
A win by the clinics in their B.C. action might open the door across Canada for an expansion of for - profit clinics and private health insurance .
' Equality , fairness ' threatened : BC Health Coalition
" This lawsuit threatens Canadians ' ability to access affordable health care when they need it .
It threatens the principles of equality and fairness that are fundamental to our Canadian health care system , " Leslie Dickout of the B.C. Health Coalition told The Tyee , referring to the action brought by the for profit - clinics and their umbrella group .
But Brian
Day takes a different view of the litigation he and his allies have launched .
" I'm of the fundamental belief that in a free and democratic society , there is nothing immoral , unethical or illegal about an individual who 's suffering from a lack of health care using their own money to purchase that health care .
It 's a fundamental human right in a free society , " Day told The Tyee .
Day went on to explain that he and other doctors at his clinic charge the provincial Medical Services Plan for their own services , while the clinic charges patients a facilities fee for use of the operating room and the salaries for nurses .
Billing methods in dispute
Mariel Schoof , who is one of the plaintiffs in the patients ' case against the for - profit clinics , she says her litigation is about fairness and access to health care .
" I was the first one to challenge what the clinics are doing , " Schooff told The Tyee .
" I 'm doing this because I want people to get the health care they 're supposed to be getting .
The province should see everybody gets medical treatment .
We should n't be a backwater . "
According to documents filed by her lawyers in December , Schooff had sinus surgery performed at the for - profit False Creek Surgical Centre in January of 2003 .
False Creek now is among the defendants in the patients ' litigation launched by Schooff and others .
The documents say Schooff personally paid $ 6,150 for her surgery , and her surgeon , Dr. Amin Javer , also billed the Medical Services Commission for procedure done on Schooff .
It would appear that this is not an incident isolated to False Creek Surgical Centre .
Day told The Tyee it is common knowledge that his and other private clinics bill patients above and beyond what the doctors invoice through the government - funded MSC .
But he said that the clinics ' billings were not for the doctor 's services , which were paid by MSC .
Those billings , he explained , are for renting the operating room and paying nurses and other operating room staff , what he calls " facility fees . "
Those billings are illegal under the Medicare Protection Act , counter the government lawyers defending Medical Services Commission and others against the lawsuit brought by the private clinics .
In their statement of defense they state it is impermissible " extra billing " to charge the MSC the amount it stipulates as the appropriate fee for a procedure and then bill the patient for collateral costs .
Government audits rebuffed by private clinics
The B.C. Medical Services Commission has been trying for at least a year to investigate this disputed pattern of charging , but private clinics have not cooperated in allowing the commission to audit their billing .
In a July 23 sworn affidavit , Bob DeFaye , the chair of the B.C. Medical Services Commission , alleges that :
" When the Commission made its decision to audit the clinics , it was aware of correspondence from approximately 30 individuals , from which it concluded that the clinics , either individually or together , had charged beneficiaries for medically required service in contravention of the Act . "
The clinics being referenced in this section of the affidavit are Cambie Surgical Centre and the Specialist Referral Clinic .
Day is medical director of both clinics and is a stockholder in both .
In February of this year , Day told Canwest News Service , " There is no hiding the fact we charge facility fees , so the audit is absolutely unnecessary . "
Marjorie Brown , one of the lawyers representing Mariel Schoof and the other former patients in their action against both the clinics and the government bodies , disagrees .
" The audit attempt was absolutely the right thing to do , " she told The Tyee .
" My clients needed medically necessary care and they were referred to doctors practicing under the Medicare Protection Act , and told by the doctors or their staff that there would be a big delay for their treatment unless they paid for it privately .
The doctors ' practice sets up two wait lists : one for those who wait in the public system and one for those who can afford to jump the queue .
But these doctors still rely on the public system , billing both MSP and the patients for the care they provide and in the process breaking the law .
It is shocking to see some doctors flout the law in this fashion . "
' Staff poaching ' from public health care : study
Brown said her clients are motivated by a concern that others not be denied care because they do n't have money .
" This action is about preserving a system , " she said .
Recent research sponsored by the anti-privatization B.C. Health Coalition suggests what may be at stake in both of the clusters of litigation that will be considered by the B.C. Supreme Court this fall .
One of its findings :
" Our research reveals that for - profit clinics are siphoning scarce personnel from local hospitals and the public health care system .
In at least two provinces , we found a demonstrable reduction in capacity of public non-profit hospitals as a direct result of staff poaching by nearby for - profit clinics .
Ontario's for - profit MRI / CT clinics led to cuts in MRI hours in local community hospitals .
In Manitoba , the for - profit MRI clinic caused a reduction in MRI hours in the Winnipeg Health Sciences Centre .
In addition , staff poaching from local hospitals was found in Nova Scotia and British Columbia . "
On the other hand , some critics say the Canadian health system is so flawed that it needs massive reform , not preservation .
For example , Nadeem Esmail of the pro-privatization Fraser Institute has argued in a recent article in the June 2009 Fraser Forum that the Canadian system is the second most expensive universal access system in on the planet , only outspent by Iceland .
Further , he says , and in this he echoes Brian Day and many other advocates of health care privatization , Canada 's wait lists for medical treatment are among the worst in the world .
' Opening the door ' to NAFTA challenges ?
Dr. Randall
White of the Canadian Doctors for Medicare , a group that has applied to be an intervenor in the case between Mariel Schooff and the other unhappy ex-patients and the MSC and the clinics , does n't see the privatization option favored by Day and his clinic associates as a useful one or one likely to improve Canadian health care delivery .
In an email interview with The Tyee , White wrote :
" If Canada opens the doors to commercial health - care delivery and insurance , we can expect NAFTA challenges that could well dismantle our publicly funded , non-profit system ...
The cost of commercial health care is high .
Many studies have found higher costs attributable to ubiquitous elements of for - profit insurance and hospitals such as administrative activities , marketing , profit generation , and executive pay .
When it comes to health care , the assertion that markets are most efficient is absolutely false .
The U.S. is the most market - driven industrialized health system and also the least efficient .
Canadians could expect greater cost inflation with the advent of market - driven health care . "
The B.C. Supreme Court , when it rules on these two related cases , will be turning its attention primarily to matters of law and the Charter , not the policy concerns variously advanced by pro- and anti-privatization advocates .
Nevertheless the court 's judgments are likely to have profound policy implications for Canadian doctors , patients and taxpayers .

Celebrity Web site TMZ.com posted two photos and a video Tuesday each showing Shriver holding a cell phone to her ear while behind the wheel on three separate occasions .
The photos -- one said to be from July and one snapped last week -- created a stir on blogs , chat rooms and Twitter after they were posted online .
Retribution for the violation seemed to be coming from no less than the state 's top elected official : her husband .
On his Twitter feed Tuesday afternoon , Schwarzenegger wrote to TMZ.com founder Harvey Levin : " Thanks for bringing her violations to my attention .
There 's going to be swift action . "
Hours later , the Web site added a video it says was shot Tuesday in Brentwood , Calif. , where the family lives .
It briefly shows Shriver behind the wheel of a large black SUV and holding a cell phone to her ear .
She then appears to put the phone down as she drives past the camera .
On Wednesday Shriver released a statement apologizing for the behavior and saying that she will donate the old cell phone seen in the photographs to charity .
" That 's my version of swift action with a higher purpose , " Shriver said .
Earlier Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear explained earlier that by " swift action , " the governor means he 'll ask his wife not to hold the phone while driving , but there could be monetary consequences as well .
Schwarzenegger signed a law last year requiring California drivers to use a hands - free device when talking on cell phones .
Since then , the California Highway Patrol has issued more than 150,000 citations , according to The Associated Press .
That figure does not include citations issued by local police .
State fines for driving while using a hand - held device are $ 20 for the first ticket and $ 50 for subsequent tickets , plus additional fees .
In Los Angeles County , where Brentwood is located , the fines are $ 93 for the first ticket and $ 201 for the next one , meaning Shriver could have owed at least $ 300 in fines and court fees had she been caught by police .

One billion people now live in Africa , says a new report .
The continent 's population is growing by about 24 million a year , and will double to nearly two billion by 2050 , the report adds .
These statistics have been released by the Population Reference Bureau , a Washington - based non-profit organisation , in a report published jointly with USAID , the United States government aid agency .
The report , the " 2009 World Population Data Sheet , " shows that Africa is the continent with the world 's highest birth rate and the highest projected population growth rate to 2050 .
Although population growth has slowed in North African countries such as Egypt and Tunisia , on average women in sub-Saharan Africa have more children than women elsewhere .
While globally the average woman has 2,6 children , in sub-Saharan Africa she has 5.3 children ( which is down from 6.7 children in around 1950 ) .
The world 's highest fertility rate is in Niger , where women have on average 7.4 children .
Worldwide , 62 percent of married women of childbearing age use contraception , but in Africa the figure is 28 percent .
The report also reveals that sub-Saharan Africa has the world 's most youthful population , " and is projected to stay that way for decades . "
In 1950 , nine percent of the world 's youths were African .
In 2050 , the continent is expected to have 349 million youths , or 29 percent of the world 's total .
The report says of the world 's young people : " This very large group will arrive at working age with a right to expect gainful employment , adequate health care , and the ability to raise a family with an appropriate living standard if they so choose ...
But will the economic conditions of their country be able to meet their rising expectations ?
This will be one of the major social questions of the next few decades . "
Other points from the report :
HIV prevalence appears to be on the decline in Africa , although the rate of infection is still much higher than elsewhere ;
Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world – 26 percent of people aged between 15 and 49 are HIV positive .
While worldwide , less than 60 percent of youth go to secondary school , in sub-Saharan Africa the figure is less than 30 percent .
Although Africa has a seventh of the world 's people , it has a quarter of the world 's refugees .

There ’s an article about MySpace on Download Squad today ( a great site - and one you should subscribe to , if you do n’t already ) .
It would appear that MySpace is “ showing artists some love ” by adding some basic analytics and an archive of music videos .
That ’s it ?
Are they kidding ?!
MySpace has what I would consider to be the greatest untapped asset on the internet right now : EVERY FRICKIN ’ BAND ON THE PLANET .
You guys ARE MySpace .
That ’s “ love ” ?!
MySpace need to do better .
Way better .
And they need to do it now .
A better MySpace
Imagine if they started a merchandise service , and topsliced $ 1 off each sale .
Even if every artist in the world only sells two t- shirts - one to themselves , and one to their mother - and with an average of ( let ’s say ) 2.5 people per ‘ band ’ - there ’s $ 25 m right there without even blinking .
By being actually helpful .
Or what if they set up a publishing company to connect artists with independent film - makers , games developers , television producers , web companies and other media outlets ?
Or helped artists connect with brands , so that Coke could offer $ 500 to each of 1,000 young indie rock bands in exchange for the usual sponsorship stuff on tours ?
Or suppose they designed the perfect online independent music contact management system .
Or gave ordinary members - non-musicians - the tools to set up their own MySpace ‘ labels ’ to discover , promote and distribute artists .
Or any number of other things they could do if they thought for two minutes about the fact that they have EVERY FRICKIN ’ BAND ON THE PLANET .
The list is endless .
But MySpace clearly do n’t get it .
They think that they ’re still in the social network game .
That they are somehow competing with Facebook .
They ’re not .
That ’s not the business they ’re in .
I mean really - do you know ANYONE who uses MySpace for day to day general social networking ?
They may have been pioneers in this field ( I do n’t happen to think they were … but they MAY have been ) - but that ’s not what people use them for now .
Do n’t get me wrong :
You CAN manage your day to day independent music career using MySpace .
Many people do .
But it ’s like drying your hair with a toaster .
Possible , but not really fit for purpose .
Let ’s be clear .
We decided what MySpace would become .
They set up a social networking platform , but what we as users decided to use it for is as a music platform .
Were it not for issues of timing and some core functionality that nobody else was offering right up front , it would probably have been dead by now , because they still have n’t realised that very simple fact .
The only thing keeping MySpace on life support to this day , as far as traffic is concerned - is YOUR music .
For reasons of critical mass alone , more or less every artist on earth has a presence there - and that ’s mostly because every other artist on earth does .
And we put up with its broken interface , bad design , 90s technology , ad - riddled BS , and complete lack of comprehension about what MySpace is really for - for one reason alone : nobody else has EVERY FRICKIN ’ BAND ON THE PLANET .
Right now , nobody else can do what MySpace could do , should they choose to .
Nobody else has everyone in music signed up , and it seems unlikely at this point that anyone else ever will again .
Lots of stuff does things far better than MySpace - but everyone ’s already AT MySpace .
Inertia rules .
We need a revolution
MySpace does n’t need improvement - it needs a complete rethink .
It needs to be remade , genuinely in the service of the people who make it work - OR we need to stage an orchestrated mass exodus .
We need an elsewhere to go and we need to ALL go there .
I ’m completely serious about this : if the people at MySpace do n’t recognise and understand the incredible asset they possess and start to make use of it in a way that ’s helpful and beneficial to their core user base - then they deserve to fail .
Slowly , painfully , and in abject corporate misery .
And when I say ‘ core user base ’ - I do n’t mean ( as they do ) all of the people who at one time signed up to MySpace .
They ’re members - but they ’re not all users .
I ’m talking about the people who USE MySpace .
Really use it .
Of course the ironic thing is that simply realising and making use of this ‘ revelation ’ is exactly the sort of thing that would turn MySpace into a far more wildly successful money - spinning destination than it ever has been in the past .
One that grew organically and provided well thought - through ( and wildly profitable ) services for the vast majority of artists who are NOT Black Eyed Peas or Muse .
But they clearly have n’t understood it yet , and I despair of them ever understanding it at all .
MySpace is playing catch - up in increments - they ’re a decade behind everyone else , and losing ground fast .
They need to stop making improvements and adding extra features .
Seriously : tear it down , and build it again properly .
And this time , understand what it is you have necessarily become : a service for independent music .
You have EVERY FRICKIN ’ BAND ON THE PLANET for God ’s sake .
Sort yourself out .
You have one year .
The clock is ticking
I ’d like to hereby declare 24th October 2010 Global ‘ Quit MySpace ’ Day .
That ’s one year from today .
It ’s a Sunday .
Put it on your calendar .
Mark it in your diary .
And spread the word .
Let ’s give them 12 months to do it right - or we ’re ALL gone .
I ’d like to invite any other music - facing service on the planet , real or as - yet unformed , to step up and take their place as the default home for independent music online .
We may be about to create a vacuum .
Someone needs to step in to fill it .
I do n’t necessarily WANT MySpace to fail .
The best outcome for this is for musicians to be delighted with the platform .
Nobody wants to move all their data , re-upload their songs , and start building up a fanbase ( however bogus those numbers actually are ) all over again .
But if the ‘ love ’ shown to artists is as weak and contemptuous as the kind of ‘ love ’ that passes for News From MySpace as reported on Download Squad today - then they MUST fail .
To be honest with you - this is not my fight .
I ’m not an independent musician .
I do n’t have to be on MySpace .
In fact , I never have to look at it again if I do n’t want to .
But this makes me angry .
You deserve far better - and I hope this inspires you to demand it .

Today Sony Computer Entertainment America have officially announced a 250GB version of the new , slimmer , lighter PS3 .
Full details such as price ( which is a lot cheaper than you ’d expect ) , and release date after the jump .
On November 3rd , SCEA will be releasing a 250 GB PS3 slim for the low price of just $ 349.99 .
No games are bundled with this model , which allows for a much more economical price .

( CNN ) -- Soupy Sales , a comedian from the golden era of television , died Thursday .
He was 83 .
Soupy Sales entertained generations of Americans with his off - the - cuff , wacky antics .
He was 83 .
The funny man seen many times on popular game shows died at a New York hospice , said Paul Dver , Sales ' longtime friend and manager .
" We have lost a comedy American icon , " Dver said .
" I feel the personal loss , and I also feel the magic that he had around him being gone .
That 's a much more severe loss than a loss of a friend . "
Sales was known for his long - running children 's show " Lunch With Soupy Sales , " which started in 1953 and began his trademark slapstick pie-throwing antics .
The comedy show featured skits that culminated in Sales getting walloped with pies in the face .
What are your memories of Sales ?
" Soupy was the last of the great TV comics when you talk about Ernie Kovacs , Red Skelton , right down to Howdy Doody , " Dver said .
" But it was bigger than that , because he used a children 's format aimed at the kids and then he would forget he was doing a kids ' show and do a wild , unrehearsed , wacky improv for a half - hour every day for 15 years . "
He could also inflame the authorities .
One New Year 's Day , upset at being asked to work , he asked his youthful audience to send him those " green pieces of paper " from their parents ' wallets .
Though he did n't receive much -- he told The New York Times he received only a few dollars -- he was suspended for a week for the prank .
Later in his career , he was a regular on TV game shows , such as " Hollywood Squares , " " To Tell the Truth " and " What 's My Line ? "
Sales recently fell backstage at a local Emmy awards show in New York and developed serious ailments after that , Dver said .

Why The 10,000 Point Dow Does n’t Matter
The Dow is at 10,000 .
Reporters glow .
Retirees relax .
Investors sigh : “ Whew , we ’ve made it . ”
They ’re wrong .
This purported milestone is n’t a victory .
It ’s nonsense .
The market is the wrong place to look when measuring the health of our economy .
The collective wisdom of mutual fund analysts was wrong in 1999 , wrong in 2006 , and it ’s wrong right now .
The best investor in the United States basically ignores Wall Street .
Warren Buffett has billions he could trade in and out of stocks .
Thousands of analysts would clamor to give him hot tips .
But Buffett ignores it all .
Serene , he sits in his office , reading annual reports , newspapers , and thinking about opportunities for growth .
He is n’t drinking champagne tonight .
And you should n’t be either .
We are far from out of the woods .
Large companies are still laying off employees .
When we cross the 10 % unemployment line , consumer spending ( now down to 70 % of GDP ) may contract even further .
It probably should .
Consumer spending in the UK is 65 % and in China it ’s only 40 % .
Have n’t we learned something from this crisis ??
Wall Street sold the world worthless securities , trillions of dollars of wealth evaporated , and now Wall Street is cheering this “ new ” bull market .
Now the bulls say it ’s all okay again ?!
What you ’re watching now is a bull market on government spending .
What you should be watching is the real report card :
Inflation :
There is $ 50T in unfunded liabilities on the country ’s balance sheet .
If the USA played by corporate America ’s accounting rules , we ’d be bankrupt .
The laws of gravity still apply .
We will experience significant inflation within 3 years .

Job Growth :
Since the start of the recession in December 2007 , we ’ve lost 7.6 million jobs .
Millions more have stopped looking for work .
The analysts keep saying this downward trend will stop .
But it has n’t .

Innovation :
The credit contraction makes it harder for entrepreneurs and small businesses to invest in growth .
This segment of the economy is where a rebound will start .
Do n’t watch the Dow , watch small business credit ( contracting ) and patents filed ( contracting ) .

Education :
The important word in “ Gross Domestic Product ” is product .
We must have highly skilled knowledge workers to compete against other economic innovators .
A third of high school students are n’t graduating .
This is the HR pipeline ??
Yes , we have stepped back from the abyss .
But some very smart people thought the same thing in 1932 .
Then 1933 happened .
Not so fast , Wall Street …
This battle is far from over .
Let ’s dig deep , focus on the long haul , and make the substantive policy and business improvements the economy needs to really rebuild .
Then , the Dow will take care of itself .
Report the suspicious , not the strange ?
I am posting this from the train station where I took this photo .
Translink and the RCMP have been running a set of ads recently where they show silly situations that do not need to be reported to the police .
However , for the most part , the “ real ” situations have been pretty criminal .
Seriously ?
Taking photographs is now a suspicious behaviour ?
If you wish to comment , please consider using Reddit .

Sony has a penchant for making questionable or offensive ads .
But man , nothing they 've done comes close to some of the stuff you guys came up with .
You 've been warned ; no whining about being offended allowed .

Guest blogger John Graham - Cumming initiated and led the successful petition drive to procure an apology to Alan Turing from the UK government .
John is the author of The Geek Atlas , CTO of a stealth - mode start - up , and a longtime programmer who has a doctorate in computer security .
If you ’re in London this Saturday , September 19 , come by the launch party for his book at the Brunel Museum .
There 's a long tradition in the UK of direct democracy , with citizens
petitioning the Prime Minister themselves .
Typically , thousands of
signatures are collected on paper and then delivered directly to the
Prime Minister 's home at No. 10
Downing Street in London .
The petitioners arrive at No. 10 and
hand the signatures through the open front door .
But the British government has made great strides to bring many
aspects of government relations into the electronic age .
Through the
non-profit MySociety.org the
government has created web sites ( all with open - source code ) for
citizens to interact with local and central government offices .
One such web site is the No. 10 Downing Street petitions page ( its code
is open - source and can be found here ) .
I used the petitions web site , a collection of Web 2.0 technologies ,
and a bit of media savvy to successfully petition the government to
apologize for the prosecution of the seminal computer scientist Alan Turing .
And I did most of it from the top of a red London double - decker bus
using an iPhone .
Alan Turing did three amazing things in his working life : he laid the
foundations of computer science by thinking up a theoretical computer
called the Turing
Machine , he worked through the Second World War breaking Nazi
German codes , and after the war he worked on artificial intelligence
and defined the Turing Test .
His
life was cut short at 41 when he had begun to work on morphogenesis in
plants .
Alan Turing was also gay and he was prosecuted for “ gross indecency ” ( essentially being gay ) in 1952 .
To avoid prison he agreed to be injected with female hormones as a sort of ‘ cure ’ for homosexuality .
Two years after his prosecution he was dead : he killed himself by eating an apple dipped in potassium cyanide .
June 23 , 2009 was the anniversary of Alan Turing 's birth ( he would
have been 97 ) and I posted a blog entry entitled Alan
Turing deserves an apology from the British Government .
It
generated a few comments and I posted a follow - up entry the next day
with an example of how
I would apologize for my government 's actions in 1952 .
That night I created a petition on the
No . 10 Downing Street web site asking for a government apology for the
treatment of Alan Turing .
On August 4 , 2009 the petition was approved and made public .
I
mentioned it on my blog , on Twitter , on Facebook , and posted it to Y
Combinator 's Hacker News .
At the time I thought I 'd have a hard time
getting 500 people to sign .
Little did I know the petition would
gather over 30,000 signatures in 37 days and elicit an incredible
apology from the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown preceded by a
personal call to my mobile phone .
This chart shows the number of signatures per day between August 4 ,
2009 and September 10 , 2009 .
( click for larger view )
The same day the story appeared
on Reddit .
Signatures started to come in slowly .
The next day the petition was picked up by the first journalist to
write about it : Jessica Geen of Pink News wrote an online only story
which made the story jump over from being covered just by computer
scientists and into the LGBT community .
The LGBT press would turn out
to be a strong ally reporting on the growing petition throughout the
campaign .
Four days later , on August 9 , 2009 the petition passed
500 signatures .
This was the magic level needed to get a government
response .
I was still pretty skeptical of getting an apology but I
certainly was n't going to be satisfied by 500 names and kept promoting
it on Twitter , my blog , and elsewhere .
The first really big break came on August 16 , 2009 when the Manchester
Evening News wrote
about the petition .
Manchester was where Alan Turing died and where
he had worked before his death .
There 's a great deal of local pride
in Manchester 's adopted local boy Alan Turing .
The following night I
was a guest on
BBC Radio Manchester 's gay hour .
On August 18 , 2009 the petition made the national news with a major
story in The Independent , and at the same time the first celebrity
name appeared on the list of signatures : Richard
Dawkins .
With one celebrity name and national press I began to think the
petition might really get noticed .
The following night Richard
Dawkins and I appeared
on Channel 4 News to talk about the petition ( Dawkins was filmed
looking regal in his garden ; I was filmed in classic programmer
clothing : bad shoes , dirty shorts and a crumpled shirt ) .
The same day
I appeared
on the BBC World Service and PRI 's The World .
Sitting on the bus each morning I would catch up on email regarding
the petition and scan the list of signatures looking for celebrities
who I would then try to contact through their agents .
I also plotted
how to get the story in the press .
Anyone who wrote about the story
got added to my Turing / Media email list and each morning I would
prepare an update on the story with the number of signatures , who had
signed and any other events , and send it out .
Over the next week many things happened : I appeared on BBC
Radio Ulster , I wrote a letter
to Her Majesty
The Queen asking her to consider a posthumous
knighthood for Alan Turing , the veteran human - rights campaigner Peter
Tatchell signed the petition and I received an email from the
writer Ian McEwan to say that he had signed .
I knew it was time to get the story out as widely as possible and so I
emailed two BBC journalists that I knew to say that I thought the
petition was an important story and that they needed to cover it .
Do you think you ’d be interested in covering the Alan Turing Petition ?
It ’s now got backing from Richard Dawkins and has been covered by BBC
Radio Manchester , BBC Radio Northern Ireland , The World Service ,
Channel 4 News , The Independent , … Watch : http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/pardon+for+enigma+codebreaker+alan+turing/3315187
for good background .
There are now 4,800 signatories .
John .
On August 31 , 2009 BBC News online covered
the story with a long article about the petition , and its celebrity
backers .
The night before I had gone to bed feeling happy that there
were 5,000 signatures on my petition ; I woke up to 16,000 , by the next
morning there were 20,000 .
That day I appeared on BBC Radio Scotland .
The single enormous leap in signatures in the chart above happened
because of the BBC News online story .
On September 1 , 2009 I appeared on BBC
Radio 4's PM program , CNN covered
the campaign , I appeared
on CBC's As It Happens , and Stephen Fry signed and tweeted
urging his followers to sign .
The same day I received two extraordinary emails .
Unbeknownst to
anyone I had written to MI5 asking them to release documents about
Alan Turing 's death in an effort to clear up any doubt about whether
his death could have been murder .
They denied
my request .
The second email
came from a member of Alan Turing 's surviving family .
The BBC report
had erroneously said that he had no family .
But that was incorrect :
Turing 's three nieces remembered him well , and he had a surviving
nephew .
On the bus home I heard directly that Alan Turing 's nieces had many
memories of their Uncle Alan .
They even still had his teddy bear .
I
hung up and sat at the back of the bus and cried quietly .
I had
always felt that Alan Turing 's treatment was appalling , but to hear
the family speak of the man was too much .
I was convinced that I had
to see my campaign , which had started on an impulse , to its
completion .
Two days later I raced up to Bletchley Park to film the definitive
report on the campaign with BBC Newsnight 's science editor Susan
Watts .
The report ran that night and the same day international
coverage of the campaign exploded with stories in the major press
all over the world .
The Newsnight story featured an interview with
Alan Turing 's nieces and nephew describing the terrible treatment he
had endured and giving their blessing to the petition .
On September 7 , 2009 I did a final piece of radio , appearing on BBC
Radio Ulster .
The same day I began to feel unwell with what would
turn out to be a nasty bout of flu .
Lying in bed on September 10 , 2009 I had to check my email because of
a work commitment the following day .
In my Inbox was the following
email :
John – I wonder if you could call me as a matter of urgency , regarding
your petition .
Very many thanks !
Kirsty Kirsty xxxxxxx
10 Downing St , SW1A 2AA
Tel : 020x xxxx xxxx
Of course , I called back !
I was told that the apology was coming that
night and that “ Gordon would like a word with you ” .
At 19:44 that
evening my mobile phone rang and I was handed the Prime Minister .
“ Hello John .
It 's Gordon Brown .
I think you know why I 'm calling you . ”
Update
The nice folks at No. 10 Downing Street and the petitions team released a spreadsheet of the actual day - by - day signatures for the petition period that gives an even clearer picture of the effect of different news outlets ( the chart above came from my hand written , sporadic notes ) .

You may remember that she attacked 12 - year - old Graeme Frost over the SCHIP vote and posted personal information about his family .
Well , now she 's lowering the bar and attacking an 11 - year - old girl .
( Malkin link here )
At least she 's an equal - opportunity smear artist .
I know this happened a few days ago , but I had to address it .
Bob Cesca covered it with his post : Malkin and Fox News Are Stalking Children Again
It 's a brand new conspiracy involving President Obama and an 11 - year - old girl .
The plot ?
To ask a question at a town hall meeting .
Scary .
Run for your lives and all that .
Rewind to Tuesday afternoon when an 11 - year - old girl asked President Obama a question about the " mean things " she observed on various protest signs outside .
Malkin and other wingnuts swooped into action , investigating and exposing the girl 's parents as -- shock , horror ! -- supporters of the president .
The girl 's parents even donated some money and volunteered on the campaign .
Mind blowing , I know .
It 's like the Donald Sutherland scene in JFK .
But considering that there were literally millions of volunteers associated with the president 's campaign , and considering that tickets for the event were available online where millions of supporters of the president typically hang out , it stands to reason that a few actual , you know , supporters would manage to acquire tickets .
Yet beyond this earth - shattering information uncovered by Malkin that Obama supporters attended an Obama event , there is n't any evidence whatsoever that the 11 - year - old girl was coached or scripted by the White House .
None .
And , it goes without saying that Malkin and Fox News Channel are entirely ignorant of the fact that similar Bush events were revealed to be literally and entirely staged and scripted with attendees having to sign loyalty oaths .
Sean Hannity had Malkin on his Fox News show to try and justify her actions .
I mean it 's sickening .
And yet networks like NBC put her on the TODAY show as if she 's a credible person .
Malkin :
The lie about the astroturfing is very important and I spent a lot of time today on my own blog talking about these Obamacare human stage props that OFA and HCAN have put forth .
And yesterday in Portsmouth we saw it with that little girl who 's mom happened to be a very invested and close ally of the Obama administration ....
The lie is that she denies any astroturfing has been taking place at the town halls .
I wo n't even post the information because it 's been so heavily covered , but the words " truth and " lie " are interchangeable with Michelle so why bother giving her evidence when she clearly knows about it .
Eric Boehlert writes :
Was n't Malkin 's infamous , and creepy , 2007 Baltimore drive - by* bad enough ?
I guess not , because now Malkin 's zeroing in on a young Massachusetts school girl .
Why ?
Because she got to ask president Obama a question at a town hall forum .
Bad idea !
( She was an " in - the - tank questioner . " )
The girl may as well have painted a bull 's eye on her back because Malkin and her online detective pals are takin ' that kid down !!
Stay classy , Michelle .
Next up , Malkin steals a toddler 's pacifier because his parents live in San Francisco and had an Obama bumper sticker .
" It 's just another cry baby socialist ! "

Marijuana growers , many believed to be affiliated with Mexican drug cartels , are aggressively expanding their illegal farming operations in the U.S. , clearing land to plant pot in dozens of national forests from coast to coast .
Illicit cannabis farms on public land first sprang up in California more than a decade ago and remain a serious problem in that state .
But in the past two years , the U.S. Forest Service has documented a rapid expansion of the practice .

Massachusetts - based First Amendment rights lawyer Marc Randazza is defending a controversial parody website which satirizes American political commentator Glenn Beck .
The website was created in September by a man from Florida named Isaac Eiland - Hall , and it asserts Beck uses questionable tactics " to spread lies and misinformation " .
The website created by Eiland - Hall is located at the domain name " www.GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com " .
Its premise is derived from a joke statement made by Gilbert Gottfried about fellow comedian Bob Saget .
The joke was first applied to Beck on the Internet discussion community Fark .
It then became popular on Internet social media sites including Reddit and Digg , and was the subject of a Google bomb , a technique where individuals link phrases in order to artificially change Google search results .
Eiland - Hall saw the discussion on Fark , and created a website about it .
The website asserts it does not believe the rumors to be true , and states : " But we think Glenn Beck definitely uses tactics like this to spread lies and misinformation . "
In an interview with Ars Technica , he said the website was " using Beck 's tactics against him " .
The website was created on September 1 , and by September 3 attorneys for Beck 's company Mercury Radio Arts took action .
Beck 's lawyers sent letters to the domain name registrar where they referred to the domain name itself as " defamatory " , but they failed to get the site removed .
Even an imbecile would look at this Web site and know that it ’s a parody .
— Marc Randazza , attorney for the website
Beck filed a formal complaint with the Switzerland - based agency of the United Nations , the World Intellectual Property Organization .
Beck alleged that the website 's usage is libelous , bad faith , and could befuddle potential consumers .
Beck 's complaint was filed under the process called the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy .
The policy allows trademark owners to begin an administrative action by complaining that a certain domain registration is in " bad faith " .
A lawyer for Beck declined to provide a comment to the Boston Herald , however a source told the newspaper that Beck 's complaint with the site is primarily a " trademark issue " .
Randazza established an attorney - client relationship with Eiland - Hall after his client received threatening letters from attorneys representing Beck .
He then sent an email to Beck 's attorneys , and pointed out inconsistencies between their client 's recent actions and his prior public statements in support of the First Amendment .
Randazza wrote a reply to the World Intellectual Property Organization , and contends that the website is " protected political speech " , because it is " satirical political humor " .
Randazza stated that " Even an imbecile would look at this Web site and know that it ’s a parody . "
In his legal brief , Randazza compared the website to other Internet memes , such as " All your base are belong to us " and video parodies of the German film Downfall .
It 's not often that I would recommend reading a World Intellectual Property Organization legal brief for its entertainment value , but today is going to be an exception .
— Andy Carvin , National Public Radio
" We are here because Mr. Beck wants Respondent 's website shut down .
He wants it shut down because Respondent 's website makes a poignant and accurate satirical critique of Mr. Beck by parodying Beck 's very rhetorical style , " wrote Randazza in the brief .
The brief also commented on Beck 's style of reporting , and pointed out a controversial statement made by Beck when he interviewed a Muslim member of the United States Congress .
Beck said to Representative Keith Ellison : " I like Muslims , I 've been to mosques .
...
And I have to tell you , I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is , sir , prove to me that you are not working with our enemies . "
According to the Citizen Media Law Project , the website 's joke premise takes advantage of " a perceived similarity between Beck 's rhetorical style and the Gottfried routine " .
Public interest attorney Paul Levy told Ars Technica that if a statement in a website 's domain name were both false and " stated with actual malice " , it is possible it could be considered defamatory .
The First Post reported that Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Corynne McSherry gave an analysis asserting that though the domain name of the website is " pretty dramatic " , it constituted " pure political criticism and there 's nothing wrong with that " .
McSherry and Levy both agreed that the action of Beck to take the matter to the World Intellectual Property Organization was probably a tactic to determine the identity of the website 's owner .
Andy Carvin of National Public Radio wrote that Randazza 's legal brief was amusing , commenting : " It 's not often that I would recommend reading a World Intellectual Property Organization legal brief for its entertainment value , but today is going to be an exception . "
Nate Anderson of Ars Technica commented " In any event , the WIPO battle promises to be entertaining , and there 's even a bit of serious purpose mixed in with the frivolity .
Just how far can WIPO go in using its domain dispute system to address Internet spats ? " .
Domain Name
Wire wrote that " ... when someone who has created a bitingly satirical web site works with his lawyer to put pen to the paper , the end result can be quite amusing . "
Writing for Adweek , Eriq Gardner pointed out the comparison made by Randazza 's legal brief between the website 's parody nature itself and the statement made by Beck to Congressman Ellison , noting : " this case also makes a political point " .
Jack Bremer wrote in The First Post that the attempts by Beck 's lawyers to argue that the website 's domain name is itself defamatory " looks like a first in cyber law " .
Rick Sawyer of Bostonist characterized Randazza 's legal brief as " Hillarious ! " , and called the attorney " among the North Shore 's most hilarious legal writers " .
[ Glenn Beck ] did the one thing guaranteed to garner the greatest amount of publicity for the site ...
— Politics Daily
The FOX News - critical site FoxNewsBoycott.com likened the legal conflict between Beck and the site to the Streisand effect , a phenomenon where an individual 's attempt to censor material on the Internet in turn proves to make the material itself more public .
" Glenn Beck is experiencing the Streisand Effect first hand , " wrote FoxNewsBoycott.com .
John Cook of Gawker.com also compared Beck 's actions to the Streisand effect : " Now Glenn Beck 's trying to shut down their web site , ensuring that people will write about it . "
Jeffrey Weiss of Politics Daily wrote that by taking legal action , Beck " did the one thing guaranteed to garner the greatest amount of publicity for the site " .
Techdirt described Beck 's legal action as " not particularly smart " , and noted : " Beck would have been better off just ignoring it .
Instead , in legitimizing it by trying to take it down , many more people become aware of the meme -- and may start calling attention to situations where Beck ( and others ) make use of such tactics . "
The blog Hot Air noted the issue could gain attention if it becomes a test case for the First Amendment : " If this becomes a First Amendment test case , the smear ’s going to be covered far and wide ... "

We 'll be happy to give due credit or to remove the images if so requested . )
The bell shaped Hubbert curve is commonly observed when a non renewable , or slowly renewable , resource is exploited in a free market .
But what is the origin of the curve ?
Ugo Bardi and Alessandro Lavacchi have recently published a simple " mind sized " model of the Hubbert behavior in " Energies " .
Fat cows and lean cows are not included in the equations of the model , but come as a logical consequence of it .
Have you ever tried to tell a politician about peak oil ?
If you did , you know what happens .
Supposing that he / she pays any attention to you , you 'll immediately face at least two typical objections : if there is still oil underground , what is the problem ?
If the price is high enough , why should production decline ?
It is not easy to answer these questions in the 30 seconds which are the typical attention span of a politician .
Failing to do that will make you look like a representative of one of those millenarian sects eagerly waiting for the end of the world .
And the problem is not just with politicians ; try to explain peak oil to your mother or to an economist .
It is not easy .
Possibly , peak oil will always be beyond the intellectual capabilities of the average politician , but it is also true that there are plenty of intelligent people out there who are perfectly able to understand the concept .
The problem is how do we explain it to them .
And , if we have to explain it , we must understand it first .
What is , exactly , that causes production peaks for oil and for other non renewable resources ?
If you look at the common explanations for the Hubbert curve , you 'll see that it is often said to be due to the sum of many extraction curves for individual wells .
( see , e.g. , Roger Bentley 's paper , here ) .
There is something in this explanation : as you scratch the bottom of the wells , you produce less and less and that may generate some kind of curve that first goes up , then down ( see this paper by Dudley Stark ) .
But this interpretation requires a number of af hoc assumptions and I think it is not enough to explain how general these curves are .
The bell shaped curve appears not just with crude oil , but with a number of resources which do n't have the same behavior in terms of single production units .
For instance , there are the cases of coal , whale oil , caviar , Carrara marble and many other cases of mineral resources .
So , there must be some general explanation for why we have bell shaped curves so often and in so many different cases .
Hubbert himself never clearly explained what he thought was the origin of the bell shaped curve , but his model has been analyzed over the years using various versions of system dynamics and standard economics theory .
There are many models which can explain bell shaped production cycles , including the well known " Limits to Growth " scenarios .
The problem is that most of these models are not easy to understand for the non specialist .
If you look at the scheme of the " world3 " model used for " The Limits to Growth " scenarios , you 'll see just a jumble of boxes and arrows .
How does one make sense out of that ?
Yet , the bell shaped curve is not so complex , in itself .
Ca n't there be a " mind sized " explanation for it ?
" Mind sized " is a term invented by Seymour Papert , the creator of the " logo " programming language .
He said that complex problems can always be broken into mind - sized blocks , and so can be grasped by the human mind .
Indeed , most of us ( including politicians ) tend to take decisions based on the way we understand what 's going on and our understanding can't be but mind sized .
In addition , we tend to ignore what we do n't understand .
That may be one of the reasons why peak oil is so commonly ignored by politicians and decision makers .
While trying to understand the Hubbert curve a few years ago , I started studying the history of whaling , which turned out to be a perfect example of a the Hubbert cycle .
Even though whales are , theoretically , a renewable resource , they were exterminated so fast that they did n't have time to reproduce .
So , I found very clear , bell shaped curves for the production of whale oil .
It was while I was working on whales that there came to my mind the Lotka - Volterra model .
After all , Volterra had developed his model studying Mediterranean fishing , so could the model be used to describe whaling ?
You have probably heard of the Lotka - Volterra model that goes also under the name of " predator - prey " or " foxes and rabbits " model .
You find it typically in biology textbooks , but it is not so often used in biology because it does n't catch the complexity of a complete ecosystem .
Nevertheless , the Lotka - Volterra model is a good " mind sized " model that tells you how populations grow and tend to overshoot their resource base .
Think of an island inhabited by rabbits and foxes .
Initially , foxes reproduce rapidly with plenty of rabbits : it is positive feedback .
But , with many foxes around , the number of rabbits goes down and foxes starve and die , too .
That 's negative feedback .
Then , without foxes , it is the surviving rabbits who have an easy life , they reproduce and grow .
At this point , foxes start having plenty of food again , and the cycle restarts .
So , I spent a few Saturday afternoons developing a simple fitting program for the whaling data based on the Lotka - Volterra model and , bingo !
It worked right away !
The model could reproduce very well the production of whale oil ( the prey ) and the predator activity , taken as proportional to the tonnage of the fishing fleet .
I could also simplify the model assuming that whales were just like crude oil : a non renewable resource .
Here are the results in a graph that I made a few years ago ( there is another , more refined version of this fitting in the paper in " Energies " ) .
A nice result , but I think that anyone who has just a whiff of an economist 's soul inside would find it appalling .
How come that you can describe an economic system without taking prices into account ?
And how come that you do n't take into account technological progress , which was there even in 19th century ?
Yet , the model catches the basic long term behavior of the system .
Evidently , the system is dominated by internal feedbacks rather than by technological changes or external market factors , which appear as variable prices .
So , there is this very complex system with whales , whalers , whaling vessels , the whale oil market and all that , and the way it has evolved in time is - basically - mind sized .
Whalers have been catching as many whales as they could , reinvesting their profit in more whaling vessels .
It was positive feedback .
But , with whale numbers dwindling , catching them became more difficult and expensive .
Profits went down so that , after a while , whalers had to reduce their activity .
It was negative feedback taking over .
Eventually , they had to stop whaling altogether , at least for those species of whales hunted in 19th century .
That was helped by the appearance of crude oil in the market but , surely , depletion was the main factor .
It has been estimated that at the end of this whaling cycle there remained only fifty females of " right whale " ( the main species hunted ) alive in all the oceans .
Now , I think there are not many cases of a quantitative fitting of the Lotka Volterra model to a real life situation ; so this is a very interesting result .
And , when you discover something interesting , you feel excited and elated .
But you have to see whether you have something that has general validity or if it is just a quirk of the particular system that you are studying .
In my case , I needed to show that the model applies to other resources , including crude oil .
That took quite a bit of head scratching .
Think of crude oil , the " prey " is oil itself , but what is the " predator " ?
Evidently , it is all those things that are used to find and extract oil : people , machines , rigs , trucks , etc .
All this can be described with a single term " capital " , as it was done , for instance , when modeling similar situations in " The Limits to Growth " .
The problem is how to quantify capital .
There are plenty of historical data available in terms of the extraction of crude oil and of other mineral resources .
But data on what I called " capital " are not easy to find .
And , then , what should be used as capital for crude oil ?
The budget of the oil industry ?
The number of workers ?
The number of active rigs ?
When I could find data for these parameters , I tried to fit them to the model , but nothing worked .
That was good , incidentally , because , at least , it told me that the model is not a " fit- all " model .
Since this work was done mainly overnight and with no financial support , it took me a lot of time , years , to reach a conclusion .
( There is a general rule in scientific research that says , " No research that is relevant is ever financed " . )
Initially , I enlisted the help of Leigh Yaxley , petroleum engineer based in Jakarta , and we published a preliminary version of this study in the proceedings of ASPO - 5 in 2006 .
Unfortunately , Leigh had to stop working on this subject because of other engagements .
So , I asked Alessandro Lavacchi , a former PhD student of mine , to give me a hand .
Both Leigh and Alessandro are much better than I am at data processing and curve fitting and , with their help , eventually , we found the key to the story .
Let 's go back to whaling in 19th century ; at that time the main problem related to killing whales was finding one .
Once it was found , killing it and making whale oil out of it was a relatively quick process .
In the case of crude oil , instead , the length of delay between discovering a field and getting oil out of it often amounts to several years .
But , the main point is discovery : once a field is discovered , it will be put into production at some point -- that 's almost automatic .
So , prospecting for oil is the main " predation " activity , and also the most expensive one .
So , the production parameter in the model is the amount of oil found , not the produced oil .
At that point , you can think that a measure of the effort ( the capital ) placed into prospection is the number of wildcats drilled .
Once we found this idea , it was bingo again .
The relationship of predator to prey was there , although it was not as good as for whaling .
Here are the results for the US 48 lower states ( the case studied by Hubbert ) .
In our paper in " Energies " you 'll find also the case of Norwegian oil and two cases of gold mining , including California gold in 19th century ( the forty - niners , my darling Clementine and all that ) .
I do n't know if that can be considered sufficient to prove the generality of our assumptions but , surely , there is something there .
In the paper that I wrote with Leigh Yaxley , we also show a correlation between the world 's GDP ( the predator ) and the energy produced ( the prey ) .
We did n't show this result in the paper in " Energies " because we are not really sure about this interpretation but , again , I do believe that there is something there .
As I said , this is not a " fit- all " model ; so , when you find that two parameters are related according to the model , you may strongly suspect a prey / predator relationship .
Indeed , once you start thinking in these terms , you 'll see that the " predator / prey " relationship is a very useful concept that can help you understand a lot of things .
For instance , you may go back to the jumble of boxes and arrows that is the " world3 " model , and now you 'll see that you can cut it down to a number of " mind sized " subsystem that are often based on negative / positive feedbacks similar to those of the Lotka - Volterra model .
It may be difficult to find sufficient data for a quantitative fitting but , qualitatively , the Lotka - Volterra model can be applied to many cases .
Here you can see it , without experimental points - mind sized .
We can see it in terms of a " results " curve ( the central curve , labeled " production " ) and an " efforts " curve ( on the right , labeled " capital " ) .
Think about that : have n't you noticed many times that there is this kind of temporal shift in so many human endeavors ?
You start with something that works well , so you increase your efforts and it goes even better , but at some point you see that no matter how much you increase your efforts , you can't increase the results any longer .
You have run out of resources , you get discouraged and your efforts dwindle , too .
It is a bell shaped curve .
Maybe I am seeing ghosts created by my own mind , but I tend to see many things that I have done in my life in these terms .
I see it even with the research grants for my lab , at the university of Florence .
Despite having stepped up our efforts , we are getting less and less money to run the lab .
" Peak grants " has taken place a few years ago and my lab is being destroyed by the same mechanism that , long ago , brought down the Roman Empire .
But we had started with the idea of explaining the Hubbert curve to a politician ; so , let me summarize the main assumptions of this " mind sized " model .
It may still bee too much for a politician , but at least it gives you a fighting chance .
1 . There exists a non renewable or slowly renewable resource which is limited in amount and " graded " in costs of extraction / production .
2. People will extract / produce first the low cost resource and will re-invest an approximately constant fraction of their profits in more facilities for extraction / production .
This is the positive feedback that generates the rapid initial growth of the curve
3 . As the resource is consumed , increasing costs of production reduce profits and - as a consequence - investments in extraction / production .
This is the negative feedback that generates the decline .
When these three assumptions are described by two coupled equations , they generate a nearly symmetrical , bell shaped , curve .
Political , technological and market factors may modify the behavior of the system .
However , since the curve has been often observed in historical cases , we can conclude that these three assumptions are sufficient at least for accounting for the main tendency of this kind of system .
In the end , do n't take the Lotka - Volterra model as the universal explanation of everything .
But it is mind sized model that can help you describe what the peak is ( including fat cows and lean cows ) next time you discuss with a politician .

Owls must hear to hunt
Noise pollution is becoming a major threat to the welfare of wildlife , according to a scientific review .
Sounds produced by vehicles , oil and gas fields and urban sprawl interfere with the way animals communicate , mate and prey on one another .
The sounds are becoming so ubiquitous that they may threaten biodiversity , say the review 's authors .
Even the animals living in protected National Parks in the US are being exposed to chronic levels of noise .
Writing in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution , three scientists based in Fort Collins , Colorado , US detail the extent to which noise pollution is now harming wild animals .
GLOBAL PROBLEM
In Canada , the number of frog species falls as traffic density increases
In Africa , the species richness of primates and carnivores falls within 30 m of roads In The Netherlands , 60 % of woodland bird species avoid roads Dr Jesse Barber and Dr Kevin Crooks of Colorado State University and Dr Kurt Fristrup of the US National Park Service reviewed all recent scientific studies examining the issue .
They found that man-made noise is already causing a catalogue of problems .
" Many animal species evolved hearing sensitive enough to take advantage of the quietest conditions ; their hearing is increasingly compromised by noise , " Dr Barber told the BBC .
That intrusion can have a significant impact on the way wild animals communicate .
Great tits ( Parsus major ) sing at higher frequencies in response to urban noise , so they are better able to hear each other .
But not all animals are able to adapt in this way .
Urban great tits have to sing at a higher pitch Female grey tree frogs ( Hyla chrysoscelis ) exposed to the sounds of passing traffic take longer to locate and find calling males , while European tree frogs ( Hyla arborea ) call less overall .
Crucially , both species appear unable to change their calling habitats to overcome the din from the roads , potentially compromising their ability to reproduce .
Noise pollution can also effect the ability of many animals such as owls and bats to find and hunt their prey .
Laboratory studies have shown that gleaning bats , which locate prey by the sounds they make , avoid hunting in noisy areas .
That can place gleaning bats at a higher risk of extinction , as noise pollution increasingly corrupts once habitable areas .
MAN - MADE NOISE 83 % of land on the continental US is within just over 1 km of a road
At this distance , the sound of an average car is 20 dB
At the same distance , average trucks and motorcycles project 40 dB of noise
For example , one gleaning bat species , the Bechstein 's bat ( Myotis bechsteinii ) , is less likely to cross roads than other bat species that forage in open areas , suggesting the noise of the traffic could fragment their hunting grounds .
The bat occurs across Europe including in the south of the UK .
In the Amazon , terrestrial insectivores , which also hunt using sound , especially avoid areas where roads are being constructed .
" Noise pollution is so ubiquitous that it may be a factor in some large - scale declines in biodiversity , " says Dr Barber .
The problem appears to be getting worse .
In the US alone , between 1970 and 2007 , the US population increased by approximately one - third .
Traffic on US roads tripled , to almost 5 trillion vehicle kilometres per year , while air traffic also more than tripled between 1981 and 2007 , say the reviewers .
Shipping noise has similarly increased , according to recent reviews of the effects that artificial noise has on marine mammals such as whales .
Gleaning bats rely on picking up the telltales sounds made by prey Even National Parks are becoming increasingly affected .
Despite being protected against the sprawl of towns and cities and other forms of development , noise carries into the parks from surrounding roads and planes flying overhead .
" Quiet places are especially vulnerable to noise intrusions , because even distant sources can have an impact , " says Dr Barber .
Systematic monitoring by the Natural Sounds Program , a research exercise carried out by the US National Park Service , confirms the extent of the noise intrusion .
Noise is audible during more than one quarter of daylight hours at more than half of 55 sites in 14 National Parks studied to date .
At 12 sites , anthropogenic noise can be heard more than half the time .
SUFFER THE ANIMALS
Birds with lower frequency calls are more likely to avoid traffic noise
The din from overhead aircraft disturbs the behaviour of harlequin ducks and goats Greater sage grouse and mule deer steer clear of noise - producing oil and gas developments
Much more needs to be done to mitigate the problem , says Dr Barber .
" Noise mitigation techniques include quieter road surfaces , noise barriers , appropriate signage in protected areas and most importantly , restriction of motorised travel in protected natural areas , " he says .
Otherwise , there may be few quiet places left .
" Naturally quiet backgrounds are an imperilled acoustical resource in many parts of the world , " Dr Barber says .

Stock markets disconnected from economy
I yesterday published a short post on Chinese equities and said : “… it looks if more downside is in store for the Shanghai Composite Index and it would not come as a surprise if lower Chinese equities serve as the catalyst for a well - deserved pullback in global stock markets . ”
With the MSCI World Index , the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and the major US indices coming off the boil yesterday , China may already have started leading world markets lower .
On a number of occasions recently I have asserted that the stock market has become disconnected from the economy .
Mohamed El - Erian , CEO and co-CIO of Pimco , yesterday shared this view in an interview with CNBC .
He said : “ The stock market has gotten way ahead of the reality on the ground . ”
Arguing that markets are on a “ sugar high ” , he added : “ Stock investors are making overly optimistic assumptions .
The key stimulus has already come to the consumer and has helped in the last few months .
But for the third and fourth quarters looking ahead , I am not so sure things will be as good . ”
Click on the image below to view the interview with El - Erian .
Source : CNBC , August 14 , 2009 .
The Q2 earnings season came to an end yesterday with Wal - Mart ’s report .
Although the bulk of the Q2 earnings reports have beaten earnings estimates , the actual level of earnings nevertheless remains depressed .
With share prices rallying strongly and earnings still heading lower , valuations have become stretched .
Based on operating earnings ( i.e. stripping out everything that is bad ) , the historical price / earnings ( PE ) multiple of the S&P 500 is 25.6 .
Getting past the loss - making fourth quarter of 2008 and calculating prospective multiples through December 31 , 2009 , reduces the valuation to 18.6 – still hardly the type of valuations that will inspire one to be a buyer across the board .
( The earnings estimates are courtesy of Standard & Poor’s . )
David Rosenberg ( Gluskin Sheff & Associates ) commented as follows : “ Based on past linkages between earnings trends and the pace of economic activity , believe it or not , the S&P 500 is now de facto discounting a 4.25 % real GDP growth rate for the coming year .
That is what we would call a V - shaped recovery .
While it is possible , though in our opinion a low - odds event , it is doubtful that the economy is going to be better than that .
So we have a market that is more than fully priced for a post - recession world – any further gains would suggest we are moving further into the ‘ greed ’ trade . ”
“ Obviously , if the current bull is going to have any sustainability at all , earnings will have to start growing again .
But for now , as evidenced by the skyrocketing PE ratio , investors are paying up on the hopes of future earnings growth , ” remarked Bespoke .
“ Do n’t be surprised if we begin another period of sideways trading now that the most recent earnings season has come to an end .
With the Dow down a quick 150 this morning [ Friday ] , it looks like the hangover could be pretty rough . ”

As I said before , a much - needed pullback / consolidation of frothy markets looks likely .

Projects based on / inspired by Uzbl
Sometimes people disagree on some aspects and start their own project .
Or they want more , and build something new on top of the existing codebase .
Here is a list of all uzbl - based / inspired projects I 'm aware of :
uzbl_tabbed : Python - based wrapper around uzbl ( using Xembed ) which provides tabs .
This script is included with uzbl , in the examples directory .
( started by Tom Adams and currently led by Mason Larobina )
pyweb : A browser ( ' framework ' ) in python , inspired by uzbl .
The main point here is complete integration with python , and hence compromiseless flexibility ( if you like python ) ( led by Tom Adams )
surf : I think I can best describe it as : ' Surf is to Uzbl what dwm is to wmii . '
Their codebase is smaller , but if you want to customize / integrate you 'll need to hack some C. ( suckless.org )
ffuzbl : A firefox add - on which brings the look and feel of uzbl to firefox .
( but does n't use uzbl itself ) ( Azer Koculu )
Ezbl : Probably the youngest of them all ; this project aims to provide a browser in emacs by embedding uzbl using Xembed .
( Daniel Hackney )
I also would like to port uzbl to / package uzbl for the n900 .
I have a project page ( uzbl mobile ) but did n't find the time to work on it yet .
Dieter
PS : We 're currently hacking and refactoring ' events ' in uzbl .
It will be much easier to handle all kinds of events ( better then the current handlers ) and also we 'll be able to improve the keybind system a lot .

Your principal incentive to recycle ?
That one ’s a no- brainer : the environment , of course .
But , it does n’t just have to be a green act of good will ; it can add a little extra cash to your wallet as well .
Recycling for money sure wo n’t make you a millionaire , but these days every penny counts .
So , cash in on your good conscience with these items .
Aluminum Cans
I ’m a soda addict , and I can go through a 12 - pack faster than a roll of toilet paper .
Even if you only drink a couple throughout the week , add your significant other or roommates into the equation , and the cans can pile up pretty quickly .
Instead of tossing them in your recycling bin , bag up your plethora of cans and bring them to your local recycling center for some extra cash .
You can also take them to a reverse vending machine , as long as they ’re not crushed .
Plastic Bottles
The same goes for plastic bottles .
Keep in mind that the majority of recycling centers pay by the pound , so save gas by accumulating as many as possible before taking a trip .
Glass Bottles
In addition to aluminum cans and plastic bottles , you can also bring glass bottles to a nearby recycling center or reverse vending machine to get money back .
Printer Cartridges
Hang on to your empty printer cartridges and send them in to be recycled by eCycle Group or similar programs .
While you ’re at it , get your office in on the action , too .
You can also bring them to a nearby Staples , but you ’ll receive store credit instead of cash .
PCs and Laptops
Computers become obsolete quickly , and that means more outdated electronics in the landfill .
But , it does n’t have to be .
Send in your old laptop or personal computer to Gazelle or search online for similar sites to get money back .
Cell Phones
My puppy recently mistook my cell phone for a chew toy .
When I told a friend , she told me that I could send it in to Buy My Tronics for cash – even if it ’s mangled beyond recognition .
iPods or MP3 Players
So , you upgraded to the iPod Touch , and you ’re wondering what to do with your old MP3 player .
That ’s an easy one ; there are a number of web sites that pay you to send it in , including You Renew .
Car Batteries
If your car battery goes dead , call the company you bought it from to determine their policy .
Since dead batteries can be reused to manufacture new ones , many companies will pay you to bring your it back .
Digital Cameras
Get cash for your old digital camera by sending it to Gazelle or other similar programs .
Game Consoles
Have you outgrown your game console ?
Even if it ’s broken , you can still send it in to Buy My Tronics or similar sites for cash .
Calculators
Sure , that heavy graphing calculator got you through accounting classes in college , but it has n’t seen the light of day since .
Get money back by sending it in to You Renew or similar programs .
CDs and DVDs
Trade them in at a local music store or send them in to sites like Second Spin to receive cash in return .
Books
Sell your old textbooks and novels to Cash 4 Books or similar programs .
Feeling really resourceful ?
You can also recycle …
Copper
Salvage copper from singed electric cords , leaky pipes and other sources , and bring it to a scrap metal center for cash .
Chances are , what you manage to recover is worth more than a bag full of cans and bottles .
Brass
Like copper , brass is worth more than your typical recyclables .
So , turn rusty old hinges , door knobs , plumbing fittings and more into cash at your local scrap metal center .

" We are not deterred , and will continue to visit the al - Aqsa Mosque , which is very important to , " the Islamic Movement in Israel said after Jerusalem Police decided limit the entrance of Muslim worshippers to the Temple Mount compound during Monday 's Jewish prayer services at the site .
Rebuke Jordan reprimands Israel envoy over Temple Mount riots Roni Sofer Amman says Israel 's policy on east Jerusalem causing ' unnecessary turmoil , ' claims Waqf director was ' humiliated ' by police .
Ambassador Rosen blames ' inciting elements ' Jordan reprimands Israel envoy over Temple Mount riots
Thousands of Jews are expected to flock to the Western Wall Monday for the traditional Birkat Kohanim ( Priestly Blessing ) ceremony .
Meanwhile , Hamas has called for a new intifada ( uprising ) to " defend " Jerusalem and the al - Aqsa Mosque , which is located within the compound .
The Islamist group issued a statement saying that " harming al - Aqsa will blow up in the face of the Zionist aggression , " and blamed Israel for the recent violence in east Jerusalem .
Police will allow Muslim Worshipers aged 50 and over and women of all ages , who carry Israeli IDs , to attend services at the Temple Mount . .
On Friday the leader of the Islamic Movement 's northern branch told followers that should Muslims have to choose between renouncing the al - Aqsa Mosque and becoming martyrs they will choose the latter .
" Should the State of Israel make us choose … we will clearly choose to be martyrs , " said Sheikh Raed Salah in the annual al - Aqsa convention in Umm al - Fahm .
" We are a nation that does not give up , we will die and win ; the al - Aqsa Mosque is not a matter that can be given up on , and we shall win , God willing . "
Thousands of Muslims heeded Salah 's call and made their way to Jerusalem 's Old City early Sunday .
Police initially restricted access to the compound – both to tourists and visitors – as a precautionary measure , after learning that residents of east Jerusalem were urged to " come to protect the Mount . "
Large police forces were deployed in the Old City as well .
' Carrying out policy '
The would - be precautionary measure backfired , as shortly after word that the compound had been closed spread , some 150 Arabs arrived at the Lions Gate and began stoning security forces .
The demonstrators were pushed back towards the Wadi Joz neighborhood , where they continued to riot .
Islamic Movement spokesman Zahi Nujidat said police " are carrying out the Israeli government 's policy .
This plan was formulated years ago – this is no secret .
( Former Israeli prime minister ) David Ben-Gurion said the State was worthless without Jerusalem .
" It is important that people realize that this is a religious conflict , " said the spokesman , " This is not about politics – this is our religion , our faith , so it is only natural that we pray here .
The government and police wo n’t stop us from doing so . "

The “ Tea Party ” Movement and Its Misuse of History
Mr. Stern is now completing his doctorate in early American history at Princeton University ; his dissertation is entitled , The Overflowings of Liberty : Massachusetts , the Townshend Crisis and the Reconception of Freedom , 1766 - 1770 .
He is also the author of " Jane Franklin Mecom : A Boston Woman in Revolutionary Times " ( Early American Studies , Spring 2006 ) .
We ’ve seen a lot of the “ Tea Party ” protesters in recent weeks .
Their main announced purpose , as they parade and wave their tea - bags , is to stop health - insurance reform , which they have branded a “ socialist ” ( or , alternatively , fascist ) invasion of private rights .
They complain bitterly about taxation , and about government spending in general .
Many go a good deal further , spouting incendiary ( and often blatantly false ) claims about government leaders and intentions .
They insist that the “ real ” America – whatever recent elections say – hates and fears that government .
They seem , indeed , determined to whip the like - minded into a frenzy bordering on violence .
Many prominent conservatives have happily embraced this movement .
House Minority Leader John Boehner proudly calls it the start of a “ rebellion , ” a rising of the angry masses against the government – a government he speaks of as if it had been imposed on the country against the people ’s will .
The protesters steep themselves in the aura of the American Revolution , claiming to embody its spirit .
Yet they seem to believe their anger should trump the will of a democratic majority – an idea that comes much closer to nullification and secession , the roots of the Civil War , than it does to our nation ’s founding ideals .
In comparing themselves to Boston ’s 1773 destruction of tea , the “ Tea Partiers ” grossly misunderstand the history they claim to champion .
“ Tea Party ” is , first of all , a patronizing name never used by the participants ( it was coined by 19th century writers uncomfortable with popular crowds ) .
But , far more importantly , the 1773 event had nothing to do with taxes being too high – and it certainly was n’t meant to condemn the idea of taxation in general .
The issue was taxes imposed from Britain , without the consent of the people or their representatives .
Far from denouncing taxation in general , the Revolutionaries often declared it their patriotic duty to pay , making much of their readiness to contribute to or even beyond the limits of their means – so long as they , through a majority vote of their representatives , made a free grant of their money to the government .
The Revolutionary movement had little to do with the modern conservative notion that taxation is “ organized theft . ”
The “ Tea Party ” movement , when it invokes the Revolution , is completely confused on these points .
Ironically , their take on the “ Tea Party ” is closer to that of the British and the Loyalists , who contemptuously caricatured the colonists as mere tax rebels .
The Revolution established elected government in America ; after that , the militant methods of 1773 no longer applied .
There were , to be sure , tax revolts after the Revolution – but most Revolutionary leaders condemned them .
Taxes were now passed by majority consent through elected legislative assemblies , and were binding on majority and minority alike : extra-legal risings such as the tea action were no longer considered legitimate .
Many , of course , from the founding era on up , complained that taxes were too high , or that government was getting too big and too intrusive .
But the Revolution had changed everything : government policy was determined by majorities of the people ’s representatives .
Those out of power have always had every right to challenge policies they dislike .
Yet the route to redress was now through elections and the courts .
Dissenters could not deny the legitimacy of elections they disapproved , or reject the rule of law because they disagreed with the majority ’s decisions .
It would surely be well if senior politicians such as Boehner considered these facts , before tossing around words like “ rebellion . ”
The “ Tea Partiers ” openly and proudly denounce our elected leaders as socialists , fascists , foreigners , and a good deal more besides .
Defining themselves and their sympathizers as the only “ real ” Americans , they want a veto over the will of the actual voting majority .
The leaders and thinkers of the American Revolution would have no tolerance for such tactics .
The minority ’s forcible refusal , within a republic , to abide by the majority ’s constitutional acts betrays everything the Revolution achieved .
That was why the Union eventually fought the Civil War – and one would have hoped , since then , that minority “ rebellion ” had lost its appeal as a political strategy .

None of which has been seriously challenged as a fundamental facet of the original design of the system .
These are all Federal intrusions into a system that needs oversight , not acts of fiat .
We play the hands we are dealt , sir .
The over - arching concern is how the rules need to be changed .

I do n't know which message boards you read , but consider what Steve Chapman wrote about President Obama at Townhall in September :
" He is president , in short , at a highly consequential moment .
And consequential moments inflame the political climate , because so much is at stake .
Does that mean the ferocious criticism has nothing to do with race ?
Of course not .
Obama may be a ' post - racial ' figure , but there is still a significant slice of the electorate that has never gotten past his skin color .
For anyone who regards blacks as irredeemably alien or inferior , Obama is a nightmare , not just because he is black but because he so thoroughly confounds racist stereotypes . "
Chapman 's article about the President and criticism of past Presidents and the comments are interesting .
See
http://townhall.com/columnists/SteveChapman/2009/09/20/race_and_the_opposition_to_obama?page=full&comments=true
Anyone who has read message boards where anonymous members of the public congregate has seen the President referred to as the Mulatto Messiah and his wife as Aunt Jemima .
Or worse .
And we 've all read the on - line discussions where people shake their heads at acquaintances who make jokes about the First Family 's family tree and gorillas .
One thing to look out for is the degree of comfort people have in calling out fellow posters with whom they otherwise agree ideologically when they make racist comments .
If opposition to Obama mostly is philosophical or political and not racial , otherwise like minded people should feel comfortable posting rejoinders such as " that 's ugly and uncalled for .
I did n't vote for him , but he 's the President voted in to office by a majority of the American people .
Let 's keep race out of our discussions of public policy . "
If such pushback to the comments about Mulatto Messiahs and Aunt Jemima and gorillas is n't there , then historians will have to try to unravel why not .
There could be any number of reasons related to the way people in groups interact .
Maarja Krusten - 10/12/2009 See http://www.marketwatch.com/story/story/print?guid=CE4D5D66-5492-4894-9878-5F3E1F769FBA
The writer offers that just in fun , but it's a reminder of how different tax and other domestic policy issues can look , depending on where one lives .
David Brooks pointed that out in 2004 in a more thoughtful column than the one in MarketWatch .
Brooks offered his observations in a column headed " Not Just a Personality Clash , It 's a Conflict of Visions , "
Brooks noted , " Politicians from the more sparsely populated South and West are more likely , at least in the political and economic realms , to champion the Goldwateresque virtues : freedom , self - sufficiency , individualism .
Politicians from the cities are likely to champion the Ted Kennedyesque virtues : social justice , tolerance , interdependence .
Politicians from sparsely populated areas are more likely to say they want government off people 's backs so they can run their own lives .
Politicians from denser areas are more likely to want government to play at least a refereeing role , to keep people from bumping into one another too abusively . "

I support efforts by historians to point out the facts behind historical events and to engage with the public .
I wish more of them did so .
However , sites such as HNN do n’t have a very broad reach .
There are many busy , well - meaning Americans who never read history , only get glimpses of the news , and have a vague and inchoate sense of how they and their perspectives on the past and present fit in with other citizens and the federal government .
Among the people in the Tea Party movement are populists , libertarians , and conservatives , among others .
What is the best way to reach them with discussions of history ?
Is it possible to do that effectively in this echo chamber age ?
Aside from the broader strategic issue , I ’d like to offer some tactical advice .
You write , “ The ‘ Tea Partiers ’ openly and proudly denounce our elected leaders as socialists , fascists , foreigners , and a good deal more besides . ”
That seems too broad brush and didactic to me as an historian , given the analyses I ’ve seen of the divergent elements that made up some of the participants in rallies .
Beyond that , there is the question of advocacy , in which you seem interested .
If you ’re trying to reach some of the persuadable people , I ’d take a different approach than you have .
\
At the AEI blog , Charles Murray recently wrote : “ My reader — the one I ’m talking to with every sentence — is a bright , reasonable person who does n’t agree with me but comes to my text ready to give me a shot .
My task is to get this reader to stick with me as we work through difficult questions .
If I take a cheap shot at his point of view , I ’m going to lose him .
If I duck an obvious objection to the argument I ’m making , I ’m going to lose him .
I realize that this is a saccharine , maybe even a wussy , way of thinking about what I ’m doing .
And it ’s more than a little elitist .
But we live in a world where a majority of the best and brightest young people who are going to shape the culture leave college with a standard liberal view of the world . ”

That is not to say that everyone is reachable to advocates on the right , left or in the middle .
Consider the range of opinions this summer just at two sites .
Kathleen Parker , a Republican pundit who writes for the Washington Post , observed in August in a column about economic woes called “ Anxiety Attacks ” that “ Here 's how a Florida real estate appraiser summed up the zeitgeist : ’ People do n't believe the politicians or the government stats when they know five couples who are losing their house and cars .
. . .
Basically , it 's a total disconnect from government , and government cannot influence their decisions unless they give them money , yet every giveaway reinforces their lack of faith . ’"
Her column is here http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/07/AR2009080702364.html?referrer=emailarticle
The response at FreeRepublic to her assessment of citizens ’ anxiety is here :
http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/2311972/posts
As you can see , Ms. Parker and the posters are hardly on the same page .
To unravel the sources of some of the anxiety , I think historians will have to take a very nuanced view .
J R Willis - 10/12/2009
This and your other post imply that the protests are , at the end of the day , all about race .
To say that no one is protesting the president simply because of the color of his skin is certainly wrong , a small proportion surely may be .
To suggest that all of them are doing so for that reason is a badly and over - played card , for several reasons :
- Obama 's job ratings have been falling steadily .
This demands that we admit a few facts , namely , that a significant proportion of the same people who elected him do n't approve of what he is doing .
Hardly a racist smoking gun .
Too , as hard as the media has tried , they have n't found any significant racial displays or motivations behind the protests , which , if they could prove , would have been splattered non -stop throughout the media universe .
It just is n't happening that way .
- Congress is just as big a target ( if not moreso ) of the protests as Obama , and this is not related to race .
It is about competance , vision , and execution , which has been found wanting in that body .
Congress ' approval ratings are in the toilet , and Obama is surely getting some negative feedback for his collusion with key members of that body .
I was deeply concerned that race would become an issue with this president , but I am both saddened and relieved to see that he has foundered so mightily that it really is n't a factor .
Lisa Kazmier - 10/12/2009
You 're being pretty disingenuous if you try to assert those are the reasons .
Read my post and watch that program first .
Lisa Kazmier - 10/12/2009
Recently , I saw a History Channel program on the history of the KKK and their stances against immigrants and the like .
The footage could easily have been shot this year at a Teabagger Event .
Indeed , a lot of the language used about Martin Luther King Jr ( except the N word ) has been used regarding Obama .
I suggest people look into this .
J R Willis - 10/12/2009
I stand by what I said , I think we are talking about degrees here .
Reaction to taxation was ugly , and often saw some violence .
But none of these acts approached the Tea Party in significance or repercussions , which is why I stated that taxation / representation had , by then , been eclipsed by a new form of abuse , and thus response .
One only needs to read the Declaration of Independence to see that this list of grievances had grown long .
Yes , taxation was important and it served as the launching pad for discontent , but it was NOT the only factor behind the Tea Party participants or leadership actions .
As for rebellion , it takes many forms , and not all are successful .
I never suggested whether it was " proper " or not , only that it does and will occur .
Having said that , are you suggesting the attempted nullification of the Alien and Sedition Acts , by none other than those rebels Jefferson and Madison , somehow violated the spirit of the Revolution ?
I do n't think so , because they were well - positioned to understand the difference between a Republic and a true democracy .
There is no doubt that Jefferson thought that the Contract had been violated , demanding the use of whatever means needed ( words , in this case , perhaps followed by actions ) was the correct response .
But again , I see no reason to directly link the violence of the 1773 folks with those of today , rather , I think that the two groups share very similar complaints and goals , even if the exact set of playing pieces have changed slighty .
As for denying the legitimacy of elections and laws , they may do so at their leisure until they actually act .
This is my main complaint with your otherwise good piece :
You seem to deny the right of dissent , but from only one ideological direction .
Lawrence Brooks Hughes - 10/12/2009
Which of these claims about our government leaders do you find " blatantly false ? " --
A ) We are saddled with a Secretary of Treasury who failed to pay $ 35,000 in income taxes for which he was reimbursed in advance , and for which he signed an agreement to pay ?
B ) We have a chairman of the tax - writing House Ways and Means Committee who admits he failed to report $ 75,000 in rental income
from a villa he owns ( ! ) in the Caribbean , and who admits that an account containing $ 250,000 was omitted from his net worth statement .
Forget all the other tax - cheaters .
Those two alone are worth several protest walks .
Jeremy Adam Stern - 10/12/2009
To deny the centrality of taxation without consent is to miss the entire thrust of the Revolutionary era , Mr. Willis .
Your statement that taxation " had not provoked such an uproar " by 1773 is so utterly wrong , it really makes any further discussion of the issue pointless .
I suggest you spend some time with the Colonial newspapers and legislative proceedings , and see what they had to say on the matter .
As for your suggestion that forcible risings against government are justified so long as they are " successful , " I think you rather proved my point than refuted it .
The forcible overthrow of an elected government by the frustrated minority destroys everything the Revolution stood for .
Such " success " would only mean that democracy had been " successfully " destroyed .
That was why the Whiskey Rebellion , nullification and secession were opposed .
And , quite apart from the widely documented tenor of the " Tea Party " protesters ' signs and statements , " rebellion " was a direct quote from the House minority leader .
The " Tea Party " protesters have every right to march , protest and call for whatever policies they wish .
They do not have the right to deny legitimacy to fair and free elections simply because they do n't like the result ; nor do they have the right to call -- as they do -- for forcible resistance to legal acts of government .
James Lee Winningham - 10/12/2009
If you have n't noticed the agitation for rebellion at these " tea parties " then you have not been watching .
Try living in Texas .
There are many here ready to leave the country .
J R Willis - 10/12/2009 " Crazies " ?
I would say that the Americans of ' 73 were a bit more " crazy " than modern protestors .
When someone in this modern movement tars - and - feathers an IRS agent or destroys a massive amount of government property while dressed as indians , then we can talk .
J R Willis - 10/12/2009
Do n't misunderstand , the tax issue was ever - present , but had not provoked such an uproar to that point .
The monopoly was the real spark , because it was seen for what it was : Government force .
The Navigation Acts and others beyond those had long set the tone , but as long as the colonies were not burdened too heavily , the relationship did n't sour until the series of extra-ordinary revenue measures of the 1760's .
Even then , civil disobedience was the chosen tool for resistance for the most part , not outright commercial terrorism .
I wo n't spend too much ink parsing your choice of " proper " , but proper and effective tend to part ways on occasion , thus weakening your argument .
Look at the Nullification impasses , the Whiskey rebellion , the lead - up to the Civil War , and that event itself .
Whether proper or not , these were issues that sought to address a perceived tyranny , and each was variously successful .
I do n't see many modern " tea party " folks suggesting rebellion , they have , in contrast , peacefully staed their deep displeasure with what they see as abusive government policies that they have no other way to resist , for a number of reasons .
Jeremy Adam Stern - 10/12/2009
In fact , Mr. Willis , the 1773 tea action had everything to do with taxes .
While the monopoly granted to the East India Company was certainly an extra source of anger , the main issue was the 1767 Townshend duty on tea ... as Caroline Hill correctly points out , the 1773 Tea Act was seen as a trick to lower the price of tea , thereby to sell the tea in the colonies , collect the duty , and establish the precedent of taxation without consent .
As for the notion of arrogant and invasive government , the point is that the present federal government of the United States has been fairly and freely elected .
That is an issue I very explicitly addressed : since the Revolution , the proper way to oppose government is through elections and the courts .
The 1773 protests and their extra-legal approach had no bearing after independence .
Today 's " Tea Party " protesters , by suggesting rebellion against the lawful elected government , are not the ideological heirs of 1773 .
william e vanvugt - 10/12/2009
Add to this the fact that many of the " tea party " leaders in 1773 were smugglers who were now being undercut by the cheaper tea -- cheaper even though it was taxed .
The anti-tax crazies of today have nothing in common to those of 1773
Caroline Hill - 10/12/2009
The 1773 demonstration also , ironically , protested lower taxes !
As part of the attempt to create the monopoly the East India Company was granted tax rebates , which would lower the price of tea .
. . and entice colonists to break the boycott .
After today ’s major announcements from Sony , not only did they make waves in the gaming community but they have given Amazon.com quite a stir .
On Amazon ’s ‘ Movers and Shakers ‘ list 3 out of the top 5 are PlayStation products .
The number one spot belongs to none other than the freshly revealed PS3 Slim .
Number 3 goes to the White PSP Go , and number 4 , is the 80 GB PS3 which just received a price drop down to $ 299 .
Tailing not too far behind at the number 16 spot is the 160 GB Uncharted : Drakes Fortune Bundle which also received a $ 100 price drop , down to the low price of $ 399 .
With sales skyrocketing for Sony ’s line - up , is this a sign of what ’s to come ?
Is Sony on it ’s way back to the top ?

Did they copy my idea or what ?
2 weeks ago in my review for episode 8 , Duped , I proposed an idea " ... entire episode dedicated to searching for the ferret in the Warehouse and in the process seeing lots of artifacts ... "
Now I know it 's a little different , but you gotta admit it 's darn similar .
So was I satisfied ?
For the most part I was , and I 'm fine with a revised formula .
If Pete , Myka , and Claudia are going to do all the silly stuff , and Artie and Mrs. Frederick tackle important problems , I 'm fine with that .
Saul Rubinek and CCH Pounder are good enough on their own , that Myka and Pete all the time can take a hold .
I thoroughly enjoyed seeing more artifacts though I was hoping to see less ludicrous ones .
Claudia continues to be a bright spot with her comments and actions though someone has to reign her in one of these days .
After the debacle last week , she still has n't learned her lesson .
Now is n't the right time , maybe a future episode , Claudia has to take some responsibility for her actions and realize that while she may be young , she has to be careful .
When Pete got caught by Sylvia Plath 's emo typewriter , I had to laugh .
How awesome is it that her typewriter sucks the life out of people ?
The whole deal with the Regents confronting Artie was well done , but felt a little disingenuous .
I thought more time could have been spent on that story and it wrapped up abruptly .
Once again , a guest star was underused , this time being Mark Sheppard who is great in everything he does .
To me , his career feels like Terry O'Quinn 's pre-Lost ( and minus his tenure on Millennium ) .
He 's a guest on a bunch of different shows , but never has a major role in everything .
The good thing is that the Regents will probably be recurring so we can hope to see him again .
The purpose of the episode was pretty clear .
The kids have fun in the Warehouse , while the adults do serious discussion .
We can pretty much see where the next 2 episodes are going .
The season finale is titled MacPhearson , so it 's pretty obvious we 'll get another confrontation by season 's end .
Cheesy one - liners , cheesy visual effects , and a whole lot of fun .
This is what I expect from the show .
Fun and not much else .

A leading climate scientist has presented new research findings on the increasing potential for a 4 degrees Celsius rise in global temperatures if the current high emissions of greenhouse gases continue .
The conference at Oxford University is the first to consider the global consequences of climate change beyond 2 degrees Celsius , and is jointly sponsored by University ’s Environmental Change Institute , the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research and the Met Office Hadley Centre .
Speaking at the international conference called ‘ 4 degrees and beyond ’ at Oxford University , Dr Richard Betts , Head of Climate Impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre , described the possibility of a 4 degree warming happening ‘ before the end of the century ’ .
He added that a scenario of very intensive fossil fuel burning could bring this forward by 20 years .
Conference convenor Dr Mark New , from the Oxford University School of Geography and the Environment , and the Tyndall Centre , said : " Since the late 1990s , greenhouse gas emissions have increased at close to the most extreme IPCC scenarios , meaning that rates of warming will be faster than most people expect .
The conference will review the best science on the consequences of these large climate changes and what we can do about it . "
In this presentation Dr Betts warned that 4 degrees of warming could have extreme regional implications along with major changes in rainfall .
He said : " If greenhouse emissions are not cut soon , then we could see major climate changes within our own lifetimes . "
Other speakers are Professor John Schellnhuber , Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research , on 4 degrees warming and the potential for tipping points ; Professor Yadvinder Mahli , from Oxford University ’s Environmental Change Institute , on the impact on tropical forests ; Dr Philip Thornton , International Livestock Research Institute , Nairobi , on sub-Saharan agriculture ; Dr Pier Vellinga , from Wageningen University , on sea - level rise ; and Professor Kevin Anderson , Director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , on global emission pathways .
The Environmental Change Institute ( ECI ) at Oxford University focuses on environmental change across the natural and social sciences with an orientation to applied and public policy .
ECI plays a leading role in three of the UK Government 's main climate research initiatives : the UK Climate Impacts Programme , the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , and the UK Energy Research Centre .
Topics from over 50 other conference research papers included : food and water security , vulnerable populations , human health , migration , wild fires , sea level rise , wildlife conservation , and ecosystem services .
Regional case studies will include Amazonia , Australia , Bangladesh , Brazil , Ethiopia , Finland , Mauritius , Siberia , Vietnam , and the monsoon region .
Court OKs barring religious tunes at graduation U.S. COURT OF APPEALS
A divided federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a school district 's refusal to let a band play a religious piece at a high school graduation , saying the superintendent had reasonably decided to avoid a constitutional controversy by ordering a secular program .
The district 's veto of an instrumental version of " Ave Maria " by German composer Franz Biebl at the 2006 graduation ceremony in Everett , Wash. , did not violate students ' freedom of speech or religion , said the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
The court said it was n't necessarily forbidding religious music at graduation - unlike prayers , which the U.S. Supreme Court has barred at high school commencements as an unconstitutional endorsement of religion .
But the appeals court said it was reasonable for school officials , concerned about an appearance of religious favoritism , to " prohibit the playing of an obviously religious piece . "
Dissenting Judge Milan Smith said the district had violated students ' freedom of expression and predicted such actions would " hasten the retrogression of our young into a nation of Philistines , who have little or no understanding of our civic and cultural heritage . "
Religious music , he said , is the backbone of Western classical composition and expresses a secular , artistic message .
The case arose a year after the choir at Jackson High School sang a religious piece at graduation , with the principal 's approval , prompting complaints from some students and residents .
When members of the school 's woodwind ensemble proposed playing " Ave Maria " at the 2006 ceremony , the principal referred the issue to the district superintendent , Carol Whitehead , who decided that all graduation music should be secular .
Whitehead was sued by Kathryn Nurre , a graduating senior and alto saxophone player , who accused the superintendent of censoring her musical expression and acting with hostility toward religion .
Upholding a judge 's dismissal of the suit , the appeals court said graduation is unlike other school events at which musical programs commonly include religious works .
Graduation takes place before a " captive audience , " the court said , and the time is too short to guarantee a balanced program , unlike concerts , which can mix religious and secular pieces .
" The district had a legitimate interest in avoiding what it believed could cause confrontation with the Establishment Clause , " the constitutional ban on government sponsorship or endorsement of religion , Judge Richard Tallman said in the majority opinion .
Nurre 's lawyer , W. Theodore Vander Wel , said his client may appeal the ruling .
" School officials decided to censor this song because of its content , " he said .
Barry Lynn , executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State , said the court had properly allowed the district to decide how to protect the rights of all students .

One of the major changes for version 3.0 of the inference collection is a rule compiler that generates code for ( portions of ) the match / join process .
This will be done at expansion ( compile ) time by the rule language macros themselves .
The rule language macro include , and .
The rule compilation itself takes place in themacro .
So far , I have the rule parsing , rule validation , and rule normalization phases pretty much complete .
The rule normalization phase converts Boolean expressions within the pattern clauses on a standard .
The first form is a simple rule while the second is a sequence of simple rules .
For example : would expand into the equivalent of the two rules :
This can simplify writing complex rulesets .
I am now coding the actual rule compiler .
This will generate procedures for matching pattern elements and joining matches - applying join constraints .
For example , the patternwould compile into : where each pattern element is a five element list ( ) , where is the pattern element type ( e.g. , #:variable or # :literal ) , is the key for association list matching , is a variable name , is a constraint expression , and is a procedure to match the pattern element .
These are used at execution time to build the rule network .
The structure of the pattern is maintained in the compiled form and is used to structure the match nodes and the data flow between them .
The , , , and fields are used to determine when nodes can be shared among rules .
Finally , the procedure in the field does the actual matching and variable binding .
Immutable vectors are used to represent matches .
For example , the patternmatched against the asserted factwould produce a match ofwhere is the assertion object for the specified fact and 10 , 14 , and 16 are the values matching the variables ?a , ?b , and ?c , respectively .
Immutable vectors are also used to represent joined matches .
For example , the patternsmatched against the asserted factswith no asserted ) fact , would produce a match ofA major bottleneck in the current inference engine is the amount of work done in propagating ( or unpropagating ) assertions and deletions through the join ( and rule ) nodes of the rule network .
For version 3.0 , I 'm planning on two ( eq ? ) hash tables for each join node to index left and right matches and a double doubly - linked list of joined matches .
This will allow efficient insertion and deletion of both left and right matches during join processing ( for propagating and unpropagating ) .
More to come .

The car can reach speeds of up to 130 miles per hour
Many people 's first vehicle costs peanuts , but a team of Northern Ireland researchers have helped take that a step further by building a racing car using cashew nut shells .
The Formula
Three vehicle , which is world 's first sustainable racing car , has been constructed using sustainable and recycled products - including hemp , soybean oil , potato starch and recycled bottles .
It runs on bio - diesel and has a top speed of 130 mph .
The car has already appeared at this year 's Goodwood 's Festival of Speed and was driven by A1 Grand Prix champion racing driver Adam Carroll .
Dr Julie Soden , researcher at the University of Ulster ( UU ) , helped make a barge board which is positioned behind the front wheels .
" It is exciting and refreshing to see an actual product coming out of the research lab , " she said .
" The next step in the process is the testing and improvement of the first design , so the initial work will be built upon to show the full potential and the scope of the research .
" While the safety critical parts are not made from sustainable materials , the racing car is evidence of the significant advances made by researchers into what is readily achievable in the sustainable composites field . "
The project was undertaken in collaboration with the University of Warwick 's Innovative Manufacturing Research Centre .

We ’ve got a great post today by George Stephens , Professor of Geology and Geography and Deputy Director , University Honors Program .
Dr. Stephens has both a BS and MS in Geology from GW and a PhD in Geology from Lehigh University .
He ’s been teaching GW students about Geology since 1978 !
Geology is the study of the Earth , its history and the processes that shape its future .
Thus geology is a four - dimensional science , three spatial and one temporal .
It is from this viewpoint that I am reading Flat , Hot and Crowded .
I am not an expert on climate change ; my research interests lie elsewhere .
But , as a geologist , my understanding of contemporary global climate change ( “ Hot ” ) and the increasing world population ( “ Crowded ” ) is informed by four billion years of Earth history .
My initial premise is that human behavior is , unquestionably , affecting our planet .
It is disingenuous to argue that deforestation and fossil fuel consumption do not affect atmospheric CO2 levels and atmospheric temperatures .
Long - term records from deep Antarctic and Greenland ice cores as well as short - term direct measurements confirm human - induced CO2 increases .
But it is also true that the surface of our planet has been significantly warmer in the geologic past .
Melting of modern - day glaciers and ice sheets is taken as a reliable indicator of global warming .
But for most of its history our planet has been entirely ice - free .
Glacial epochs through geologic time are very few and reasonably brief .
The last great ice age began just three million years ago and during this time there have been approximately 30 major ice advances and retreats .
A mere 20,000 years ago we reached the apex of the latest ice advance .
At this time virtually all of New England , New York , northern New Jersey , parts of Pennsylvania and much of the mid-west were covered by an ice sheet two miles in thickness .
For the past 10,000 years we have been in a warming post - glacial period .
Whether this truly marks the end of Cenozoic glaciation or in simply yet another inter-glacial remains an open question .
If another major ice advance is headed our way 80,000 years from now , maybe a little global warming is not a bad idea .
In any case , the Earth does n’t care .
Surface temperatures have been significantly warmer throughout Earth history , climatic belts have shifted dramatically and some biological species have thrived while others have been driven to extinction .
An examination of the fossil record confirms that extinction is the ultimate fate of virtually all biological species .
Paradoxically , simple life forms seem to be longer lived than more complex organisms .
Cyanobacteria ( think slime mats ) have been around for two or three billion years whereas humans began their evolutionary trek only three million years ago or so .
To put this in perspective , three million years is but a geological blink of an eye .
True , we humans have developed a hitherto unknown capacity to alter our world environment .
Still , biologically , we are just another species .
If we are unwise enough to use our opposable thumbs and advanced reasoning ability to drive ourselves to extinction , the Earth does n’t care .
Life will likely continue and another , less presumptuous species will rise to dominance in “ our ” ecological niche .
Over-population is another non-problem for Mother Earth .
Human population growth will ultimately be limited by the carrying capacity of individual geographic regions and the present exponential population growth will ultimately obey a “ logistic curve ” .
That is , the present growth curve will flatten dramatically and approach zero as the carrying capacity of our resource base is reached .
I conclude that “ hot , flat and crowded ” are real problems of planetary magnitude but they are ultimately only human problems .
Our planet will survive and perhaps even thrive with us or without us .
I am relatively pessimistic about the ability of the human race to come together as an international community to alter our current trajectories before it is too late .
But I am comforted by the history of cataclysmic changes recorded by our planet and by the robustness of plant and animal life in successfully adapting to these changes .

Earlier this year , Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak accepted the position of chief scientist at start - up solid - state drive company Fusion - io .
It 's the first time since 1972 , when he worked in Hewlett - Packard Co. 's calculator division , that he has held a technologist 's position for a company that was n't his own .
Unlike many other solid - state vendors , Fusion - io does n't manufacture a NAND flash drive product in a 2.5 - in. or 3.5 - in hard drive form factor .
The company makes PCIe cards with up to 640 GB of capacity and 1.6GB / sec. throughput that can be inserted directly into servers , greatly increasing performance for I/O - intensive applications while also shrinking space requirements when compared to high - end hard disk drives .
Since joining the company , Wozniak has n't widely discussed why he chose to become a member of Fusion - io 's advisory board and then its chief scientist .
Computerworld spoke to him about that choice and what he sees as the future of solid - state storage technology .
The following are excerpts from that interview .
Becoming a member of any company 's board that you did n't help create seems uncharacteristic of you , so why did you join Fusion - io's ?
I joined because I saw a remarkable vision , but more than the product vision , I saw the people who created the vision .
Their overall design methodologies lead to good clean products .
That 's what I saw in these people .
I really expected to be invited to join the advisory board , but I sort of got a position in the company , which was exciting because by then I was so sold on the company .
And , I 'm sort of a purist .
I like things with electrons moving instead of heavy metal parts -- maybe because I did n't grow up as a mechanical person .
Rather than spinning atoms , I like to get down to electrons , and who knows , maybe in the future it will be photons .
You 've never really been a storage guy .
What attracted you to this technology ?
Well , I was a storage guy really early - in floppy disks .
I do n't come from the heavy - duty storage area where you 've got RAID arrays and fiber optic channels .
But , actually , the way I approached even designing my floppy disk structures was to take out a lot of middle man technology that was n't needed - to look at the overall problem and get from the start to the finish in one quick jump .
And , I saw those same principles had been applied in designing [ Fusion - io's ] product .
Also , I 've been close to a lot of people who worked in data centers -- good friends -- and it's just like data centers always have huge racks and racks of equipment .
And , almost every entity in the world is basing its operations on servers and disk storage , so it 's almost unlimited .
So [ with Fusion - io ] you 're not confined to one little niche .
What initially caught your eye , though ?
I went into a meeting totally blind .
I had n't researched the company .
I had just agreed to have lunch in Los Gatos , [ Calif . ] with some of the engineers .
I 'd met a couple of really bright Ph.ds like [ Fusion - io chief technology officer ]
David Flynn ... and his background was with supercomputers and disk storage devices .
He 'd worked a very long time with a low budget at home , sort of the way we 'd done it at Apple and he had gotten far enough to have developed some very good working models .
He did n't go down to a venture capitalist with a sheet of paper and say here 's what we'd like to do and give away all the company to begin with .
I really admired the way he'd structured his start - up .
I started asking questions like , how would it compare to this , or how would it compare to that technology ?
How did you solve these problems ?
The answers came back very knowledgeable and very much in line with my thinking about how you should design good products .
They completed their financing round , which I had nothing to do with , and then they offered me a position in the company and I accepted .
It 's the first time I accepted a position in a company that I did n't create myself since 1972 with Hewlett - Packard calculators .
What do you see as the role of solid - state drives today and how do you see that changing over the next five to 10 years ?
I 've been a very big fan of solid - state storage .
I had dynamic RAMs backed up with power in huge tower - like structures that I 'd connect to early Macintosh computers .
I 'd use that as my disk and it would double my speed .
I 've been a fan of solid - state disk in my laptops - I always ordered them and paid extra for the solid - state disk .
I 'm just sort of a purist .
With music devices , even before the first iPod , I preferred to use solid - state storage when it cost a thousand dollars to have enough solid - state storage for an airplane flight .
So , I 'm just a big fan of that storage media .
Why ?
It 's just really interesting to see at the enterprise level that it 's outperforming and solving a lot of problems we 're having with spinning media .
It 's a very different approach to how you solve your storage problems .
I like to say solid - state storage , not solid - state disk , because a disk implies it's on a regular cable , plug - in structure that a disk could be plugged into and this is one alternative .
I like skipping that and just going to just one protocol in communication .
SSD appears to be finding great success in enterprise - class server systems , but not so much in the PC and laptop market .
Why is that ?
Hard disks over a certain size are still more economical than solid - state storage .
You have to pay a premium to have solid - state storage , and depending on the way it 's architected , it may not be faster in all ways .
I have flash in my laptop and it boots up and loads programs much faster than before , but the general operation does n't seem that much faster .
So why would you pay extra when you do n't see [ the added performance ] ?
I mean I 'd pay extra ... because I like the whole concept of reliability [ with flash memory ] , and I like to be a purist and like to be a little bit in the lead in doing something .
I like to have an early jump .
So I had this penchant for solid - state storage before the fact that it now has a place in enterprise storage .
That 's what really surprised me , and of course now the whole world is recognizing that 's a big part of the future of enterprise storage - at least on the first tier .
Why has solid - state storage done so well in the enterprise ?
There was a vacuum .
The solution had n't been recognized early on .
Even the personal computer could be thought of but it could n't be designed until the price of chips due to Moore 's Law came down to a certain amount of power in chips for a certain price .
In flash memory , that was n't obvious at first - how low it would get .
But as flash memory went into consumer devices [ MP3 music players , USB flash drives , for example ] and became such a huge product ... its price came down .
When I first talked to the Fusion - io people I asked how would it compare to a bunch of disk drives in a RAID array .
And , how about in an enterprise server ?
And they said we beat them 2 to 1 .
I 'm a practical person and I look at what really works and what does n't , and it 's incredible how much equipment they save and how much complexity they save and how much power they save .
Almost everywhere I go ... I speak to CEOs of companies and when I tell them what our product does they say , " Oh , my god .
We 've got to get onto this right away . "
We 've got the solution to so many problems that people are going through right now .
How do you see the PCIe form factor addressing the bottle neck issue between the CPU and the application as opposed to using SSD in a 2.5 - in or 3.5 - in disk form factor ?
I look at it as a more efficient , more direct connection to the high - speed bus .
That 's where you want it .
The processors are so fast now , you 've got so many cores , that they 're no longer the bottleneck .
It 's always been the disk channel [ that 's been the bottleneck ] .
Sure , you can come close in bandwidth if you plug a Fibre Channel board into the same slot .
But why do you want to transfer all your data into the Fibre Channel mode and then transfer it back .
Why do you want to go through extra boards to cables to more boards and cables and then transfer it back ?
Skip all that middle - man stuff .
That 's the same way I thought when I was designing computers , storage and disks .
Re-visualize the entire problem .
You want to get a little data from here to there , but you do n't want to go through extra chips , extra parts , extra pieces .
That 's unreliability .
The number of pins and connections you have is more related to reliability than the overall number of transistors these days .
I also like the fact that you just plug a board into a computer .
I 'm one of these guys that does n't like to see bundles and bundles of cables .
You know , where does this one go , and did I plug that one in the right way ?
Then you have to test both ends of it .
It becomes a mess .
I 've got racks of equipment in my home and I do n't like that .
It 's an overall mess that you look at and think , this scares away the common person .
It scares away a child .
I really believe that when you make something so simple that anyone can look at it and understand it , it even makes it easier for the engineers to understand what 's going on where .
That was one of the big things that turned me toward Fusion - io - using this form factor compared to the solid - state disk approach .
Do you see a day when solid - state storage will kick all spinning disk out of the data center ?
No .
I do n't see it kicking all spinning disks out .
In computers we have so many tiers of storage for cost efficiency .
Even when you have a hard disk drive it has its own cache built into it .
Then we have caching systems in operating systems .
Then we have different speeds of memory from your RAM to your L1 , L2 , L3 caches .
This is an in - between one , but I think it 's going to be huge - a lot bigger than people think .
It cost more money per bit to create NAND flash ... [ but ] in a lot of places kick out spinning storage .
I can see certainly in a netbook you do n't want spinning storage .
If you 're talking 64GB or less , it 's less expensive to have flash solid - state disk now .
But in a big enterprise - class data center there are huge amounts of data that are n't accessed very often .
It 's just mathematics .
You take stuff that 's not accessed very often , it can be accessed slowly .
And then you bring it into a faster form of storage when it is being used a lot .
So I can see solid - state storage in the enterprise as a type of cache , without the same programming and design structure as cache , but serving that same purpose .
How will the maturing of the flash memory market affect the DRAM market ?
Do you think flash memory could replace DRAM as a type of cache in the future ?
Indirectly .
When ... you have this high speed , local , very cost effective mass storage , all of a sudden you do n't need this extra level of cache to speed it up because it 's already fast enough to keep your processor at 100 % efficiency .
Apple , like many personal computer manufacturers , has been slow to adopt flash in the majority of its desktops and laptops - at least not as something that does n't come at a significant premium .
How long before these companies start really warming up to flash and offering it at a reasonable price ?
I do remember paying a premium for it , but it was like the first computer I 'd ever seen that offered flash from the factory as an option .
That was the MacBook Air .
So of course I ordered my Air with the 64GB flash option .
But now 64GB is the crossover point ... where it 's equally expensive to have spinning disk or flash .
So if your needs are met by 64GB , that 's your decision today .
Now , I look at my MacBook Pro , and I have a 256GB flash drive built in , and , yes , it cost me an extra $ 800 .
It gives me a little slicker performance but it's not a killer that everyone needs .
I can't say Apple has held back that much .
The new technology of the future , Apple 's usually the earlier ones to jump on in recognizing what the winners are going to be .
Things like USB , FireWire and a number of other such products over time .
When do you see the market for solid - state really catching fire ?
It 's on fire now .
I look back to the personal computer revolution , and we were n't selling many personal computers , but just as we were starting Apple , the first wave of analysts paying attention to this and saying it was going to be a multibillion - dollar market was so similar with what 's happening with Fusion - io .
Almost anywhere I go , I talk to anyone with a large company and when I tell them about our product and what it does , they want to get their IT people on it right away .
It takes a long time before that turns into huge sales , but what other start - up company do you know that has 1,000 customers in a year ?
I 've been associated with an awful lot of start - ups , my own and others , and I 've never seen one growing this fast and successfully since Apple .
So you 're comparing this in many ways to what it was like with Steve Jobs and Apple in the early 1970s ?
If I did n't think it was very similar , I would n't be here .
We 're bringing the revolution to the world .
We 're looking at all the competition jumping into the same market .
It 's an exciting time in life again .
On The Asking of Favors From Established Writers
It looks like it ’s time to do a little more head - knocking regarding the life of a writer , so let ’s just start knocking heads , shall we .
Dear currently unpublished / newbie writers who spend their time bitching about how published / established writers are mean because they wo n’t read your work / introduce you to their agent / give your manuscript to their editor / get you a job on their television show / whatever other thing it is you want them to do for you :
A few things you should know .
1 . The job of a writer is to write .
So , I ’m looking at one of my book contracts .
It says that I need to write a certain type of book ( science fiction ) of a certain length ( 100,000 words ) by a certain time ( er… Hmmm ) .
In return , I get paid a certain amount of money .
So that ’s the gig .
Here ’s what ’s not in the contract :
1 . That I critique the novels of other people ;
2 . That I offer any advice to people on how to get published ;
3 . That I arrange introductions to my agent , editor or publisher ;
4 . That I do any damn thing , in fact , other than write the book I ’ve agreed to write .
The job of a writer is to write .
To which you may say , “ Yes , but – ” To which I say , you ’ve gone one word too far in that sentence .
There is no ‘ but ’ involved .
Once again :
The job of a writer is to write .
Anything else a writer does is entirely on his or her free time and subject to his or her own whim .
Commensurate to this :
2 . A writer ’s obligations are not to you .
Here is the list of the people and things to which I am obliged , in roughly descending order :
1 . My wife and child .
2 . My work .
3 . My friends and the rest of my family .
4 . My editors and producers .
Now , you might notice that you are probably not in that list .
You know why ?
Because you and I do n’t share a life bond / genetic consanguinity / mutually beneficial business relationship .
Now , as it happens , I also feel an obligation to my various “ communities ” — the spread - out groups of people who share common interests with me — and one community I think about quite a bit is the community of writers .
However , two things here .
First , my sense of obligation to the community of writers is both voluntary and rather significantly less compelling to me than the obligations I feel to those enumerated above , and also does not mean I feel obliged to any particular member of that community ( i.e. , you ) .
Second , there are lots of other writers who may not feel a similar communal obligation .
You may or may not feel this is proper on their part or mine , but so what ?
It ’s not up to you .
Which brings us to :
3 . The person who determines what a writer should do for others is the writer , not you .
Why ?
Well , quite obviously , because it ’s not your life , and you do n’t get a say .
And if you ’re somehow under the impression that well , yeah , actually you do have a say in that writer ’s life , take the following quiz :
Think of your favorite writer .
Now , are you :
1 . That writer ?
2 . That writer ’s spouse ( or spousal equivalent ) ?
3 . Rather below that , a member of that writer ’s immediate family ?
4 . Rather below that , the writer ’s editor or boss ?
If the answer is “ no ” to the above , then guess what ?
You do n’t get a vote .
And if you still assume you do , that writer is perfectly justified in being dreadfully rude to you .
I certainly would be .
I certainly have been , when someone has made such assertions or assumptions .
And if necessary , I will be happy to be so again .
Beyond this , you do n’t know the circumstances of the writer ’s life , so you do n’t know what his capacity is for doing extra-curricular good deeds for random strangers , or his interest , or his ability .
The writer may simply not have the time .
He may not have the connections .
He may not feel competent to evaluate your work .
Or he may just not want to , because after everything else he does , he ’s tired and just wants to kill zombies on his computer .
Again , you may object to this , or feel your favorite writer should make a special exception for you and your work .
But again : So what ?
It ’s not your life .
4. Writers are not dicks for not helping you .
Let ’s say you ask me to read your work and I tell you “ no . ”
What happens then ?
a) You perish in a burning house .
b) You starve to death .
c ) You die due to sepsis of the blood because both your kidneys have failed .
d ) You are smothered by adorable kittens and fluffy bunnies .
e ) Nothing .
The correct answer is “ e ” .
Because you know what , my refusal to read your work has not damaged you or your work in any way .
This is not a life or death situation , and all the normal ways of intake into the world of professional writing — the various query and submission processes , the workshops and writers circles — remain as open to you as they ever were .
Let ’s review .
When you ask me ( or any writer ) to read your work , you are asking for a favor .
A favor is generally understood to be something that someone is not obliged to do and is indeed an imposition , to a greater or lesser degree , on the person being asked by the person asking .
People are not dicks for refusing to grant a favor , and someone who believes them so either does n’t understand the nature of a favor , or is a bit of a dick themselves for thinking that favors must or even should be granted .
Along this line :
5 . People asking for favors from writers often do n’t understand the consequences of that favor .
You know , right after I announced that I was hired as the Creative Consultant for Stargate : Universe , people I did n’t know came out of the woodwork asking me if I could hook them up with gigs or send along their scripts or if I give them the e-mail of the producers so they could talk to them about this great idea they had .
You know what would have happened if I had done any of that ?
If you say “ oh , you ’d probably have gotten fired , ” you ’d be absolutely correct .
It would have been frankly insane for me to jeopardize my gig that way .
I ended up putting up a note telling people to stop asking , but I still to this day get people who think that it ’s somehow logical to ask a complete stranger who knows nothing about them ( and who they know nothing about ) to carry water for them .
When you ask a favor of a writer , you ’re asking her to take time from her own work and / or her own life .
You are asking her to assume you ’re not crazy or wo n’t turn spiteful or angry when she can’t give you 100 % of what you want .
You are asking her to assume that 10 years from now you wo n’t sue her because something she ’s written is somewhat tangentially related to something you asked her to read .
You ’re asking her to assume that continually pestering her own contacts on behalf of people she does n’t know at all wo n’t jeopardize her own relationships with those contacts .
And so on .
6 . People asking favors from writers are often crazy in some undiagnosed way .
Yes , I know .
You ’re not crazy , and you wo n’t become an asshole to the author , and you wo n’t sue them even though that story is exactly like yours was , sorta .
But there are two things here .
First , the people who ask a writer to do things for them underestimate the number of times authors get asked for these sorts of favors .
People : you ’re not special when you ask us for our time / effort / connections .
Personally , I started getting asked for hook - ups by strangers when I was still in college ( I was freelancing for the Sun - Times then ) , so that ’s two decades of being solicited , and no , not even posting a “ why I wo n’t read your unpublished work ” post here stops it , because lots of people believe , oh , that does n’t apply to them .
Second , ask a writer and they will tell you a horror story of trying to help out someone by critiquing their novel or some other nice thing they tried to do in their capacity as a writer , only to have that person go completely nuts on them , for whatever reason .
The specifics will vary , because crazy is a multi- headed hydra of abject terror , but just about every writer I know has a story .
Some , who still believed in the fundamental sanity of people after such an experience , have two .
Almost none have three .
The point is , you may be a nice , sane , rational person who will be grateful for any help you get from a writer .
The problem is , other people out there are flat - out bugshit nutbags , and they are asking for the same things you are .
It only takes one of them to ruin it for the rest of you , and the problem is that from the outside , you all look pretty much the same .
Sorry .
7. Writers are not mystical door openers .
At least not in a professional sense .
If I read your novel and critiqued it , the critique will tell you how to make to novel more like something I want to read .
But you know what ?
I ’m not an acquiring editor at a publisher , and what I consider readable and what that editor were to consider saleable are likely not in parallel .
Likewise , I could introduce you to my agent or editor , but I guarantee you that neither of them are going to suspend their judgment to rely on mine ; they will happily reject your work if it does n’t suit their needs , even if I love it insensibly .
The most I or almost any other writer can get you , professionally speaking , is a small jump ahead in a line .
But if your writing does n’t work , you ’re still going to get rejected .
And if I spend all my time touting people who my agent and editor end up rejecting , in a very short period of time I ’m going to become someone you definitely do n’t want on your side .
What it comes down to is that the belief that selling work really comes down to who you know is magical thinking , or at the very least it ’s wildly overrated in terms of what actually sells work .
Yes , there are authors for whom their assurance of a blurb on your cover might convince a publisher to buy your novel , sight ( and quality ) unseen .
Currently , they are called “ Stephenie Meyer ” and “ Dan Brown . ”
As for every other writer in the land , well , it ’s nice you imagine us with such mighty powers .
But you really are better off simply submitting your work the regular way .
Finally , there ’s this :
8. Writers remember :
If you ask for a favor and I say no and your response is to throw a fit about how elitist writing assholes such as myself are pulling up the ladder after us and we all suck , I will remember that .
If you ask for a favor and I say yes and you do n’t end up getting what you want and you throw a fit about it , I will remember that too .
If you ask for a favor and I say no and your response is gracious , I will also remember that .
And if you ask for a favor and I say yes , and you do end up getting what you want , I will remember how you respond to that as well .
As will any writer in my position .
What will it mean that we remember these things about you ?
On one hand , it might not matter much .
On the other hand , writers , like all professionals , talk shop .
We talk shop with other writers , with editors , with publishers and with everyone else in our little industry .
Occasionally we are in a position to help people .
Occasionally we ’re in a position to influence the selection of a writer for an assignment .
Occasionally there ’ll be work we ’ve been offered and can’t take , but will be in a position to suggest someone who can .
Occasionally we ’ll switch hats and become editors or producers and be in a position to buy work .
And then , of course , remembering will , in fact , matter .
It does n’t mean I or anyone else will take the opportunity to be a dick , mind you .
We will simply remember who we think is worth helping or considering , and who is not .
And that ’s something for you to remember .
And now we ’re done .
The Obama administration took its strongest action to date against highly destructive mining practice today , putting a hold on dozens of mountaintop removal projects in the Appalachian region .
The Environmental Protection Agency said it was ordering a review of 79 permits in West Virginia , Virginia , Ohio and Kentucky to mine for coal by blowing the tops of mountains to assess the impact on water quality .
Mountaintop removal involves dynamiting the tops of mountains - leaving mounds of debris in neighbour rivers and waterways - razing forests and cutting off hundreds of feet of rock to reach narrow seams of coal .
The EPA said it had continuing concerns about toxic debris from the mine sites , and the loss of hundreds of miles of streams , which were choked off by the rubble .
" The administration pledged earlier this year to improve review of mining projects that risked harming water quality .
Release of this preliminary list is the first step in a process to assure that the environmental concerns raised by the 79 permit applications are addressed and that permits issued are protective of water quality and affected ecosystems , " the EPA administrator , Lisa Jackson , said in a statement .
The decision was welcomed by some environmental organisations as a key break by the Obama administration with the policies set by George Bush .
Appalachian Voices , a local activist coalition , said in a statement :
" By recommending these permits not be approved , the EPA and the Army Corps has demonstrated their intention to fulfill a promise to provide science - based oversight which will limit the devastating environmental impacts of mountaintop removal mining . "
But environmental organisations are still pressing the Obama administration for an outright ban on mountaintop removal , which environmentalists say is the most destructive method of extracting coal .
Bush - era regulations had made it far easier for mining companies to win approval for mountaintop removal and to avoid regulatory control .
The EPA , in Bush 's eight - year term , did not oppose a single permit for mountaintop removal .
Jackson , in a recent interview , admitted the agency had grown " toothless " .
The Obama administration signalled last June that it would take a tougher approach to enforcement .
Earlier this week , the agency said it would halt West Virginia 's biggest mining project , spread over 2,300 acres , because of concerns over dumping debris .
The agency now has two weeks to issue its final decision on the pending permits .
Projects that do meet EPA environmental standards will move ahead .
Notice how the Gestapo , like Cheney , had doctors present , and all torture was very carefully monitored .
Blows with a stick , like collaring someone and bashing his body against a plywood wall - were carefully monitored to a maximum number of times .
The " windowless cells " , and sleep deprivation are identical to Cheney 's methods .
In the 1948 trial , cold baths were also used to bring prisoners ' temperatures down to near - death levels , like those used by Navy SEALS in Afghanistan , by McChrystal 's special ops in Iraq , and by Cheney 's supervised torture in Gitmo .
The victims wore no uniforms ( which was used as a defense by the Nazis in the trial as they have been used by some on the right to defend American torture ) , and , unlike those subjected to Cheney 's torture techniques , none of those tortured by the Gestapo died in the process .
In fact , the Gestapo 's defense at trial was John Yoo's :
Most of the injuries inflicted were slight and did not result in permanent disablement .
The Gestapo did not use waterboarding - so their methods of interrogation in this case were not as extreme as Cheney's .
Nonetheless , the US - run court ruled that Cheney - style EITs , deployed by the Gestapo with the same justification as Cheney , constituted prosecutable torture :
As extenuating circumstances , [ accused torturer ]
Bruns had pleaded various incidents in which he had helped Norwegians , Schubert had pleaded difficulties at home , and Clemens had pointed to several hundred interrogations during which he had treated prisoners humanely .
The Court did not regard any of the above - mentioned circumstances as a sufficient reason for mitigating the punishment and found it necessary to act with the utmost severity .
Each of the defendants was responsible for a series of incidents of torture , every one of which could , according to Art. 3 ( a ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of the Provisional Decree of 4th May , 1945 , be punished by the death sentence .
And they were executed for war crimes .
The question Americans have to ask themselves is why they hold the former president and vice - president to lower moral and ethical standards than the United States once held the Gestapo .
That 's all .
And that 's everything , is n't it ?

The Acorn scandal continues to mushroom .
Yesterday BigGovernment.com published videos from a fourth Acorn office visit by freelance investigators James O'Keefe and Hannah Giles .
As Johnny Carson used to say , it 's weird , wild stuff .
The woman manning the Acorn office in San Bernardino , Calif. , Tresa Kaelke , responds to the pair 's requests for help setting up a child - prostitution ring by claiming to be an ex-prostitute herself .

Robert Altman fit none of these molds , just as he never managed to conform to the image of a Hollywood director .
At school he was not much taken with anything except pranks and mischief .
He liked to have a good time and he enjoyed the facilities of that philosophy - - a little booze , some girls , late nights , and spare time .
He had an instinct for moviemaking , proved on training films at Calvin , and occasionally he decided that he really ought to try Hollywood .
But several visits in the post war years came to nothing .
He was busy and well - intentioned , but sort of aimless -- is it possible that he never took himself that seriously ?
A few years later , he admitted that " I started in the film business not too long ago , right here on this soundstage .
It was a stormy beginning , and as I remember , I was in such a hurry to ‘ make it ’ that I often forgot to stand still long enough to do what it was I was trying to do .
I ’m not sure -- even today -- that I knew what it was I was trying to do , but I do know that I tried very , very hard , and ran around and around my goal until either I or it became like tigers turning into a circle of melted butter .
And never once stopping to wonder what it was I was chasing -- or was it , by then , chasing me . "
Ambition in movies was supposed to be more sharply focused , but Altman seemed to exist in his own haze .
Gradually , during the 1950s and early 1960s , he gathered real credits : he did a bad picture called The Delinquents , and that got him the co-directing job on a maudlin documentary , The James Dean Story .
( But there was no hint that Altman identified with Dean , or his troubled generation , or the mawkish theme song on the Dean film - -" Let Me Be Loved . " )
He did some work directing television and he made a sci- fi picture called Countdown .
What that meant was that as he came to make M.A.S.H. , in 1970 , he was already forty - five -- in a movie world in which people such as Coppola , Lucas , Scorsese , Bogdanovich , and Spielberg were getting their break at half his age .
Was the Kansas City man a late developer , or a drummer who moved to his own lazy beat ?
Altman nearly missed out on M.A.S.H .
He was not well known enough .
There were arguments that it was right for Stanley Kubrick .
But two friends , George Litto and Ingo Preminger , carried the day , despite the studio ’s refusal to give Altman any points on profits .
Then the picture was a breakout hit after Fox had thought it would need a lot of changes .
Riotous preview screenings showed that Altman ’s insouciance and irreverence had caught a new young mood of 1970 .
So the military field hospital in Korea abandoned every hallowed sense of duty and respect .
It treated the doctoring as a bloody job for hip young guys worried about tee times and fucking nurses .
Of course it was truer to life than any war comedy had ever been , and beneath the blood and the wisecracks it was easy to mistake Korea for Vietnam -- who really knew , when it had been shot at Malibu and in the L.A. canyons ?
M.A.S.H. was a merciless celebration of a men ’s club -- perhaps the only sane way to handle a war -- and was so steadily funny that audiences were either offended or charmed .
But they were never indifferent .
As much as any movie of the 1970s , M.A.S.H. divided the crowd -- and though it got a best - picture nomination and a nod for Altman himself , the grindingly archaic Patton won those Oscars .
In hindsight , we are left wishing that the inspired teasing and disrespect of Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould could be ladled over the pomp of George C. Scott !
M.A.S.H. came from a novel that the distinguished scenarist Ring Lardner Jr. had adapted .
But then Altman proceeded to trash and re-do Lardner ’s script -- the Oscar was the writer ’s reward , said the deadpan Altman .
At last a personal style was at work : the film was an excuse for an ensemble in which outward codes of rank and duty were dismantled by improvisation and insurrection .
The players refused to take anything seriously , and Altman reduced everyone to the level of " support . "
All of a sudden you could detect an attitude in Altman that most set - piece American movies were stuffed , and deserved deflation and deconstruction .
In time M.A.S.H. was a smash ( the only one of Altman ’s career ) , and so liberating that it paved the way for a TV series that increasingly settled for the sweet routines of character , comedy , and anti-war sentiments .
The astonishing thing about the movie M.A.S.H. -- and Altman made not a penny from the TV show -- is that it did not even bother to be anti-war .
Jenson Button and Brawn GP are continuing their discussions about money but it is not expected that there will be any change in the relationship in 2010 , when Button is expected to be joined by Mercedes - Benz nominee Nico Rosberg .
The delay in confirming the deal is based on talks over money as Button wants to be rewarded for his achievements this year and for his loyalty to the team , having agreed to a salary cut to help the team survive over the winter .
Things have changed fairly dramatically since then in terms of the world economy and the value of drivers has plummeted because the number of good seats in F1 is a limited commodity and a driver must take what he can get if he wants a competitive car .
The word is that Brawn is only offering $ 8 m as a basic salary , while the stars in F1 these days have been used to numbers in the $ 30 m range in recent years .
The reality is that those days are gone and drivers must accept what they can get .
This is fine when one has a dominant car but , when that changes , teams may find themselves struggling to get the best when times are hard .
Williams went through a series of years when the team ditched World Champions because they wanted too much money .
Now Williams needs top drivers but cannot get them because the cars are not quite competitive enough .
The skill is to get the whole package with everyone happy .
The reality is that there will be a settlement between Brawn and Button , probably with bonus schemes that work for both sides .
Opinion Welcome to the New Germany
After Sunday 's election , Germany 's political landscape has been shaken up , perhaps for ever .
Angela Merkel 's conservatives will be able to form a coalition government with the business - friendly FDP , but the balance of power between the two parties has fundamentally shifted .
And the once - powerful Social Democrats may never recover from their defeat .

How many politicians would walk onto a set of a TV show out of the blue and eviscerate the entire pundit panel ?
Alan Grayson strolled out onto the stage of CNN's The Situation Room and took on their crew including Blitzer , Carville , Johns and that whack job Alex Castellanos over his remarks about the non-existent GOP health care .
He started by saying " they have no plan ! " and by not having a plan , they are hurting Americans .
Blitzer was so shocked that Grayson actually said something nobody in the media wants to talk about .
Grayson :
They just want to stop everything .
Blitzer : Has any Democratic leader asked you to apologize to the republicans .
Grayson :
No and you know why ?
Because I 'm saying what everyone else has been thinking , but no one else has been saying .
Blitzer :
And so you have no intention of apologizing ?
Grayson :
Of course not .
Apologize ?
I 'm not the one who should be apologizing , they should be apologize to America .
Johns :
Was n't it over the top though ?
I mean wo n't you at least admit that ?
Grayson :
Well , Look I'm 6 , 4 so it takes a lot to get over my head .
Castellanos : I 'm a republican congressman and I have a question .
Which particular Americans do you think I 'd like to die ?
Can you name some ?
Listen ,
Do you want to make sure that people have affordable universal comprehensive health care in this country , do you ?
Castellanos : : Yes
Now what have you done about it ?
Castellanos : Republicans have a very different approach than the democrats do but it 's very concrete .
Instead of a big government gamble ...
Oh , please ... That 's amorphous nonsense
Do you really think that Tort reform is going to take care of 47 million people not having ....
Borger tries to talk , but Alex cuts her off ...
Shopping across state lines ..
Oh and you really think that 's going to solve
Letting individuals have the same advantages of buying insurances that business have
Grayson :
You know , that 's just helping the people who give republicans money ...
Let 's concentrate on helping this country , saving lives and saving money and not the usual cliches .
--
Grayson :
These are foot dragging , knuckle dragging neanderthals who think they can dictate policy to America by being stubborn and I think the time is over .
We had an election , that 's it .
Now we have to move ahead in just the way the president wants us to .
Lagering beer can be problematical for home brewers , if they are not properly equipped .
The key is that , for home brewing , kegs and lagering go hand in hand with the handy home bar invention called the kegerator .
A kegerator can do two things at once – act as a lagering closet and serve beer .
If you want a little more control with your lagering temperature , you may opt for a lagering closet or separate fridge or freezer conversion .
The ideal lagering temperature for beer , according to white labs , manufacturers of specialty brewing yeasts , changes over the lagering period .
Ideally , the lagering process starts out at 51 to 53 degrees .
This temperature is maintained for the first week , and then the beer is allowed to warm to 62 - 64 degrees for four to six days .
After this , white labs recommends lowering the temperature five degrees per day until the ideal long - term lagering temperature of 31 to 32 degrees is achieved .
Then , lagering for six weeks at the lowest temperature takes place .
This is the most complicated lagering scenario I have heard of .
Most home brewers do not maintain such precise controls in any their brews , but it is clear that one would need to have a precise temperature controlled lagering closet in order to produce a lager of such exacting qualifications .
Keep in mind that the process of lagering was first developed by Bavarians keeping their beer in caves .
I would recommend a slightly more low - tech approach to lagering .
By utilizing your kegerator , you can lager your beer at roughly the same temperatures , as long as you are not serving beer at the same time ( except at the final lagering stage , if you fudge the temp up to the regular serving temp of 38 degrees ) .
For the homemade conversion - style kegerators , there is plenty of room for an additional Cornelius keg , and sometimes a Sanke keg .
It is at this final stage that the keg comes into the picture .
This is the perfect time to transfer your lager beer into a keg for its final fermentation stage .
By lagering your beer in the keg for its final fermentation cycle , you can ensure that it will be a simple process to serve your beer .
After the fermentation is complete , simply tap the keg onto your beer line and serve .
No need to move the keg around and let it settle – although be sure to clean and sanitize your beer lines between each keg .
A custom temperature control can be installed into your kegerator or lagering closet if you do want to maintain such precise lagering controls as described by White Labs .
Johnson Controls produces what is probably the easiest to use temperature control unit .
The Johnson Controls unit plugs right into he wall and controls the power coming into your kegerator or freezer , turning of the power when the temperature reaches the right reading , and turning the power back on when the reading goes above the dial .
Whether you go low or high tech , lagering beer at home can be a challenge if you do n’t have a kegerator or temperature controlled freezer / lagering closet .
It is not an impossible challenge , however , especially not for the home brewer who knows how to get things done .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
There 's no need to fear a Wall Street brain drain -- despite the crackdown on pay by Washington .
On Thursday , White House pay czar Kenneth Feinberg outlined compensation restrictions at seven firms that got special bailouts , and the Federal Reserve proposed to review pay practices at 28 unnamed giant banks .
Critics warn that reining in pay makes it hard to keep talented employees .
Hemmed in , institutions like AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) and Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) could lose their best people .
These firms would then perform even more abysmally , if that 's possible , leaving them hard pressed to repay tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer - backed loans .
Still , we say Godspeed to this " talent . "
After all , the traders and suits in the corner offices do n't exactly have an unblemished track record .
In 2008 , Citigroup , BofA and Merrill Lynch ( since acquired by BofA ) posted a grand total of $ 51 billion in losses .
Yet even as they were running themselves into the ground , the firms managed to pay out more than $ 12 billion in bonuses -- including 1,606 million - dollar - plus bonuses , according to a report from the New York attorney general 's office .
" Even a cursory examination of the data suggests that in these challenging economic times , compensation for bank employees has become unmoored from the banks ' financial performance , " the report said .
Meanwhile , it 's hard to imagine that defection - hit firms would have a lot of trouble finding qualified replacements in the current job market .
Unemployment has doubled nationally since December 2007 , when the recession started .
Securities industry employment has fallen 10 % nationwide and 14 % in New York from a mid-2008 peak , according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data , costing some 90,000 jobs in the U.S .
And Goldman Sachs ' ( GS , Fortune 500 ) charm offensive notwithstanding , it looks like the official response to runaway pay is just starting .
The Fed 's plan to weigh big banks ' compensation plans against their potential for undermining the economy could eventually put pressure on pay at all the big banks .
" This could be a game changer , " said Simon Johnson , an economist at MIT .
" There will be a lot of pressure on them in Congress to stick it to the big firms . "
But maybe the best reason not to fret about talent flight is one familiar to cubicle dwellers everywhere : just because someone has a big , high - paying job does n't mean they 're good at it .
Take Bank of America , for instance .
The bank 's longtime CEO , Ken Lewis , unexpectedly announced his retirement this month , while agreeing to give back his 2009 salary .
Lewis did n't say why he was leaving , but it seems that criticism over his empire building , mishandling of the Merrill acquisition and outsize pay got to him .
The Charlotte Observer reported he had grown tired of the " mud being thrown on him day by day . "
Another helping or two of that mud could be just what Wall Street needs .
Uh-oh !
Smartest White House Ever makes another diplomatic blunder
When the President flew into Copenhagen last week to save Chicago ’s bid for the Olympics , he hastily added a few extra diplomatic tasks to his itinerary .
The White House followed long - standing procedure and issued a press release to let the media know the president ’s schedule for the day .
If the Bush White House had issued this press release , the left would have used it as proof that everyone in the administration was an idiot .
Especially George Bush .
But we ’ve yet to see that argument made about the Obama White House press release .
Here ’s what the press release said :
The President will arrive in Copenhagen , Denmark in the morning .
The arrival at Copenhagen Airport , Kastrup is open press .
The President and the First Lady will then travel to Christiansborg Palace .
They will be greeted by HM Queen Margrethe II and HRH Prince Consort Henrik .
There will be a travel pool spray .
The President will meet Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen .
There will be a pool spray at the top of the meeting .
Do n’t look now , Mr. President , but that the wrong Rasmussen .
Lars Løkke Rasmussen is the Prime Minister of Denmark .
Anders Fogh Rasmussen is Secretary - General of NATO .
But you know how it is .
All those Danes look alike .

There are quite a few celebrations this year of one form or another — the 200th anniversary of the death of Thomas Paine ( although that ’s not such a hot issue in Britain , outside of Thetford and Lewes ) ; the 350th anniversary of the birth of Henry Purcell ( LOTS of concerts all year here in London ) ; the 250th anniversary of the death of Handel ( ditto ) ; the 200th anniversary of the death of Haydn ( ditto ) ; and the 200th anniversary of the birth of Mendelssohn ( ditto again ) .
But the big celebration all year here has been the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin ( and , incidentally , the 150th anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species ) .
There have been any number of events to commemorate this — new stamps and coins , a blockbuster show ( now closed ) at the Natural History Museum ( and the opening of the new Darwin Centre ) , and lots and lots of books — it ’s been a bonanza for the publishing industry .
And any number of shows at smaller museums .
So Saturday we headed up to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge to check out the Endless Forms : Charles Darwin , Natural Science and the Visual Arts show , and it ’s worth the trip .
Actually , I found it a lot more stimulating than the big show at the Natural History Museum , which was hugely interesting if you did n’t actually know a lot about Darwin already .
Clearly , most of the people attending the exhibit when we were there did not .
The Fitzwilliam show is different , and I think just as successful .
The focus is on the impact of evolutionary theory , both before and after Darwin , and the arts .
Not only that — a fair amount of the show was devoted to materials ( paintings of geological formations , photographs of facial expressions ) that were used in support of Darwin ’s theory , and the more general issue of evolution .
As far as the mechanics of the show , it was excellent .
The layout was generous across the four rooms used , the narratives were highly informative ( as opposed to , say , The National Gallery show we reviewed last week ) , and the show demonstrated a critical intelligence , really only faltering in the last room with the stuff on Degas , which confused me a bit .
The overall arcs ere manifold — the underlying support for , and fascination with , the general notion of evolutionary theory that emerged in the early part of the 19th century in geology ( particularly Lyell ’s work ) , the tools that Darwin used to buttress his claims ( including photography and drawings ) , and the various transmutations that Darwinism went through in the various arts .
A fair amount of the show concentrated on the impact that Darwin in particular had on views of the poor as depicted in paintings in the second half of the century , with a full spectrum of social Darwinism on display .
In addition , some of the most fascinating parts of the exhibit were the photographs and drawing used by Darwin in his own works , particularly The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals , published in 1872 , in which Darwin specifically countered much of the criticism of Origin that tried to show the various ways humans were different from other animals .
The Joseph Wolf works in this section are particularly impressive , as are the various items used to portray the importance of sexual selection .
The inclusion of Redon ’s Les Origines , in which Redon takes a much darker view of the evolution of life , was genuinely inspired ( Redon sent a set off to Pasteur in admiration ) .
We tend to forget not only how influential the Origin was during the second half of the 19th century — and we also tend to forget how ready scientists and artists were for Darwin ’s work .
On the other hand , having nearly a whole section of a room devoted to Degas and his drawing of slope - headed ballerinas without a full discussion of of Degas ’ racism and anti-semitism seemed just a bit odd .
Yes , the show does a nice job of showing how much impact Darwin had on the Impressionists , but to end the show with only half the story on Degas was a bit disappointing after the general excellence of everything that had preceded it .
Overall , though , an extremely stimulating show , which runs through 8 October .
The companion volume is currently on sale , too .
And since we were in Cambridge for the day , and since Cambridge has about 30 or 40 small museums , most of which are eminently worth investigating , we decided to explore .
So after quick check at the Whipple Museum of the History of Science ( closed on Saturdays ) , we ended up at the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Science , which turns out to be the place you bring your kids on Saturdays if they ’re growing up in Cambridge .
All those rocks !
Fossils !
Dinosaurs !
Whatever !
And a pretty cool exhibit on Darwin : The Geologist , which included his microscope , which was on loan from the Museum of the History of Science , so I did n’t miss it after all .
This was on Darwin as a geologist — you tend to forget that for a number of years , Darwin ’s work was mostly geological in nature , and that many of the arguments he uses in Origin were similar to those used earlier in his seminal work on coral reefs .
The Sedgwick has an amazing trove of Darwinia , including the thousands and thousands of rocks he collected as a naturalist on The Beagle .
So , a good Darwin day ( even though the real Darwin Day was 12 February , Darwin ’s birthday ) .
I like living in a country that puts Darwin on its currency .
The miniature sheet of four stamps above is part of a series of stamps the Royal Mail issued earlier this year in celebration of Darwin ; this set diplays Galapagos animals on a background of an admiralty hydrographic map .
Other countries honouring Darwin this year on stamps include Portugal , Italy , Bulgaria , India , Cayman Islands ( and several other Commonwealth countries ) , Czech Republic , and Ireland .
And no , the United States has not ever put Darwin ’s picture on a stamp .
Where are all my Indian Phandroids in the house ?
I ’m sure you all are chomping at the bot waiting for Android Phones to start lighting up your country but you wo n’t have to wait long thanks to Samsung .
The company recently announced their partnership with Tata Docomoto to launch the Samsung Galaxy later this year for Rs 28,990 ( $ 607 ) .
But that ’s not all .
Listen to how assertive Samsung India Electronics GM of Marketing ( Asim Warsi ) is when discussing the company ’s status with Android :
“ This is first of the block .
There would be more this year .
Android is a very serious operating system on which we will build more phones . ”
Notice that word “ block ” together with “ this year ” ?
Yeah …
I would normally put a lot of emphasis on this but the words “ portfolio ” and “ suite ” did n’t get us very far so I think I ’ll keep my mouth shut .

A search through decades - old frozen infant stool samples has yielded rich dividends for scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , part of the National Institutes of Health .
The team customized a laboratory technique to screen thousands of samples for norovirus , a major cause of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks in people of all ages .
What they discovered about the rate of evolution of a specific group of noroviruses could help researchers develop specific antiviral drugs and , potentially , a vaccine against a disease that is very unpleasant and sometimes deadly .
The research , led by Kim Y. Green , Ph.D. , and Karin Bok , Ph.D. , of NIAID 's Laboratory of Infectious Diseases , will appear in a future issue of the Journal of Virology , and is now available online .
NIAID scientist Albert Z. Kapikian , M.D. , is a co-author on the paper .
In 1972 , Dr. Kapikian and colleagues identified and characterized the virus , now known as norovirus , responsible for an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in Norwalk , Ohio , in 1968 .
" Thanks to the foresight of Dr. Kapikian and others at NIAID and the Children 's National Medical Center who established and have maintained these clinical samples since 1974 , our researchers have a unique resource that represents one of the oldest sets of norovirus samples in the world , " says NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci , M.D. " This is the first study to look at samples that date back almost to the first recorded cases of norovirus outbreaks , more than 40 years ago . "
Highly contagious , noroviruses are responsible for an abrupt onset intestinal ailment also called winter vomiting disease or cruise - ship disease .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) estimates that 23 million cases of acute gastroenteritis each year are due to norovirus infection and that noroviruses are the cause of more than half of all foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks .
In elderly people , infants and people with compromised immune system function , dehydration resulting from vomiting and diarrhea following norovirus infection can be life - threatening .
In developing countries , according to a 2008 estimate by CDC researchers , up to 200,000 children under 5 years old die of norovirus infection each year .
There is no vaccine against norovirus and no specific antiviral drugs to treat infections .
A key question for norovirus researchers is determining when a dominant variant , called genotype II.4 ( or GII.4 ) , first emerged , notes Dr. Green .
" This genotype has been associated with the majority of global outbreaks of acute norovirus gastroenteritis since the mid-1990s , " says Dr. Green .
" The GII.4 genotype was first described around 1987 , but no one knew for sure whether that genotype emerged then or if it existed earlier . "
To answer the question , Dr. Bok customized a new technique — real - time reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) — and applied it to stool samples originally collected from infants and young children hospitalized at the Children 's National Medical Center in Washington , D.C. , between 1974 and 1991 .
Samples were taken from infants and children with gastroenteritis and from others ( controls ) who did not have gastroenteritis .
Essentially , Dr. Bok crafted genetic hooks capable of fishing out matching genetic sequences of any norovirus present in the samples .
Fifty out of 5,424 samples tested contained norovirus .
The most commonly seen genotype was GII.3 ( 48 percent ) , but the second most common genotype was GII.4 ( 16 percent ) .
Some GII.4 - containing specimens dated back to 1974 , allowing the researchers to conclude that this now - dominant genotype had been circulating for years before its more recent identification as the cause of severe global outbreaks of norovirus disease .
Next , using a strategy developed by NIAID scientist Stanislav Sosnovtsev , Ph.D. , the researchers determined the complete genetic sequences of five older GII.4 viruses and compared those sequences to gene sequences of contemporary GII.4 noroviruses .
The comparison allowed the investigators to determine how much the archival viruses differed from the most recent representatives of the same genotype and , thus , to calculate how quickly the GII.4 genotype is evolving .
Currently , there are no antiviral drugs specifically targeted to noroviruses , but the new knowledge about which segments of the norovirus genome change the least could aid in the development of novel drugs that could be targeted at those more genetically static portions of the virus , say the researchers .
Noroviruses , like influenza viruses , mutate readily and evolve rapidly , explains Dr. Green .
If vaccines against noroviruses become possible in the future , researchers would need to take into account shifts in the virus 's genetic make - up and reformulate the vaccines to match the virus , she adds .
However , unlike influenza viruses , noroviruses cannot be grown in the lab , raising an additional hurdle to vaccine development .
" By examining the history of norovirus evolution contained within these archival samples , we can see how the virus has changed during this time , and we also can better predict how the virus is likely to change in the future , " says Dr. Bok .
If scientists one day crack the problem of growing norovirus in the lab , information about the rate of evolution will be invaluable to developing vaccines , adds Dr. Green .
" This research is the first to reveal the speed at which the molecular clock of norovirus runs , " says Dr. Green .
Dr. Green and her colleagues are now looking at stool samples from the 1960s in Dr. Kapikian 's collection .
If norovirus can be detected in those samples , knowledge about the ancestry and rate of evolution of this virus will be further expanded .
With a genome size of ∼580 kb and approximately 480 protein coding regions , Mycoplasma genitalium is one of the smallest known self - replicating organisms and , additionally , has extremely fastidious nutrient requirements .
The reduced genomic content of M. genitalium has led researchers to suggest that the molecular assembly contained in this organism may be a close approximation to the minimal set of genes required for bacterial growth .
Here , we introduce a systematic approach for the construction and curation of a genome - scale in silico metabolic model for M. genitalium .
Key challenges included estimation of biomass composition , handling of enzymes with broad specificities , and the lack of a defined medium .
Computational tools were subsequently employed to identify and resolve connectivity gaps in the model as well as growth prediction inconsistencies with gene essentiality experimental data .
The curated model , M. genitalium iPS189 ( 262 reactions , 274 metabolites ) , is 87 % accurate in recapitulating in vivo gene essentiality results for M. genitalium .
Approaches and tools described herein provide a roadmap for the automated construction of in silico metabolic models of other organisms .
There is growing interest in elucidating the minimal number of genes needed for life .
This challenge is important not just for fundamental but also practical considerations arising from the need to design microorganisms exquisitely tuned for particular applications .
The genome of the pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium is believed to be a close approximation to the minimal set of genes required for bacterial growth .
In this paper , we constructed a genome - scale metabolic model of M. genitalium that mathematically describes a unified characterization of its biochemical capabilities .
The model accounts for 189 of the 482 genes listed in the latest genome annotation .
We used computational tools during the process to bridge network gaps in the model and restore consistency with experimental data that determined which gene deletions led to cell death ( i.e. , are essential ) .
We achieved 87 % correct model predictions for essential genes and 89 % for non-essential genes .
We subsequently used the metabolic model to determine components that must be part of the growth medium .
The approaches and tools described here provide a roadmap for the automated metabolic reconstruction of other organisms .
This task is becoming increasingly critical as genome sequencing for new organisms is proceeding at an ever - accelerating pace .

In this paper , we highlight the development of an in silico model of metabolism of M. genitalium .
It was subjected to network connectivity gap detection and reconnection as well as restoration of consistency with in vivo gene essentiality experiments [ 19 ] .
We subsequently used the model to pinpoint components in the growth medium that are needed for the production of all components of biomass in an effort to eventually eliminate the need for non-defined components such as serum in the growth medium .
The above underlines the importance of investigating the molecular biology of mycoplasma and M. genitalium in particular .
However , a major hindrance to M. genitalium research and laboratory diagnosis of infection has been their cultivation in vitro .
While defined media are present for some mycoplasmas [ 28 ] – [ 30 ] , researchers have often had to resort to complex media to cultivate most mycoplasmas , including M. genitalium .
M. genitalium , and many other mycoplasmas are cultured in vitro in SP - 4 medium .
This extremely rich medium contains several undefined additives including peptones , yeast hydrolysate , yeast extract and 17 % fetal bovine serum [ 31 ] .
The use of complex undefined growth media has interfered with the molecular definition of mycoplasma metabolic pathways , genetic analyses , estimation of growth requirements , characterization of auxotrophic mutants and examining the nutritional control of bacterial pathogenecity .
Mycoplasma genitalium is not only the closest known approximation of a minimal cell but also an important sexually transmitted human pathogen .
It is a cause of nongonococcal urethritis in men and is associated with genital tract inflammatory diseases in women , including endometritis , cervicitis , pelvic inflammatory disease , and tubal factor infertility ( for a recent review see [ 23 ] ) .
Additionally , evidence suggests that M. genitalium infection increases the risk of contracting HIV - 1 [ 24 ] – [ 26 ] .
Mycoplasmas , the generic name for the bacteria that comprise the Mollicutes taxon , evolved from the low G+C Gram positive bacteria through a process of massive genome reduction [ 27 ] .
Their salient characteristics in addition to small genomes are a lack of a cell wall , and an almost complete inability to synthesize the building blocks of DNA , RNA , proteins , and cell membranes .
M. genitalium has received considerable attention as it is the smallest organism that can be grown in pure culture , having a genome size of ∼580 kb and approximately 480 protein coding regions [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
An examination of its genome content revealed limited metabolic capabilities [ 20 ] , leading researchers to suggest it may be a close approximation to the minimal set of genes required for bacterial growth [ 19 ] , [ 21 ] .
Several researchers have carried out genomic and proteomic analysis of M. genitalium to quantify this minimal set .
For example , Mushegian and Koonin have carried out a detailed comparison of M. genitalium and H. influenzae proteins to derive a set of 256 genes that they suggested are necessary for viability [ 22 ] .
Further , genomic analyses of these species revealed that Mycoplasma genes encode for several catabolic and metabolite transport proteins but for only a limited number of anabolic proteins suggesting that Mycoplasma species need to scavenge for the required nutrients from the surrounding environment [ 20 ] .
More recently , Glass and co-workers performed global transposon mutagenesis and established that 382 of the 482 protein coding sequences are essential genes for this minimal bacterium [ 19 ] .
These gene sets and essential gene analyses , however , have not been put into context of a complete functional metabolic model .
The four steps used in the present work are 1 ) identification of biotransformations using automated homology searches 2 ) assembly of reaction sets into a genome - scale metabolic model 3 ) automated network connectivity analysis and restoration , and 4 ) automated evaluation and improvement of model performance when compared to in vivo gene essentiality data .
In response to this flood of present and future genomic information , automated tools such as Pathway Tools [ 16 ] and SimPheny ( Genomatica ) have been developed that , using homology comparisons , allow for the automated generation of draft organism - specific metabolic reconstructions that can subsequently be upgraded into metabolic models .
All of these models remain to some extent incomplete as manifested by the presence of unreachable metabolites [ 17 ] and some growth inconsistencies between model predictions and observed in vivo behavior [ 2 ] .
In particular , optimization - based techniques for automatically identifying metabolites disconnected from the rest of metabolism ( i.e. , GapFind ) and hypotheses generators ( i.e. , GapFill ) for reconnecting them have recently been introduced [ 17 ] .
In order to resolve substrate utilization prediction inconsistencies , Reed et al . [ 2 ] introduced a novel approach for identifying what reactions to add to the genome - scale metabolic models of E. coli to correct some of the in silico growth predictions .
In our group , we have taken the next step for gene deletion data by attempting to correct all such growth inconsistencies by allowing not just additions but also eliminations of functionalities in the model ( i.e. , GrowMatch ) ( Satish Kumar and Maranas , submitted ) .
As outlined in Figure 2 , in this work , we describe the application of these automated methodologies during the Mycoplasma genitalium model construction process ( as opposed to an a posteriori mode of deployment ) .
The numbers of both metabolic models and completed genome sequences have been growing exponentially .
Despite the increase in the number of metabolic models , their total remains smaller than 1 % of that of sequenced genomes .
Genome - scale metabolic reconstructions are already in place or under development for a growing number of organisms including eukaryotic , prokaryotic and archaeal species [ 1 ] .
Metabolic pathway reconstructions are increasingly being queried by systems engineering approaches to refine the quality of the resulting metabolic models [ 2 ] .
Curated metabolic models are indispensable for computationally driving engineering interventions in microbial strains for targeted overproductions [ 3 ] – [ 6 ] , elucidating the organizing principles of metabolism [ 7 ] – [ 10 ] and even pinpointing drug targets [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
Currently , over 700 genomes have been fully sequenced [ 13 ] whereas only about 20 organism - specific genome - scale metabolic models have been constructed [ 1 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
Figure 1 pictorially demonstrates , in logarithmic space , the widening gap between organism - specific metabolic models and fully sequenced genomes over the past twelve years .
It appears that metabolic model generation can only keep pace with about 1 % of the fully sequenced genomes .
Results
The metabolic model reconstruction process is subdivided into four steps .
These four steps are summarized in Figure 2 and include ( 1 ) identification of biotransformations using homology searches , ( 2 ) assembly of reaction sets into a genome - scale metabolic model , ( 3 ) network connectivity analysis and restoration , and ( 4 ) evaluation and improvement of model performance when compared to in vivo gene essentiality data .
Model construction is followed by minimal defined medium component elucidation .
Generation of Computations - Ready Model
A metabolic reconstruction has been described as a 2 - D annotation of a genome [ 32 ] .
The generation of a computations - ready model requires the complete assignment of metabolites to reactions , inclusion of exchange reactions , resolution of gene - enzyme associations , and derivation of biomass equations .
Here , we largely follow the steps put forth by [ 33 ] in the latest E. coli metabolic reconstruction .
Assignment of ORFs , reactions & metabolites and their classification .
Under this step we first include in the model all reactions associated with enzymes as identified above ( ensuring , when necessary , that the metabolites have the appropriate protonation state corresponding to pH 7.2 and are elementally balanced ) .
We then extend the list to include non -gene associated reactions ( e.g. , account for the substrates and products for the kinase pool ) .
Subsequently , we append spontaneous reactions for chemical transformations that are not enzyme catalyzed and for the transport of molecules that can freely diffuse across the cell membrane and are likely to be present in the natural or laboratory - adopted environment of M. genitalium .
A distribution of the ORFs , metabolites , and reactions included in the final model iPS189 are provided ( see Tables S1 , S2 , S3 and Text S1 ) .
A breakdown of the ORFs into functional clusters is shown in Figure 3 .
Here , each ORF is assigned to a cluster of orthologous groups ( COGs ) ontology [ 35 ] along with the percent of the total ORFs for the entire M. genitalium genome that is included in iPS189 for each classification .
System boundary identification .
The system boundary includes the entire reaction network .
Exchange reactions were created that allowed metabolites to enter or leave the extracellular space .
Constraints on these exchange reactions were established to account for the simulated growth conditions by restricting the uptake ( substrate ) metabolites of the system .
Conversion of model into computations - ready form .
The stoichiometric matrix for iPS189 after step 1 involves 179 rows ( i.e. , reactions and exchange reactions ) and 292 columns ( i.e. , total metabolites , taking the compartment designations into account ) .
We also established gene - protein - reaction ( GPR ) associations to link reactions to genes .
Only 48 reactions contained more than a single GPR association .
Of these , none contained single - protein isozymes , and 47 were catalyzed by just one of the various enzyme complexes ( among which was the ribosome and its associated proteins ) .
Only one contained both isozymes and protein complexes .
Biomass equation derivation .
The derived biomass equation drains all metabolites present in cellular biomass in their appropriate molar biological ratios ( see Table 3 for a list of components ) .
Because the dry cell content of M. genitalium has not been experimentally measured , the biomass composition was estimated from the protein composition of closely related mycoplasmas , comparisons with a metabolic model for the related Bacillus subtilis , and a reduction of the biomass equation from the Escherichia coli model iAF1260 .
These biomass compositions were adjusted to account for components known to be absent in M. genitalium such as the cell wall .
The biomass equation explicitly includes charged and uncharged tRNA molecules , rather than only the amino acids themselves .
It also contains a non -growth - associated ATP maintenance reaction .
The genome and RNA content was adjusted to reflect the low G+C content of M. genitalium .
While determining the precise biomass composition has been a challenge for many other models [ 36 ] , previous work has shown that the calculated biomass production is relatively insensitive to the exact ratios used [ 37 ] .

Biomass components used in iPS189 .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000285.t003
The computations - ready model along with the biomass description allows for the use of optimization - based techniques for testing and correcting for the presence of connectivity gaps ( step 3 ) and growth prediction inconsistencies ( step 4 ) .
Analysis and Restoration of Network Connectivity
The initial model was constructed almost exclusively based on homology searches within model libraries .
This procedure led to the presence of many network gaps [ 17 ] preventing 177 reactions ( 99 % of total ) from carrying flux under all uptake conditions ( i.e. , they were blocked ) .
As a consequence , these blocked reactions precluded the formation of some of the biomass components .
Using GapFind [ 17 ] we found that a total of 175 ( 70 % ) cytoplasmic metabolites could not be produced inside or transported into the intracellular space .
These metabolites included a number of biomass precursor metabolites ( e.g. , some amino acids , cofactors and metal ions ) that had not been assigned uptake reactions .
Of all the blocked metabolites , thirteen were involved in nucleotide metabolism and eight were metal ions without an identified transporter .
We also note that 40 of these metabolites are charged / uncharged tRNA molecules , which are active in closed reaction cycles used in forming the protein component of biomass .
Through the use of GapFill [ 17 ] we subsequently sought to bridge these network gaps through the addition of reactions , transport pathways and relaxation of irreversibilities of reactions already in the model .
Reactions known not to be present in M. genitalium ( e.g. , an incomplete TCA cycle ) were excluded as gap filling candidates .
We first applied GapFill to unblock constituents of biomass guided by the known components in the growth medium .
We unblocked biomass production by adding 65 reactions , for which most ( i.e. , 43 ) were involved in metabolite transport , such as for the uptake of amino acids ( 14 ) , folate , riboflavin , metal ions ( 8 ) , and cofactors such as CoA .
Among the remaining reactions were those responsible for the hydrolysis of dipeptides ( 15 ) and eight reactions involving other biotransformations .
We performed an additional round of BLASTp comparisons of genes annotated with these reactions against the M. genitalium genome to determine if we could associate any of these reactions with specific genes in M. genitalium .
We found five proteins catalyzing these reactions that had BLASTp scores smaller than 10−5 ( see Table 2 ) .
For example , GapFill suggested the addition of reaction glutamyl - tRNA ( Gln ) amidotransferase in the model to allow the formation of the gln -tRNA molecule .
BLASTp searches allowed us to link this activity with the genes encoding for the three subunits ( MG098 , MG099 and MG100 ) .
Note that these three genes ( and others added during this step ) were not added earlier ( steps 1 and 2 ) on account of their ambiguous functional characterization .
By bringing to bear both homology ( though BLASTp ) and connectivity restoration ( through GapFill ) , here we rely on multiple pieces of evidence when appending a new functionality and corresponding genes to the model .
Even after unblocking biomass formation , 43 metabolites remained blocked and were subsequently analyzed by GapFill .
The results from GapFill are summarized in Figure 4 .
We were able to reconnect three metabolites by treating three reactions as reversible .
We also found that the originally assigned ( based on the auto - model ) directionality of 1 - acyl - sn - glycerol - 3 - phosphate acyltransferase was incorrect .
It was subsequently reversed and found to be in accordance with both KEGG and MetaCyc entries .
An additional 21 metabolites were reconnected by adding 18 reactions from the KEGG and MetaCyc databases ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The addition of these 18 reactions also introduced an additional nine metabolites ( three of which were involved in glycerolipid metabolism ) to the model .
Finally the incorporation of uptake / transport reactions reconnected an additional four metabolites .
We performed an additional round of BLASTp comparisons and we were able to associate three out of 22 reactions with specific genes ( see Table 2 ) .
We found that the associated gene ( i.e. MG066 ) for 1 - deoxy - D-xylulose 5 - phosphate synthase was already included in the model but with a different functionality ( i.e. , transketolase ) .
The secondary synthase functionality , revealed by GapFill / BLASTp , was subsequently associated with gene MG066 in the model .
A similar situation occurred with MG053 , which was already associated with phosphomannomutase in the model .
In addition , gene MG259 ( annotated as “ modification methylase , HemK family ” in the Comprehensive Microbial Resource , http://cmr.jcvi.org) was added to the model to carry out the glutamine - N5 methyltransferase activity elucidated by GapFill / BLASTp .
The model statistics after correcting for network gaps are summarized in Table 1 .

Model Correction Using In Vivo Gene Essentiality Data Based on in vivo gene essentiality data [ 19 ] we deduced that there are 174 essential genes and 19 non-essential genes among the 193 genes provisionally present in the model ( after steps 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .
We note that the in vivo gene essentiality experiments were performed using non-defined medium containing serum and yeast hydrolysate among other rich components .
During the in silico model predictions / comparisons , we allowed the uptake of all extracellular metabolites with transport reactions , except for sugars other than glucose , in order to computationally approximate this medium .
Using a recently proposed diagnostic of the percentage of correctly - identified essential genes [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] , we found that the model correctly identified 137 out of a total of 174 essential genes ( i.e. , specificity of 79 % ) and 16 out of a total of 19 non-essential genes ( i.e. , sensitivity of 84 % ) .
This implies that the model ( after steps 1 , 2 , and 3 ) was 79 % correct in its overall accuracy in growth predictions ( i.e. , 153 of 193 ) .
Most of the mismatches ( 92 % ) were over - predictions of the metabolic capabilities ( i.e. , predicting growth when none is observed in vivo ) instead of under- predictions ( i.e. , predicting no growth when growth is observed in vivo ) .
We subsequently deployed the GrowMatch method ( Satish Kumar and Maranas , submitted ) to rectify as many as possible of the erroneous essentiality predictions by the model .
GrowMatch functions by identifying the minimal number of model modifications required to restore consistency between growth predictions and gene essentiality experiments ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Model under- predictions include mutants ( MG410 and MG411 ) , which encode the subunits for the phosphate transporter , preventing in both cases the uptake of phosphate .
This implies that M. genitalium must have an additional uptake route of phosphates .
Even though GrowMatch suggested a number of phosphate uptake alternatives to resolve this conflict and Glass and coworkers [ 19 ] had posited the activity of a putative phosphonate transporter ( MG289 , MG290 , and MG291 ) , we decided not to add them to the model as no direct evidence exists to ascertain their presence .
For instance , the putative phosphonate transporter might be nonspecific thus also enabling uptake of phosphate .
Alternatively , the unidentified phosphonate substrate might be catabolized to yield phosphate through a number of reactions .
The other incorrect under-prediction involved MG138 ( homologous to elongation factor 4 in E. coli ) , which had been associated with macromolecule formation during the automodel construction .
We observed that deletion mutants of the homolog in E. coli ( lepA ) are viable [ 40 ] .
Based on this information , we removed this gene and its erroneous association as an essential component of the biomass equation from the model .
Interestingly , three of the 37 erroneous over - predictions were corrected by adding three membrane components to the biomass equation ( see Table 3 ) .
These components were not added during the initial model construction because it was not clear which ( if any ) of this class of metabolites were essential .
An additional three erroneous predictions of non-essentiality were corrected by suppressing two reactions .
One of these reactions , inosine kinase , was added during GapFill but not linked to an associated gene .
Suppression of this reaction corrected two over - predictions but did not invalidate any correct model predictions , suggesting that the reaction activity is unlikely to be present in vivo , at least under the experimental conditions , and perhaps is not an activity encoded by M. genitalium .
An additional six over - predictions involved two metal ion ABC transporters .
GrowMatch identified each transporter to be essential when the other one was suppressed .
We rejected co-regulation of the two transporters as a model restoration mechanism .
Instead , we restored consistency for three of the six genes by assigning the cobalt uptake to the complex with a better homology to characterized cobalt transporters ( MG179 , MG180 , MG181 ) .
The remaining three genes were removed from the model .
An alternative interpretation of the GrowMatch results is that some other ion uptake reaction (s ) are uniquely associated with these transporters and are thus responsible for the in vivo phenotype .
Overall , the application of GrowMatch to the metabolic model led to the generation of a number of testable hypotheses regarding the presence or absence of specific functionalities and emphasized the importance of determining the substrate specificity of the transporters .
We also identified reactions that had to be inactivated only for certain knock - outs suggesting their dependence on the genetic background in addition to the specific environmental conditions .
For example , MG112 ( ribulose - phosphate 3 - epimerase ) had to be suppressed in conjunction with two single gene deletions ( i.e. , conditional suppressions ) to restore consistency with the in vivo data , suggesting possible regulation events .
Figure 5 summarizes the complete GrowMatch results .
Considering only those changes that could be repaired with global model adjustments conservatively raised the overall percent accuracy of the model ( versioned as i PS189 ) from 79 to 87 % .
By recalculating the diagnostics of the percentage of correctly - identified essential genes [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] we found that the model is now 87 % ( i.e. , 149 of 171 ) correct in its essentiality predictions ( specificity ) and 89 % ( i.e. , 16 of 18 ) correct in its non-essentiality predictions ( sensitivity ) .

Before the application of GrowMatch , 79 % of the model predictions on gene essentiality agreed with in vivo experiments .
Nearly all incorrect predictions occurred when the model predicted growth , but no growth was observed in the in vivo experiment ( termed GNG mismatches ) .
GrowMatch was able to rectify eighteen of these mismatches .
This increased the percent agreement to 87 % .
The rightmost heat - map and the number of resolved mismatches also include the removal of one gene to correct a GNG experiment and three genes to resolve NGG mismatches .

M. genitalium iPS189 Model Characteristics
The iPS189 model predicts that M. genitalium uptakes fructose via a PTS system .
The fructose is converted to fructose 1,6 - bisphosphate ( fdp ) and finally enters the glycolytic pathways to produce lactate via lactate dehydrogenase .
Neither fructose nor glycerol uptake was found to be essential as glucose could be efficiently taken up and converted .
Specifically , glucose is transformed to glucose 6 - phosphate and finally to fdp via phosphofructokinase .
As expected , the model also indicates that co-enzyme A ( CoA ) is taken up , since M. genitalium has no coA biosynthesis genes .
Additionally , accetal - CoA ( accCoA ) is not formed via pyruvate formate lyase but rather by pyruvate dehydrogenase .
Interestingly , we find that should acetate be taken up , it is converted to acetyl phosphate ( actp ) and finally to accoa by phosphotransacetylase .
Sources for acyl - CoA ( aCoA ) and CDP - glucose are also required for lipid production .
The metabolites riboflavin and nicotinic acid ( niacin ) are taken up for synthesis of the cofactors FAD and NAD , respectively .
In addition , both spermidine and putrescene are directly imported as biomass components .
Similarly , we also found that D - ribose ( rib - D ) is needed to fuel the truncated pentose phosphate pathway .
Examination of fluxes indicated that the uptake of rib-D results in production of 5 - phospho - α - d - ribose 1 - diphosphate , which enables the conversion of adenine to amp .
We also deduced that only adenine and cytidine are precursors to nucleotides and nucleosides ( CTP , dCTP , UTP , dUTP , dTTP ) .
Interestingly , the model required the direct uptake of GTP and could not be produced through the uptake of guanine .
Model modifications that eliminate this requirement using GrowMatch resulted in a number of incorrect gene essentiality predictions .
The need for the direct uptake of GTP is consistent with the fact that in M. mycoides the guanine nucleotide pathways depend on transport of preformed guanine derivatives [ 34 ] , and that a number of other Mycoplasmas are not able to grow on medium that only contains guanine as a nucleobase [ 41 ] .
In addition , all amino acids are imported directly from the environment as either monomers or dipeptides .
Unlike many other mycoplasmas , M. genitalium is an arginine nonfermenting species , and not surprisingly arginine deiminase activity was not present in the model .
Furthermore , in iPS189 , the only participation of the amino acid arginine is its direct incorporation into biomass .
Finally , flux predictions revealed that lactate is the main product of M. genitalium fermentation .

Explanation :
This serene view records a late summer night sky over the rolling , green hills of planet Earth .
It was taken near the rural village of Saadat Shahr , Fars province , in southern Iran .
Saadat Shahr is also known as Astronomy Town , as the inhabitants have demonstrated a remarkable passion for sky gazing .
Fittingly , this Astronomy Town sky view finds a lovely part of the Milky Way near picture center .
The three brightest stars are the stars of the Summer Triangle , Deneb in Cygnus ( top ) , Altair in Aquila ( left ) , and Vega in Lyra ( right ) .
The foreground landscape , illuminated by Astronomy Town lights , includes a kind of wild pistachio tree common in the region .

Neil Barofsky , the inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program has criticised US Treasury officials for making optimistic statements last September , at the height of the financial crisis
The US Treasury misled the public over the health of struggling Wall Street banks receiving emergency funds at the height of the financial crisis , creating unrealistic expectations and undermining popular trust in bailout efforts , according to an official audit .
An inspector general appointed to oversee the US government 's banking bailout has singled out president Bush 's treasury secretary , Henry Paulson , for painting an excessively rosy picture of the condition of institutions such as Bank of America , Citigroup and Merrill Lynch when the government pumped $ 125 bn ( £ 70 bn ) into America 's ten top banks in September last year .
At the time , Paulson described the banks as " healthy institutions " and said that an injection of government cash would kick - start lending in the economy .
But officials in both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve had private concerns that some of them were teetering close to a financial collapse .
" The Treasury may have created unrealistic expectations about the institutions ' condition and their ability to increase lending , " says a report today by the inspector general , Neil Barofsky , who adds that the Treasury and the bail - out program " lost credibility when lending at those institutions did not in fact increase " .
He continues : " Accuracy and transparency will enhance the credibility of government programs like TARP [ the troubled asset repurchase plan ] and restore taxpayer confidence in the policy makers who manage them ; inaccurate statements , on the other hand , could have unintended long - term consequences that could damage the trust that the American people have in their government . "
The Federal Reserve 's chairman , Ben Bernanke , and the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , Sheila Bair , are criticised for similarly optimistic remarks in the findings , which will add to a vigorous debate about the handling of the credit crunch in the final months of Bush administration .
As the global financial system wobbled in the fallout from the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year , the US government summoned the bosses of America 's top banks to Washington and told them that they were getting injections of Treasury money , whether they liked it or not .
Paulson and Bernanke opted to pump funds into all ten of the country 's top banks to avoid creating " haves " and " have nots " that would highlight those considered to be in a more perilous state .
In doing so , they tried to talk up the condition of every big institution .
Several banks , including Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley , have since repaid government aid and freed themselves from restrictions over dividend payouts , bonuses and the recruitment of foreign staff .
But others , such as Citigroup and Bank of America , are still dependant on Treasury support .
The Treasury responded to the criticism by saying that utterances by Paulson and his colleagues should be considered " in light of the unprecedented circumstances in which they were made " .

Ezra Klein does a pretty good job taking down the rhetorical slights of hand Republicans are using on this issue .
His approach might not be the most effective politically – but it has the virtue of being honest .
Rather than proclaiming there will be no rationing – he points out that we already do ration .
We prioritize botox for the rich over cancer treatments for the poor .
This is the status quo that we have that is so incredibly expensive .
The debate over health care should be focusing on two questions :
How much of our national wealth are we going to choose to spend on health care ?
How do we want to allocate our limited health care technology and services ?
We can agree to spend a lot of our national wealth on health care .
After all , we need to spend it on something .
The rate of growth is too much now – but we do n’t need to reduce our levels of health care spending to that of Great Britain .
( They spend 41 cents on the dollar that we spend for better overall results as measured by life expectancy , infant mortality , as well as overall patient satisfaction . )
Then – to the second question – how do we allocate access ?
Right now , we provide emergency treatment to everyone ; those with the most money get any treatment they like without significant waits ; the rest of us wait , but at least are treated if we have insurance coverage .
There ’s a reason why rich people from around the world travel to America – and it ’s not just because we have great doctors .
It ’s because they get to cut the line and get treated ahead of those with less financial status because our system rations by money .
For the rest of us , the health care reforms being discussed now wo n’t reverse this privileged position for the rich .
What Obama is proposing is not anything so radical .
But rather he seeks to accomplish several things , to moderately improve our current system :
it will eliminate the fear that your insurance company will drop your coverage once you get sick – putting you on the fast road to being poor and at the bottom rung of our society and in our health care system at the same time ;
– putting you on the fast road to being poor and at the bottom rung of our society and in our health care system at the same time ; it will – through incentives , tax breaks , and mandates – ensure that everyone has a base level of coverage ;
for the many who already do have coverage , it will provide a sense of security – a peace of mind – that even if you lose your job , you will still be able to get affordable health insurance ; and
– a peace of mind – that ; and finally , for a small number of Americans to start , and then perhaps for a larger portion if the program is successful , it will provide a choice of health insurance plans in a functioning and transparent market for individuals which our current mish - mash of Wall Street - run health insurance companies and hodge - podge of regulations is n’t able to provide .
This moderate plan bears little resemblance to the “ government takeover of health care ” that critics are directing their fire at .
It is n’t about “ rationing . ”
In fact , what it seeks to do is address the rationing our system already does .
In this way , the attacks on the plan are Rovian in the most diabolical sense – they take the strength of the plan , and try to turn it into a weakness .

A ban on shark finning in UK waters is to be introduced by the government , ministers will announce this week .
The practice , which involves slicing fins from sharks at sea and dumping their bodies overboard – often while still alive – has been heavily criticised by campaigners and blamed for pushing many shark species to the brink of extinction .
Shark finning was banned by the EU in 2003 but loopholes in the legislation have allowed fishing boats in UK waters to continue finning .
It is estimated that hundreds of tonnes of shark fin have been landed since the European " ban " was introduced .
The government has decided to close this loophole , following the passing of an early day motion in the House of Commons .
MPs demanded that " on no occasion should the UK government approve any derogation from the shark finning legislation in order to allow UK - registered vessels to remove shark fins at sea " .
The government has agreed to follow the example set by MPs , a decision that will be warmly received by wildlife groups , who have long campaigned for the UK to introduce a ban on finning .
Shark fins are used as an Asian delicacy – mainly as the key ingredient in shark fin soup – and sell for more than £ 200 per kilo .
And it is this high price that has led to the spread of shark finning .
Instead of taking the entire body of a shark back to port , fisherman hack off the animal 's most lucrative parts , its fins , and then throw the rest of it away .
The sharks can no longer swim and either starve to death or are eaten alive by other fish .
Species targeted this way in UK waters include the shortfin mako , blue , smooth hammerheads and thresher sharks , as well as species such as Portuguese dogfish and gulper sharks .
Finning these species is officially banned by the EU .
However , a derogation scheme allows member states to grant special permits that allow their fishing vessels to remove shark fins at sea provided the quantity of fins on board is kept below 5 % of the weight of shark bodies .
Many scientists say this figure is too high and allows fishermen to land two or even three fins for every shark carcass they land .
Hundreds of tonnes of shark fin have been landed by the UK fleet under these permits since the EU shark finning regulation was adopted .
But now UK fisheries ministers have decided to halt the issuing of these permits , a move that will ensure the UK fishing fleet complies with the original intent of the EU finning ban – that sharks are landed with their fins naturally attached .
As Sonja Fordham , policy director of the Shark Alliance , recently told the BBC : " Requiring that sharks be landed with their fins attached is by far the most reliable means of enforcing a ban on shark finning . "
The move should also ensure that fishermen catch far fewer sharks in UK waters and will be seen by campaigners as a significant step to help prevent many shark species being driven to extinction .
" Right now , the oceans are being emptied of sharks , and the scale of the problem is global , " Dr Julia Baum , of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California , told the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference earlier this year .
" If we continue , we are looking at a really high risk of extinction for some of these species within the next few decades . "
With Britain agreeing to the ban on shark finning , attention will focus on Spain and Portugal , who are now considered the main shark finning nations in Europe and the primary obstacles to an effective EU finning ban .
As part of this campaign , UK ministers are to write to Joe Borg , the European commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , to request an urgent review of shark finning regulation throughout the EU .
Princeton University scientists have shown that , in ancient times , the Earth 's magnetic field was structured like the two - pole model of today , suggesting that the methods geoscientists use to reconstruct the geography of early land masses on the globe are accurate .
The findings may lead to a better understanding of historical continental movement , which relates to changes in climate .
By taking a closer look at the 1.1 billion - year - old volcanic rocks on the north shore of Lake Superior , the researchers have found that Earth 's ancient magnetic field was a geocentric axial dipole -- essentially a large bar magnet centered in the core and aligned with the Earth 's spin axis .
Some earlier studies of these rocks had led other teams to conclude that the magnetic field of the ancient Earth had a far more complex structure -- some proposing the influence of four or even eight poles -- implying that present models of the supercontinents that relied on paleomagnetic data and an axial dipole assumption were wrong .
The report , which will appear in the October issue of Nature Geoscience , says that previous efforts to interpret the ancient geomagnetic field in rocks from North America were confused by the rapid migration of the continent toward the equator in the distant past .
The researchers " neatly lay to rest the long - standing controversy over the nature of Earth 's magnetic field 1.1 billion years ago , " writes geoscientist Joseph Meert of the University of Florida in an essay that accompanies the report .
" In this paper , we show that Earth 's magnetic field has been more stable in the past than originally believed , " said Adam Maloof , an assistant professor of geosciences at Princeton and one of the paper 's authors .

The Earth 's magnetic field wraps around the globe , shielding life from harmful cosmic rays .
It is emanated by the Earth 's iron core and is shaped by a multitude of factors , including the spinning of the Earth and circulatory motion influenced by the Earth 's rotation and temperature differences between the inner core 's outer layers and the lower mantle .
The researchers obtained magnetic measurements from a thick stack of lava flows in the Lake Superior region .
The lavas erupted when geologic forces attempted to tear apart central North America forming the Keweenawan Rift .
The researchers used the tiny magnetic minerals within the volcanic rocks to record the orientation of the geomagnetic field at the time the rocks erupted onto the Earth 's surface .
By knowing how those grains pointed to the magnetic field of that time , the scientists could deduce the latitude where they were located when the lava flows erupted and cooled .
The grains pointed to where " paleo - north " was for each rock .
Studying layers of the basaltic lava flows , they used the information to track how the Earth 's magnetic poles have " flipped " over the eons , with the North Magnetic Pole becoming the South Magnetic Pole and vice versa .
The team studied three of these reversals that occurred over a few million years .
The scientists plan to use the data to better understand how continents moved in the distant past , massing to form supercontinents .
" We needed to be able to have a working model of how the geomagnetic field behaved in the past if we are going to talk about where plates have moved , how fast they 've moved and how ancient supercontinents were configured , " said Nicholas Swanson - Hysell , a graduate student at Princeton and the first author on the paper .
Knowing the proper location of continents is key to understanding the climate of any era , Maloof said , because the shape and location of continents affect ocean currents , global average temperatures and wind patterns .
And by understanding in detail what Earth 's climate was like in ancient times , he noted , scientists can better comprehend the climate of today and make more accurate projections for the future .

According to scientific reconstructions , a supercontinent known as Rodinia existed between 1 billion and 800 million years ago .
The extreme cooling of the global climate about 700 million years ago and the rapid evolution of primitive life during subsequent periods are often thought to have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia .
Rodinia predated a more recently created supercontinent called Pangaea , which came together about 300 million years ago .
Scientists have pieced Rodinia together by comparing rocks with similar geological features that are now widely dispersed .
Knowing that they have confirmed the structure of the Earth 's magnetic field at that time gives Maloof and Swanson - Hysell the confidence to learn more about the supercontinent and that epoch .
" For the past 30 years , scientists have feared that the geometry of Earth 's field was complex and varied , " Maloof said .
" Such a complex field made it very hard for people to reconstruct the ancient geography of the planet because they could not rely on a predictable field .
We show that these fears were unfounded -- at least for 1.1 billion years ago -- and that the evidence for a complex ancient field was an artifact of the way rocks had been sampled . "
Other researchers on the paper included : Benjamin Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; and David Evans of Yale University .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation , Sigma Xi , Agouron Institute and Princeton University .
Science fiction TV shows used to be about scientists playing God — now our intrepid heroes meet God , instead .
The overt religious discussions on Battlestar Galactica stood out as unusual , but now every SF show brandishes a bible .
What happened ?
Oh , and there are some spoilers for upcoming TV shows here .
We can't help noticing the odd religious moments in a lot of the fall 's biggest SF TV shows , and how shoehorned - in the references to God or the Bible often seem to be .
Unlike Firefly , which featured a man of God as one of its major supporting characters and naturally sparked theological discussions , or BSG , which took place during an apocalypse , the newest crop of shows seems determined to mention God even when it does n't make that much sense .

Or FlashForward , whose pilot includes one character who randomly questions whether God gave everyone on Earth a glimpse of the future as a punishment .
Leaving aside the fact that clairvoyance seems like an odd shape for divine punishment to take .
There 's also the fact that the slutty / Christian babysitter just happens to be making out with her boyfriend ( while the girl she 's looking after is asleep ) and thus feels guilty — so she decides that God gave the entire world a future vision just to punish her for making whoopie on the couch .
Make sense ?
Absolutely not .
Unless you think that some studio exec in a meeting said , " We need a religious angle here .
There oughta be one character who decides that this was all God 's doing .
Because that 'll play well in the God states . "

And then there 's V , which — spoiler alert — has aliens visiting us and claiming to be benefactors , who 've come to help us .
Plenty of people are suspicious of these allegedly enlightened visitors , but then we meet a Catholic priest who 's decided to preach that these aliens are " God 's creatures , " with the implication being that they 're sent by God .
And the priest tells his underling , Father Jack , that he must preach the aliens are divinely sanctioned — or else .
It 's even sort of implied ( if I remember correctly ) that the Vatican has made support for the aliens official policy .
WTF ?
Why would the Catholic church come out in support of random aliens that we know nothing about ?
It 's one of the few moments in the V pilot that literally makes no sense whatsoever , and it inspired much head - scratching when we saw it at Comic Con .

And then there 's Stargate Universe , which — spoiler alert again ! — has a character experience weird religious visions for no discernable reason in its second episode .
( Or third , if you count the two - hour pilot as two episodes . )
It 's never entirely clear why one character , stuck on a weird , inhospitable planet , is having visions of being in church and talking to a priest , and it seems partly designed to give us a chunk of this character 's backstory .
But it also feels like a quick - and - dirty way of conveying that this character is having a spiritual wandering - in - the - wilderness thing , without actually having to create any real religious / spiritual content to go with it .
It feels a bit cheap : he's in the wilderness , and he sees some churchy stuff .
Oh !
So that means it 's deeply symbolic or something .
And of course , Dollhouse gave us the ultra-stereotypical " Christian cult with guns " in one of its first - season episodes — the one where Echo gets turned into a blind religious zealot with cameras in her eyes , and everybody 's sorta Amish and sorta Mormon .

Honestly at times , watching current SF TV it 's hard not to feel like someone watched too many early John Woo movies and thought " church with birds in it — deep ! "
Or maybe too many early 1980s New Wave videos , where Duran Duran dance around pews and it randomly turns black and white .
( And yes , I know that those videos are directed by Highlander auteur Russell Mulcahy . )
But it also feels like a bit of pandering to a Christian nation that 's perceived as being a bit suspicious of science -y stuff .
The Genesis of religion in SF TV
Once , it seemed like religious iconography and rhetoric was rare in science fiction — the original Star Trek confronted Captain Kirk and his crew with Greek gods , as well as godlike aliens who just wanted to toy with our heroes .
You might have a hysterical crewman babble something about " If God had wanted us to go into space , etc , " and the Roman episode did end with Uhura staring at the camera and saying the rebels were worshipping " the son of God . "
But these were just grace notes .
( We wo n't get into Star Trek V , since that was a movie , and it came much later , and it makes the head hurt . )

After Trek , you certainly had the occasional SF program where the good guys were confronted with bog - standard space gods , who were notably free of any religious dogma that people on Earth could recognize .
In fact , one reason why space gods are so often ridiculous and campy is the fact that they 're trying so hard to be ecumenical .
One common SF trope , over the decades , was the " meeting the real - life alien behind the ancient Earth myth — but this was usually the creature who inspired the Aztecs or the Egyptian religions , not the Judeo - Christian deal .

But in general , when television SF did grapple with religion prior to recent years , it was to reveal religious icons as aliens , using high technology to impress the superstitious .
It was n't until the final couple of seasons of Stargate SG - 1 that this " superstitious humans worshipping aliens " storyline seemed to be an overt critique of organized religion .
The show suddenly introduced a new antagonist for our heroes , a set of " ascended " ( non-corporeal ) aliens called the Ori , who encourage humans to worship them and preach from the Book of Origin .
Writes blogger Chris Bateman in his 10 - part essay on religion in science fiction :
It is almost impossible not to interpret the Ori as a paper - thin parody of Christianity ...
Much of the shallow critique of Christianity occurs between Claudia Black 's ex-Goa'uld host Vala Mal Doran – who takes over Richard Dean Anderson 's role as comic relief in the later seasons and fulfills this role magnificently – and her Ori-worshipping husband Tomin .
Vala and Tomin square off in debate after Tomin reads incessantly to her from the Book of Origin , with Vala accusing him of taking a bunch of stories about how to live well and using it as a justification for war and murder .
The scene serves a narrative purpose – Tomin later witnesses a Prior blatantly distorting the meaning of one of the verses in the Book of Origin , causing him to question his faith – but it also reads as a clumsy attack on contemporary Christianity .

Bateman theorizes that the producers of SG - 1 were aghast at the Bush Administration 's war in Iraq and wanted to satirize what they perceived as a right - wing Christian crusade against Islam .
To some extent , The 4400 also seemed to be taking jabs at organized religion on occasion .
But before SG - 1 introduced the Ori , Star Trek : Deep Space
Nine took a huge leap forward in introducing religious themes to SF , with the Prophets , aka the " wormhole aliens . "
For most of DS9's run , you could choose to believe the secular theory that the Prophets were merely interdimensonal aliens , who lived outside space / time and saw future and past as the same thing .
But towards the end of the show 's run , the messianic overtones around Benjamin Sisko made it harder and harder to sit on the fence .
And meanwhile , Babylon 5 won praise for including characters of faith ( including a Catholic commander , and a group of Catholic monks who come to live on the station ) as well as including religion in many of its storylines .

Most recently , Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles included Agent Ellison , who 's frequently shown to be a Baptist , and religious references became more and more predominant in the show ( which is about the actual apocalypse , so it does make sense to bring it up . )
Most fans of BSG would agree that the show 's monotheist / polytheist divide made it a much richer experience than a simple robots - vs - humans show would have been otherwise — regardless of how you may feel about the Baltar Cult , and the hand - wavy " Starbuck turns into ZZ Top " ending .
And it 's pure blasphemy to suggest that Firefly would be better without Shepherd Book .

The rise of Space Jesus ?
Lately , though , it 's seemed almost required to have some kind of religious discussion among a TV show 's themes — and it's more likely to be Christian rather than some kind of vague Space Religion ( TM ) or misty spirituality .

Religion is part of society , and including religious points of view makes your world seem more realistic and three - dimensional — it would seem odd if science fiction on television never included a religious viewpoint , just as it would if people never mentioned politics at all .
At the same time , there are ways to include religion that make sense ( Firefly and T : SCC come to mind immediately ) and ways to include it that feel gratuitous and weird ( the Vatican is endorsing the aliens ! )
And yes , when you throw in religion in a nonsensical way , it either feels like you 're going for a cheap effect , or like you 're pandering to religious people .
Add to that the fact that scientists and people who use pure empiricism to deal with problems are far and few between —
Walter Bishop and maybe the twisted Topher on Dollhouse are our only real avatars of tech nerdhood that I can think of off the top of my head .
It 's become a taboo in televised science fiction to show people doing science .

The show that 's handling religion in the most fascinating manner right now is Supernatural , which is modern fantasy rather than science fiction .
In the last year or so , angels have joined the show 's long - standing demon characters — and now Lucifer himself is roaming around .
And there are lots of hints that we 'll actually be meeting God this season at some point .
Theological discussions over why God allowed all of the horrors of the 20th century to happen are automatically more fascinating when they come out of the mouths of actual Angels , and the fact that the Archangels believe that God is dead makes for fascinating viewing .
So consider this a plea for more thoughtful portrayals of religion in science fiction — and fewer random , thoughtless , kitchen - sink inclusions .
People who watch science fiction are smart .
We can tell when we 're being pandered to , and when we 're being spoonfed religious ideas just because it makes your show seem more " mythic " or " relevant . "
Religion can make your science - fiction story feel like it takes place in a world we can relate to , and it can deepen your characters and add another layer to your story — or , in the wrong hands , it can feel like a random piece of baggage , tacked on to your story for spurious , external reasons .
We can usually tell the difference between the two .

Tea and Sympathy By Arnold Kling
A conservative photo - journalist refers to yesterday ’s rally in Washington as The Conservative Woodstock .
I believe that this day could be referred to in the not too distant future as the day that changed America .
This was the day the great silent conservative majority finally found its voice .
I ’m to put my comments below the fold , because this is an “ off - mission ” post .
If the point of my blogging is to educate people about economics and political economy , it is hard to see how this post relates , although it might .
First of all , I do n’t see this as the dawn of a new day .
More like a last stand .
But I ’ll come back to that .
I ’m probably one of the few people who was on the Mall for a big anti-Vietnam War rally and also for some of this event .
However , for this one , I came down on my bike , got there around noon , and left after about 15 minutes .
I did n’t see the huge crowd that ultimately assembled .
When I passed the Reflecting Pool , there were more tourists than protesters , and I had to get almost to the lawn on the Capitol before I saw a big concentration of protesters .
People were mellow and friendly , like at the giant anti-Vietnam rally .
And as with that rally , they tended to mill around , ignore the speakers , and chat among themselves .
My joke is that I was waiting for Pete Seeger to come out and sing “ Waist Deep in the Big Muddy ” about the deficits .
( “ We ’re waist deep in the Big Muddy .
But the Big Fool says to push on . )
At an anti-war rally , a thrill would run through the crowd if a charismatic politician came to speak .
Here , that was not going to happen .
Is that because there are no charismatic conservative politicians any more , or because conservatives are n’t so much into charisma ?
Do they fit the stereotype of being white , small - town , uneducated racists ?
Not much racism , but otherwise I would say they fit the stereotype enough to make me skeptical that this is an important political movement .
This country is becoming more urban , less white , and more educated .
At most , this movement could turn out to be the right - wing equivalent of MoveOn–a mailing list to be tapped when somebody wants to try to mobilize activists .
But it may not even achieve that before it splinters and shrivels into insignificance .
I think the long - term significance of what is going on , both at the progressive end and at the Tea Party end of the political spectrum , is an open rupture .
In the 1960 ’s , a Hubert Humphrey or Robert Kennedy could connect with uneducated white voters .
The idea of blowing them off was unthinkable , if only because they were such a large majority of the voting population at the time .
Now , the elitism of President Obama and his supporters has reached in - your - face levels .
They have utter contempt for the Tea Party - ers , and the Tea - Party - ers know it .
I would n’t want the Tea Party - ers at the faculty picnic , either .
But my sense of class solidarity with Obama and other educated progressives does not make me want to see them exercise power .
If anything , being a member of the educated elite and knowing knowing them as well as I do makes me share the Tea Party - ers ’ fears .
I come back to my view that this is white , small - town America making its last stand .
However , I think , also , that the progressive elite is making a last stand .
My guess is that doubts are mounting among many independent voters about whether they want such a highly - charged politics .
I am sticking with my bet that the Democrats will hold onto their House and Senate majorities as well as the Presidency through the elections of 2016 , but relative to six months ago I feel that I am depending more on Republican incompetence than overall political trends to win that bet .
One could argue that this country is on the verge of a crisis of legitimacy .
The progressive elite is starting to dismiss rural white America as illegitimate , and vice - versa .
I see the chances of both sides losing as much greater than the chance of either force winning .
Police say South Australian Premier Mike Rann was assaulted at a function at the National Wine Centre last night .
They say a 55 - year - old man from Burnside in Adelaide has been arrested for allegedly hitting Mr Rann below his right eye during a Labor Party fundraising dinner .
Witnesses say the man made a comment to the Premier and allegedly tried to grab a knife from a nearby table .
Businessman Barrie Harrop helped control the man until police arrived .
" He came in with a rolled up magazine and started beating the Premier across the head five or six times , " Mr Harrop said .
" I got up and put the guy into a headlock ; he went for a knife on the table and he was begging for me to let him go . "
The man has been taken to the City Watch House and is expected to be charged with aggravated assault .

Advertisement Britain's oldest original computer , the Harwell , is being sent to the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley where it is to be restored to working order .
The computer , which was designed in 1949 , first ran in 1951 and was designed to perform mathematical calculations ; it lasted until 1973 .
When first built the 2.4 m x 5 m computer was state - of - the - art , although it was superseded by transistor - based systems .
The restoration project is expected to take a year .
The system was built and used by staff at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell , Oxfordshire .
Speaking to BBC News , Dick Barnes , who helped build the original Harwell computer , said the research was - officially at least - for civilian nuclear power projects .
" Officially it was to help with general background atomic theory and to assist in the development of civilian power , " he said .
" Of course , it [ the Atomic Energy Research Establishment ] had connections to the nuclear weapons programme , " he added .
Although not the first computer built in the UK , the Harwell had one of the longest service lives .
Built by a team of three people , the device was capable of doing the work of six to ten people and ran for seven years until the establishment obtained their first commercial computer .
" We did n't think we were doing anything pioneering at the time , " said Mr Barnes .
" We knew the Manchester Baby and Cambridge 's EDSAC were already up and running .
Both these projects had large teams and we felt like a poor relation .
" Looking back , hardly any of us were computer literate and it's astonishing that we managed stored computing at all , " he said .
The Harwell machine is recognisably modern in that unlike some of its predecessors such as Colossus it used a single memory to store data and programs .
The Harwell computer was still in use in 1973 Kevin Murrell , director of The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park , said it had some of the characteristics of contemporary machines .
" The machine was a relay - based computer using 900 Dekatron gas - filled tubes that could each hold a single digit in memory - similar to RAM in a modern computer - and paper tape for both input and program storage . "
Time line Retired from service at Harwell , the system was offered as a prize for colleges , with Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College ( later Wolverhampton University ) taking ownership and renaming it as the WITCH ( Wolverhampton Instrument for Teaching Computing from Harwell ) .
It was used in computer education until 1973 .
It then went on display at Birmingham Science Museum , before being put in storage at Birmingham City Council Museums ' Collection Centre .
Now it is being sent to the National Museum of Computing in Bletchley , where a team are set to restore it to working order .
Mr Barnes said the prospect of seeing the Harwell computer up and running after more than 36 years was " very exciting " .
" I still do n't know how they managed to find so many spare parts , but I think they have a very good chance of getting it going again , " he said .
There are several significant predecessors to the Harwell computer : The Ace ( parts of which are on display in London 's Science Museum ) , the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator ( EDSAC ) which was broken up , and Manchester 's Small - Scale Experimental Machine ( SSEM ) nicknamed Baby , which has been rebuilt but not using original parts .

With the August 31 deadline having passed Versus has been removed from DirecTV .
The LATimes wrote about the reason for the dispute between the satellite giant and the sports network last week :
Robert Mercer , director of public relations for DirecTV , said : " Versus ' overall ratings are poor and have not increased nearly enough to justify what we 're paying them , let alone the significant increase they 're asking for .
" It is a significant rate hike and the deal is discriminatory because Versus is not offering the same package options as other distributors . " ...
On DirecTV , Versus ranks 61st among 74 English - advertising supported cable networks .
Obviously to MMA fans the story is the fact that WEC shows are going to become unavailable for a large percentage of viewers .
The loss in eyeballs will no doubt result in a loss of cash for the promotion , but also for fighters who are given sponsorship deals based on the number of eyeballs that will be on their fights .
From an overall sporting perspective the coverage change comes just days before the start of the college football season .
With Versus having a deal with the Big 12 as well as carrying a small number of Pac - 10 and Mountain West games the pressure to work out a deal will increase with every passing day .

ATLANTA , Nov. 13 ( UPI ) --
The governor of drought - stricken Georgia and 250 of his constituents gathered Tuesday to " pray up a storm . "
At the end of the prayer vigil at the statehouse , the sun broke through the clouds , The Atlanta Journal - Constitution reported .
But Gov. Sonny Perdue said God may still answer the prayers with rain tomorrow or next week .
Advertisement
Television cameras recorded the event as Perdue opened the vigil .
" We come here very reverently and respectfully to pray up a storm , " he said .
Police kept a group of protesters from the Atlanta Freethought Society about a block away .
One of their signs read " Hail Priest - King Perdue . "
The Rev. Gil Watson of United Methodist Church led the prayers .
" We have not been good stewards of our land .
We have not been good stewards of our water , " he said .
" Lord , have mercy on your people , have mercy on us and grant us rain .
Oh God , let rain fall on this land of Georgia . "
The National Weather Service said some light rain is possible later this week , although not enough to break the drought .
For those of you waiting till next week to see it , I can't say this strongly enough :
Do not put off going to see " Capitalism : A Love Story . "
It is not just a movie .
It is a referendum that is being closely watched by the CEOs of America .
Let me tell you bluntly , the suits on Wall Street are closely watching to see how this movie does this weekend .
So , too , are the members of Congress .
If " Capitalism " has a huge opening , it will send shivers down their corporate spines , telling them loud and clear that the American people are mad as hell and are not into taking it any more .
It will put all the bosses on notice that the vast Obama - voting majority has awoken from its silence and are out in full force .
But if the attendance is just " ok " or " so - so , " then they will be relieved knowing that there is not a popular groundswell of opposition out there -- and then they can go about their business as usual .
I 'd like to send them a different message .
Treat tonight and tomorrow as if it were election day .
Blow their minds on Monday morning when they show up at their executive suites , switch on CNBC or Fox Business News , and learn that America turned out in droves to participate in a raucous denunciation of Wall Street and everything it stands for .
I often hear people ask , " What can I do to make my voice heard ? "
Your answer is at the nearest theater showing this movie .
Trust me , packing these movie houses tonight and tomorrow will eff them up in an overwhelming and profound way .
Last night , there were many reports of spontaneous cheering throughout the film in nearly all the theaters .
Theater managers reported difficulties in getting people to clear the theater lobby afterwards because groups of total strangers assembled to passionately discuss what they just saw .
One manager wrote to me and said , " It 's a good thing we carry Gummy Bears and Junior Mints at the concessions stand instead of pitchforks and torches !
These crowds were ready to march over to the local Citibank and do something ! "
Another manager said a crowd in the lobby formed around the little Chase ATM machine next to his popcorn stand and started to " yell at it . "
Jeez !
( Click here to see some of the cell phone photos fans have sent from various theaters around the country last night . )
Here 's what I 've heard the most about last night : Audiences were stunned and shocked by many of the things I reveal in the movie -- stuff that the networks have refused to show them -- even though they have the footage !
They purposely withhold this news from you , the public .
And because I dare to show it , some networks now refuse to license any of their footage to me .
So I get my hands on it and put it in the movie anyway .
I truly do n't care .
I 'm sick and tired of the truth not being told to the American people -- and I am willing to suffer whatever the consequences come my way because I showed it to you .
Fortunately we have " fair use " laws in this country that have kept my hide out of court so far .
There is something so patently wrong with not being told what Wall Street and Corporate America are up to .
If you go see " Capitalism " tonight , you 'll see what I mean .
You will alternately have your head spinning and then find yourself laughing your ass off !
Much more is riding on the success of this movie than the amount of popcorn that is sold .
If we do well this weekend , the studio will expand the film to smaller towns next week .
Do n't put off seeing it !
Click here to find out where it 's playing and order your tickets now .
Call some friends and make a night of it .
My crew and I have put nearly two years of our lives into this and I am honored that it has been so well received .
Join in on the fun of giving AIG , GM , Bank of America and all the other thieves the shellacking they deserve .
And send me a photo of you and the crowd there tonight !
I 'll post it and personally send it to the heads of all the financial institutions and the members of Congress .
They need to get a clue -- right now -- and I 'd like you to help me send them that clue !
Thanks again , and I 'll see you tonight at the movies !
Yours ,

Fighting rages across Afghanistan as US military buildup continues
By Patrick Martin
14 September 2009
Attacks by anti-occupation forces spread across Afghanistan over the weekend , with major armed clashes , bombings and other incidents in at least 10 provinces , including eight that are outside the southern region where the US and NATO forces have launched a major military offensive .
Rather than directly confront the greatly increased US ground forces in provinces like Helmand , the Taliban and other resistance forces are employing typical guerrillas tactics , striking at “ soft ” targets well away from the main combat zone , in many cases in areas where there has been relatively little insurgent activity .
The bloodiest single incident took place Saturday in Farah province , in western Afghanistan , where dozens were killed in US air strikes after a Taliban ambush killed three American soldiers and seven Afghan army troops .
The guerrillas staged a complex assault involving two separate roadside bombs , gunfire and grenade launchers .
US military officials said that the firefight raged for as long as six hours , with repeated air strikes called in to assist the ambushed US - led force .
Press accounts cited military claims of 50 dead Taliban fighters and local reports of civilian casualties .
This is a regular pattern in the war , as the Pentagon routinely categorizes all those killed by US firepower as “ insurgents , ” regardless of their actual role in the fighting .
There was another clash in the west in Herat province , with one Afghan policeman and two Taliban killed .
In southern Afghanistan , at least 20 civilians were killed , reportedly by roadside bombs .
In Uruzgan province , 14 people in a minivan were killed , while six others died in a similar attack in Kandahar province .
In the city of Kandahar , the country ’s second largest and the provincial capital , three suicide bombers hit the office of the national intelligence police in a coordinated but largely unsuccessful attack , killing one officer .
There were incidents in six provinces of eastern Afghanistan , which had been considered a military “ success story ” for the US forces , at least compared to the south .
In Wardak , a roadside bomb killed two American troops .
In Kunar , a Taliban ambush killed six private security guards working for a construction company , and wounded ten .
In Nangarhar , four policemen died when militants attacked a border checkpoint .
In Khost , a rocket attack killed three civilians .
In Ghazni , five Afghan army troops were killed by gunfire and mine explosions .
And in Paktika , a suicide bomber attacked , but killed only himself .
In the previously quiescent north , there was an extremely bloody incident in Kunduz province that suggests the degree of insurgent infiltration of the local armed forces .
A district policeman poisoned eight other officers at a guard post , killed his commander , and then handed over the other seven to the Taliban , who beheaded or shot them and then burned the guard post .
Kunduz was the site of last week ’s atrocity when US war planes hit two hijacked gasoline tanker trucks , creating a fireball that killed as many as 150 people in the village of Omar Kheil .
In another incident that gives a glimpse of the popular hatred of the US - NATO occupation , a fight broke out in Kabul , the capital city , when several Afghan National Police officers objected to a US soldier drinking in front of them while they were observing the Ramadan fast .
The argument turned into a shootout , in which the US soldier and his interpreter were seriously wounded and one Afghan policeman was killed .
The Washington Post noted , “ The geographical diversity of the assaults was a fresh indication of the Taliban ’s widening reach , which now extends to about 80 percent of the country , according to the International Council on Security and Development ( ICOS ) , a London - based research organization . ”
The ICOS data , as reported by Reuters , found that there was “ substantial ” insurgent activity in 97 percent of Afghanistan , and “ heavy ” activity in 80 percent .
Almost half of the country was classified as either “ high risk ” or under “ enemy control . ”
The most significant change from a year ago was the increased guerrilla activity in areas of the north .
The increasingly grim position for the US - backed Afghan puppet regime of President Hamid Karzai has produced a crisis for the Obama administration , which is deliberating how much to increase the US military intervention , under conditions where support for the Afghan war among the American people is collapsing .
Since Obama ordered 17,000 additional troops to Afghanistan early in his presidency , there have been a series of additional , incremental increases that have not been as widely reported .
In September alone , for instance , there have been several such additions to the forces available to the US Afghan commander , Gen. Stanley McChrystal .
The New York Times reported Thursday that Defense Secretary Robert Gates was preparing to send more US counter - explosive forces to Afghanistan , in a move that would be separate from any request by McChrystal for additional troops .
The Los Angeles Times reported September 2 that as many as 14,000 additional combat troops would be deployed in Afghanistan by sending home troops working in support functions and replacing them with “ trigger pullers . ”
The support duties would be handed over to private contractors , who now outnumber the actual uniformed soldiers .
This would greatly increase the firepower of the US occupation force while allowing the White House to conceal the escalation .
In a statement on Capitol Hill Friday after a visit to Afghanistan , Democrat Carl Levin , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , called for the Obama administration to focus its escalation of the war on the buildup of Afghan troop strength , from 134,000 now to 240,000 by 2012 — essentially conceding , with this time frame , that US military forces will be in Afghanistan in huge numbers at least until then .
Levin said that such an increase should be prepared before any additional US ground combat forces were dispatched .
General McChrystal is believed to be requesting as many as 40,000 additional US troops , in a report now being reviewed in the Pentagon and White House , and to be delivered to Congress by September 24 .
The Obama administration is requesting more money for Afghanistan - Pakistan operations in its 2010 military budget than for Iraq , the first time that spending for the “ Afpak ” theater has exceeded that in Iraq .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday , “ I do n’t think there ’s a great deal of support for sending more troops to Afghanistan in the country or the Congress . ”
Such warnings are becoming increasingly common from congressional Democrats , not because they oppose further escalation — they have , on the contrary , fervently supported the war in Afghanistan for eight years .
The Democrats are concerned that as antiwar sentiment mounts , those opposed to the US occupation of Afghanistan will draw the correct political conclusion — that both big business parties are irrevocably committed to advancing the interests of US imperialism — and will seek a political alternative .
YESTERDAY'S GDP figures are certainly wrong .
But for now , we do n't know which of its figures are wrong - and so we do n't know Australia 's real rate of economic growth .
Sorry , but that 's the truth .
The figures released yesterday do not add up .
They will be heavily revised .
Their bottom line could be flipped upside down , turning growth negative .
For now , the Bureau of Statistics estimates that the economy grew by 0.6 per cent in the year to June .
Wayne Swan was triumphant yesterday , declaring Australia the only advanced economy to record growth in the past year .
An economic gold medal for Australia - and thanks to his stimulus !
Well , what do the figures say ?
They tell us our gross national expenditure in the June quarter was actually a tad less than a year earlier .
The reason our output grew , it says , was that we imported far less of what we consumed - import volumes fell 13 per cent year on year - yet our export volumes held steady , even rising 3 per cent in the first half of 2009 !
Hmm .
POOLE , England 
It has become commonplace to call Britain a “ surveillance society , ” a place where security cameras lurk at every corner , giant databases keep track of intimate personal details and the government has extraordinary powers to intrude into citizens ’ lives .
A report in 2007 by the lobbying group Privacy International placed Britain in the bottom five countries for its record on privacy and surveillance , on a par with Singapore .
But the intrusions visited on Jenny Paton , a 40 - year - old mother of three , were startling just the same .
Suspecting Ms. Paton of falsifying her address to get her daughter into the neighborhood school , local officials here began a covert surveillance operation .
They obtained her telephone billing records .
And for more than three weeks in 2008 , an officer from the Poole education department secretly followed her , noting on a log the movements of the “ female and three children ” and the “ target vehicle ” ( that would be Ms. Paton , her daughters and their car ) .
It turned out that Ms. Paton had broken no rules .
Her daughter was admitted to the school .
But she has not let the matter rest .
Her case , now scheduled to be heard by a regulatory tribunal , has become emblematic of the struggle between personal privacy and the ever more powerful state here .
A Los Angeles Times article this year recounted how a teacher rebuked an eighth grader who had been hospitalized for slashing his wrists in a suicide attempt .
“ Carve deeper next time , ” the teacher allegedly advised .
He was even said to have added : “ You ca n’t even kill yourself . ”
A review board blocked the termination of that teacher .
The Los Angeles Times investigation found that it is so expensive to remove teachers that the authorities typically try to do so only in cases of extreme misconduct  not for something as “ minor ” as incompetence .
Of course , there are many other obstacles to learning : lack of safety , alcohol and narcotics and troubled homes and uninterested parents .
But there ’s mounting evidence that even in such failing schools , the individual teacher makes a vast difference .
Research has underscored that what matters most in education  more than class size or spending or anything  is access to good teachers .
A study found that if black students had four straight years of teachers from the top 25 percent of most effective teachers , the black - white testing gap would vanish in four years .
There are no silver bullets , but researchers are gaining a better sense of what works in education for disadvantaged children : intensive preschool , charter schools with long hours , fewer certification requirements that limit entry to the teaching profession , higher compensation to attract and retain good teachers , objective measurement to see who is effective , more flexibility in removing those who are ineffective .
Unions are wary in part because school administrators can be arbitrary and unfair .
Yet there are some signs that the unions are rethinking their positions in very welcome ways .
The National Education Association has announced an initiative to improve teaching in high - poverty high schools , and the American Federation of Teachers is experimenting with teacher evaluation that includes student performance data .
Neither initiative reflects sufficient urgency .
But let ’s hope this is a new beginning .
I ’m hoping the unions will come round and cooperate with evidence - based reforms , using their political clout to push to raise teachers ’ salaries rather than to protect ineffective teachers .
This is the central front in the war on poverty , the civil rights issue of our time .
Half a century after Brown v. Board of Education , is n’t it time to end our “ separate but equal ” school systems ?
Some of the world 's greatest leaders , from Napoleon Bonaparte and Winston Churchill to Bill Clinton and Margaret Thatcher , are said to have managed on just four to six hours ' sleep a night , whereas the typical teenager finds it difficult to get out of bed in less than 10 .
Newborn babies can sleep for up to 18 hours – admittedly at irregular intervals – whereas an elderly person may find it hard to sleep longer than six , although they often have to resort to the odd afternoon nap to make up for what they lacked at night .
Sleep is the quintessential ingredient of life .
Every animal does it at some point in the 24 - hour cycle and people who are forcibly deprived of sleep are effectively undergoing torture .
But the big unanswered question is how much sleep do we actually need ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Some people seem happy with four or five hours , although most people would feel sleep - deprived on less than six .
Others need a good seven or eight hours of sleep and adolescents are renowned for extended kips .
So how much sleep is necessary for a healthy mind and body , and does this amount truly need to vary between people and age groups ?
The latest study into sleep may help to resolve the issue with the discovery that certain people in the population carry the smallest of genetic mutations in a gene that appears to play a significant role in deciding just how much sleep human beings need .
Scientists studied an extended family in California and found that a mother and her daughter shared a life - long habit of rising in the very early hours of the morning with no apparent ill - effects .
They routinely went to bed between 10.30 pm and 11 pm and got up between 4 am and 4.30 am .
The researchers took blood samples from all members of the family and analysed their DNA for any signs that could explain this unusual behaviour .
The tests revealed that the mother and her daughter did in fact share a tiny " point mutation " in a gene known as hDEC2 , which is known to affect the regulation of other genes and has been implicated in the control of sleeping patterns in animals .
Other members of the family who followed a more conventional sleeping pattern were not found to have inherited the same mutation .
These family members typically required the normal eight hours or so of sleep a night instead of the five to six hours of the mother and daughter .
Just to make sure that the hDEC2 mutation was truly involved in this unusual sleeping pattern , rather than a coincidental occurrence in the two women , the scientists went on to create genetically - engineered mice with the same point mutation to the same gene .
These mice also exhibited unusually short patterns of sleep , a feature not seen in ordinary mice .

" The implication from the study would be that there is a genetically - wired system in our body to tell us how much sleep do we need , " explained Ying - Hui Fu , Professor of Neurology at the University of California in San Francisco , the study 's head .
" Yet , we really do n't know anything about how this is done .
This discovery provides an opportunity for us to begin to probe into the pathway regulating our sleep quantity and need , " said Professor Fu , whose study is published in the journal Science .
" It is not clear at the present time how this mutation can lead to short sleep quantity .
This is one of the areas that we are pursuing actively , " she said .
The scientific evidence suggesting that different people are genetically wired to require shorter - than - average periods of sleep goes back many years .
In 1999 , for instance , scientists identified the existence of a gene – or more specifically an inherited mutation within a gene – that appeared to confer something called familial advanced sleep - phase syndrome .
This is an inherited condition where people tend to go to bed early and get up early , which can also happen when people abandon normal sleeping routines , such as at the weekend and when on holiday .
People who exhibit this all the time are known as " morning larks " , to distinguish them from " night owls " at the other extreme who routinely go to bed late and get up late .
The scientists in this study , led by Christopher Jones of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , did not actually find the gene or its mutation – they could only show that it must exist in the 29 people from three different families that they had studied .
People with advanced sleep - phase syndrome , however , still sleep for the usual seven and a half to eight hours a night , it 's just that their daily routine or " circadian rhythm " is shifted .
Scientists believe that genetic mutations can also occur in the genes influencing this aspect of the 24 - hour sleep - wake cycle .
Sleep is a product of both circadian rhythm and another controlling factor that , put simply , measures the amount of sleep we have had .
When we need sleep , this " homeostatic " mechanism makes us sleepy ; when we 've had enough sleep , it tells us to wake up .
Professor
Fu and her team suspect that the mutation they have found plays a role in the homeostatic mechanism that helps to control the amount of sleep we need .
What the latest study tells us is that the actual quantity of sleep needed is partly under genetic control – and that is the result of who our parents were , rather than what we do each day .
Seven ages of sleep
1 Sleep in newborn babies occurs around the clock on an irregular cycle
2 Babies between three and 11 months usually begin sleeping through the night
3 Toddlers between one and three years old need between 12 and 14 hours of sleep and daytime naps
4 Pre-school children begin to have nightime fears and nightmares
5 Problems in the five - to - 12 group linked with television and computers
6 Adolescence associated with long sleeping patterns thought to be necessary for development
7 Adult sleep can become progressively difficult and disturbed

Some Thoughts on Child Support and Michigan 's Friend of the Court
Basic Information
I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice .
These are tough times in Michigan , and many parents are loosing good jobs , particularly in the
automo tive sec tor , and are th ey unable to fi nd more work at t he same pay rat e .
Some of thes e
parents pay child support through the Michigan Friend of the Court , and they 're having a hard
time getting the FOC ( Friend of the Court ) and courts to adjust their child support obligation to
reflect their new income .
Sometimes , a FOC employee or judge will say that children who benefit from child support
" shoul d not suffer " because a parent loos es a job .
I feel that if he /s he says this , he / she is not
properly conducting his / her duties , and is not obeying the laws of the state of Michigan .
It 's not more money that 's in the child 's best interest , it 's the correct application of the Michigan
Child Support Formula Manual .
As of Oct 1 , 2008 , the 2008 Michigan Child Support Formula Manual is used .
For use in reviewing previous orders , 2004 Michigan Child Support Formula Manual may be
used .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran confirmed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president and said a row over his June 12 re-election was over , leaving opponents who cried foul with few options .
Iran ’s top legislative body , the Guardian Council , said a partial recount on Monday had disproved complaints of irregularities by pro-reform opponents , who said the count was inadequate and that only annulling the election would do .
Riot police beefed up their presence in the capital Tehran but there were no signs of major unrest late on Monday , in contrast to protests that erupted when Ahmadinejad was first declared victor of the June 12 vote .
State media say 20 people died in that violence which the government and opposition blamed on one another .
Pro-government Basij militia and riot police broke up the protests .
“ The secretary of the Guardian Council , in a letter to the interior minister , announced the final decision of the Council ... and declares the approval of the accuracy of the results of ... the presidential election , ” state broadcaster IRIB said .
The poll and its turbulent aftermath have exposed splits in Iran ’s political establishment and plunged the country into its deepest crisis since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
But options for the opposition look limited now the election result has been officially upheld , after the recount of what the Council said was a random 10 percent of the vote .
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei signaled on June 19 that mass protests would no longer be tolerated .
There is little scope for more legal fights , and hundreds of opposition supporters have been detained , leaving protesters leaderless .
After dark , some people are still chanting “ Allahu Akbar ( God is greatest ) ” from their rooftops , mimicking tactics used during the 1979 revolution , but the nightly cries are weakening .
There has been talk of other forms of civil disobedience , including strike action , but these have yet to materialize .
DOSSIER CLOSED
“ The Guardian Council statement was issued when it became convinced about the accuracy of the election , ” a Council spokesman said , adding that no irregularities were found .
“ The dossier of the ... election has been closed today . ”

The recount system was not immediately clear , but state media said it had been spread over at least several provinces .
Opposition supporters say the vote was rigged to favor the hardline president over reformist rivals including Mirhossein Mousavi , who came second .
Mousavi had rejected the idea of a recount and sent no representatives to watch it .
“ The Guardian Council approval of the vote negates the possibility of an election re-run , ” Iran ’s English - language Press TV television station said ,

STRAINS WITH WEST
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Iran ’s rulers were still likely to face internal opposition .
“ They have a huge credibility gap with their own people as to the election process .
And I do n’t think that ’s going to disappear by any finding of a limited review of a relatively small number of ballots , ” she said .
Asked if Washington would recognize Ahmadinejad as president of the world ’s fifth biggest oil exporter , she said :
“ We ’re going to take this a day at a time . ”
Iran ’s rulers , locked in a row with the West over nuclear ambitions , have blamed the post - vote trouble on foreign powers rather than popular anger .
The protests strained relations with Britain in particular , which rejected accusations its embassy encouraged the unrest .
Iran had detained nine local embassy staff but freed five of them on Monday , saying the others would be kept for questioning .
“ Iran ’s action , first the expulsion of two diplomats and now the arrest of a number of our locally engaged staff , is unacceptable , unjustified and without foundation , ” Prime Minister Gordon Brown told reporters in London .

“ No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick .
If you agree , join us in posting this as your status for the rest of the day . ”
So went the status updates of Facebook users a couple of weeks back .
It ’s unclear which individual or organization started this effort , or how many people it has reached .
But this hardly matters because with a few a clicks a new chapter in America ’s battle over health care was being written online .
Numerous online publications and blogs were documenting what had just happened and adding to the hype .
Facebook is only one of the social media platforms health - care - reform advocates are using to build a grassroots movement around their cause .
And it is only one example of how , contrary to common belief , young people do in fact care about the future of their country .
Activist organizations such as MoveOn.org , Young Invincibles and the 80 Million Strong coalition ( to which HeadCount belongs ) have turned to Web 2.0 platforms in hopes of building a true grassroots movement .
Young Invincibles , which launched its campaign a few months ago , invites people to submit videos of their personal health - care stories .
With more than 400 submissions received in just a few weeks , supporters can upload their videos via a YouTube channel .
Could interaction among supporters be any easier ?
Video is immediate , direct , authentic , and uncensored .
Yes , it may take more work than , say , writing a letter to congress .
But it ’s an fresh and exciting way for the millennial generation in particular to make its mark on history .
And they ’ve only just begun .
“ We are very interested in thinking about ways to work with Facebook and other social media applications to create ways in which people can express and have that spontaneous expression of support or desire for change , but also to become part of a community that allows us to continue to talk to them and engage them in what is going to be a longer - term drive toward reform , ” said Ari Matusiak , a founder of Young Invincibles .
80 Million Strong has taken similar measures .
Last week they collected dozens of stories told through video , photographs and written works , which they will present to elected officials .
MoveOn.org , teamed up with the band R.E.M to make the “ We Ca n’t Afford to Wait ” music video .
It features photographs of organization members across the country sharing their struggles with the current health - care system .
This medium is undeniably remarkable in what it can achieve .
But it ’s no substitute for outreach outside the web warns Maya Enista , CEO of the 80 Million Strong Coalition .
“ While social media definitely have elevated the level of discussion and made it more accessible to more people , it ’s not enough to win a campaign , ” she said .
“ I think they ’re one of the most important avenues of communication for our generation .
It ’s just another tool in the box we activists use . ”
Critics of reform are also in on this spreading trend .
Conservatives for Patients ’ Rights , known for its “ No Guarantee ” ad , uses its video page and blog to criticize reform .
And although pro-reform Facebook groups seem to outweigh the naysayers , People against Nationalized Health Care has managed to attract more than 2,350 friends .

All the ( equal rights - deprived ) world 's a stage
by Jeremy Hooper
There are some careers that are undeniably , inextricably linked to the LGBT community .
Fields that are teeming with gays at every rank , from entry - level to top dog .
Lines of work in which anti-gay bias is not merely a socio-political reality that graces the American landscape , but rather a deeply personal , deeply hurtful affront to friends , colleagues , bosses , loved ones , and selves .
Theatre is one such world .
Before launching G - A- Y , this writer worked on Broadway .
My world was filled with gay - headed families of every variety , many of whom had achieved astronomical professional success in their careers .
Yet despite their achievements and accolades -- and regardless of how many heterosexuals their words , music , or scripts may have delighted over the years -- these accomplished pros , like all LGBT people , have never known a world where their bonds are fully protected or their existences fully respected .
Creativity can create a two hour staged illusion , but it can not change reality .
So since the Broadway world is one of America 's most LGBT - filled professional environments , it 's no surprise that there is a heightened passion for gay causes among this community .
We 've seen this advocacy come even more into prominence in the eye - opening wake of Prop 8 , with groups like Broadway Impact cropping up to stem the tide of anti-gay activism .
It 's because the theatre community is so rich and fulfilled , with LGBT people contributing so much to this richness and fulfillment , that the men and women who live , work , and play in this world simply cannot stomach the constant attacks on the " lifestyle " that they know as " life . "
So what if you were a theatre professional whose mother spends her every day gunning for LGBT rights ?
Might it bother you that as you try to carve out a path that is so rich in gay history , your matriarch is working to carve away the gains that gay people have made ?
When you appear in theatrical satires like Sodom : The Musical ( a production that starred Village People singer Randy Jones ) , might it concern you that the person you most want to see in the audience , smiling and applauding , is someone who regularly goes on CNN to non-satricailly deny Mr. Jones ( and various other production members ) of their civil equality ?
And since your mom has dedicated her adult life to countering equal rights , might you see a principled need to step up and say , " Hey , wait just a minute , mama ? ! "
Well , you 'll have to ask Maggie Gallagher 's son for yourself .
Only he knows the answers to these questions .
Your thoughts
Wow .
Poor guy .
Posted by : Garet | Aug 26 , 2009 9:24:11 AM
Wow .
The resemblance is uncanny , too .
Posted by : Christopher™ | Aug 26 , 2009 11:43:57 AM
Where did you see a picture , Christopher ?
Posted by : G - A - Y | Aug 26 , 2009 11:46:52 AM
I just looked " Patrick Gallagher " up on IMDB , and then did a Google search for a variety of movie and play premieres to make sure it was the same person .
Posted by : Christopher™ | Aug 26 , 2009 12:39:47 PM
Christopher :
That 's not the same one .
The one who was in Night At the Museum and is currently in " Glee " ?
That 's not him .
Although there is certainly a physical similarity .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Aug 26 , 2009 12:45:27 PM
You know what ... you 're right .
He grew up in Canada .
So it could n't be him .
Sorry for the false alarm .
Although they do look a lot alike .
Posted by : Christopher™ | Aug 26 , 2009 12:50:33 PM
So , maybe I 'm dense , but does The Gagger have a gay son ?
Who is also involved in the theater ?
He would be ( I guess ) in his twenties ??
early thirties ??
When is his tell - all book coming out ?
Posted by : Dick Mills | Aug 26 , 2009 1:28:50 PM
Dick : Maggie has a son who is in theater .
He was in the off - Broadway production of " Sodom : The Musical " , a satirical take on the S&G story that starred Village People singer Randy Jones .
That 's the bulk of what I know .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Aug 26 , 2009 1:37:00 PM
So , yes , it is official : I am dense !
Thank you for clearing that up .
Did he play the part of the gas - bag in the blue dress going around rattling , hissing and spitting venom at all things LGBT ?
Oh , no , wait ..
I think his mother beat him out for that role .
But , unless he is a raging homophobe himself , there still may be a good book in it .
Posted by : Dick Mills | Aug 26 , 2009 2:17:38 PM
I 've known Patrick for years .
He 's a very talented guy and quite likable as well .
His mother 's public position is something she has to answer for , not him .
I love my parents , but we have some very strong disagreements on some political matters .
I can understand outing someone who is privately gay but publicly takes an anti-gay stance .
But outing someone who is straight because he works in a field with many gays and his mother is anti-gay rights ?
I do n't see the point .
There 's no hypocrisy , only guilt by association .
Posted by : DaveS | Aug 26 , 2009 2:23:06 PM
Well Dave , let 's be very clear here .
There 's no " outing " going on .
Unless , of course , one sees being in the theatre as a bad thing .
If we tell you that Meryl Streep 's daughter is in the theater , is that outing ?
No !
The same goes with Patrick .
We were tipped off to the fact , and we put it out there .
He , by nature of appearing in this public business in public productions , has made himself a semi-public figure .
And as for the point :
That maybe , just maybe , someone who works closely with the LGBT community would see a need to take a stand against a family member 's very hurtful activism !
If Patrick were to come out and say , " I adore my mother but she 's WRONG on this , " he could do more to stop NOM 's agenda than all of us put together !
It 's his prerogative not to .
Nut we are well within our rights to raise these questions !
You are 100 % right that the child does not have to answer for the sins of the mother .
But we can wish and hope that the child might help us stop his mother from her career of using our love to brand us as " sinners . "
But we 're thrilled to hear he 's a good guy .
We never doubted as much .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Aug 26 , 2009 2:51:01 PM
I 'm on the fence about outing .
Those who are privately gay and publicly anti-gay are an easy call - out them .
Those privately gay and closeted ( but not anti-gay ) - no outing - but encourage them to come out .
If Maggie 's son is gay , I think it is somehow relevant , as it would expose a deeper personal agenda or motivation than we had thought .
She should then be hammered with questions about her efforts to control her son's life and how that squares with " family values . "
If Patrick is gay and is outed against his will , he should blame his mother .
Patrick is just one person , while his mother is waging a vicious campaign against every gay person in the US .
By the way , does anyone know if Patrick 's surname is Gallagher , Srivastav , or something else ?
Posted by : Richard Rush | Aug 26 , 2009 5:15:00 PM
Richard : Patrick Gallagher identifies as straight .
We have no reason or desire to dispute that .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Aug 26 , 2009 5:24:14 PM
By " outing , " I did not mean to suggest Pat is gay - he 's not - or that he was outed as an actor .
I meant he was outed as Maggie 's son .
My point is that like everyone else , Pat is faced with choices about how active to be about his beliefs .
I think you were trying to pressure him to do something that the rest of us do not get pressured to do .
It would be nice if we all devoted more attention to making the world a fairer place .
I can't say I do as much as I should , or that my actions match my strong feelings on the subject .
But does
Pat deserve to be confronted , as he now might , more than the rest of us , about what he thinks and whether he should try to embarrass Mom ?
I do n't think so .
I also think you exaggerate the significance of Maggie Gallagher 's straight son publicly saying he disagrees with Mom .
Who would care ?
It would be a little more significant if Pat were gay and came out , but still not as significant as Dick Cheney 's daughter .
But a straight son ?
So what ?
NOM would survive , and Prop 8 still would have passed .
Perhaps I 'm being a bit harsh on you .
I can understand your antipathy toward Maggie , and this world is changing for the better -- too slowly -- more because of people like you than people like me .
Still , I think this indirect attack is unwarranted .
Posted by : DaveS | Aug 26 , 2009 9:34:28 PM
Dave : I do n't think you 're being " Harsh " at all .
I just think you 're inaccurately sizing up the situation .
I dare you to show me where the " attack " lies .
Patrick is in the theatre .
Maggie is an anti-gay activist .
Both of them , to varying degrees , are in the public spectrum .
All this post did was make note of these facts , of which we only just became aware .
And form those facts , I put forth a few simple questions .
The answers could very well be " No , " in all instances -- I have in now way suggested one possible outcome !
But what is unfair is to act as if asking these questions was somehow wrong !
As for what he could do : I think you underestimate the worth here .
I 'm nto sure if you are aware of the extent to which Maggie Gallagher currently influences the gay rights debate in this country , but if you ever want me to clue in , please let me know .
I mean that sincerely , as I have an EXTENSIVE library of most every appearance , musing , essay , etc. that she has put forth on the subject .
For modern gay rights activists , Maggie Gallagher has become * THE * face of those who are seeking to deny equality .
If her own son , by virtue of his own life experiences , took a stand for what is fair and right , it absolutely could be a powerful statement .
And beyond that :
If he considers the denial of LGBT equality to be a detriment ( and I 'm not even sure if he does ) , then I would think that he might have a desire to speak up simply out of principle !
I know I would .
In fact -- I HAVE !
I told my own tale of parental conflict on national TV ( 2006 on PBS ) because it was crucial to my story as an activist !!
So bottom line :
Whether or not Patrick cares to ever address any of this is his prerogative .
But as long as he takes part in a public exercise like the theatrical arts , and as long as his mother takes part in a public exercise like anti-gay punditry , then it is perfectly fair for someone ( especially a lover of both the theatre and the gays ) to say , " Hey - - did you know that he 's related to her ? "
People can and they will .
And some would argue that for a principled gay person or ally , the acknowledgement and related questioning is actually more like a MUST !

Posted by John , October 25th , 2009 - under Nazis , Resistance , Social fascism .
Tags : BNP , Britain , British National Party , Fascism , Fighting back , Free speech
Out they come , the free speech fundamentalists , defending the ‘ right ’ of fascist leader Nick Griffin to appear on BBC TV .
They shall have emblazoned on their banners ‘ Free speech for fascists ’ as the Nazis imprison them .
And possibly , given their tendency to acquiesce to power , these apologists for capital and exponents of parliamentary cretinism will bow before Hitler ’s children if they grow in power .
These fools elevate free speech to an absolute principle .
But even under capitalism today speech is not free .
Powerful barons control and mediate speech .
The internet is no saviour .
It lives in the shadow of thought that the capitalist media throws .
Free speech , the right to organise and the right to vote did not come gift wrapped from the bourgeoisie .
They were born of struggle against the established order .
They often sprang from the battles of workers for a just society .
It is the working class which retains the power to defend those freedoms if and when the bourgeoisie wants them curtailed .
The BBC decision to give air time to the fascists is part of the future planning of the ruling class .
It will also lead directly to an increase in attacks on Muslims , Asians and blacks in society .
The BNP is claiming a record number of enquiries about membership after the broadcast .
Hiding behind free speech and even handedness is also hypocritical .
Irish freedom fighter Bobbie Sands was elected to the British Parliament .
The BBC did not ( as far as I can find out ) interview him .
Instead they followed Margaret Thatcher ’s order not to give Sinn Fein what she called ‘ the oxygen of publicity . ’
Apparently censorship is OK when used against those who challenge the established imperialist order , but an outrage when it threatens the bosses ’ fascists , the brutal bully boys of capitalism in crisis .
The bourgeoisie will have no compunction in attacking basic freedoms if it is in their interests to do so to protect and restore profit rates .
The rise of the Nazis to power in Germany in the 1930s is a case in point .
The crisis of profitability in German society saw the fascists grow from a tiny minority to being the largest party in the Reichstag .
The Nazis won less than three percent of the vote in the 1928 elections , then over 18 percent in 1930 and 37 percent in the 1932 elections .
The Nazis were initially the political expression of the middle class , a class caught between big business and labour .
They attempted to appeal to both workers and bosses – hence national ‘ socialism ’ .
But while the German economy boomed , the bourgeoisie had little immediate need for the fascists .
That changed with the collapse of the German economy during the Great Depression .
The bourgeoisie found their strong leader in Hitler .
His task for the bosses was to smash the trade unions and political parties of the left , the German equivalent of the Labor Party and the German Communist Party .
Having done that the Nazis could then drive down living standards , reorganise capital and restore profit rates .
Hitler adopted a two pronged approach to organisation before winning power - the respectable parliamentary fascists and the street fighting mainly unemployed gangs .
It is an approach Nick Griffin in the UK is following today .
Like Hitler he is mainstreaming fascism for future battles .
The BBC is his accomplice in that .
And his street thugs , groups like the English Defence League , attract human scum to prepare for the battles of the future against workers and their organisations .
The BNP received 6 percent of the vote in the European elections in June .
This is partly because of the complete failure of New Labor to defend public services and living standards .
Britain remains in recession while other countries appear to be coming out of it .
In Germany in the early 30s both the Communist Party and the Social Democrat party were strong institutions of the working class .
They failed to unite against the fascists .
The Stalinist tactic of attacking the social democrats as social fascists was a crime against history and , along with the failure of the left to mobilise workers as workers against fascists , led to Hitler ’s victory .
In Britain today there is no strong social democratic party , and certainly no revolutionary group with significant support in the working class .
While economically the situation today in Britain is not yet like Germany in the early 30s , politically it is much worse .
Any worsening of the economic situation could see a swing to the British fascists among voters , including working class voters because of the lack of a left alternative and New Labour ’s abject failure .
As the BBC decision to legitimise the BNP ’s fascism shows , the British bourgeoisie is hedging its bets .
It does not need the fascists yet to destroy the weak labour and left movements .
But if the British economy worsens , it might consider using the fascists to drive down workers ’ living standards .
This may not be by granting the fascists power .
The British Nazis already perform a valuable function for British capital .
They will be a magnet pulling the forthcoming Conservative Government further to the right and pushing it to massively attack public services , jobs and wages .
And Muslims , Asians and blacks .
The demonstration outside the BBC headquarters when Griffin turned up for his interview shows that some in British society recognise the danger .
Unless British unionists begin to join them in droves and to exercise their power as workers against the Nazis , the fascists could grow rapidly .
We ’ve put together a collection of magazine covers that have stirred up controversy through the years .
These covers can serve as object lessons for what to do and what not to do both with design and editorial .
While some controversial covers have worked and sold more magazines , or won awards for the editors who made the decision to go to press with them , others were embarrassments that the publication had to either apologize for , or fire an editor over .
Here are some of the most controversial magazine covers of all time .
Feel free to suggest other covers that you think should be part of this collection .
Time Magazine , January 2 , 1939 : Hitler as Man of the Year
This cover featured an elaborate illustration of Hitler playing “ his hymn of hate in a desecrated cathedral while victims dangle on a St. Catherine ’s wheel while the Nazi hierarchy looks on . ”
Baron Rudolph Charles von Ripper was a Catholic that fled Hitler ’s Germany , and the artist of this disturbing piece .
By 1938 , Hitler had firmly seized power in Germany , taken over Austria and Czechoslovakia , and had been given a free hand in Eastern Europe by the English prime minister of the time , Neville Chamberlain .
Time has had to defend this choice throughout history , and at the time defended it by stating that the “ Man of the Year ” was a title bestowed on the person who had most influenced events of the previous year .
Time Magazine , April 8 , 1966 : Is God Dead ?
This cover has been called the most controversial of all time .
The related article concerned the “ death of god movement ” that had sprung up in the 1960’s .
The cover and article enraged readers .
Life , November 26 , 1965 : War In Vietnam
Paul Schutzers captured this arresting image of a VietCong prisoner being taken prisoner by American forces during the Vietnam War .
Photography and news coverage like this helped to turn the American public against the Vietnam war .
While Schutzers was one of LIFE ’s best photographers , he was killed on assignment during the Six - Day War of 1967 between Israel and its neighbouring states of Egypt , Jordan , and Syria .
Esquire , April 1968 : The Passion of Ali
This smart rendition of Muhammad Ali was created to illustrate his martyrdom to his cause after he refused to join the US military due to his religious beliefs and was subsequently stripped of his heavyweight boxing title .
The piece was done after the same manner as “ The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian ” , a popular theme through medieval art but most recognizable in the painting by Andrea Mantegna .
Esquire , May 1969 : The Drowning of Andy Warhol
Another triumph of Esquire ’s former visionary Art Director , George Lois , this picture combined two separate shots of a soup can and Warhol .
In the first ten years of his employment at Esquire , circulation was boosted from 500,000 to 2 million , a figure for which his covers were partially responsible .
This shot references Warhol ’s famous “ soup can ” exhibits that symbolized the American avant - garde art movement .
Playboy , October 1971 : First Playboy African - American Woman
This cover was the first Playboy cover to feature an African - American woman .
The model is Darine Stern and the photographer was Richard Fegley .
National Lampoon , January 1973 : If You Do n’t Buy This Magazine …
While this cover did n’t do much more than make people laugh when it came out despite its violent overtones , Ronald G. Harris ’ famous cover shot definitely raised a few eyebrows in pre-Photoshop days .
The New Yorker , March 29 , 1976 : Steinberg Map of New York
This portrayal of a New Yorker ’s idea of what the rest of the United States looks like was drawn by Saul Steinberg .
The artist sued Columbia Pictures over their movie poster for “ Moscow on the Hudson ” , which does seem to be derived from Steinberg ’s cover down to the placement of the title .
Steinberg won the case .
Rolling Stone , January 22 , 1981 : John Lennon and Yoko Ono
Annie Leibovitz took this shot just hours before John Lennon was shot outside of his apartment building , the Dakota , in New York City on December 8 , 1980 .
Leibovitz originally wanted to take the shot of Lennon alone but he insisted that his wife be in the pictures .
This cover was named the most popular magazine cover of the past 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Publishers .
Vanity Fair , August 1991 : Demi Moore , Pregnant and Nude
This cover was shot by celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz and was decried as shameful and disgusting when it was released .
Some stores sent back the issue , or only sold it with a brown paper covering the “ offensive ” image .
It has spawned countless celebrity nude pregnancy shots done in the same fashion , and helped to launch Demi Moore ’s career into the stratosphere .
Vanity Fair , August 1993 : K.D. Lang and Cindy Crawford
The cover was meant to be as controversial as the country star ’s career .
According to the cover story , Lang got more grief from the country music industry over her decision to join PETA than her decision to come out as a lesbian .
Time Magazine , June 27 , 1994 : OJ Mug Shot Controversy
In 1994 , OJ Simpson was accused of murdering his wife , Nicole .
In 1995 , he was acquitted after a long and highly publicized trial .
The photo used on the cover of Time Magazine was manipulated to make OJ look darker in skin tone and more menacing .
For comparison , see the Newsweek cover which uses the original shot without any alteration .
The Economist , September 10 , 1994 : The Camel - Humping Issue
Obvious Black Eyed Peas references aside , this cover drew some fire for the UK - based magazine .
The cover was printed for the North American market only .
Time , April 14 1997 : Ellen ’s Coming - Out Issue
Time ’s cover and exclusive story left no doubt in the minds of all Americans that Ellen was , in fact , gay .
Even in 1997 , coming out could be perilous for a star ’s career .
While it may now seem like a mere bump in the road due to Ellen ’s stunning success , at the time TV outlets in rural America pulled her show .
Wired , June 1997 : 101 Ways to Save Apple
When this magazine went to press , Steve Jobs had just rejoined Apple through Apple ’s acquisition of his NeXT Software Inc .
While the cover was a bit more pessimistic than the story it was meant to illustrate , it remains one of the top magazine covers of all time .
We do n’t think anyone would try to give Jobs advice today , but back then Mac fans would have done anything they could to help the ailing corporation .
Time , Dec 21 , 1998 : Devil Horns on Clinton
This was one of several magazine covers that featured Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal .
In 1995 , Lewinsky was an intern at the White House during Clinton ’s presidency , and they had an intimate affair .
The scandal broke when Lewinsky confided in a colleague in January of 1998 .
The scandal eventually resulted in Clinton ’s impeachment .
The top of the letter “ M ” in the Time masthead appear to be resting on the top of Clinton ’s head as horns .
The devil horns were written off by Time as an accident of masthead placement rather than a deliberate act .
Esquire Magazine , December 2000 : The Crotch Shot
This shot of Clinton was said to be inspired by the Lincoln Memorial , but was interpreted as an obvious reference to the Monica Lewinsky scandal .
Like the Obama couple satire in the New Yorker seen further down , this cover drew fire from both sides of the political fence .
The New Yorker , Sept. 24 , 2001 : Twin Towers in Silhouette
This cover was a graphical as well as an editorial success .
The magazine succeeded in creating a fitting and classic memorial to the victims of the tragedy and the buildings themselves in true upscale New Yorker fashion .
Covers editor Franoise Mouly created a testament to the Twin Towers that drew on the inspiration of Ad Reinhardt ’s black - on - black paintings .
Entertainment Weekly , May 2 2003 : Dixie Chicks
The Dixie Chicks set off a firestorm when they criticized then - president George W. Bush for invading Iraq on the grounds that Iraq was manufacturing weapons of mass destruction .
The Dixie Chicks used their weapons of mass distraction on this provocative cover .
Seventeen , May 2003 : Sarah Michelle Gellar ’s Zombie Arm
This horrendously manipulated stock photo of Sarah Michelle Gellar made the mag send an expensive purse by way of apology .
Gellar returned the purse since she did n’t wear leather .
While the practice of using stock photos for covers is common , flagrant abuse of Photoshop is something that the art department and editor usually catch before print time .
Rolling Stone , January 2006 : The Passion of Kanye West
Rolling Stone tipped a thorny hat to Esquire ’s portrayal of Ali with this 2006 cover .
It is n’t known if the cover was meant to be a joke about the singer ’s ego , but most people found it very funny .
Religious fans of the magazine did n’t find it as hilarious , and the odd cover story that went with it in which the singer admits to a porn addiction just made the whole thing awkward .
The tone of the cover feels current in light of the singer ’s recent mike - grabbing moment at the 2009 VMA’s .
Baby Talk , August 2006
While this image seems benign to most people who have been involved with a baby in one fashion or another , the cover was decried as obscene .
Even though moms made up the target demographic , a survey of 4000 of them turned up the fact that 25 % had a negative response .
One mother actually shredded the magazine so that her 13 - year old son could n’t see it .
Not that he likely noticed ; he was probably on the computer downloading porn watching tips from Kanye .
Texas Monthly , January 2007 : Dick Cheney Cover Issue
Building on the famous 1973 Lampoon cover , Texas Monthly took a jab at the Vice - President ’s hunting accident where he shot a colleague in the face .
This cover won the 2007 Best Cover Line of the Year Award from the Magazine Publishers of America .
Time , August 29 , 2007 : Devil Horns on Billy Graham
The blogosphere was rife with rumours about this cover .
This was probably not intentional .
Time Magazine has claimed that all of its “ Devil Horn ” covers through the ages are mere coincidences .
For a defense of the Time Magazine position , this blog post has a list of Time Magazine covers that have devil horns but no potential hidden meaning .
Accident of their masthead design , or subtle editorial statement ?
You decide …
Golfweek , January 19 , 2008 : The Noose that Hung an Editor
This cover was born out of the comments of a golf anchorman , Kelly Tlighman , that fellow players should “ lynch ( Tiger Woods ) in a back alley ” and the subsequent feature story that was published in that edition of Golfweek .
PGA
Tour director Tim Finchem had this to say about it : “ Clearly , what Kelly said was inappropriate and unfortunate , and she obviously regrets her choice of words , but we consider Golfweek ’s imagery of a swinging noose on its cover to be outrageous and irresponsible ” .
A day after the cover was published , the editor was let go .
People Magazine , March 2008 : Brangelina Twins
This cover and photo shoot sacrificed People ’s editorial soul for a first shot at the Brangelina twins .
Instead of their usual journalistic even - handed approach , they seemingly acquiesced to the couple ’s need for nothing but positive coverage in order to get a scoop on the rest of the world with the first baby pictures .
While People magazine denied these charges as “ categorically false ” , the coverage was nevertheless very rosy - cheeked in tone .
Vogue , April 2008 : King Kong Cover
This cover of model Gisele Bundchen and sports star Lebron James was considered to be a racist portrayal of “ King Kong ” .
Images that portray black males as threatening “ reinforce the criminalization of black men , ” said Damion Thomas , assistant professor in the Department of Kinesiology at University of Maryland .
The cover was supposed to showcase two stars with excellent bodies , in keeping with the “ Shape ” theme of the issue .
The New Yorker , July 21 , 2008 : The Obama Couple Satire
This cover by famous New Yorker cartoonist Barry Blitt was heavily criticized by both the McCain and Obama camps during the 2008 US election .
While the piece was meant to be a satire of allegations lobbed at the couple by their detractors , its inopportune appearance during a campaign did n’t have Obama ’s supporters laughing as hard as the magazine intended .
OK Magazine , June 2009 : Michael Jackson Death Photo
Fans were upset over the magazine ’s decision to publish this photo .
Sarah Ivens , editorial director , said that the cover decision was made since they wanted to stand out from all of the tribute covers that were dominating the stands that week .
Jackson died on June 25 , 2009 after being given a cocktail of drugs by his physician .

Post - election protests have been quashed with force by authorities An Iranian news agency says a young man arrested during post- election protests died after being beaten , and not from meningitis as police had first claimed .
Semi-official Mehr quoted an " informed " source citing a coroner 's report .
If confirmed , it would be the first official sign that jailed protesters faced severe abuse , as alleged by some leaders of the opposition movement .
The man , Mohsen Ruholamini , 25 , was the son of a campaign adviser to defeated conservative candidate Mohsen Rezaie .
Correspondents say the conservative supporting Mehr news agency has previously been used by critics of the re-elected President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , to leak information .
It is owned by the Islamic Propagation Organisation , which although an independent legal entity , in practice works in parallel with the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance .
Mehr says that last month a state forensic doctor ruled out meningitis as the cause of Ruhalamini 's death in a report handed to judicial authorities .
In fact , he died of " physical stress , the effects of being held in bad conditions , multiple blows and severe injuries to the body " , the doctor is quoted as saying .
On Sunday , Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promised Abdolhossein Ruholamini , the young man 's father , that justice would be done in the case .
' Lives lost '
The recently appointed judiciary chief , Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani - brother of Mr Ahmadinejad 's main conservative rival - has set up a three - member panel to look into post-election unrest , including the alleged abuse of detained protesters .
Police chief Esmail Ahmadi Moghaddam had originally said some protesters had died from a viral disease at Kahrizak jail - where Ruholamini was held - which has since been closed down .
Reformist leader and defeated candidate Mehdi Karroubi has claimed detained protesters had been subjected to beatings , torture and rape in jail .
" Some youngsters who were chanting slogans were beaten in such a way that they lost their lives , " he alleged .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's re-election was followed by massive street protests over alleged vote - rigging , in which at least 30 protesters were killed in clashes and thousands were arrested .
Most of those detained have been released , but about 200 remain behind bars and some 110 have been put on trial .
On Friday Mr Ahmadinejad called for decisive action to deal with leaders of the protests which he said were organised , provoked and implemented on behalf of " the enemy " .

POPULATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
By Kawsu Ceesay
As at today , the global population stands at about 6.8 billion inhabitants .
China and India together account for over a third of the current total .
All around the globe , the various economies are facing difficulties related to population growth and sustainability .
For example there is less water for every cattle herder in the horn of Africa , less land for farmers tilling the slopes and scarcer and higher priced energy and food .
The global economy is down with massive job losses particularly in the Global North .
As we debate our way out of the current economic downturn and environmental crisis , we have to ask ouselves if downshift in human numbers will put the environment on a mvore sustainable path .
My own guess is a BIG YES .
However , it is not just a downshift in human numbers that will bring about sustainability but also the way we continue to behave .
According to Robert Engelman , vice president for programmes at the Worldwatch Insttitute , the behaviour of a dozen people in one place sometimes has more environmental impact than that of a few hundred somewhere else .
Falling human numbers will immensely benefit environmental sustainability .
And the way to achieve this is as follows :
1. to make sure that every woman bears a child in good health when she wants a child
2. all women and girls should have unlimited access to good quality education
The above suggestion may be part of the recipe to achive a drop in population growth globally as research has indicated that women with at least secondary school education tend to have fewer children than those with no secondary school education or with no education at all .

Oct. 12 , 2009 --
Researchers have found new evidence that it 's possible for a mother with cancer to pass the disease on to her unborn child .
A case report shows that cancer cells in an infant genetically match those from her mother ; the mother was diagnosed with leukemia shortly after a normal full - term delivery .
Researchers say rare cases of mothers ' cancer cells in infants have been reported over the last 100 years , which has suggested the possibility that cancer cells may be passed from mother to infant .
But until now it had not been confirmed genetically .
In the case report , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , researchers used genetic tracking to prove that the cancer cells had been transmitted from mother to infant .
The mother was a 28 - year - old woman who was diagnosed with leukemia shortly after giving birth ; her 11 - month - old daughter developed a similar type of cancer .
Genetic testing showed the infant 's cancer cells shared a unique genetic match to her mother's .
Special markers in the cancer cells of the infant confirmed they were of maternal origin .
Additional testing showed that the infant 's cancer cells lacked a portion of genetic material that would have flagged them as intruder cells and targeted them for elimination by her immune system .
Researcher Takeshi Isoda of Tokyo Medical and Dental University and colleagues say this genetic trait likely enabled the mother 's cancer cells to evade the infant 's protective placental barrier .
DEPRECATION NOTICE
This module does n't work well on Catalyst 5.9 or above , and no longer passes its tests .
Repairing it is n't possible .
Using this module for anything new is n't recommended ; use Plack : : Middleware : : AccessLog or log at the proxy layer .
It remains online in support of existing users .
SYNOPSIS
Requires Catalyst 5.8 or above .
# In lib / MyApp.pm context use Catalyst qw ( ConfigLoader - Stats=1 AccessLog ... other plugins here ... ) ; __PACKAGE__->config( ' Plugin : : AccessLog ' => { formatter => { format => '% [ time ] % [ remote_address ] % [ path ] % [ status ] % [ size ] ' , time_format => ' % c ' , time_zone => ' America / Chicago ' , } , } ) ; __PACKAGE__->setup ( ) ;
DESCRIPTION
This plugin is n't for " debug " logging .
Instead it enables you to create " access logs " from within a Catalyst application instead of requiring a webserver to do it for you .
It will work even with Catalyst debug logging turned off ( but see enable_stats below ) .
CONFIGURATION
All configuration is optional ; by default the plugin will log to STDERR in a format compatible with the " Common Log Format " ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format).
target Default : \*STDERR
Where to log to .
If target is a filehandle or something that isa ( " IO : : Handle " ) , lines of logging information will be print ed to it .
If target is an object with an info method it 's assumed to be a logging object ( e.g. Log : : Dispatch or Log: : Log4perl ) and lines will be passed to the info method .
If it 's a CODE ref then it will be called with each line of logging output .
If it 's an unblessed scalar it will be interpreted as a filename and the plugin will try to open it for append and write lines to it .
formatter Default : { class => " Catalyst : : Plugin :: AccessLog:: Formatter " } The formatter to use .
Defaults to the Formatter class included in this distribution .
This option must be a hashref .
The class option is taken as the name of the class to use as the formatter ; all other keys are passed to that class 's constructor .
See Catalyst :: Plugin :: AccessLog :: Formatter for the keys supported by that module .
enable_stats Default : true Catalyst :: Plugin :: AccessLog works without regard to Catalyst 's debug logging option .
However , the time - related escapes are only available if the Catalyst : : Stats statistics collection is enabled , and by default stats are tied to the value of the debug flag .
If this option is set , stats will be enabled for the application regardless of the - Stats or - Debug flags , or the MYAPP_STATS or MYAPP_DEBUG environment variables .
NOTES
Logging to $ c->log
It is generally not recommended to write the access log to $ c - > log , especially if static file handling is enabled .
However , there might be a good reason to do it somewhere .
If the logging target is a coderef , it will receive $c as its second argument .
You can log to $ c - > log with :
target => sub { pop -> log -> info( shift ) }
Do n't store $c anywhere that persists after the lifetime of the coderef or bad things will happen to you and everyone you know .

Speaking on an Italian talk show Parla Con Me , Quentin Tarantino confirms his plans to make a Kill Bill 3 .
The writer / director — whose last film Inglourious Basterds has generated over $ 245 million in worldwide box office — says that he will make another installment of his successful Kill Bill series , but that he wants there to be a 10 - year break between the second and third film .
That would put Kill Bill 3 with a 2014 release date and his star Uma Thurman at 44 , just the right age to kick more ass .
The law firm Carter - Ruck has made a fresh move that could stop an MPs ' debate next week by claiming a controversial injunction it has obtained is " sub judice " .
The move follows the revelation of the existence of a secret " super- injunction " obtained by the firm on behalf of the London - based oil traders Trafigura .
The injunction not only bans disclosure of a confidential report on Trafigura and toxic waste , but also banned disclosure of the injunction 's very existence , until it was revealed by an MP this week under parliamentary privilege .
Carter - Ruck partner Adam Tudor today sent a letter to the Speaker , John Bercow , and also circulated it to every single MP and peer , saying they believed the case was " sub judice " .
If correct , it would mean that , under Westminster rules to prevent clashes between parliament and the courts , a debate planned for next Wednesday could not go ahead .
Earlier this week , the Labour MP Paul Farrelly said Carter - Ruck might be in contempt of parliament for seeking to stop the Guardian reporting questions he had put down on the order paper revealing the existence of the " super- injunction " .
The Conservative MP Peter Bottomley went on to tell Gordon Brown at prime minister 's questions that he would report Carter - Ruck to the Law Society for obtaining an injunction that purported to ban parliamentary reporting .
Carter - Ruck said in a letter and press release that , although the Speaker had discretion over sub judice questions , " we believe the proceedings to have been and to remain ' active ' within the definition of House Resolution ... of 15 November 2001 in that arrangements have been made for the hearing of an application before the Court " .
Bercow had told MPs the previous day : " It is not sub judice under the house 's rules ...
There is no question of our own proceedings being in any way inhibited . "
Evan Harris , the Liberal Democrat MP who secured next week 's debate , said : " I read with interest the letter from Carter - Ruck .
I do not think that sub judice is involved here and I do not think that MPs will be deterred from discussing this case in the debate without a ruling from the Speaker , which he has not as yet indicated any likelihood of providing . "
Farrelly said : " Carter - Ruck 's manoeuvres this week , were it not so serious , would be tantamount to high farce .
It is important MPs should not be prevented from going ahead with debates next week . "
The prominent media lawyer Mark Stephens said : " This sort of assault on democratic privileges is what you would expect to see in a banana republic . "
Prince Philip admires the winning design
The man who invented the foldaway Brompton bicycle has been honoured by the Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace for his lifelong obsession .
Andrew Ritchie invented the diminutive bike in 1979 and has been tweaking the design ever since .
After collecting the Prince Philip Designers Prize , Mr Ritchie said he was not finished yet and was still thinking about how to make the bike lighter .
The portable bike folds down to barely bigger than its 16 inch ( 40 cm ) wheels .
In a brief speech Mr Ritchie thanked some of his early financial backers , who had each invested £ 100 in the scheme .
His obsession started in 1975 when he came across a different model and thought he could do better .
Speaking after receiving the award , Mr Ritchie described himself as a " crazy guy " who had spent his time trying to create the most human - friendly product he could .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He said he hoped to make the bike lighter , but it was just as important to him that the bike was easy to manufacture at the company 's factory in west London .
He said : " Getting the design right , getting the ergonomics right is one of the key things for me . "
The Duke set up the prize , run by the Design Council , in 1959 to encourage entrepreneurship .
Alright , so Doom is n’t actually running on the key chain itself , but rather a BifferBoard : a small 150MHz x86 containing ethernet , serial , and even USB with only one watt of power consumption !
The project is to show how easy it is to program the BifferBoard and getting it talking to other hackable items – such as the picture key chain for a display .
Doom does appear a bit slow , but [ Biff ] figures its do to how haphazardly it grabs keyboard input over SSH .
Jenny Sawyer Reads So You Don't Have To
plot
main ideas
themes
symbols
The great thing about books used to be their creepy paradoxical nature .
The book , humblest of objects , its name printed on its spine because it always needs to be stored in the most efficient way rather than proudly displayed , made space for .
If you had read a great book , you had to have spent at least twenty of your good hours in silence and isolation ; you were definitively alone .
And yet if someone else had spent those same isolated hours -- read the same book -- you felt a special connection with them .
You had both done something absurd and dreamed the same dream as a result .
It was as arbitrary and exciting as being someone 's brother or cousin .
Fortunately , all that is over now that quirky , interesting English major Jenny Sawyer is recording sixty - second recaps of 1,000 classic works of literature so that people who do n't like to read will develop B.F. Skinner - style associations between Jenny Sawyer and Pere Goriot .
" Everyone should be allowed to at least know that literature can be beautifully relevant to their own lives Ã ¢ÂÂ " and not just because they want to get a good grade in school , but because it has a transforming power , " she says .
" It has messages that can affect , for the better , our relationships with our peers ( or ) with North Korea . "
North Korea ?
A grandiose idea , she concedes , but " ultimately it all comes down to ' How do you deal with really obnoxious , frightening personalities ? '
Well , Jane Austen had the answer to that .
She sure did !
Tolerate them with pleasant sarcasm , knowing that in truth you are superior , even if your society will never recognize this and reward you for it , until you are safely married to a wealthy man who is also arrogant enough to keep up with you !
That 's how we need to deal with North Korea !
Basically this is a well - meaning idea , but with a terrible approach .
Why ?
What is Jenny Sawyer giving away in her videos ?
Each book gets an " album " of at least 10 videos laying out plot , main ideas , themes , symbols Ã ¢ÂÂ " not quite CliffsNotes but " something that 's going to help them understand what they 're getting into .
"
In other words : In other words : I can't help but imagine that the script for every single one of these videos will start with " Okay , so , there 's this guy " or " there 's this girl . "
I would like this plan if Jenny Sawyer would ditch the homework - help approach and just say what is actually interesting about these classics , i.e : " You should read Moby Dick because it 's about a crazy sea captain attempting to murder God , and the people who help him . "
" Great Expectations is about how even if that girl in your class does n't like you and never will , if you save the life of a criminal then one day he 'll rain wealth upon you .
"
" The Scarlet Letter is about how if you have sex in a small town in Puritan America , you will give birth to a demon child who will help you somehow .
"
The videos would be best if Jenny Sawyer did not aim to be a cool " big sister " or " the smartest kid in your English class " , but rather a girl wearing some kind of threadbare sweater , sitting on a sink that is coming off of the wall , huge cracks growing in the plaster .
She does n't ever look at the camera and she seems like she 's afraid of finding just the right word .
She is probably smoking some kind of cheap cigarette -- or rather she is lighting them , staring at them , forgetting them and letting them burn out .
She says a name : " Amory Blaine . "
She says it again , and again .
" Amory Blaine .
Amory ... Blaine . "
She shakes her head .
She starts crying .
The camera fades to white .
But then again that would also probably be this Jenny Sawyer
In a society increasingly steeped in moral relativism , it 's not the Harrys of the world who will make a difference .
It 's the Snapes .
It 's those who need redemption , then choose it .
It 's those willing to press on and fail and then to press on again Ã ¢ÂÂ " especially when there are no clear answers .

Teach for America alumni Jace Goodier , 24 , left , and Nathan Carlberg teach in Baltimore , where about 25 % of new teachers this fall will be from TFA .
BALTIMORE 
In 2007 , fresh out of the University of Massachusetts Amherst , Chris Turk snagged a coveted spot with the elite Teach For America program , landing here at Cherry Hill Elementary / Middle School in a blue - collar neighborhood at the city 's southern tip .
For the past two years , he has taught middle - school social studies .
One recent afternoon , during a five - week " life skills " summer - school course , Turk tells his five students that their final project , a movie about what they 've learned , has a blockbuster budget : $ 70 .
" We can go big here , " he says .
" We can go grand . "
He might as well be talking about the high - profile program that brought him here .
Despite a lingering recession , state budget crises and widespread teacher hiring slowdowns , Teach For America ( TFA ) has grown steadily , delighting supporters and giving critics a bad case of heartburn as it expands to new cities and builds a formidable alumni base of young people willing to teach for two years in some of the USA 's toughest public schools .
Baltimore Superintendent Andres Alonso — who says he has seen " fewer retirements , fewer resignations and just greater stability in terms of our teaching ranks , " much of it because of a reluctance to leave a secure job in a recession — has doubled the number of TFA teachers , known as " corps members , " in city schools over the past two years .
Next week , more than 160 new TFAers arrive in Baltimore , up from 80 in 2007 .
They 'll make up about one in four new hires .
Nationwide , about 7,300 young people are expected to teach under TFA 's banner , up from 6,200 last year .
TFA is expanding from 29 regions to 35 , including Dallas , Boston and Minneapolis - St. Paul .
But critics say the growth in many cities is coming at the expense of experienced teachers who are losing their jobs — in some cases , they say , to make room for TFA , which brings in teachers at beginners ' salary levels and underwrites training .

TWITTER : Follow reporter Greg Toppo @gtoppo
In Boston , TFA corps members replaced 20 pink - slipped teachers , says Boston Teachers Union President Richard Stutman .
" These are people who have been trained , who are experienced and who have good evaluations , and are being replaced by brand - new employees . "
This month , he met with about 18 other local union presidents , all of whom said they 'd seen teachers laid off to make room for TFA members .
" I do n't think you 'll find a city that is n't laying off people to accommodate Teach For America , " he says .
In March , Charlotte - Mecklenburg , N.C. , schools Superintendent Peter Gorman told board members he was laying off hundreds of teachers but sparing 100 TFAers because the district " made a commitment to this program . "
Gorman noted that TFA teachers " are placed at schools with high populations of underprivileged students where the placement of personnel has proven to be difficult . "
TFA spokeswoman Kerci Marcello
Stroud says it 's a mistaken notion that corps members are displacing experienced teachers .
" In every region where we send teachers , we 're just one source , " she says .
Once they land , corps members must interview for jobs just like everyone else .
Tapping passionate graduates Supporters see TFA 's rise as a boon for low - income students .
Founded in 1990 by Princeton University senior Wendy Kopp as part of her undergraduate thesis , it was her bid to " mobilize some of the most passionate , dedicated members of my generation to change the fact that where a child is born in the United States does a great deal to determine his or her chances in life . "
TFA began with 500 teachers culled from 2,500 applicants .
This year it received 35,000 , including applications from 11 % of seniors at Ivy League schools .
How better to get earnest , whip - smart young people into the classroom to improve the education of low - income students ?
Not so fast , says John Wilson , executive director of the National Education Association , the USA 's largest teachers union .
Last May , he sent a memo saying union leaders were " beginning to see school systems lay off teachers and then hire TFA college grads due to a contract they signed . "
Wilson says TFA hurts children by bringing " the least - prepared and the least - experienced teachers " into low - income schools and making them " the teacher of record . "
TFA , he says , has " done a marvelous job of marketing their program and branding their program — you cannot take away from their business model .
But what they 're doing to poor children is malpractice . "
Only 29 % still teaching Detroit teachers union President Keith Johnson also put it bluntly last April , calling TFAers " educational mercenaries " who " ride in on their white horses and for two years share the virtue of their knowledge as a pit stop on their way to becoming corporate executives . "
Actually , only 4 % eventually go into business , according to a 2008 survey .
About two - thirds remain in education — mostly in administrative or political jobs or working with policy or charitable groups — though overall only 29 % of alumni are still in the classroom .
That 's a bit lower than the USA 's overall teaching force , about one - third of whom quit within the first few years .
By the end of five years , recent research shows , nearly half of new teachers leave the profession , though overall about 40 % of teachers ' college graduates never enter the classroom — period .
TFA says its high attrition rate may be misleading , since only about one alumnus in 10 would have considered education without that two - year teaching stint .
In Baltimore , 365 alumni call the city home , says Omari Todd , TFA - Baltimore 's executive director ; of those , 72 % are still in education .
They include 11 school principals and Alonso 's deputy chief of staff .
Nationwide , TFA boasts 293 principals and five superintendents , including Washington , D.C. , Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee and the founders of the KIPP charter schools .
TFA also says more than 10 % of D.C. public schools are run by its alumni .
But critics such as Wilson — as well as a few alumni — have long pointed out that TFA seems more interested in becoming a political force than providing teaching ground troops .
Its growth plan , posted online , foresees 800 alumni as principals and 100 as elected officials by 2010 ; but nowhere does the word " teaching " appear .
Todd says he does n't see a problem .
" We need people in all sectors if we 're going to close the achievement gap . "
A political agenda as well TFA alumni Nathan Carlberg , who for two years has taught alongside Turk at Cherry Hill , agrees .
He says TFA 's push " into the political side of education " could make a huge difference .
" Once we get people who have experienced and gone through TFA as union heads and secretaries of education and presidents of school boards , " Carlberg says , " then we will see the large systemic change that is needed in this system . "
On its website , TFA prominently displays research on its effectiveness — and faithfully includes unflattering findings .
Among the most favorable : a 2004 study by Mathematica Policy Research .
It found that TFAers blow away their peers when it comes to attending a " most , highly or very competitive " college : 70 % vs. fewer than 4 % for all others .
But the study shows " only slight gains in math for ( students of ) corps members and none for reading , " notes researcher Megan Hopkins , a TFA alumna and doctoral student at the University of California - Los Angeles .
She says her TFA experience and corps members ' " uneven " achievement overall suggest that they " do not receive enough training to be effective .
Of course , TFA would argue that they provide excellent training and mentorship after teachers enter the classroom .
My own experience says otherwise , although TFA is constantly working to improve itself . "
Turk , the Baltimore teacher , says TFA 's training effort is " genuine " but could be improved .
" I think that there is no level of training you can receive , whether it 's Teach For America or any non-profit organization , that 's going to adequately prepare you for a low - income public school system , " he says .
Turnover in low - income areas Like 70 % of corps members , Turk is white .
He says he'd add a crash course , tailored to each region , on race relations .
" I think a lot of corps members are unaware of those things — I 'm still figuring it out . "
After two years in the classroom ( and a planned third this fall ) , he 's training to be a principal — but not until he masters teaching .
He says the charge that TFAers perpetuate chronic turnover in low - income schools is " a fair criticism . "
But Alonso , the Baltimore superintendent , says schools can't expect all — or even most — young teachers to devote decades to a teaching career anymore .
" Like all professions , my sense is that we 're in a different place than 30 , 40 years ago , and young people are trying for the right fit , " he says .
" Part of our responsibility is to be sure that we 're part of the right fit . "

Carter Pagel , a member of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty , documents the long list of injustices that have put Reginald Blanton face to face with the Texas death chamber .
IN TEXAS , it does n't matter if you 're innocent .
They 'll kill you anyway .
The Lone Star State solidified this disgraceful reputation in 2004 when it went ahead with the execution of Cameron Todd Willingham , despite a report from a top scientist disproving most of the evidence that sent Todd to death row .
Now , the state is again refusing to listen to innocence pleas from another man , and has set his execution date for October 27 .
Much like Willingham , Reginald Blanton says he has been accused and convicted of a crime he did n't commit .
Unlike Willingham , Reggie 's life can still be saved .
A Fateful Day
April 9 , 2000 was a regular , lazy Sunday for Reggie .
He was at his home in San Antonio when his twin brother Robert Blanton and Robert 's girlfriend LaToya Mayberry dropped by .
The couple wanted to go cruising around , and visit friends and family .
Reggie agreed to join them .
One of the places the stopped that day was Carlos Garza 's home .
When they arrived at the Stepping Stone Apartments , LaToya , who was pregnant at the time , opted to wait in the air - conditioned car while Reggie and Robert went up to Carlos ' apartment .
They knocked on the door , but Carlos never answered .
So the two brothers returned to the car and , along with LaToya , left to go visit other friends .

Later that day , someone would kick in Carlos ' door and fire two bullets into him , fleeing the home as Carlos lay dying .
During their investigation of the crime , police initially heard a description from a woman who had been with Garza the day he was murdered .
She told investigators that she had seen a man threaten Carlos 's life that same day and described him as wearing a silver 2 P ac necklace .
Police searched for a man fitting the woman 's description , but they were unable to turn up any leads and soon began searching for others to blame .
Creating a Case
Reggie , Robert and LaToya were no angels as far as the San Antonio police were concerned .
The cops knew the brothers as the " Blanton Boys " and were aware that they had ties to gangs in the area .
This gang affiliation makes kids like Reggie perfect scapegoats when someone turns up dead and there are no credible leads .
The act of pinning the Garza murder on Reggie began on April 11 , when police responded to a domestic disturbance call at the trailer home where Robert and LaToya were staying .
An officer arrived and attempted to detain LaToya .
She resisted and was charged with assault on a public servant and failure to produce identification .
When the officer ran a background check , he discovered she also had outstanding warrants , which meant LaToya was facing significant jail time .

At this point , another officer arrived , placed LaToya in his squad car and drove her across the street to a church parking lot , where they were met by a detective who was in the neighborhood investigating the Garza murder .
The detective , aware of the disturbance , LaToya 's arrest and her involvement with the " Blanton Boys , " likely saw this as an opportunity to manipulate her and end his fruitless investigation .
After the detective talked with the arresting officer for a few minutes , LaToya was taken to the homicide office for questioning .
According to sworn testimony by LaToya , the detective fed her information about how he thought Garza was murdered .
He told her that eyewitnesses had already implicated her and Robert in the killing , and said if she did n't sign a statement against either Robert or Reggie , she would be charged with murder -- meaning she would give birth to her child in prison and , ultimately , lose custody .
Of course , there were no eyewitnesses .
But LaToya was scared for her life and the life of her baby , so she signed a statement saying that she heard Reggie bragging about killing his friend Carlos that day .
At trial , Mayberry recanted her statement and testified that she was threatened with capital murder charges .
Almost comically , LaToya 's original statement , which was typed by the detective , compared Reggie to Tupac Shakur -- an obvious attempt to deal with the description of the initial suspect ( who was not said to look like Tupac , but was wearing a 2 Pac necklace ) .
After the statement was signed , LaToya 's charges of assault on a public servant and failure to produce I.D , as well as her outstanding warrants , were all suddenly dropped , and she was sent home from the homicide office .
She never saw a jail cell .
When the arresting officer was questioned at Reggie 's trial about what happened to the charges , he said he did n't know .
Even with Mayberry 's coerced statement , investigators needed one more person to point the finger at Reggie to shore up their case .
So the detective called up Robert Blanton and asked him to come to his office so they could talk about a murder .
The officer assured Robert that he was n't a suspect in the case , and even sent a squad car to pick him up .
According to Robert 's testimony , upon arriving at the homicide office , the detective changed his story and told Robert that if he did n't sign a statement against his brother , not only would he get locked up on murder charges , but his pregnant girlfriend would be locked up as well .
Just like LaToya , Robert was terrified and signed the statement .
Just like LaToya , Robert recanted his statement at trial - - a statement that , again , was typed by the detective , and not only used terms that were n't part of Robert 's vocabulary , but also listed his age and Social Security number incorrectly , and placed the scene of the murder at a different location than the Stepping Stone Apartments .
Despite these inconsistencies , the detective had what he needed .
On April 14 , Reginald Blanton -- at the age of 18 - - was arrested for the murder of his friend Carlos Garza .
The Trial
Civics classes and our introduction through popular television series like Cops teach us that all suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law .
In reality , a defendant is presumed guilty .
After all , he would n't be there sitting at that table unless he had done something wrong , would he ?
In the case of Carlos Garza 's murder , Reginald Blanton was sitting at the defense table despite the fact that not a single shred of physical evidence connected him to the crime .
In fact , the only physical evidence investigators had come up with should have ruled out Reggie altogether .
When Carlos 's door was kicked in , a shoe print was left behind .
Also taken into evidence were the shoes Reggie wore the day of the murder .
The problem for the prosecution is that Reggie 's shoes were two sizes smaller than the footprint on the door , and the tread patterns clearly did n't match .
Though Blanton 's court - appointed trial lawyers were aware of this fact , they refused to bring it up in court .
We may live in the age of CSI , but in the real world , many defendants are charged and convicted not based on objective forensic evidence , but rather on coerced confessions , jailhouse snitches and unreliable eyewitness testimony .
Speaking of jailhouse snitches , one always seems to turn up in cases where actual evidence is scant , and they are rewarded handsomely for their information .
In Reggie 's case , no murder weapon was ever found , and there were no eyewitness accounts , so the prosecution found a complete stranger to testify that Blanton had bragged to him about the murder .
For his part in sending Reggie to the death chamber , the snitch received a one - year , time - served deal for a number of felony cases pending in several counties and states .
The fact that things like this remain legal stands as further evidence that the so - called justice system in this country is n't interested in putting the right person behind bars -- just in putting someone behind bars .
With the three coerced statements in hand , prosecutors made their case that Blanton had not only killed Garza , that he'd done so while robbing him of jewelry , making the charge capital murder , punishable by death .
When Reggie testified that the jewelry he supposedly stole from Carlos was , in fact , his , the prosecution scoffed .
When a mutual friend , Ronald Marshall , produced photographs of Reggie wearing the jewelry two - and - a - half months prior to Carlos ' death , the prosecution 's story changed : Carlos lent the jewelry to Reggie , but Reggie gave it back to Carlos , and then went back and stole it .
The prosecutors never explained why Reggie would go through the trouble of killing his good friend in order to take jewelry he had been lent weeks before .
But they did n't need to -- Reggie was sitting at that table , so he must be the guy who did it .
The Texas Shuffle
Prosecutors do not like Black people on juries .
As recently as 1986 , it was legal to strike potential jurors simply for being Black .
The U.S. Supreme Court stepped in and tried to change that , but prosecutors still have tactics to keep African Americans off juries , and in Reggie 's case , they pulled out all the stops .
First , when they saw too many Blacks in the front of the jury pool , they requested ( and were granted ) three " jury shuffles . "
This maneuver is an obscure rule that only exists in Texas .
Basically , it allows lawyers on both sides an unchecked pass to judge prospective jurors primarily based on their skin color or gender .
Despite the legal status of the jury shuffle in Texas , there have been cases where it was ruled discriminatory by federal courts .
In June 2006 , for instance , the high court cited the jury shuffle as one of the discriminatory tools used by prosecutors in a 19 - year - old Dallas County death penalty case it overturned .
Even in Blanton 's case , the federal courts agreed that the shuffle was unacceptable discrimination -- but shockingly , did nothing to fix the situation .
The three shuffles by prosecutors successfully moved most of the African Americans to the back of the line , making them unlikely even to be interviewed to serve since a jury is usually found before complete panel is interviewed .
In this case , jury selection did make it to the Blacks in the pool .
But the prosecutor found excuses , supposedly having nothing to do with race , to strike all of them .
The courts went along with this as well , and as a result , there was not a single African American on Reggie 's jury .
With their African American - free jury set , prosecutors argued their case with the only evidence they had : coerced statements from Robert , LaToya and the jailhouse snitch , and testimony that Reggie had pawned some jewelry for about $ 80 shortly after Carlos 's death ( some of which he was wearing in those photographs the prosecutors were stunned to be presented with ) .
Even with this thin evidence , the jury found Reggie guilty and sentenced him to death .
In reality , Reggie never had a chance .
He could n't depend on the lawyers that the rich and middle class retain .
His only hope , like the hopes of other poor people , lay with often - incompetent appointed counsel or over - worked public defenders .
You Have the Right to Be Ignored
Death row in Texas is where people are sent to die , and the conditions are perfect for it .
The cells are small and dingy .
The inmates are kept in solitary confinement 23 hours of each day .
They are treated poorly and fed worse than animals .
Reginald Blanton , however , has refused to die in his cell .
" One thing is for certain , " he says .
" I will never give up , nor will I stop being a voice for my brothers and sisters on death row .
I know who I am and my value to my community , and will fight this to the end . "
And he has done just that .
Reggie personally presented his court - appointed appellate attorney , James Scott Sullivan , with approximately a dozen critical issues in the categories of : wrongfully admitted evidence , prosecutorial misconduct , perjured testimony , ineffective assistance of counsel , mitigating evidence , insufficient investigation and actual innocence .
He followed up with letters , begging his lawyer to file appeals , but his pleas fell on deaf ears .
( Sullivan also failed to return phone calls for this story . )
After realizing his efforts with his attorney were getting him nowhere , Reggie compiled carbon copies of all the letters he sent to his court - appointed lawyer and mailed a 50 - page filing to the appellate court himself , notifying the court of Sullivan 's refusal to represent him , while requesting for the court to hear his ignored issues .
The court also ignored his plea .
Finally , in a last ditch effort to have his interests represented in his appeal , Reggie sent the same filing to the American Bar Association , which is supposed to investigate claims of professional misconduct among lawyers .
After viewing the complaint , the ABA stated , " If your case involved a court - appointed attorney , court appointments are exclusively under the authority of the appointing cour , and the Board cannot take any action to remove or replace a court - appointed attorney . "
Ironically , this response placed Reggie right back in the same court that was ignoring him .
The Eleventh Hour
Despite the glaring lack of evidence and court - acknowledged racial discrimination in jury selection , the blood - soaked wheels of Texas justice continue to steam forward .
Now , with less than a month left until Reginald Blanton is scheduled to be poisoned with lethal chemicals that have been deemed too cruel to use on dogs , the governor of Texas is the only man who has the jurisdiction to save his life .
However , history has proven that elected officials in Texas are either too scared or too callous to step up on their own .
Justice will only come from forcing the governor 's hand through media exposure and public outcry .
One woman who knows this as well as anyone is Reggie 's mother Anna Terrell .
At a recent rally to save Reggie 's life , she pleaded with Gov. Rick Perry , " At least have my son 's case looked into before it 's too late . "
But the state of Texas is n't interested in looking into cases .
Once they have their verdicts , no matter how they get them , they 're satisfied that justice has been served .
Just ask the presiding judge on the highest court for all criminal matters in Texas .
Sharon Keller of the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals has clearly stated that " finality [ of a judgment ] is important , " and that she is " absolutely " bound to follow the law even if it means an unjust result .
Translated , this means that if someone has a strong innocence claim , but is also out of appeals or is being ignored by a court - appointed attorney , he or she is out of luck .
Does that sound like justice ?
What if that someone was you ?
In this case , that someone is 28 - year - old Reginald Blanton , a real person with a mother who loves him ; a real person with dreams and aspirations ; a writer ; a self - taught law student ; a flame of inspiration .
How can we , in good conscience , let that flame be extinguished , knowing there is even the possibility that he is innocent ?
The simple answer is : we can't .
Now , we just have to convince one more person that Reggie 's life is worth something .
Hopefully , Mr. Perry is listening .
President Barack Obama has introduced a concept into the U.S. health - care debate that " no one should go bankrupt because they got sick . "
Most Canadians listen to this rhetoric and smile , secure in the knowledge that for them this issue was solved a long time ago .
But for some Canadians this platitude is as relevant as it is to their American cousins .
They are going broke in the land of universal health care because someone in their family is sick .
My family and I moved to the United States a year ago , following employment opportunities that promptly vanished like spring flowers in the blizzard of the financial system meltdown .
Left precariously clinging to tenuous health - care insurance , we received an involuntary crash course in the very insecurities of being American that fuel the current U.S. health - care debate .
Yet financially , when we balance our chequebook every month , we feel we are more secure and less likely to fail than we were before we left Canada .
How can this be ?
Well , we have a daughter with autism , a disorder that now strikes at least one in 100 children , seemingly at random .
It can not be tested for or prevented .
Autism can prevent children from learning how to communicate , to socialize , to control their own body movements and functions .
Behavioural therapy is the only proven and effective treatment .
In Canada , this therapy is provided by a patchwork quilt of provincial programs , all of which are resource constrained .
Rationing of care is the result .
In Ontario , where we used to live , children proceed unpredictably from wait list to therapy , sometimes never actually receiving any help at all .
Once they reach school age , they are dumped into a system that actually prevents their trained therapists from helping them to learn by barring them from the school building .
In this situation , many Canadian parents empty pocketbooks , mortgage houses and exhaust the kindness of relatives in a scramble to personally provide the behavioural therapy that helps to unlock the minds of their children from their uncooperative bodies .
A disproportionate number live below the poverty line .
Some go bankrupt .
It is hardly a glowing example of the universal care Canadians so smugly proclaim to their American cousins .
But wait .
Now we are the American cousins .
What a difference this makes .
Before school started , our daughter received a complete program of scientifically validated behavioural therapy , arranged by the state of Pennsylvania , with no mentions of wait lists , benchmarked cut - offs or payment .
Now in kindergarten , she receives in - school services and support from therapists with the same training as those who are barred from schools in Ontario .
How can these outcomes be so different for the same child when the clinical diagnosis used as a basis for the provisioning of services is precisely the same ?
I believe the answer lies in the very basis of our two societies .
Canada is founded on principles of peace , order and good government .
In Ontario , this translates into a benchmarks program that will withdraw therapeutic services from children with autism who do not show a sufficiently timely response to therapy .
It is apparently a bureaucratic issue of the proper management of government spending .
If presented with a young Helen Keller , one wonders whether Ontario government - provided therapy services would be withdrawn .
Would Keller ever have achieved her eureka moment if , instead of persistently holding Keller 's hand under the pump , her therapist had been told to move on to another child with a more visible return on therapeutic investment ?
The recent media coming - out party of Carly Fleischmann , who showed mixed indications of therapeutic progress for almost 10 years before flowering into a fearsomely articulate advocate for autistic children , is a local and compelling embodiment of the argument that this management - efficiency approach to providing autism services is misguided .
Counterintuitively , things are different in the United States .
A nation founded upon the principles of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness brings a persistent faith in the individual to the question of how to provide for autistic children .
A simple trip of a moving truck has transformed the status of our daughter from that of an inconvenient provincial liability to that of a valued citizen with the right to demand assistance in her essential pursuit of happiness .
In Pennsylvania , her very existence demands that supports be provided , with the full force of the law and court system standing behind her .
These differences in the approach to the treatment of autistic children between our two nations call out the fact that the Canadian system is not the perfectly formed jewel it is often made out to be in comparison with the American system .
Families with children with autism should not go bankrupt .
But in Ontario and other Canadian provinces , many do .
By allowing such bankruptcies to occur , policy at both the federal and provincial level reveals a hole in the safety net large enough for entire families to fall through .
It is a hole that America apparently started to patch up some time ago .
Canadians have some work to do on their own safety net where it concerns helping and supporting children with autism and their families .
There is no time like the present for that work to get started .

At the dawn of the Internet age the domain registry and registrar were one and the same .
The registry managed the domain space and also sold domains as a registrar to anyone that wanted one .
It 's a practice that disappeared in 1998 with the creation of ICANN and the break - up of the integrated Network Solutions Registry / Registrar .
While domain registrars and registries have now been separated for a decade , with a new generation of Top Level Domains ( TLDs ) soon to be approved , integrated registries may soon return .
Opponents of the integrated registry registrar argue that they restrict competition , while advocates argue that it will increase competition .
" Network Solutions is supportive of the current ICANN requirements for existing TLDs which requires that registrars and registries maintain their legal separation , " Jon Nevett , senior vice president of Policy & Ethics for Network Solutions told InternetNews.com .
" With respect to new TLDs , Network Solutions has advocated a middle - ground " position between those who argue that registrars may not sell new TLDs of affiliated registries and those who argue that the separation requirement be eliminated altogether . "
In Network Solutions middle - ground position , registrars would be permitted to sell new TLDs of affiliated registries up to a certain amount of perhaps up to 100,000 .
Nevett added that once the allocated number of names has been registered , the affiliated registrar would not be able to accept new registrations .
" This proposal would generate more competition by allowing smaller registries to get distribution through an affiliated registrar and would maintain certain safeguards , " Nevett said .
Opponents of the integrated registry / registrar approach include domain infrastructure vendor Afilias .
Afilias does the technical management for multiple domains including .org , .info and .mobi .
While Afilias could financially benefit from being both the registry and the registrar for a TLD , Brian Cute , VP Discovery Services at Afilias told InternetNews.com , the company is not in favor of such a setup .
From Afilias ' point of view , enabling a registry to act as a registrar and then sell their own domains is the equivalent of selling direct to the public .
The current system does n't allow for that and enforces a separation between the registry and registrars .
An argument against registry / registrar
According to Cute , there were solid reasons back in 1998 why ICANN divided up the Network Solutions monopoly and in his view the same reasons exist today .
" The registry gets access to a lot of data about domain names , who is looking them up , traffic and other unique and commercially sensitive data that a registrar could use to its advantage , " Cute said .
" So ICANN originally figured they should prohibit the registry to selling its own TLD because if it did it could discriminate against other registrars and use that data to identify high value domains and raise prices , and that 's not the competitive effect that ICANN was looking for . "
An ICANN spokesperson was not available for comment by press time .
For its part , Network Solutions does n't see the same issues about changing cross ownership rules increasing bad acts by registries .
" While that may be a concern , recent history does not prove the concern , " Nevett said .
" For example , Hostway Corporation operates the .PRO registry and also operates a leading .
PRO registrar .
Even with these affiliations , there have never been any allegations of domain tasting , front running , or other improper conduct .
" Similar situations exist for .
CAT , .MUSEUM , .COOP , and .
ME .
Certainly , if abusive practices were to occur , this would be an issue for ICANN to address from a compliance standpoint . "
ICANN is currently scheduled to provide an update on its next round of TLDs at its meeting in Seoul , Korea at the end of October .
The meeting will be the first major ICANN event since the new Affirmation deal with the US government that has ICANN operating without direct US oversight .
For opponents of the integrated registrar registries the meeting will be key to get their point across .
At the core , they argue it's about maintaining the checks and balances that have helped the Internet for the last ten years .
" What we 're saying is that by taking away a long standing policy of separation and allowing a vertically integrated registrar to sell domains , what you are doing is you are removing the checks and balances that have been in place to mitigate and minimize the abuses that already take place , " Alexa Raad CEO of the .org registry told InternetNews.com .
" Without the checks and balances it will be hard to discern the abuse because you do n't have anything to check the data against . "
A federal judge orders the FBI interview of Dick Cheney , former Vice President of the United States , be released to the public .
This is the first of many " releases " that will eventually come out .
A federal judge ruled Thursday that the FBI must publicly reveal much of its notes from an interview with former Vice President Dick Cheney during the investigation into who leaked the identity of a CIA operative .
Cheney agreed to be interviewed by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald in June 2004 during the investigation of the leak of Valerie Plame 's identity after her husband publicly criticized the Bush administration .
Both the Bush and Obama administrations said they wanted to keep the interview confidential because future presidents , vice presidents and their senior staff may not cooperate with criminal investigations if they know what they say could became public .
But U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled there was no justification to withhold the entire 67 pages of FBI records documenting Fitzgerald 's interview since the Plame leak investigation has concluded .
He said that limited parts could be withheld to protect national security and private communications between the president and vice president .

( Tom Friedman ) President Trump has made it unmistakably clear in recent weeks  and even more crystal clear at the Tuesday debate  that there are only two choices before voters on Nov. 3  and electing Joe Biden is not one of them .
The president has told us in innumerable ways that either he will be re-elected or he will delegitimize the vote by claiming that all mail - in ballots  a time - honored tradition that has ushered Republicans and Democrats into office and has been used by Trump himself  are invalid .
Trumps motives could not be more transparent .
If he does not win the Electoral College , hell muddy the results so that the outcome can be decided only by the Supreme Court or the House of Representatives ( where each state delegation gets one vote ) .
Trump has advantages in both right now , which he has boasted about for the past week .
I cant say this any more clearly :
Our democracy is in terrible danger  more danger than it has been since the Civil War , more danger than after Pearl Harbor , more danger than during the Cuban missile crisis and more danger than during Watergate .
To get back a semblance of unity and sanity , Biden has to win .
And that is why I have only one answer to every question now : Vote for Biden  do it by mail early if you must , but if you can , please , put on a mask and do it in person .
If enough of us do that , Biden can win outright with the votes cast on Election Day , instead of waiting for all the mail - in ballots to be counted , thereby giving time for Trump and Fox News to muddy the outcome .
So help register someone to vote for Joe Biden .
Phone bank for Joe Biden .
Talk to your neighbor about Joe Biden .
Volunteer for Joe Biden .
Drive someone to the polls to vote for Joe Biden .
Magyarul is működik az a nemrég felfedezett hirdetésgyilkos módszer , amely tragédiára , katasztrófára utaló szavak becsempészésével eltünteti a gmailes levelek mellől a Google hirdetéseit .
Ne próbálja ki !
Írjon saját magának egy néhány szavas , angol vagy magyar nyelvű , semleges hangvételű emailt , majd tekintse meg ugyanezt a levelet a Gmail webes felületén .
A levél melletti , jobb oldali hasábban nagy valószínűséggel tematikus hirdetéseket lát majd : ezeket a Google helyezi el azoknak a szavaknak az alapján , amelyek az emailben szerepelnek .
Ha például azt írja : „ Akarod -e , hogy te is megkapd az asztalosom számát , aki kiváló bútoripari szakember ? ” , a Google hirdetési rendszere a levél mellett megjeleníti egy áramkörtervező cég , egy burkolóanyagbolt , egy lakberendező szoftver és egy IQ - teszt hirdetését , mint az az alábbi ábrán látható .
Van hirdetés
Ha szomorkás hangulatú verset idéz levelében , például hogy „ Letéptem ezt a hangaszálat / Már tudhatod az ősz halott ” , egy devizakeresked ő cég reklámja jelenik meg az email mellett – azt ne kérdezze , miért , valahogy így alakult .
Van hirdetés
A hirdetések kiszűrésére pompás szoftvereket találtak már ki , ott van rögtön az AdBlock , ami a gmailes reklámokkal is elbánik , de ha valaki nem akar a telepítéssel bajlódni , létezik egyszer űbb módszer is .
Egy kaliforniai digitális művész , a Berkeley és a Stanford egyetemek óraadó tanára , Joe McKay rájött , hogy ha beírja az emailbe a suicide , death , 9/11 és a murder szavakat ( öngyilkosság , halál , 9/11 és gyilkosság ) , a Gmail egyáltalán nem jelenít meg hirdetéseket a levél mellett .
És valóban :
Nincs hirdetés
McKay nem elégedett meg ennyivel , tovább kísérletezett , és kiderült , hogy ha túl hosszú az üzenet , a Gmail újra kiteszi a hirdetéseket ; és hogy ezt a jelenséget újabb borzasztó szavak beillesztésével lehet elkerülni .
„ Hosszas tesztelés után rájöttem , hogy az email további részében minden 167 .

Működik viszont az a módszer , hogy a feladó a háttérszínnel megegyező színre ( alapesetben fehérre ) állítja a betűszínt , de ez még ijesztőbb lehet , ha a címzett kijelöli az email szövegét , és előtűnik a borzalom .

Officials said the East Asian nations would carry out a feasibility study for a freed trade zone
Asian leaders meeting in Thailand are discussing plans to " lead the world " by forming an EU - style community by 2015 .
Japan 's Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama argued nations should take advantage of the region 's more rapid recovery from the recession than the West .
" It would be meaningful for us to have the aspiration that East Asia is going to lead the world , " he said .
Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( Asean ) are meeting other regional heads at Cha - Am beach resort .
Increased integration
The community would involve the 10 - members of Asean with regional partners China , Japan , South Korea , India , Australia and New Zealand , Japanese officials have said .
Officials said the East Asian nations would carry out a feasibility study for a huge free trade zone .
But there was debate at the summit over whether the community would also include the United States .
Increased integration has been a recurring theme of the meetings in Thailand , as the region seeks to capitalise on its recovery from financial turmoil .
On Friday , the leaders officially launched a new human rights watchdog .
Correspondents say the new commission is in part a response to criticism that the region is soft on human rights abuses by member nations such as Burma .
But observers have queried whether it will have sufficient powers to make a real difference .
Anti-government protesters forced the cancellation of the previous attempt to hold the summit in April .
Around 18,000 troops and dozens of armoured vehicles have been deployed to ensure this summit passes off smoothly - with another 18,000 on standby or on duty in Bangkok .

Advertisement US President Barack Obama has said he was " surprised and deeply humbled " to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , less than 10 months into his presidency .
Speaking at the White House hours after the Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee named him as a surprise winner , he said the award should be a " call to action " .
The world faced challenges that " cannot be met by one person or by one nation alone , " Mr Obama said .
The committee said he won for efforts to boost diplomacy and co-operation .
" Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world 's attention and given its people hope for a better future , " the Norwegian committee said in a statement .
" His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world 's population . "
Long - term goals Standing in the Rose Garden to make his first public statement since being woken early by aides bringing news of the award , Mr Obama stressed that his win was just the beginning of his work .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
Why did he win ?... because he 's not President George W Bush and has steered American foreign policy , or at least its strategy if not its aims , in an opposite direction
Mark Mardell
BBC North America editor
Read Mark 's thoughts in full
He said he did not feel he deserved to be in the company of some of the " transformative figures " who had previously received the award .
Some of his aims , particularly the goal of universal nuclear disarmament , would be difficult to achieve even within his lifetime , let alone his presidency , Mr Obama said .
And he sought to deflect some of the global surprise at his win , describing the award as " affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations " .
" I know that throughout history the Nobel Peace Prize has not just been used to honour specific achievements , " he said .
" It 's also been used as a means to give momentum to a set of causes .
And that is why I will accept this award as a call to action , a call for all nations to confront the common challenges of the 21st Century . "
The White House has said that the cash prize that accompanies the award will be distributed among several charities .
Public bemused
There were a record 205 nominations for this year 's peace prize .
Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai and Chinese dissident Hu Jia had been among the favourites .
ANALYSIS Paul Reynolds
BBC News , London
The award is certainly unexpected and might be regarded as more of an encouragement for intentions than a reward for achievements .
After all , the president has been in office for a little over eight months and he might hope to serve eight years .
His ambition for a world free of nuclear weapons is one that is easier to declare than to achieve and a climate control agreement has yet to be reached .
Indeed , the citation indicates that it is President Obama 's world view that attracted the Nobel committee - that diplomacy should be founded " on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world 's population " .
Obama rewarded for world view Instead the committee chose Mr Obama , who was inaugurated less than two weeks before the 1 February nomination deadline .
While there was support for the decision , notably from world leaders , many others expressed scepticism .
In the US the chairman of the Republican National Committee , Michael Steele , asked a simple question : " What has President Obama actually accomplished ? "
Attributing Mr Obama 's win to his " star power " , Mr Steele said it was " unfortunate " he " outshined tireless advocates who have made real achievements working towards peace and human rights " .
Iran 's foreign minister said the decision to give the award was taken too " hastily " .
" A good timing for the award would be when US troops have pulled out of Afghanistan and Iraq and the United States is standing up for the rights of the Palestinian people , " Manouchehr Mottaki told the Mehr news agency .
But he said that if winning the prize encouraged the US president to reject the " warmongering " policies of previous administrations , Iran had no opposition to it .
A large majority of remarks from BBC viewers , listeners and website users also expressed surprise .
Senior Democratic figures rebuffed Mr Steele 's remarks , with former Vice - President Al Gore , a joint recipient of the award in 2007 , calling Mr Obama 's win " extremely well deserved " .

" I think that much of what he has accomplished already is going to be far more appreciated in the eyes of history , " Mr Gore said .
But spokesmen from anti-US Islamist groups such as the Taliban and Hamas focussed on the present , saying they had seen no evidence yet of improvements in security for people in their regions and as such opposed the award .
' New climate '
Since taking office in January , President Obama has pursued an ambitious international agenda including a push for peace in the Middle East and negotiations over Iran 's nuclear programme .
Asked why the prize had been awarded to Mr Obama less than a year after he took office , Nobel Committee head Thorbjoern Jagland said : " It was because we would like to support what he is trying to achieve " .
He specifically mentioned Mr Obama 's work to strengthen international institutions and work towards a world free of nuclear arms .
The statement from the Nobel Committee said Mr Obama had " created a new climate in international politics " .
THE SELECTION PROCESS
Those qualified to nominate candidates include members of national governments , international judiciary , academics and previous prize winners Five Norwegians are chosen by Norway 's parliament to sit on the Nobel Committee
The committee compiles a shortlist of between five and 20 candidates
The shortlist is considered by the Nobel Institute 's permanent advisers , mainly Norwegian academics The Nobel Committee chooses the winner Details of the nominations and selection process are kept secret for 50 years
World reacts to Obama peace prize Profile : Barack Obama
However , critics say he has failed to make breakthroughs .
Domestically , Mr Obama has been working to tackle an economic crisis and win support for healthcare reform .
Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa , a former winner , said the prize was a way of encouraging the US leader early in his presidency .
Mr Obama is the first US president to win the prize since former US President Jimmy Carter in 2002 .
Theodore Roosevelt won the prize in 1906 and Woodrow Wilson won it in 1919 .
The prize was invented by the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite Alfred Nobel , and was first awarded in 1901 .
As Sweden was at the time united with Norway , Nobel designated the parliament in Norway to elect the peace prize committee .
Swedish academies are responsible for other prizes .
The prize - giving ceremony for the peace award is due to take place on 10 December in the Norwegian capital , Oslo .
Mr Obama has indicated he will attend .

Following a demonstration by Intel of an advanced new optical data port called Light Peak , a new report says Apple actually brought the concept to Intel and that the new standard will play " a hugely important role " in upcoming Apple products .
Engadget reported the news first , based on " an extremely reliable source . "
The site said it reviewed evidence that Apple began talks with Intel in 2007 to develop a new cabling standard with the capacity to handle " massive amounts of data " and replace a variety of existing ports , including USB , FireWire , and DisplayPort .
The article said initial conversation and fleshing out of the Light Peak standard began between Steve Jobs and Intel CEO Paul Otellini .
Apple expressed a need for a single port and that optical signaling made the most sense .
Apple is expected to incorporate Light Peak quickly and will use it to replace other legacy ports , much as it did with USB on the original iMac , albeit on a smaller scale .
Engadget said that based on what it saw , it expects Apple to roll out the new connector on machines next fall , replacing existing ports for networking , display , and general peripheral use .
Within another year , it expects Apple to begin rolling out a low power version suitable for use in mobile devices such as the iPhone , iPod touch , and a version of the tablet device Apple is expected to bring to market early next year .
Light Peak uses optical rather than electrical signaling to achieve an initial throughput of 10 Gbps ( " you could transfer a full - length Blu - Ray movie in less than 30 seconds " Intel says ) .
That 's similar to high - end optical Fibre Channel or HDMI , and ten times faster than Gigibit Ethernet , more than twenty times faster than USB 2.0 , and three times faster than eSATA / SATA 300 .
Within a decade , Intel expects to achieve speeds of 100 Gbps .
Unlike bulky copper cables ( like HDMI ) , Light Peak achieves its speeds over fibre optic strands the size of a human hair .
And unlike existing ports focused on solving a specific problem , such as USB for simple peripherals , DisplayPort for video , SATA for disk drives , and Ethernet for networking , Light Peak can handle multiple protocols over a single cable .
Replacing nearly all of the external ports on existing notebooks or mobile devices with Light Peak would enable a new generation of industrial designs without sacrificing features , as the MacBook Air had to do to achieve its thin outline .
It would also enable users to run a single cable to an external display to provide video , audio , touch input , and peripheral expansion that included blazing network performance and high speed disk access .
Gorki Águila is blunt in his assessment of Fidel Castro 's half century of revolution : " Communism is a failure .
A total failure .
Please , leftists of the world - improve your capitalism !
Do n't choose communism ! " Águila , a Havana resident , wears homemade anti-government t- shirts , frequently denounces the Castro brothers as geriatric tyrants , and heads up perhaps Cuba 's only explicitly political punk band , Porno Para Ricardo .
And because of his stubborn belief in free speech , he is routinely arrested on charges of " social dangerousness . "
Tired of his anti-regime music , Cuban authorities made the rare decision to grant Águila a visa to travel abroad , perhaps hoping that he would n't return .
In September , Reason.tv's Michael C. Moynihan caught up with Águila on the Washington , D.C. leg of his American promotional tour to talk about his music , the origins of Porno Para Ricardo , and how long it takes to get Led Zeppelin records in a totalitarian society .

It ’s a sausage lover ’s world out there , right ?
Especially at this time of year , nothing goes better with a great cold beer .
The crisp crunch of that first juicy bite , the perfect blend of fresh ground meat redolent with toasted spices and pungent herbs .
Granted , you can increasingly find some pretty good packaged sausages .
But for the true fan , nothing compares to the texture and flavors to be found in great homemade sausage .
Sausage making is an art that spans almost every regional and ethnic cuisine , a craft carefully honed and perfected over thousands of years .
For the first - time sausage - maker , the process can seem a bit mysterious .
Not to mention daunting .
But make your own sausage , and you might never go back to commercial again .
Make your own , and you ’re limited only by your imagination .
Choose what kinds of meat you want to use , and flavor the sausage to suit your tastes .
Best of all ?
Made from scratch , the sausage is your creation and you know exactly what ’s gone into it -- no mystery ingredients here .
Advertisement
Meat variations
Start with something like a simple , country - style chicken sausage .
Combine just a few ingredients , and the sausage is ready to go .
It does n’t need to be cased ; simply form the loose sausage into patties and fry them to order .
Studded with apples and onions , and scented with cinnamon and chopped sage , it ’s wonderfully fragrant and tender -- the perfect breakfast sausage .
Or riff on a classic , such as bratwurst .
It ’s a rustic pork and veal sausage ground with a delicate balance of flavorings and spices .
Case the sausage into plump , tender links , and they ’re ready to go , whether you ’re serving them up for Oktoberfest or grilling a batch for your next pre-game cookout .
Or maybe get creative with a bold and spicy sausage , like merguez .
This lamb - based sausage gets its bright color and assertive flavor from fresh and dried peppers and chiles .
Grill it , and serve it on its own , or use it to spice soups , stews and chilis .
Advertisement
While the ingredients are basic , sausage - making does take some special equipment , which is available at kitchen stores or online .
Consider purchasing a food grinder .
Though not essential ( you can ask your butcher to grind the meat for you ) , a grinder enables you to flavor and season the sausage mixture before it ’s ground .
Hand - cranked and motorized grinders are available , as are grinder attachments for heavy - duty stand mixers .
You can also grind the meat with a food processor , but it ’s easy to over - heat and over - grind the meat , reducing it to a paste .
You also might want a sausage stuffer if you plan on casing your sausage .
Tube stuffer attachments are available for most meat grinders , which are great for small batches of sausages .
Stand - alone stuffers tend to be a little more expensive but are a good investment if you plan on making homemade sausage frequently , or more than a few pounds at a time .
Sausage - making should not be rushed .
Allow yourself enough time to complete the entire process , from purchasing your ingredients to stuffing the links , in one day .
Sausages can be made from almost any meat , but the most common is pork .
Pork is versatile , inexpensive , tender when ground and full of juicy flavor .
Pork typically stays moist throughout cooking and lends itself to any of a number of flavorings .
Cheaper , tougher cuts of meat , such as the shoulder , or “ Boston butt , ” often work best .
Advertisement
An integral part of any sausage recipe is fat .
Fat may often gets a bum rap , but here it lends flavor and gives a smooth , juicy texture .
Recipes may vary from about 15 % to 30 % fat .
This may seem high , but it ’s comparable to most commercial ground hamburger and lower than some commercial sausage , which can contain up to 50 % fat .
Pork fat is used most in sausage making , regardless of the type of lean meat used .
Back fat ( or fatback ) , the white fat that runs along the back of the pig , is often recommended .
Keep it cold
When you ’re ready to start , cut the meat and fat into manageable pieces , about 1 - inch cubes , toss them with seasonings and spices and then cover and refrigerate the mixture for up to two hours so the flavorings marry with the meat .
Advertisement
Half an hour or so before grinding , place the mixture in the freezer ; it should chill almost to the point of freezing .
Keeping the meat thoroughly chilled is essential .
If the meat warms , the protein and fats in the sausage can separate , causing the sausage to break when it cooks , resulting in a coarse , grainy texture .
It ’s also a good idea to chill the grinder and stuffer attachments before using .
Keep the sausage mixture well - chilled at all times , and make sure to grind it into a bowl set over ice .
If the grinder blade clogs during grinding , be sure to clean it quickly to prevent the sausage mixture from warming .
When the sausage is ground , knead the mixture with your hands .
Michael Ruhlman and Brian Polcyn , in their book “ Charcuterie , ” compare mixing ground sausage to kneading bread dough ; working the mixture develops structure .
The final mixture should be cohesive , with a slightly sticky texture .
After the sausage is combined , test for flavoring and seasoning .
Break off a bit of the sausage and make a small patty , then pan - fry it and taste it .
When you ’re happy with the flavor , wrap the loose sausage tightly in plastic wrap ( a large log shape works well ; unwrap the log and slice patties as needed ) , or prepare the stuffer to case the sausage into links ( if stuffing , plan to do this soon after kneading , before the sausage has a chance to “ set up , ” or stiffen ) .
Advertisement
Traditionally , sausages are stuffed into natural casings made from hog , beef or lamb , generally from the intestines .
To prepare the casing for stuffing , remove the length of casing needed for your recipe ( typically 1 to 2 feet of hog casing , or about 4 feet of narrower sheep casing , per pound of sausage ) .
If the casing is packed in salt , place the casing in a bowl of warm water .
Flush the interior with running water to remove all of the salt , then soak the casing in fresh water until it is soft and pliable , about 1 to 2 hours .
If you are using liquid - packed casing , you may need only briefly flush and soak it .
Stuff the sausage according to manufacturer ’s instructions and when the casing is filled , inspect the sausage for any air bubbles and prick them with a pin , then twist the sausage into even - sized links .
Place the sausage on a rack and refrigerate , uncovered , for a few hours or up to overnight to set up .
Uncooked fresh sausage generally will keep , tightly covered , two to three days refrigerated and up to two months frozen .
After it sets , go ahead and cook the sausage .
Loose sausage can be cooked simply by pan-frying it in patties or by crumbling it into a larger dish .
With cased sausage , cooking can be a bit more tricky .
It may be tempting to throw those beautiful links directly on the grill , but that cooks them unevenly , potentially causing the fat to separate , even making them split and burst .
To keep them beautiful , poach them first , just until they ’re cooked through .
This cooks the sausages gently and evenly so they retain their moisture and smooth texture .
Now all you need is that cold beer .

Fiona Jennings , a senior employee with a high - street retailing chain , is 37 and does not have children , was one of the women who took part in the survey .
“ I made a conscious decision not to have children and that was the right decision for me .
My career has always been as important as my home life .

My employers agreed to give me seven months off as an unpaid sabbatical .

Any perturbation , however , such as a bad soldering job on a splice , can cause resistance and heat the cable and cause it to lose its superconductivity in what physicists call a “ quench . ”
Which is what happened on Sept. 19 , when the junction between two magnets vaporized in a shower of sparks , soot and liberated helium .
Technicians have spent most of the last year cleaning up and inspecting thousands of splices in the collider .
About 5,000 will have to be redone , Steve Myers , head of CERN ’s accelerator division , said in an interview .
The exploding splices have diverted engineers ’ attention from the mystery of the underperforming magnets .
Before the superconducting magnets are installed , engineers “ train ” each one by ramping up its electrical current until the magnet fails , or “ quenches . ”
Thus the magnet gradually grows comfortable with higher and higher current .
All of the magnets for the collider were trained to an energy above seven trillion electron volts before being installed , Dr. Myers said , but when engineers tried to take one of the rings ’ eight sectors to a higher energy last year , some magnets unexpectedly failed .
In an e-mail exchange , Lucio Rossi , head of magnets for CERN , said that 49 magnets had lost their training in the sectors tested and that it was impossible to estimate how many in the entire collider had gone bad .
He said the magnets in question had all met specifications and that the problem might stem from having sat outside for a year before they could be installed .
Retraining magnets is costly and time consuming , experts say , and it might not be worth the wait to get all the way to the original target energy .
“ It looks like we can get to 6.5 relatively easily , ” Dr. Myers said , but seven trillion electron volts would require “ a lot of training . ”
Many physicists say they would be perfectly happy if the collider never got above five trillion electron volts .
If that were the case , said Joe Lykken , a Fermilab theorist who is on one of the CERN collider teams , “ It ’s not the end of the world .
I am not pessimistic at all . ”

Go Senator Al !
Al Franken successfully introduced legislation that denies federal contracts to companies that have policies — anywhere in the world — that punish employees for complaining about rape or discrimination on the job .
This is in response to a KBR / Halliburton employee in Iraq who was drugged and gang - raped by co-workers and denied justice or even medical treatment , then locked in a storage container for 24 hours and told that she 'd lose her job if she left the country to get medical help .
She was also prohibited from suing or seeking criminal justice because her Halliburton contract forbade seeking any justice apart from private arbitration .
Sen . Jeff Sessions ( R - AL ) tried to block the amendment , saying that it was a " a political attack directed at Halliburton . "
Franken replied , " This amendment does not single out a single contractor .
This amendment would defund any contractor that refuses to give a victim of rape their day in court . "
Sessions ' brave defense of the right of private companies to deny justice to drugged and gang - raped employees should not be forgotten .
Truly , the man is a model of moral principle .
[ Franken ] : " The constitution gives everybody the right to due process of law …
And today , defense contractors are using fine print in their contracts do deny women like Jamie Leigh Jones their day in court . …
The victims of rape and discrimination deserve their day in court [ and ]
Congress plainly has the constitutional power to make that happen … "
Appearing with Franken after the vote , an elated Jones expressed her deep appreciation .
" It means the world to me , " she said of the amendment 's passage .
" It means that every tear shed to go public and repeat my story over and over again to make a difference for other women was worth it . "
Franken Wins Bipartisan Support For Legislation Reining In KBR's Treatment Of Rape

On a diet ?
Then put away those sweeteners ... because they may help you GAIN weight
' Opposite effect ' : Sweetener ( above ) is said to help you absorb more glucose
Artificial sweeteners do nothing to help weight loss and could actually cause us to pile on the pounds , scientists say .
Our bodies are unable to distinguish between the calorie - free sugar substitutes widely used in the food industry and the real thing , research suggests .
Artificial sweeteners behave in a similar way to sugar , by activating sensors in the gut which are key to the absorption of glucose .
As a result , the body processes extra sugar – and all the calories that go with it .
For the dieter , it means little or no weight loss .
Over time , it could even lead to extra pounds being put on .
Researcher Soraya Shirazi -Beechey said : ‘ If someone wants to lose weight , I do n’t think artificial sweeteners are going to help .
‘ My recommendation is to eat natural foods , but to eat less of them . ’
The Liverpool University professor studied the processes in the small intestine by which the sugar or glucose from food is absorbed into the bloodstream .
She identified specific cells which detect sugar , releasing hormones essential for its passage through the lining of the gut and into the blood , where it is either burned off or is converted into fat .
Crucially , these cells release the hormones when confronted by artificial sweeteners .
This primes the gut to absorb real sugar .
Prof Shirazi-Beechey said : ‘ Artificial sweetenerscan also activate the glucose sensor and increase the capacity of the intestine to absorb more sugar .
‘ You drink diet cola to stay slim but the reverse is true , because the artificial sweeteners can activate the sensor , so you are taking more glucose from your diet . ’
Drugs which control the sugar sensor cells , leading to more or less entering the bloodstream , could help treat diseases such as diabetes and obesity .

The Glenn Beck advertiser boycott has officially reached the mainstream as the AP ran a story today about the advertiser backlash that Fox News and Glenn Beck are facing after he called President Obama a racist .
Clorox became the latest big name to drop Beck .
The AP story is essentially a rehash of what we have been writing about here at Politicus for the last couple of weeks .
The interesting twist is that Clorox has not only dumped Beck , but has decided not to advertise on any political talk shows , regardless of whether they are liberal or conservative .
A topic that I addressed on Friday when it was announced that Verizon Wireless , was dumping Beck is the potential impact on ad revenue that might come with all of these big name companies dropping him .
The Glenn Beck show draws over 2 million a viewers a day , but without big name advertisers competing for the ad slots during his show , ad revenue will fall .
Advertisements
This boycott wo n’t impact FNC ’s overall revenue as many of the advertisers have simply shifted their ads to other shows on the network , but Beck ’s show , with its massive ratings , is a huge moneymaker for them .
If advertisers are too skittish to run their ads on Beck , it hurts revenue in that time slot .
Plus , the Beck incident is forcing advertisers to take a hard look at whether they want to advertise on controversial programs .
Beck ’s calling Obama a racist could end up hurting liberal and conservative political talk programs if advertisers decide that appealing to those viewers is n’t worth the risk of controversy .
The Sunday morning talk shows play it safe , so I think they are immune from this , but Olbermann , Matthews , O’Reilly , and Hannity could also feel some pain if advertisers decide that political talk shows are n’t worth the risk of some bad publicity .
On Saturday , Sept. 19 , the Indonesian National Police announced that a DNA test has positively identified a man killed Sept. 17 as Noordin Mohammad Top.
Noordin was killed in a raid on a safe - house in the outskirts of Solo , Central Java , that resulted in a prolonged firefight between Indonesian authorities and militants .
Police said four militants were killed in the incident and three more were taken into custody .
( Two of them were arrested before the raid . )
Authorities also recovered a large quantity of explosives during the raid that they believe the militant group was preparing to use in an attack on Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .
Indonesian National Police had reported Sept. 17 that the dead man 's fingerprints matched Noordin's .
But given several inaccurate reports of Noordin 's demise in the past , combined with reports that the body believed to be Noordin's was headless — perhaps due to the explosion of a suicide belt — most observers were waiting for DNA confirmation before removing Noordin 's name from the pinnacle of the organizational chart of Tanzim Qaedat al - Jihad .
Now that Noordin 's name officially has been scratched off the list , big questions emerge : Can Tanzim Qaedat al - Jihad continue without him ?
Can the group be effective as a militant organization ?
And who will step up to fill the void left by Noordin ?
The Importance of Leadership
All three of these questions touch on the issue of leadership .
Without leadership , militant groups wither and / or disintegrate .
Without skilled leadership , militant groups lose their ability to conduct effective attacks .
Quite simply , leadership , skill and professionalism make the difference between a militant group wanting to attack something — i.e. , possessing intent — and the group 's ability to successfully carry out its intended attack — i.e. , its capability .
Although on the surface it might seem like a simple task to find a leader for a militant group , in practice , effective militant leaders are hard to come by .
This is because militant leadership requires a rather broad skill set .
In addition to personal attributes such as ruthlessness , aggressiveness and fearlessness , militant leaders also must be charismatic , intuitive , clever and inspiring .
This last attribute is especially important in an organization that seeks to recruit operatives to conduct suicide attacks .
Additionally , an effective militant leader must be able to recruit and train operatives , enforce operational security , raise funds , plan operations , and then methodically execute the plan while avoiding the security forces constantly hunting the militants down .
The importance of leadership to a militant organization has been wonderfully illustrated by the trajectory of al Qaeda 's franchise in Saudi Arabia .
Under the leadership of Abdel Aziz al - Muqrin the Saudi al Qaeda franchise was extremely busy in 2003 and 2004 .
It carried out a number of high - profile attacks inside the kingdom and put everyone from the Saudi monarchy to multinational oil companies in a general state of panic .
With bombings , ambushes and beheadings , it seemed as if Saudi Arabia was on its way to becoming the next Iraq .
Following the June 2004 death of al - Muqrin , however , the organization began to flounder .
The succession of leaders appointed to replace al - Muqrin lacked his operational savvy , and each one proved ineffective at best .
( Saudi security forces quickly killed several of them . )
Following the February 2006 attack against the oil facility at Abqaiq , the group atrophied even further , succeeding in carrying out one more attack , an amateurish small - arms assault in February 2007 against a group of French tourists .
The disorganized remaining jihadist militants in Saudi Arabia ultimately grew frustrated at their inability to operate on their own .
Many of them traveled to places like Iraq or Pakistan to train and fight .
In January 2009 , many of the militants who remained in the Arabian Peninsula joined with al Qaeda 's franchise in Yemen to form a new group called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) under the leadership of Nasir al - Wahayshi , the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen who served under Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan before being arrested in Iran .
Al - Wahayshi was returned to Yemen in 2003 through an extradition deal between the Yemeni and Iranian governments and subsequently escaped from a high - security prison outside Sanaa in 2006 .
Al Qaeda in Yemen 's operational capability improved under al - Wahayshi's leadership , and its operational tempo increased ( even though those operations were not terribly effective . )
In the wake of this momentum , it is not surprising that the frustrated members of the all - but - defunct Saudi franchise agreed to swear loyalty to him .
The first real fruit of this merger was seen inside Saudi Arabia in the Aug. 28 attempted assassination of Saudi Deputy Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef .
That the plot had to be planned and launched from Yemen reveals AQAP 's weakness inside the kingdom , and the plot 's failure demonstrates that , overall , AQAP is far from an effective organization .
Like the Saudi node , the fortunes of other al Qaeda regional franchises have risen or fallen based upon the ability of the franchise 's leadership .
For example , in August 2006 al Qaeda announced with great fanfare that a splinter of the Egyptian jihadist group Gamaah al - Islamiyah had become al Qaeda 's franchise in Egypt .
Likewise , in November 2007 al Qaeda announced that the Libyan Islamic Fighting group ( LIFG ) had joined its constellation of regional groups .
But neither of these new franchise groups ever really got off the ground .
While a great degree of the groups ' lack of success may have resulted from the oppressive natures of the Egyptian and Libyan governments — and the aggressive efforts those governments undertook to control the new al Qaeda franchises following the announcements of their creation — we believe the groups ' near total lack of success also stems in large part from the lack of dynamic leadership .
Recently , LIFG leaders have issued statements speaking out against al Qaeda 's operational principles and general methodology .
Dynamic leaders are indeed hard to find .
Even though Indonesia has an estimated population of more than 240 million , Noordin — considered the most dangerous and most wanted man in Indonesia before his death — hailed from Malaysia , not Indonesia .
He was an outsider like the Jordanian - born Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , who brought al Qaeda in Iraq into the global spotlight .
Of course , not every leadership change is disastrous to a militant group .
Sometimes a new leader breathes new life and energy into a group ( like al - Wahayshi in Yemen ) , or the group has competent lieutenants able to continue to operate effectively after the death of the leader ( like al Qaeda in Iraq after the death of al - Zarqawi ) .
Noordin 's replacement , and how the leadership transition affects the group , must therefore be closely monitored .
Topping Top
Noordin was an accomplished operational commander .
He was responsible for a number of terrorist attacks in Indonesia , including the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings , the 2003 JW Marriott bombing in Jakarta , the 2004 attack on the Australian Embassy in Jakarta , and most recently , the July 17 bombings of the JW Marriott and the Ritz - Carlton in Jakarta .
MONTREAL
A major underpinning of the sovereignist narrative has always been that Quebec 's provincial status is at the root of structural defects upon which secession would act as a magic wand .
In this spirit in the 1995 referendum the Yes camp plastered the province with soothing nursery - style pictograms bearing the slogan : Un Oui et tout devient possible .
That rhetoric was successful in claiming the weapon of hope for the Yes side but it did not address successfully the countervailing notion that Canada also played a positive part in making Quebec what it was .
In the end , that latter notion prevailed .
Sovereignist champions are hardly the only Canadians who subscribe to the thesis that Quebec and the rest of Canada are mutually harmful to each other .
Ironically , at a time when Quebec 's own grievance culture is receding , the thesis that the province has been holding back the rest of the federation has never so permeated the national conversation .
In a thought - provoking book that is bound to land on Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's bedside table ( if it has not already done so ) , economist Brian Lee Crowley takes that proposition to a higher level .
Titled , Fearful Symmetry , the book argues the 40 - year battle to keep Quebec in Canada has turned the latter into a country of takers rather than makers .
He says it has bred a culture of dependency across the land .
The expansion of the Canadian social union sits at the top of Crowley 's list of Quebec - induced perversions .
He sees it as a corrosive by - product of the simultaneous advent of the baby - boomer generation and the bidding war between Ottawa and Quebec for the hearts and souls of nationalist Quebecers .
He argues that , with Quebec 's influence on national affairs waning , it is time to turn back the clock .
Crowley would disband the social union ; he would abolish most social transfers to the provinces and leave them to finance their social safety nets according to their means , out of an expanded taxation field .
With its redistributive functions reduced to a minimum , the federal government would be free to focus on the management of the economic union .
Crowley rightly argues that his devolutionist approach to social policy would appeal to Quebec 's strong autonomist streak .
Indeed his model is as close as an English - speaking intellectual can come to giving shape to the pipe dream of an independent Quebec within a united Canada .
But where his thesis is at its weakest is in the assumption that a majority of Canadians outside Quebec share his sense that Quebec 's influence has impoverished rather than enriched the Canadian fabric .
Notwithstanding Crowley 's assertion that Canada sacrificed its historical symbols on the altar of Quebec appeasement , few Canadians are nostalgic about losing the Red Ensign to the Maple Leaf flag and most see official bilingualism as a vibrant national trait .
The collective attachment to a strong pan-Canadian social union and to the attending concept of an activist federal government runs deep in most parts of Canada outside Quebec .
When it comes to medicare , that attachment often borders on a cult .
In the last election a majority of voters supported parties that promoted the maintenance and the expansion of the Canadian social union in all regions except the Prairies .

But it is also a fact that – unless Quebecers re-engage in a progressive Canadian coalition – the balance will tilt toward the deconstruction of social Canada that Crowley so passionately promotes .
That could come no later than the next election , with the potential advent of a Conservative majority rooted outside Quebec .

Living in Three Centuries : The Face of Age is the working title for this black - and - white photographic portrait project by Mark Story .
For nearly 20 plus years , in between productions , the successful commercial media creator , Story , has retreated into his creative mind and traveled in various locations around the world , looking for centenarians .
After two decades , Story has accumulated more than 15,000 portraits .
His mission ?
To photograph the manifestation of human aging .
For the best part of this journey Story has been finding super - centenarians , which means that the elder has lived to be at least 110 years old .
Each of the seventy - two portraits featured in the exhibition was shot using a deep black background and lighting placed just right to bring attention to the the wrinkles – the portrait of the lady above depicts this very clearly , being very weathered and worn .
Collectively though , each portrait is beautiful and poignant , deeply moving and in some cases , almost shocking .
They do , however , have something in common ; they are all very technically beautiful .
All seventy - two framed prints are available as a major traveling exhibition for museums and galleries , as well as limited edition individual prints for sale .
A book , a large - format monograph containing sixty images printed with absolute fidelity to the original photographs , is being produced to accompany the exhibition .
See [ 17 ] more of Story ’s photos taken from this stunning exhibition of aged portraits , right after the jump .

The man who was Tasered , Gregory Williams , 40 , a double - leg amputee , spent six days in jail on suspicion of domestic violence and resisting arrest , but the Merced County District Attorney 's office has n't filed any charges .
Williams is black , and the two main arresting officers are white , but it 's unknown whether race played any role in the incident .
Williams , who was released from jail on Friday , said he was manhandled and Tasered by police , even though he said he was never physically aggressive toward the officers and did n't resist arrest .
A handful of residents in Williams ' apartment complex said they witnessed the incident and supported Williams ' charges .
A short video clip , shot by a neighbor and obtained by the Sun - Star , shows Williams sitting on the pavement with his pants down , his hands cuffed behind his back . [...]
Pinnegar grabbed William's 2 - year - old daughter from his lap , handing her to the CPS worker .
" I said , ' What are you doing ?
I have n't done anything ! ' " Williams said .
Williams said Pinnegar unholstered his Taser , jammed it into his rib cage and shocked him twice .
Williams said he fell from his chair onto his stomach on the ground outside his doorway .
While he was down , Williams said , Court put his knee on his neck , and one of the officers then cuffed both of his wrists .
At some point after he fell out of his chair , Williams said , his shorts slid down his legs .
With his hands cuffed behind his back , Williams said , he was unable to pull his pants up .
He said police left him for five to 10 minutes in that position on the pavement , with his private parts showing as neighbors and onlookers watched .
At the link I provided there 's a video ( which I would embed here if I could ) which you should watch .
Mr. Williams is not a large man .
He 's got gray hair , a thin frame and does not present a very imposing or menacing figure .
His testimony in the video suggests that the reason he was tased was because one of the police officers said Williams had a " big mouth " and told the other one to tase him .
His story is backed up by a white man on the video identified as his brother - in - law .
You can't say this is a shocking story anymore .
It appears to me that tasers have provided a certain element of law enforcement an easy excuse to torture people who they do n't like .
Shooting an unarmed double amputee , or bashing him about the head with a baton would be considered use of deadly force , but tasers ?
Well , I guess that 's just considered a measured response to anyone who offers law enforcement officials any " sass " or " back talk . "
Even if they are a double amputee in a wheelchair .
Maybe even especially if they are a black , 40 year old double amputee in a wheelchair .
Not that we have any racism in America , or that our law enforcement agencies treat minorities any differently than white people .
That would be wrong to assume that now that we as a nation elected an African American as our President .
Would n't it ?
Update 2 : Here 's the You Tube video of the incident as described by the victim , Mr. Williams :
Update 3 : Taser victim not charged by DA because " there was n't enough evidence " .
Police involved being investigated by Internal Affairs for incident .

It had been spitting all day – a cold April rain – on the day a bit of rudeness between a Toronto Transit Commission bus driver and a passenger escalated to name calling , an airborne empty Starbucks coffee cup and hands around a neck .
But even the 911 operator who took the call from another passenger aboard bus 7866 , which was stopped at Coxwell and Eastwood Aves. on the afternoon of April 12 , 2008 , seemed taken aback by who it was – at one moment , at least – who was allegedly on the attack .
911 : Ma'am , what 's happening ?
Caller :
Well , he attacked a passenger on the bus , and ah ...
911 : The driver did ?
Moments later , the caller , sensing the operator 's disbelief : I 'm not kidding ...
He went after her , grabbed her by the neck , thrust her around and now he 's kicking everybody off the bus .
Toronto police that day put more stock in a different version of events , one more in line with what the driver later wrote up in a report to his bosses .
Police charged Alice Evenson , a 41 - year - old artist who'd never been in trouble with the law , with assault with a weapon – a criminal offence considered so serious it requires a mandatory DNA sample .
The alleged weapon , seized at the scene , being the empty Starbucks paper cup .
The charge was later withdrawn at the request of a Crown attorney and Evenson is now suing the TTC and police , seeking $ 2.3 million in damages .
The suit alleges driver Mark Lindsay called her a " loser , " choked and dragged her , and that Toronto police officers John Aiken and Dennis Inniss failed to conduct a proper investigation .
Evenson 's lawyer , Barry Swadron , believes this could be a case of " uniform affinity . "
He suggests police chose to believe the driver , a fellow city employee , over his client and the 911 caller .
He also notes police did not interview more witnesses and did n't collect evidence that may have painted a better picture of what happened that day , including video that is now long erased .
In a recently filed statement of defence , the TTC denies the allegations and asserts that the driver was assaulted and then detained Evenson until police arrived .
The driver 's own account differs somewhat .
He wrote in a report that pedestrians began to surround him and that he left Evenson and went inside the bus to await police .
The Star sought comment from Lindsay through a TTC spokesperson and a lawyer assigned to defend him , but none came , which is not unusual when a case is before the courts .
Similarly , Aiken did not respond to a request for comment .
Inniss declined to comment .
And , officially , neither the police nor the TTC offered any comment , both citing the fact that the case is now before the courts .
What follows is based on an interview with Evenson , police and TTC notes and records disclosed to Evenson in the criminal case ( shared with the Star ) , allegations and counter allegations made in the lawsuit that have yet to be proven in court , and the 911 call , a recording of which was obtained by Swadron in a freedom - of - information request .
Evenson , who lives in the Beach , was on her way to have a laptop repaired that afternoon , and was unprepared and juggling a bag , an umbrella and a coffee when the bus pulled up .
She boarded and sat near the driver and rummaged for some change , which took some time .
As she went to pay , she alleges in her suit , she made eye contact with the driver , and for an unknown reason , he gave her a " cross look . "
She asked for a transfer , and in an " exaggerated and slow manner " delivered her one .
Having finished her coffee and arrived at her stop , she headed to the front door to leave and said , " Thank you . "
Lindsay , the driver , recalled in his notes that she said , " Bye , " but both agree he did not respond in kind .
In his notes , Lindsay says he was busy trying to park the bus at the stop due to an illegally parked car , and that passengers were starting to enter the bus .
Evenson turned and , according to her suit , said , " Thank you " again , and that the driver " gave her a very annoyed look . "
Still no response .
What 's your problem , Evenson then asked .
Evenson alleges the driver informed her in an " aggressive " manner that she was the problem and ordered her off the bus .
She asked what she 'd done wrong .
" You 're an a -- hole , " Evenson alleges was the reply .
She says she then told him he could not speak to a passenger like that , to which he responded by calling her a " loser " and shouted that she was holding up the bus .
Intending to file a complaint , she asked for his badge number , and the driver pointed to his bus number .
Lindsay , in his notes , tells a different version .
He writes that her second goodbye was " sarcastic , " that she asked what his problem was and he then informed her she was blocking the door and to get off .
She asked for his name , and he sat there , " unresponding , " he says in his notes , made an announcement that the bus was out of order , and told Evenson , " Ma'am , I am not going to argue with you , talk to the hand . "
He writes that it was she who then called him an " a - - hole , " and he in turn called her a " loser . "
Evenson said in an interview that she does not swear , and did n't on that day .

At least one would - be passenger was waiting to board and was growing impatient .
Evenson says in her suit that she decided it best to leave , was " confused and upset by the unfair and undignified treatment , " and as she departed , tossed the empty coffee cup in frustration , but was " careful not to throw the cup in Lindsay 's direction . "
" Did you just try to throw a coffee cup at me ? " the driver asked , according to Evenson 's lawsuit .
He then , the suit alleges , went after her and started to " choke " her .
Evenson , the suit states , was " in fear of her life . "
She alleges she was dragged , that the driver twisted her right arm up behind her back toward her head , and in a nearby bank alcove , " snapped " her head off a wall and glass door .
Lindsay , in his notes , says the cup hit him between the eyes , and Evenson then left the bus .
He writes that he went after her in order to detain her until police arrived , and " grabbed her from behind by her shoulder . "
Evenson struggled , he writes , and as he " started to pull " her back to the bus , some pedestrians " started to surround me " and one man became " aggressive . "
So , he states , he returned alone to the bus , closed the door and waited for police to arrive .
Evenson , too , waited for police .
A female passenger , who did not know Evenson , made the 911 call .
Police spoke with three witnesses , including the 911 caller .
One man told police the driver swore at Evenson , and that he saw the coffee cup hit either the driver or the steering wheel , but did not see her take aim at the driver .
The man told police he saw the driver grab her from the bank alcove and was handling her " quite aggressively . "
A group of people formed and held the driver back , saying " you should n't hit a girl . "
That was the general sentiment of the people on the bus .
It did n't look like Evenson was intending to assault the driver , the man told police .
It looked more like a frustrated person who " threw a piece of garbage . "
Another woman , who had been waiting to board the bus , told police she heard Evenson swear at the driver , which Evenson says she did not do , and that she " whipped " the cup .
The witness did not see where the cup landed .
Later , the witness saw the driver with his " hands on her ... on her shoulders and around her neck slightly . "
Evenson , this witness said , did not appear to be in distress .
The 911 caller , a woman , told police she believed the driver was " trying to really hurt her , " and that Evenson looked " terrified . "
In her suit , Evenson alleges the incident caused injuries to her throat , right bicep , arms and shoulders , and that she suffers from post - traumatic stress , depression and anxiety .
There are pictures , taken by a neighbour , that show red marks on her neck , as well as one showing her umbrella , which is beyond repair .
Three years after
Jack Kerouac
coined the term
“ The Beat Generation ”
a group of Beat poets gathered at the Six Gallery on Fillmore Street in San Francisco for a poetry reading .
The date was October 7 , 1955 and Kerouac was there .
So were local Beat celebrities Gary Snyder , Phil Lamantia , Michael McClure and a then virtually unknown poet named Allen Ginsberg .
In his novel , The Dharma Bums ( published in 1958 ) , Kerouac called it “ the birth of the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance . ”
He then described this memorable scene :
“ Everyone was there .
It was a mad night .
And I was the one who got things jumping by going around collecting dimes and quarters from the rather stiff audience standing around in the gallery and coming back with three huge gallon jugs of California Burgundy and getting them all piffed so that by eleven o'clock when Alvah Goldbook was reading his , wailing his poem ‘ Wail ’ drunk with arms outspread everybody was yelling ‘ Go ! Go! Go !’ ( like a jam session ) . ”
“ Alvah Goldbook ” was Kerouac ’s humorous alias for the Ginsberg and “ Wail ” was the fictitious name he gave to Ginsberg ’s poem “ Howl ” — which Ginsberg first read in public that October night .
“ Howl ” was a stylistically wild , groundbreaking poem that quickly became both famous and infamous .
The beginning of the long run-on sentence that makes up the first part of the poem is the most quoted bit :
“ I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness ,
starving hysterical naked ,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn
looking for an angry fix ,
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection
to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night ,
who poverty and tatters and hollow - eyed and high sat up smoking
in the supernatural darkness of cold - water flats floating
across the tops of cities contemplating jazz ... "
“ Howl ” was instantly revered by the Beat crowd and eventually gained worldwide fame .
But it had a rocky start in printed form .
In the poem , Ginsberg writes graphically about heterosexual and homosexual sex and about the use of illegal drugs — forbidden subjects in the uptight society of the 1950s .
When “ Howl ” was printed by a British book publisher in 1955 , copies were seized as “ pornography ” by Customs officials .
In 1956 , Lawrence Ferlinghetti , owner of the City Lights bookstore in San Francisco and a popular beat poet in his own right , published “ Howl ” in the U.S. , in a small collection of Ginsberg ’s poems titled Howl and Other Poems .
Copies of the book were soon seized by the San Francisco police and Ferlinghetti was arrested for publishing and selling an “ obscene and indecent ” book .
At the trial , Ferlinghetti was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union .
During the course of the trial , Judge Clayton W. Horn listened to nine literary experts testify about the book ’s literary merits .
In October 1957 , he issued a carefully thought out ruling in favor of the defense .
Horn concluded that Howl and Other Poems met the current legal test of having redeeming social importance and was not “ obscene . ”
Thus , Ferlinghetti was found not guilty — and “ Howl ” and Ginsberg moved on to wider and everlasting fame .
Here are some of the other famous quotes and phrases linked to October 7 :
• Former Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz ’s infamous comment about blacks wanting “ good sex , ‘ loose shoes ’ and ‘ a warm place ’ when they use the toilet ” was published in the October 7 , 1976 issue of Rolling Stone magazine .
•
“ Here is America struck by God Almighty in one of its vital organs , so that its greatest buildings are destroyed .
Grace and gratitude to God . ” -
You may not remember those words , but if you were watching the news in 2001 you remember when Osama Bin Laden delivered them .
They were the opening words in the videotaped statement he released on October 7 , 2001 , gloating about Al - Quaeda ’s September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon building in Arlington , Virginia .

The film industry is tackling the controversial issue of farmer suicides
After drinking pesticide out of sheer desperation , poverty - stricken farmer Nandu collapsed .
He did this on screen in front of an audience at a packed multiplex cinema , which issued a collective gasp .
Nandu is just a character in a recent Indian film about farmer suicides .
But his tragic fate has been a reality for thousands of farmers across India .
For the first time , this dark aspect of Indian rural life has made it to the big screen .
Most Hindi films are glossy , glamorous , super- cool and predominantly filmed in Indian or Western cities .
In the past few months several films in the Marathi language - depicting the often terrifying problems facing farmers - have been released in the state of Maharashtra .
The state is home to the glittering city of Mumbai but it is also a state where thousands of farmers have killed themselves in recent years .
This is particularly acute in the Vidarbha region , known for growing oranges and cotton , but which is prone to drought and has witnessed many farmer suicides over failed crops and mounting debts .
The central government has announced loan waivers to but thousands of families across the area have been affected .
Where Bollywood films relentlessly focus on the positive side of things , films about farmer suicides made on limited budgets by relatively inexperienced directors are by any stretch of the imagination commercially unviable .
Yet they have won critical acclaim at national and international film festivals .
Helplessness Movies such as Tingya [ the name of the child protagonist ] , Gaabhricha Paus ( The Damned Rain ) , and Goshta Choti Dongraevadhi ( Small Story as Big as a Mountain ) deal with the subject of life as a farmer with depth and simplicity .
Thousands of farmers commit suicide in India every year Mangesh Hadawle 's Tingya is a story of a seven - year - old boy who refuses to part with the family bullock which has to be sold to a butcher due to financial problems .
The story unfolds from a child 's perspective and shows the helplessness of his parents as they are unable to justify its sale , especially after the animal has grown up with Tingya and is his friend .
Satish Manwar 's
The Damned Rain is about a family living in fear because the head of the family - who is distressed but also resilient - shows signs of wanting to commit suicide .
Nagesh Bhosale 's Small Story as Big as a Mountain depicts two close farmer friends dealing with the vagaries of nature and Indian bureaucracy until one of them commits suicide and the other takes on the system .
The filmmakers wanted to highlight the real stories of farmers who they have have known closely .
" It is a collage of what I have seen and experienced .
It is important to have a vision as to what you want to say through the film .
I had this story in my mind for at least three or four years before I could actually find a producer , " Mangesh Hadawale says .
The filmmakers waited for the right producer and have spent their own money in order not to compromise on the story .
" We made this film with like - minded people who put in their own money .
We made two films - one an out - and - out commercial film and simultaneously we shot this one .
We made this film without expecting any profits .
It was important to make it so we did , " says Nagesh Bhosale , a co-producer .
' Extremely trying '
The Damned Rain was the only Indian film to win a distribution grant of 15,000 Euros from the Hubert Bals Fund at the Rotterdam Film Festival , without which even the limited release the film managed would have been difficult .
Tingya tells the heartbreaking story of a boy and his beloved bullock After being rejected by 42 producers , Mr Hadawale was vindicated when the film not only did well commercially but also won numerous awards including a national award for the child actor .
These films show understanding of the region , rural life and agricultural knowledge .
Not only are the characters based on people known to the writers but many scenes are based on real life incidents like villagers putting up the entire village for sale or farmers getting cheques for only 30 or 40 rupees in Small Story as Big as a Mountain .
" We have shown what has actually happened to farmers , " says Mr Bhosale .
" Life has been extremely trying for them for several years now .
That is why the older character in played by Nilu Phule keeps warning of an earthquake - we do n't know if it is a real one or social one . "
While some films show hope , some warn of worse times .
The filmmakers are divided on whether the films will change anything but are convinced about one thing - the story needs to be told .
The films tackle the impact of suicides on family life Mr Hadawale feels that if globalisation can reach every corner of villages by way of " soft drinks and chips , why should the stories of these villages not reach the globe ? "
The films speak of nature or rains as the mighty one , capable of changing their lives overnight .
The farmers , though , are dependent on the government and its loan schemes and are shown to be wary of political developments and corrupt administrations .
" The situation has gone out of control for the system as well .
Now unless something drastic happens , the condition of farmers is not going to improve .
At the most these films will generate some discussion and awareness , " Satish Manwar says .
" But that is not going to change much .
A complete overhaul is required which may or may not happen .
It is important to study the situation psychologically as in The Damned Rain to see what happens to a family that lives in fear . "
This sentiment is echoed by Vijay Jawandia , a well - known farmers ' activist .
" People watch these films and it is nice that the issues are being discussed .
However , the farmers are caught in such vicious cycles that one is not sure if debates and discussions can help without serious action by the government . "

We do n't sell motherboards , computer processors , RAM , ISA cards , keyboards , or any hardware that is used inside a computer .
Yes we sell integrated circuits and circuit boards .
But does SPARC International or their partners ?
They may sell large scale motherboards and riser cards , but not the raw , exposed , ' meant for research ' circuit boards that we do .
I do n't think any of our customers confuse the parts that we sell with the well - designed RISC architecture that SPARC International creates .

I have the utmost respect for Sun Microsystems ( owner of SPARC International ) .
They 're just down the road !
I understand the need for SPARC International lawyers to protect the SPARC brand , but we really have nothing to do with a fine architecture that SPARC produces .
I do n't think anyone else would confuse the two .
Why did this come up ?
SparkFun filed for a trademark on January 21 , 2009 .
The process is fairly long , and towards the end the trademark office allows anyone to file an objection to a new trademark .
Enter SPARC International .
From the letter : " The SPARC trademark portfolio is an extremely valuable asset belonging to SI ... "
Indeed , I feel the same way .
I would feel bad if anyone confused SparkFun with SPARC International , so let 's compare trademarks : I do n't see how our trademarks could be confused .
Letter : " Because the dominant portion of the SparkFun mark , namely , SPARK , is phonetically identical and nearly visually identical to SI 's SPARC mark , and because it is used in connection with identical goods , we believe confusion is likely to occur among the relevant purchasing group .

SPARC International started using their trademark in 1989 .
SPARC International has been at it a lot longer !

Breathalyser test detects lung cancer early
A coloured X - ray showing cancer in the left lung of a patient .
The cancer is seen here as the opaque grey mass .
Around 39,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK each year
Patients with suspected lung cancer could in future be breathalysed to check if they have the disease .
Scientists have developed a sensor that can quickly detect lung cancer molecules on the breath .
Early detection of the disease massively increases the chances of survival .
The Israeli researchers believe the technology could lead to cheap , portable breath - test devices with the potential to save thousands of lives .
The lung cancer biomarkers were found by comparing breath samples from 40 diagnosed patients and 56 healthy individuals .
From the results , the researchers identified 42 ' volatile organic compounds ' ( VOCs ) present in the breath of 83 per cent of cancer patients but fewer than 83 per cent of healthy volunteers .
Four of the most reliable were used to develop a nine - sensor array made from tiny gold particles coated with reactive chemicals sensitive to the compounds .
Exposed to the VOCs , the sensors generated an electrical signal that produced a distinctive trace pattern .
In tests the device easily distinguished simulated ' healthy ' and ' cancerous ' breath made from artificial compound mixtures .
The Israeli scientists led by Dr Hossam Haick , from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa , outline the research today in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .
They wrote : ' Our results show great promise for fast , easy and cost - effective diagnosis and screening of lung cancer .
' The developed devices are expected to be relatively inexpensive , portable , and amenable to use in widespread screening , making them potentially valuable in saving millions of lives every year . '
Around 39,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK each year and 34,500 die from the disease .
It causes more deaths than any other form of cancer , 90 per cent of which are a direct result of smoking .
Travel guides mostly do not mention these underground wonders , creepy tunnels and massive underground systems .
Some of these tunnels are only recently opened to public .
Some are still impossible to enter and very hard to explore .
But this is where the “ spirit of adventure ” comes in , as multitudes of amateur photographers descend into the unknown to bring back evidence of things unseen .
Abandoned Salte Mine in Romania Turda
Salt mine is an old closed salt mine in Cluj Country Romania .
The closed mine has long tunnels , and a deep natural cave .
The excavations dug a huge artificial cave , in which you could fit three 10 - story blocks .

Whenever I discuss the colossal mistake that was ( is ) the Iraq war and the embarrassing lack of WMDs , some defender of that war always insists that “ everyone ” thought Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction .
Well no , everyone did n’t , including the weapons inspectors .
But the “ everyone ” who count most are those who wield the most power , and thus said Vice President Dick Cheney in 2002 : “ Stated simply , there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction .
There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends , against our allies and against us . ”
Cheney was wrong .
“ Everyone ” was wrong .
And “ everyone ” is wrong today about Iran and their supposed WMDs .
You might be asking , “ how does some minor league columnist from Charleston , South Carolina possess the proper intel to refute what Washington leaders and our national media are all saying about Iran ’s nuclear capabilities ? ”
That ’s easy .
They ’re all full of crap .

Virtually everything our leaders told us about the supposed “ threat ” posed by Iraq was either a lie or a drastic exaggeration to garner public support for a war that was unnecessary , in hindsight .
These are the same leaders who lied about or exaggerated the immediate need for the $ 787 billion Wall Street bailout or “ TARP ” to fix our economy , as that criminal piece of legislation passes its one year mark having accomplished nothing .
I opposed the war in Iraq and TARP for the same reason — I am accustomed to politicians telling any lie necessary to get what they want , and find more truth in first examining their wants than getting caught up in the lies they find necessary to achieve them .
In Iraq , I knew the neoconservatives who ran the Bush administration had been aching to invade that country long before 9/11 , something they made clear on numerous occasions .
I watched them manipulate facts , twist logic and shamelessly use the terrorist attacks as their public excuse for their war , knowing full well it was never their private inspiration .
Since Iraq , this same crowd has had their heart set on invading Iran , something they have also made clear on numerous occasions .
When last week Iran admitted the existence of a second uranium enrichment facility , it quickly – and predictably – became 2002 and “ WMDs ” all over again .
And our leaders ’ duplicity is staggering .
Just this summer , dissidents in Iran took to the streets posing a serious challenge to the ruling regime and American neoconservatives chastised Obama for not coming out strongly in their support .
Why should our government have supported the dissidents ?
Because if things worsened , the US would have assumed a degree of moral responsibility for the deteriorating conditions , which could have resulted in American boots on the ground in Iran .
Now the same leaders who pretended to support the opposition to Iran ’s ruling regime are the staunchest endorsers of sanctions , which would punish the very same dissidents .
Or as opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi told the Washington Post : “ Sanctions would not affect the government but would impose many hardships upon the people , who suffer enough as a result of the calamity of their insane rulers . ”
Again , our politicians ’ wants dictate their arguments and their current rhetoric on Iran intentionally is leading to war , occupation and permanent US entrenchment .
We ’ve heard this all before .
WMDs ?
Iraq behind 9/11 ?
Saddam , the “ next Hitler ? ”
It was all bogus .
Iran has nuclear weapons ?
Tehran poses a threat to the US ?
Ahmadinejad is the “ next Hitler ? ”
Fool me once , shame on you .
Fool me twice …
Ex-CIA officer Philip Giraldi puts it best :
“ The real question for the United States and its citizens should be whether or not Iran constitutes a serious danger and whether the threat level mandates Washington ’s launching of another war on the heels of two unsuccessful forays into the Muslim world .
Many Americans might also observe that the cost of such a journey into darkness would have catastrophic effect on a crumbling US economy .
One could reasonably ask why Congress and the media seem intent on setting the US on a path that can only lead to war , a conflict that could easily have consequences that would gravely damage the United States and its people .
Remember the WMD , pilotless drones , chemical weapon labs , and mushroom clouds ?
The same song is being sung again , but this time everyone should recognize a con job when they see it coming . ”
But my greatest fear is that too few Americans see the same con job coming .
Conservatives who see a socialist conspiracy behind every move Obama makes are still incapable of believing government could ever conspire to take us to war , and liberals who were once antiwar will give their hero Obama the benefit of the doubt , as both parties dish out the same crap that got us into Iraq .
And I hate to say it , but Americans have far more to fear from government leaders who get excited over the idea of Iran having WMDs than Iran actually having WMDs .
Special By By Andrew Moran Sep 13 , 2009 in Business Recent television advertisements by China 's Central Television , which is state - controlled , has urged its citizens to purchase gold and silver bullion .
The announcer further adds that silver has been undervalued for several years and investment in that particular bullion is “ the right investment for individual investors and could be a good way to cash in . ”
Advertisements continued to discuss figures regarding gold by mentioning that in 2007 gold was fifty times more expensive than silver and now it has reached seventy times .
This is a complete 180 in China , where the government put strict controls on the bullion market and dissuaded its citizens to enter that market but now , with the global economic crisis , it seems that the Chinese authorities will lax restrictions .
One manager from Zaman Moniruz , CEO of Why are they doing this ?
Peter Schiff , President of Euro Pacific Capital and potential Republican Connecticut Senator , said , discussing this topic with Paul Atherley , Leyshon Resources managing director , comments on the recent Chinese purchasing gold move , according to Mineweb , “ Simply put , the Chinese government is trying to trigger a national gold craze ... and it 's working .
The Chinese public now has gold trading platforms on steroids .... ... Also , for the first time in history , Chinese investors can even trade gold abroad ( in London ) with the swipe of a ‘ Lucky Gold ' card .
I can't even get Bank of America to open a foreign currency account . ”
Currently , market reports by According to a report published by the Thunder Road Report , an announcer in one advertisement tells the viewers that it is very easy to purchase silver bullion , “ China has introduced its first ever investment opportunity for silver bullion .
The bars are available in 500g , 1kg , 2kg and 5kg with a purity of 99.9 % .
Figures show that gold was fifty times more expensive than silver in 2007 , but now that figure has reached over seventy times .

Zaman Moniruz , CEO of The Bullion Mart in Toronto , one of the few bullion dealers in the Greater Toronto Area , said on Friday that he believes that gold is the only safe haven , no matter what investors try to say .
He further added that China is one of the few countries that are doing things the correct way , " We want to protect our money the right way .
" Why are they doing this ?
Peter Schiff , President of Euro Pacific Capital and potential Republican Connecticut Senator , said , discussing this topic with Fox Business News this week , the Chinese are doing this because they own a significant amount of United States dollars and if China owns majority of bullion in the world then , Schiff asks , where will the United States go to purchase gold and or silver ?

Posted February 23 , 2009
In Afghanistan , U.S. / NATO have put the blame on Taliban for poppy cultivation to finance their resistance to allied forces .
Ironically , it was only in Taliban era when the world had seen a sharp decline in opium crop in Afghanistan .
The Afghan Taliban had banned opium cultivation nationwide , probably for the first time in Afghan history .
A more important question is how and when this business of drug production and trafficking started in region ?
CIA has been using drug money since long to generate money to support its operations all over the world .
It did not start in Afghanistan it was brought here after experimenting somewhere else .
This is something which is not a lead story in international media for obvious reasons despite the fact it is harming millions of lives around the globe .
1. CIA�s secret Operations
Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) on of the most active and dynamic intelligence setups in the world needs massive amount of money to carry on its clandestine operations all over the world .
It has happened when CIA used local sources to conduct a coups , assassinations , regime change , etc .
As U.S. has a long history to support democracy by hook and crook until and unless a dictator is ready to serve U.S. interests to prolong its rule .
Operations like the one completed in Iran in 1953 to remove Prime Minister Mussadaq and backing Shah�s regime by using assets in civil society , or in Iraq in 1975 to arm Iraqi Kurds to destabilize Pre-Saddam Iraq or more recently using its assets in Pakistan to pave the way of direct U.S. intervention in Pakistan under pretext of hunting Al - Qaeda .
These kinds of operations need a lot of financial input .
Usually CIA arranges revenue from its own means for this kind of operations where expenses can�t be predicted by any measure .
Funds from
Whitehouse always need a complete audit and detailed reports about usage of these funds .
There are numerous occasions when CIA never shared details of operations with its own analytical wing nor with any other public office in Washington .
Most of the time it is drug money that compensates these expenses .
CIA operations are not only single expenditure fulfilled by drugs there are also other deficiencies which are compensated with this money like financial institutes and banks in current financial crisis .
UNODC Executive Director Antonio Maria Costa based in Vienna revealed that drug money often became the only available capital when the crisis spiraled out of control last year .
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime had found evidence that " inter bank loans were funded by money that originated from drug trade and other illegal activities , " Costa was quoted as saying .
There were " signs that some banks were rescued in that way . "
It is not only CIA anymore in trade for using it as gold mine to finance its illegal operations all over the world but U.S. economy also need some liquidity in its banks , it doesn�t matter if it is coming by drug trade .
2. Drug Production & Consumption
Afghanistan is largest producer of heroin�s main ingredient ; opium and opium is nothing new in this part of the world .
In Afghanistan and FATA , Pakistan it is being produced since centuries ; used as remedy for various diseases .
Commercial production of opium began just during the Russian invasion in Afghanistan where it is estimated to produce some 8250 metric tons ( Source : AmericanFreePress.net , November 24 , 2008 ) of opium per year which makes 85 % to 90 %
of the world�s supply of opium .
This also contributes towards Afghan warlords � wealth directly .
This is what CIA brought to the region : Opium production without a brand name obviously .
Today�s world opium production map is as under ;
Left : Demand and trafficking of drugs globally .
U.S. is one of very high concentration drug trafficking territory thanks to Regan�s National Security Council who turned a blind eye towards South American cocaine socking into U.S. in 1980 when CIA was backing all the drug traffickers of Contra movements in Nicaragua .
Markets for these drugs stretched world over from Western Europe to Far East , From Canada to Latin America and From China to Morocco , Africa .
Profits related to this business also vary along with market�s location .
This business enriches not only the United States - friendly Afghan warlords but also elements of the Northern Alliance , the U.S. key ally in the country .
More disturbing is fact that this money also contributes in CIA�s operations against Pakistan as well .
3. Contra Movements ( 1980 )
In Asia demand for heroin is more than any other drug but it is not the case world over .
Cocaine is favourite drug which is consumed the most .
Cocaine was nothing new in South American countries but it was only during Nicaraguan contra movements against the then dictator it got shoot up .
It was again CIA�s regime change operation to bring " democracy " in Nicaragua .
It was during this period when the whole region saw an unprecedented surge in cocaine trafficking in 1980 .
This has been investigated none other than but by CIA�s inspector general in later years .
Was CIA a part of this ?
Answer is not only CIA was aiding these cocaine traffickers and money - launderers but Ronald Reagon�s National Security Council also turned a blind eye towards these drug trades despite the fact that later these very drug traffickers brought cocaine to mainland U.S. .
According to CIA�s inspector general report , published in online magazine The Consortium magazine , Oct. 15 , 1998 , it was Reagan�s National Security Council which cleared proven drug traffickers and CIA inspector general Frederick Hitz confirmed long standing allegations of cocaine traffickers .
The NSC�s covert airline was the main transportation mean to do this trade in safest possible way .
Figure 1 : Armed men of Nicaragua insurgency during 1980s , armed with CIA weapons bought with drug money .
Most stunning part of all this contra movements and CIA involvement is methods these movements used to dismantle the then Nicaraguan government including bombing and killing of civilians and CIA withheld all evidence of contra crimes from Justice Department , the Congress and even its own analytical division just to conceal its connection with drug traffickers .
4. Afghanistan
As it is mentioned earlier that Afghanistan was not a hub of drug supply to world before Russian invasion in 1979 .
It was CIA once again to implement what it successfully implemented in Nicaragua in 1980 .
Now , Afghanistan is biggest contributor in drug production with its massive opium production .
Russian Afghan War ( 1979 - 1989 )
CIA was not fully done with contra movements when Russia invaded Afghanistan in 1979 threatening the region with her expansionist design to gain control over Afghanistan and Baluchistan province of Pakistan to reach Arabian Sea .
Pakistan decided to confront Russia inside Afghanistan to thwart communist designs .
CIA found an opportunity in Afghanistan to settle its long standing duel with Russian for global dominion , after initial successes by Afghan fighters .
CIA once again brought tested formula of drug to finance this war which it used in South America with only difference in prescription where cocaine was replaced with heroin .
Poppy cultivation was nothing new to Afghan but it was level of production and demand created by international traffickers in the world which shocked many in vicinity of these poppy fields .
Profit gained by these drugs was main driving force behind all this trade and with heroin it was much more than what it was with cocaine .
Ironically U.S. and Europe became biggest markets of heroin prepared produced in Afghanistan .
Regan�s administration is also a common factor in both Afghan heroin trade and contra cocaine traffickers .
Role of CIA in first Afghan war was not overt as it could provoke Russians in more direct retaliation albeit Cuban missile crisis of 1960s .
To avoid that kind of hostility it was more suitable for CIA to have silent links with Afghan warlords and providing sources to grow poppy .
" By the end of Russian invasion in 1989 Afghanistan was second largest opium production spot with 1350 Metric ton after notorious Golden Triangle including countries like Laos , Thailand , Burma and Vietnam which was producing 2645 Metric ton at that time leaving Latin America way behind with just 112 Metric ton " , as per U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .
Pre and Post Taliban Era ( 1994-2001 )
In 1994 unrest and lawlessness in Afghanistan gave rise to Taliban .
Motivated with their strict religious background and education they put ban on all kinds of drugs in territory under their control but this was not the cure for chronically infected Afghan economy and society .
Non availability of any job market and strong hold of Northern Alliance of Northern part of country remained biggest challenge to these efforts to cut down poppy cultivation in Afghanistan .
But despite all the challenges Talibans were able to put a serious cut on opium production in Afghanistan by start of 2001 when they were about to capture Northern Alliance�s strong hold Mazar - e - Sharif but post 9/11 scenario not only changed the geopolitical dynamics of the whole world but also destroyed the efforts of Taliban to control opium production .
Figure 2 : Afghan opium sells in cheap at home , worth a fortune in U.S. market
Left :
In year 2001 , just before U.S. / NATO invasion into Afghanistan , Taliban were able to cut down opium production by a decisive margin .
This was also one of core reasons against Taliban along with other excuses .
After year 2002 , when Taliban were removed from power there is a historical increase in opium production in Afghanistan , money is going to pentagon to carry on Afghan and Iraq war despite a historical recession in U.S. .
Recent Afghan Conflict ( 2002 � To date )
Afghanistan is leading opium production in world today but after the invasion of U.S. in 2002 Afghanistan is also attributed to have largest heroin production in the world as well .
Without active support of Pentagon and CIA it is not possible to export drug prepared with more than 8000 metric tons of opium .
U.S. relations with Northern Alliance in Afghanistan after Taliban have given a free license to drug producers , traffickers .
CIA and Pentagon both have their links to all these criminals in order to get supplies of the drugs and export it in U.S. Army planes .
It has been reported that CIA used U.S. Army planes leaving Afghanistan carrying coffins which were filled with drugs instead of bodies .
To make sure undisturbed trade U.S. appointed all Northern Alliance drug lords at key posts in Afghanistan and most prominent appointment was none other than President Hamid Karzai .
Karzai�s brother , head of Kandahar�s provincial council is proven drug trafficker facilitating the transportation of heroin from Kandahar eastward through Helmand and out across the Iranian border .
There is no reason to believe that CIA is not aware of this but as it is all one big enterprise where Karzai is also a partner so no danger to his brother .
Bush administration pushed the level of poppy cultivation to next level in Afghanistan just to keep Wall Streets alive in crisis .
Many top
Bush administration�s officials were worried about growing influence of countries in Golden Triangle ( Loas , Thailand , Vietnam , Burma ) in Russian and Chinese drug markets .
Like Oil in Iraq this was just another opportunity for the Bush administration to have some quick bucks .
Blames for using drugs to fight with NATO and U.S. forces is always put on Taliban .
But looking at areas of Taliban�s active zones one can easily understand where all this poppy cultivation is taking place .
Taliban put ban on poppy when they were incharge of majority of Afghan territories and Kabul , the capital .
Afghanistan was suffering worst economic crisis at that time but Taliban never went to build their economy with heroin trade .
Now it is just ridiculous to blame Taliban to have vast fields of poppy and having enough peace and time to grow and process it into heroin and then trade it in Pakistan and Iran to dens it to destinations in Eastern Europe .
Below is map of Afghanistan indicating high poppy cultivation provinces and it is quite evident that Taliban dominant
Left : Ahmed Wali Karzai , appointed by his brother , President Hamid Karzai , to represent Kandahar province in Kabul .
According to media reports he is main player in exporting heroin and opium to European countries through Turkmenistan .
Provinces like Kunar , Pektika , Paktya has low poppy cultivation and other provinces where all U.S. / CIA supported warlords are holding key positions are growing most of opium crop .
It was only after U.S. invasion there was a 4400 % increase in opium production .
U.S. role in Afghan social debacle will go in history as described The Huffington Post on October 15 , 2008 " When the history of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan is written , Washington�s sordid involvement in the heroin trade and its alliance with drug lords and war criminals of the Afghan Communist Party will be one of the most shameful chapters . "
5. Pakistan : Indirect Victim of the CIA�s Drug business
Almost the whole world is affected by this drug trade but countries which lie in routes of drug traffickers are worst effected after the original drug markets .
Countries like Pakistan are paying a very high price for U.S. / CIA drug trade as there is a constant increase in drug addiction in Pakistan .
Iran is another country which happens to be in route of international drug traffickers so it is also facing problem of smuggling of heroin and morphine from Afghanistan and Pakistan to Turkey and Europe .
After U.S. invasion of Afghanistan this route has become active manifold then it was previously .
Effects of this trade are not limited to drug usage only but it destroys the social fabric in a society and gives rise to street crimes in order to get some cash to buy drugs from street market .
A more horrible outcome is spread of HIV virus among addicted persons when they share the injection syringes .
This threat is increasing with each passing day as number of HIV positive is increasing .
Another disastrous effect it brought to Pakistan and Afghanistan other neighbors is serious law and order situation in bordering area of each country with Afghanistan .
Combating this evil trade is not possible until a holistic effort is made by international community in this regards but its chances are bleak as this trade is needed by global imperialism ( Israel , U.S. , UK ) more than ever before to give some support to their dying economies .
Above : Pakistan has become main artery in heroin trafficking route and it has a lot of implication on Pakistani security .
Level of drug addicted also increased over the year due to high availability of drugs in street market .
Afghanistan is main producer but Pakistan us where most of drugs are seized .
6. Conclusion
Under current situation it is very important for countries like Pakistan , Iran , Afghanistan and Russia to think about how to put jinni of drug back to the bottle before international drug mafia takes over these countries by destroying their social norms and values .
CIA not only has a long history of having links with traffickers but also encouraging the drug trade to get its own interests served .
CIA always encourages this trade even if it affected its own citizens like in Contra movements of 1980 .
Afghanistan became leader in opium production and main hub for providing heroin and its main ingredient to whole world .
All this happened under the control of champion of human rights U.S. and its intelligence setup mainly CIA .
Situation is becoming more and bleaker unless Pakistan , China , Russia , Iran and Afghanistan governments start thinking about this trade and its far reaching affects on U.S. economy and CIA�s funding .

This is the website of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation , the largest contemporary history site of its kind .
We offer free access to thousands of historical documents relating to the Thatcher period .
The list of coders interviewed includes some geek household names like Donald Knuth and jwz , but also some not so well - known ones such as Bernie Cosell ( one of the programmers behind the ARPANET IMP , the first Internet router ) and Fran Allen ( compiler pioneer ) .
The full list of people interviewed is available on the book 's website .
The eras embodied by the interviewees range from the very beginnings of software as we know it today , to the heyday of the Internet boom , when people like Brad Fitzpatrick made their mark .
Seibel himself is a coder and author ( having the well - received Practical Common Lisp under his belt ) .
It is then no surprise that the interviews are packed with technical details , which ( with one exception , explained below ) restricts the intended audience of the book to those already familiar with programming .
Coders at Work manages to communicate the wisdom of programmers of bygone eras , while simultaneously being heavily colored by very contemporary issues .
JavaScript , its consequences and its discontents , is a topic recurring throughout the book .
More than just a recounting of history , Coders at Work should inspire readers to learn about the wider context of their craft and stop the reinvention of the proverbial wheel decried by several of the interviewees in its pages .
Given the related subject matter , the people interviewed in Coders at Work who played a role in creating major programming languages ( Armstrong , Eich , and Steele ) , and close publication dates of the two books , inevitable comparisons will be drawn between Coders at Work and Federico Biancuzzi and Shane Warden 's Masterminds of Programming ( I previously reviewed Masterminds of Programming on my blog ) .
There is a lot of common ground between the two books in terms of technical areas covered , but Coders at Work clearly comes out on top .
Part of the reason has to do with the fact that Seibel 's choice of interviewees is stellar .
Masterminds of Programming 's niche focus on programming language designers meant that its authors had a tougher job than Seibel , but details like the omission of Alan Kay ( creator of Smalltalk and one of the most influential programming language designers in the field 's history ) from Masterminds are nothing short of dumbfounding .
Just as important to making Coders at Work a good book is the fact that Seibel is a great interviewer .
Seibel 's questions felt more open - ended than those in Masterminds , and the resulting interviews have a flow and narrative that makes them engrossing to read and gives the programmers interviewed a chance to explore details in - depth .
A refreshing aspect of Coders at Work are the interviewees who do n't shy away from strong opinions or humor , as shown in this remark by Peter Deutsch , " I think Larry Wall has a lot of nerve talking about language design -- Perl is an abomination as a language . "
One aspect where Coders unintentionally shines is as a guide to finding and hiring programming talent .
Even non-technical managers will benefit greatly by reading those excerpts of the interviews concerned with hiring programmers .
Another unexpected aspect of the book is the breadth of topics discussed — everything from debugging machine code to women 's issues in computing workplace and education .
One area where Coders could stand improvement is in its length .
Not all of the coders interviewed possessed the gift of brevity , and many interview answers could have been edited to reduce their length without affecting the message .
In her interview , Fran Allen makes an interesting assertion — programming and computer science need to become more socially relevant .
Other scientific and engineering fields are filled with well - known personalities , described in prominent interviews , biographies , and major Hollywood films .
The only " software people " to appear in the public spotlight are the CEOs of major software firms .
Ultimately , its role in helping programming assert its status as a socially relevant profession may be the most important contribution of Coders at Work .

You know youâ€™re in a housing bubble when bankers privately reveal that 95 % of their new mortgage customers finance 95 % of their purchases .
When almost 100 % of new mortgages have the longest approved amortizations â€ “ 35 years .
When houses with crumbling basement walls but new stainless countertops attract fourteen offers .
When the average house price hits an historic high in the midst of a recession .
When buyers panic because they think theyâ€™ll be priced out .
When emotion trumps rational thought .
When debtâ€™s nothing .
And greed rules .
As dark as all that is , darker still is the growing sense in Canada that owning a home is no longer an earned privilege .
But a right .
Thatâ€™s when a bubble becomes a bomb .
The collateral damage can be morality .
This arrived today from Alberta :
I know you ’re a very busy man , but I trust your judgement and value your opinions .
Â
I ’m a daily greaterfool blog reader ( for at least the last year and a half ) , and thank you for all your time and effort you ’ve put into it .
Â
I hope that you can spare a moment to shoot a nugget of advice in my direction .
I rent a house in from some old guy who wants to sell the house and move to Victoria ( Victoria eh ? Â Way to fight the stereotype ) .
Â
We love the house , and have absolutely no interest in moving .
Â
He wants to sell the house to me , and he ’s asking fair current market value for it .
Â
I know he ’s still paying for the house , and it ’s on a HELOC at prime plus 0.5 % .
Â
Assuming I could convince him to sell it to me through a VTB mortgage ( for say the next three to five years , upon which time I ’d move the mortgage to a bank because I do n’t know how much longer he ’ll last and I do n’t want to fight with his estate executors ) at his HELOC rate plus a little bit , my monthly mortgage would be almost exactly what I ’m currently paying him in rent .
Â
I figure that this would benefit me in the following ways : Â Insulate me from price increases because I ’ve already bought it for x amount , and insulate me from significant price drops , as if the price of the house falls by more than what I ’ve already paid him , I could just walk away from the deal and let him take the loss ( with no effect on my credit report ) , then buy it when he lists it at a lower price .
Do you see any reason why I should not try to pull this off ?
Â
I am a very convincing man , and I figure the odds are better than 50/50 I ’d be able to convince him to do it .
Â
He ’s a first time landlord , a kind man , and definitely not trying to rip us off .
Â
Do you have any other suggestions about how to handle this ?
Â
( Ideally more than “ grow some morality ” , or “ get a conscience , you crook ” ) .
— Chris
After you grow some ethics , along with a set , you might ask yourself why the guy would ever sell you a home with a VTB when the propertyâ€™s already subject to financing ?
Fact is , to ink a purchase and sale agreement with you , the owner / landlord will have to agree to discharge the existing home equity line of credit on the day of closing .
And howâ€™s he going to do that when you presumably give him no money ?
Are you that convincing , dude ?
Even getting past that little roadblock , thereâ€™s the issue of the VTB rate you need to pull this thing off â€ “ prime plus a half .
Why on earth would the old guy give you financing at 2.75 % , locked up for between three and five years ?
Without a doubt , the prime rate will be double what it is now within 36 months , and could be three times higher in 60 .
Heâ€™d be foregoing income on hundreds of thousands of dollars â€ “ just so you could own his property for the same amount youâ€ ™re now paying him to rent it .
Are you on drugs ?
Finally , as for your strategy of stealing the house from this senior who ( you say ) has treated you with kindness and respect , youâ€ ™re actually asking me for an opinion on â€œwalking away from the deal .. letting him take a loss…â€  and then vultching it when he is forced to list ?
And youâ€™d do this even assuming he gave you financing to buy his home with no money down , at a bargain rate ?
You may be a regular reader , but youâ€™re also a narcissistic , greedy , self - centred , compassionless loser .
If you want a house , pal , buy one .
May you get mugged by a guy in a walker .
Filmmaker George Romero's flick " Dawn of the Dead " and others have catapulted zombies into cult - like status in Monroeville , Pa. , where the movie was filmed .
( See related article . )
Limping , bloodied ( sort of ) and wearing shredded clothing , 2,000 souls from near and far descended on the Zombie Fest and Walk of the Dead at Monroeville Mall in Monroeville , Pa. , Oct. 11 ( Ross Mantle for The Wall Street Journal )
The mall is famous as the main setting of filmmaker George Romero 's 1978 cult classic " Dawn of the Dead , " in which survivors of a plague that turns humans into zombies take refuge in the shopping center .
Pittsburgh zombie enthusiast Sandy Funtal , 39 , participated in this year 's walk and competed in an Ugly Pageant , but she did n't win .
( Ross Mantle for The Wall Street Journal )
Each year , hundreds of pale - faced zombie wannabes come to the mall , trying to look dazed and confused as they stumble past chain retail stores .

Correction 10 September 2009 : Since the Lost Land of the Volcano programme was broadcast on Tuesday 8 September , we 've learnt that this parrot may have been mis-identified .
Ornithologist Dr Jack Dumbacher now believes the parrots filmed may be yellow - capped pygmy parrots ( Micropsitta keiensis ) , not buff - faced pygmy parrots ( Micropsitta pusio ) .
At an average height of 9 to 9.5 cm , the closely - related yellow - capped pygmy parrots are slightly taller than buff - faced pygmy parrots .
The world 's smallest parrot has been filmed in the wild for the first time by a BBC expedition .
The team , filming in Papua New Guinea for the programme Lost Land of the Volcano , caught two of the buff - faced pygmy parrots on camera .
On average , buff - faced pygmy parrots ( Micropsitta pusio ) are not much bigger than a human thumb , standing less than 9cm tall and weighing 11.5g ( 0.41 oz ) .
The Lost Land of the Volcano series will broadcast on BBC One on Tuesday 8 September at 2100 BST .
It is becoming ever more apparent that the war on drugs has been lost .
Doomed to fail from the moment of its inception , the war the U.S. government has been waging has not been against drugs , but against people and the laws of economics .
The results have been violence , corruption , and a militarized society .
A basic law of economics states that when there is less of something that people want , that item will become more expensive .
Because drugs are illegal and their supply restricted , their price rises .
As the price of drugs goes up , people who were previously on the fence about dealing drugs find dealing worth the risk .
Higher profits always attract new suppliers , whether the market is legal or not .
Intensifying the drug war makes it more profitable to be a drug dealer .
The drug war creates drug lords and drug cartels .
The ironic thing about prices is that the street prices of drugs are the barometer by which the drug warriors gauge their effectiveness .
If the street price goes up , they conclude that there are now fewer drugs on the streets and that they are winning  the war .
They might as well call  the drug war a dealers  jobs program .
Criminals making incredible profits buy politicians , bureaucrats , and police .
There is simply no way around it .
As long as drugs are illegal , there are going to be government officials who are willing to help the drug dealers for a price .
The drug war corrupts the government .
By making drugs illegal , the government precludes participants in the drug market from using the legal system .
Disputes can no longer be settled in court .
Competition among rival businesses is not settled by efficient marketing and a quality product , but by violence .
It is the only recourse of competitors .
Drug dealers cant go to the police to report theft , fraud , blackmail , or even murder , because they put themselves at risk by doing so .
The drug war incites theft and violence .
The drug war also makes criminals out of good people who use drugs .
Using illicit drugs is frowned on by most , but a person has the right to ingest anything he wants as long as he does not infringe on the rights of others in the process .
The vast majority of the millions of people whom the government has incarcerated are people who have not violated the rights of others .
They have simply put something in their bodies that the government doesnt approve of .
The drug war criminalizes nonviolent activity .
The police state has swelled in large part because of the war on drugs .
Every year , SWAT teams across the country kick down the doors of homes looking for drugs .
Armed with tanks and military weapons , they inevitably end up killing people in the process .
As a senior editor at Reason magazine , Radley Balko , states , its an epidemic of isolated incidences .
The drug war militarizes society .
We have seen this all happen before .
When the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment prohibited the sale of alcohol , the booze still flowed and organized crime took over where legitimate business was forbidden .
As the booze flowed , so did the blood .
Chicago was particularly hard hit by Prohibition , with Al Capone spreading murder and corruption throughout the city .
The economics of the drug market cannot be altered .
The war on drugs produces violence in the streets , puts thugs in charge of a whole sector of the economy , and violates the rights of peaceful citizens .
This has been going on for decades .
If drugs were legalized , the drug trade would be disciplined by the market and not by violence .
People would be free to use drugs , as is their right .
And the police state would lose its primary excuse for bashing down peoples doors and seizing their property .
Why continue this madness ?
It is time to legalize drugs .

The Best of Bart Frazier
In grappling with deep philosophical issues , we are sometimes pushed towards theories we should never have adopted for their own sake .
The ideas on this page are classic cases of this kind - if you find your theory leads you into one of these positions , it 's a sign that you need to look again at your theory ...
Homunculus
An homunculus is a ' little man ' .
It 's evident that we do n't literally have a small but fully - formed person in our heads controlling what we do , but some explanations of consciousness fail because they include a central observer which itself has all the mental properties a conscious person would have , in effect an homunculus .
Explaining such a central person is obviously as difficult as explaining consciousness in the first place , and the hypothesis therefore does not get us very far .
The normal argument , in fact , is that homuncular arguments actually fall into an infinite regress , with the consciousness of each homunculus explained by ever smaller homunculini , nested like Russian dolls : but in fact this only applies to the hard - line homuncularist position that homunculi are the only possible explanation of consciousness .
One can still believe that there is , as a matter of fact , an homunculus who is responsible for our consciousness , but that his consciousness is explained on some other basis .
Most would agree , after all that thereis a central entity inside us which does all the thinking - namely the brain .
Generally , however , homunculi are regarded as evidently absurd , and used mainly as a smear against other people 's theories .
Daniel Dennett is an unexpected exception here .
No-one , in principle , is more hostile than Dennett to the idea of a central observer : Consciousness Explained repeatedly denounces the idea of the ' Cartesian Theatre ' , whose audience must surely be an homunculus ( although the same book proposes a ' Joycean Narrator ' , and one might question whether the substitution of an Irish novel for a French play makes all that much difference ) .
At the same time , Dennett has claimed that cognitive scientists frequently use homunculi in their tentative theories , and that their practice demonstrates that it is alright to do so .
The apparent inconsistency is explained by the loose interpretation which Dennett gives to ' homunculus ' : he really means something more like a ' black box ' : part of a process which cannot yet be explained , but which we take for granted for the time being in order to get on with developing the rest of a theory in the meantime .
Strictly , to be an homunculus , a component has to be fully conscious in its own right , or at least have a full set of conscious mental abilities , not just a particular narrowly - defined function .
Dualism Dualism is the belief that there are two different worlds , or two fundamentally different kinds of stuff , in existence : matter and spirit , for example .
In spite of being the received wisdom for hundreds of years , it is actually unsustainable inits strict form .
The problem arises when you consider how the two kinds of stuff , or the two worlds , interact .
If they interact directly , they are in effect parts of a single world after all , or different forms of essentially similar stuff .
If spirits affect the behaviour of material objects , they can best be thought of as another aspect of the physical world , albeit one which to date remains relatively obscure .
Matter and energy , after all , are regarded as parts of the same world .
It does not help to postulate intermediary stuff linking two worlds or two substances because the same problems recur for the relationship between the stuff in each world and the intermediary stuff .
If , on the other hand , the two worlds do n't interact , one of them is effectively null .
We , the observers , must exist in one or other of the worlds ( or be made of one or other kind of stuff ) : since the other stuff or the other world cannot affect us , we can never be aware of it and talking about it at all is a waste of time .
For reasons of this kind , and because it has sometimes been a refuge for people who would prefer things to remain unexplained , dualism has become a kind of smear which philosophers sometimes hurl at each other 's theories .
Most people believe the world is complex to some degree , and most accept that different levels of explanation are required in order to say all that is worth saying about it , which means there is always some hook in anyone 's theory on which an accusation of dualism can be hung .
There are , in any case , many different varieties of dualism , of differing degrees of radicalism .
A distinction is normally drawn , in particular , between full - blown substance dualism , and property dualism , which recognises only one underlying kind of stuff , but asserts that it has two unrelated sets of properties .
In recent years , Descartes has rather unjustly come in for particularly heavy criticism over his dualism , and it seems to have become almost mandatory to start any popular book about consciousness by criticising him for it ( while borrowing one of the quaint illustrations from his books ) .
He is often baselessly accused of originating the whole idea or of having invented , rather than perpetuated , the distinction between body and soul .
Of course he was a dualist , but in that respect he was merely giving a slightly more secular expression to a belief which was pretty well universal for centuries before ( and after ) his time .
It might be fairer to see him as restricting the role of the spirit ; he believed that most actions of the human body were purely mechanical , rather than directly actuated by spiritual influence , so he deserves respect from materialists .
Dualism still has its appeal : the Platonic form which gives numbers and abstract entities a real existence in a world of their own seems to appeal to mathematicians , and physicists talk about other worlds , though in both cases it is often unclear how far this is a metaphor , or a dramatic way of talking about levels of explanation rather than a genuine ontological commitment .
Two of the thinkers touched on in these pages - Roger Penrose and John Eccles - advocate theories of three worlds .
In spite of the hostility of most ( not all ) philosophers towards dualism , moreover , discussions of alternative worlds remains a popular method of argument about possibility , identity , and indeed , consciousness .
Dualism also remains a basic component of much religious and paranormal theory , and hence an influential part of the intellectual background .
Epiphenomenalism Epiphenomenalism is the view that one 's actions are not caused by one 's thoughts : that we are really just passive spectators under the illusion that we control our own behaviour .
The idea appeals to those who want to accept that physics explains the causes of all events , including the behaviour of human beings , while still regarding consciousness as something over and above this merely mechanical process .
The idea is lent some ( much - needed ) plausibility by Libet 's famous experiments which seem to show that decisions are effectively made before we become aware of having made them : and by many others which demonstrate people 's remarkable tendency to invent reasons , and accept responsibility for , behaviour which was actually caused by a post - hypnotic suggestion , a brain malfunction , or other factors they were not consciously aware of .
Strictly , of course , speech is another form of behaviour , so a rigorous epiphenomenalist would actually have to hold that these rationalisations and confabulations were also nothing to do with the person in themselves .
Philosophically , epiphenomenalism is hard to maintain because it makes the person - in - themselves so completely irrelevant .
It seems better to locate personhood somewhere in the material process , or even do without it altogether .
Epiphenomenalists are faced with the task of explaining how our conscious thoughts and our physical actions remain in such close harmony , which is impossible to do without raising further difficulties .
Philosophically , therefore , the idea is generally regarded as untenable ( though it has some appeal for David Chalmers , for example ) : in psychological discussions , a looser sense of the word is sometimes used , to mean a doctrine that people merely have much less conscious control over their actions than they believe .
We could illustrate the distinction between these two readings of epiphenomenalism by drawing an analogy between a human being and a large corporation .
A ' corporate epiphenomenalist ' would assert that the chief executive actually had no control over the organisation .
On the strict philosophical reading , this would have to mean he had no influence on the organisation at all ; on this view we should find ourselves forced to admit he drew no salary ( because that would affect the balance sheet , however slightly ) , had no office , and , in fact , was effectively invisible and intangible .
On the looser reading , these difficulties would not arise : the chief executive could be a substantial member of the corporate community : he could even write the Annual Report and issue convincing press releases ; he just would n't normally be able to get any internal memos or instructions acted upon .
.
Solipsism Solipsism is the belief that nothing really exists except oneself .
So far as I know there are no actual solipsists ( then again there might be hundreds of silent ones - solipsism rather undercuts the incentive to publish ) ; nevertheless the idea is interesting in that it represents one extreme version of the strategy of putting the boot on the other foot .
This strategy is the one adopted by those idealists who , rather than accepting the physical world and trying to explain how consciousness goes with it , begin instead with consciousness , and demand a justification of belief in the physical world .
The ultimate position in this direction must surely be to deny the existence of anything outside your own mind .
Solipsism also functions as a kind of black hole which threatens to draw in other radical and sceptical viewpoints , especially epiphenomenalism .
If you 're an epiphenomenalist , you must believe that any other conscious entities in the world are incapable of communicating with you , or exerting any influence on the world - so what grounds can you have for believing in them ?
It would be a more economical hypothesis to believe that they , and the material world , are really just figments of your own imagination .
Ultimately it 's impossible to prove that solipsism is wrong ; we can only point to the regularities in our experience which are most easily explained by the existence of other entities , some of them conscious .
The strongest objection is that , taken seriously enough , solipsism does n't make any difference .
So everything but me is just my dream - so what ?
Even dreams are entities and require explanation , and to ignore them , while we are dreaming , would be as irrational as ignoring reality while awake .
.
Panpsychism
Panpsychism Panpsychists believe that everything is to some extent conscious , or looking at it another way , that conscious entities are all there really is .
This neatly reverses the usual argument by taking consciousness as given and forcing opponents to explain and justify their belief in the reality of inanimate objects .
Those who lean towards relativism may find this a comfortable position because it allows them to conceive of the world as consisting only of points of view .
Equally , if you are one of the people who think real , phenomenal consciousness has no place in the chain of physical cause and effect , why should n't everything be conscious ?
It would n't make any perceptible difference , so there 's no way you can prove it is n't the case : and if everything were conscious , it might help to make the prescence of consciousness in human beings seem less anomalous .
David Chalmers speaks rather wistfully about the attraction of panpsychism , without quite comitting himself to it .
Equally , however , there can be no good reason to believe it is the case ; and the usual principle , known as Occam 's Razor , is not to believe in any additional entities ( such as the consciousness of stones and anvils ) which are n't strictly necessary .
There are a few issues to deal with , too : if everything is conscious , what counts as a thing ?
If this stone is conscious , is the left hand side of it separately conscious too ?
Is the strange but surely valid entity consisting of my left foot and a small portion of Tower Bridge conscious ?
But the ultimate problem is that panpsychism does not really revolutionise the argument the way it promises to do .
The real issue facing us is to explain the difference between being conscious and not being conscious , and in another form this remains the problem even for those who think everything is conscious .
If panpsychism is true , an anvil has a form of consciousness , but one which does not influence its behaviour .
My body , which after all is a physical object too , must have this same sort of ineffectual consciousness , but I also have another kind , the kind which causes me to speak , move , and act .
Explaining the relationship between these two kinds of consciousness comes down to much the same thing as explaining my consciousness from a non-panpsychist materialist position .
More than 11 million people are expected to be subject to checks Parents who regularly drive children for sports or social clubs will have to be vetted or face fines of up to £ 5,000 under new rules .
Along with parents who host foreign exchange students , they will fall under the scope of the Vetting and Barring Scheme , the Home Office has confirmed .
The measures to stop paedophiles are being introduced from next month in England , Wales and Northern Ireland .
Critics have branded them " insulting " and say they could deter volunteers .
A separate but aligned scheme is being set up in Scotland , to be introduced next year .
Also , anyone barred in any part of the UK will be barred from working with children and vulnerable adults anywhere else .
' Frequent , intensive '
Informal arrangements between parents will not be covered , but anyone taking part in activities involving " frequent " or " intensive " contact with children or vulnerable adults three times in a month , every month , or once overnight , must register , it has emerged .
The government 's Vetting and Barring Scheme is a child of moral panic
Mark Easton
BBC 's home editor
Read Mark 's thoughts in full Q&A : Vetting and barring scheme All 300,000 school governors , as well as every doctor , nurse , teacher , dentist and prison officer will also have to sign up .
It is thought that 11.3 million people in England , Wales and Northern Ireland - close to one in four of all adults - may register with the Home Office 's Independent Safeguarding Authority [ ISA ] .
According to BBC home affairs editor Mark Easton it is thought out of that 11.3 million , " something will come up " , such as a conviction , for about one million .
" Of those million , they reckon 40,000 will be told they are unsuitable to work in those regulated areas , " he said .
After November 2010 failure to register could lead to criminal prosecution and fine .
The clubs themselves also face a £ 5,000 penalty for using non-vetted volunteers .
Children 's minister Delyth Morgan said : " It is about ensuring that people in a position of trust that work frequently and intensively with children are safe to do so .
" Ultimately safeguarding children is the government 's priority . "
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said : " This new regime has the potential to be a real disaster for activities involving young people .
" We are going to drive away volunteers , we 'll see clubs and activities close down and we 'll end up with more bored young people on our streets . "

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said the government was " in danger of creating a world in which we think every adult who approaches children means to do them harm " .
But John O'Brien , programme director of the Vetting and Barring Scheme , said it would be a " once-only , simple step " .
He denied it was a " presumption of guilt " .
He told the BBC's Today programme : " We want to make sure we have got appropriate safeguards in place so that people with backgrounds we do n't want to work with children and vulnerable adults are not entering the workplace . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
Our children need protection but this is going too far Fran Banks , Essex Bob Reitemeier , chief executive of the Children 's Society , said the new safeguards were the result of many years of research into abuse .
" What we have to understand is there 's a great amount of learning that has been taking place over the years in looking at how people are abused and we have to apply that learning . "
' Soft intelligence '
The scheme was recommended by the Bichard report into the Soham murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman by college caretaker Ian Huntley .
Huntley had been given the job despite previous allegations of sex with under - age girls , which were not passed on .
Two hundred case workers at the ISA 's Darlington base will collect information from police , professional bodies and employers , before ruling who is barred .
The rules aim to stop those like Soham killer Ian Huntley accessing children
Even those like Huntley , without a criminal record , could be barred if officials are convinced by other " soft intelligence " against them .
Estimates suggest the number of people facing a ban will double to 40,000 once the scheme is up and running .
Those registered will face continuing scrutiny , with existing registrations reconsidered if new evidence is disclosed .
However , Soham report author Sir Michael Bichard suggested the scheme could be revised .
He told the Independent newspaper last month : " If you visit one school in January , and then do n't visit that school again , but visit another school in February and another in March , is that frequent or intensive ? "
He was speaking after a number of authors , including Philip Pullman and Michael Morpurgo , complained the requirement was " insulting " and pledged to quit school visits .
Mr Pullman described the scheme as " rather dispiriting and sinister " .
" It 's so ludicrous that it 's almost funny , " he said .
Registration will cost £ 64 in England and Wales , but unpaid volunteers will be exempt from the charge .

If you visit Ireland after October , you 'd better watch what you say about God .
A blasphemous slip of the tongue could cost you 25,000 euros under revamped legislation that will soon be signed into law .
Blasphemy is an act of challenging or offending a religious belief .
In recent years , western countries such as England have been taking blasphemy laws off the books , or changing their focus so that they cover hate - related crimes in general .
Ireland has taken a different approach , updating its legislation but maintaining a focus on religion .
In Ireland , it has been a crime to publish blasphemous material since 1961 , although nobody has ever been convicted .
The Seanad , the Irish senate and upper level of parliament , passed the Defamation Bill in July that makes uttering blasphemy a crime as well .
The bill was originally proposed in 2006 .
It worked its way through parliament and received final approval on July 10 this year , when it passed by a slim margin of 23 - 22 .
Lorraine Weinrib , a law professor at the University of Toronto , says the bill is a modern update of blasphemy laws .
" I do n't see this as a new thing as much as an old thing that has n't quite disappeared in Ireland , " she says .
" Unlike the old blasphemy laws which only protected the dominant religion [ Roman Catholicism ] … this one seems to protect all religions , so it kind of has a modern equality bent to it , " Weinrib adds .
But blasphemy laws can have an impact on freedom of expression , Weinrib says .
" They create a crime where one of the basic elements of the crime is subjective outrage of particular people .
So there 's really no objective measure , and this can cause a disruption in the modern understanding of the relationship between religion and the public space of a liberal democracy . "
Even so , Weinrib points out that under Ireland 's new legislation , in order to be found guilty , there has to be proof that the offender intended to cause outrage with a statement that is abusive or insulting .
The statement also has to produce a violent reaction .
The bill states that a person publishes or utters blasphemous matter if :
He or she publishes or utters matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion , thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion .
He or she intends , by the publication or utterance of the matter concerned , to cause such outrage .
The bill puts the onus on a defendant to prove that a reasonable person would find genuine literary , artistic , political , scientific , or academic value in the matter to which the offence relates .
" I think we 're talking about central issues — for example , a depiction of Christ as a homosexual … many religious people find this outrageous and their reaction is intense , " says Weinrib .
" The intent of the outrage still needs to be proven in this case . "
Ireland is not alone in having laws that take aim at blasphemy .
Canada lists blasphemous libel as a crime under the Criminal Code , which carries a penalty of up to two years in jail .
But the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees free speech rights that supersede the blasphemy law .
The Canadian code says , " No person shall be convicted of an offence under this section for expressing in good faith and in decent language , or attempting to establish by argument used in good faith and conveyed in decent language , an opinion on a religious subject . "
Many countries have abolished their blasphemy laws in recent years .
In Britain , the Church of England ( and by default , Christianity ) was protected from blasphemy up until last year when the government reviewed the law .
The U.K. voted to abolish blasphemy laws on Jan. 10 , 2008 .
In the United States , blasphemy has never been considered a crime .
In countries where Islam is the state religion , blasphemy is still considered a serious offence .
In countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan , the penalty for blasphemous crimes can be execution .
A number of Islamic countries have been pursuing an international anti-blasphemy resolution at the United Nations that would restrict any speech that is offensive to any religion .
But that approach assumes everyone is religious , Weinrib says , and issues can crop up when two religious groups have contradictory points of view .
Here are some significant historical events involving blasphemy :
Several sources , including this one , indicate that Michael Moore has a net worth of over $ 50 million .
On Saturday , September 26 , 2009 , CNN had an encore presentation of a recent interview with Michael Moore on Larry King Live .
In it , Moore said :
‘ No money in Switzerland .
I do n’t own a share of stock .
I have no money in the stock market .
My money is in pretty much a savings account and savings bonds , those kinds of things .
But – ”
Savings accounts and savings bonds are currently only insured up to “ $ 250,000 per deposit , per insured bank , ” up until December 31 , 2013 , at which point it will decrease to $ 100,000 .
Either Michael Moore is foolish , has additional private insurance , or has most of his money distributed over 200 + banks .
If it ’s the latter , then by January 1 , 2014 , he ’ll have to distribute his money over 500 + banks .
If he ’s foolish , then he can kiss most of his money goodbye if there is a repeat of the 5000 + bank failures from 1929 - 1932 .
On Monday , hundreds of students at Tehran University demonstrated , causing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to cancel his visit there .
On Sunday , students held a smaller protest outside the philosophy department building of Tehran University , where a member of Parliament , Gholam Ali Hadad Adel , gave a speech .
The student protests were the first of the new school year , which began last week , and took place despite the arrests of dozens of student leaders around the country this summer and increased pressure on others not to demonstrate .
Several influential university professors and former student leaders have also been jailed since June .
Dozens of student activists have been jailed this month or barred from attending classes , according to student Web sites , in an effort to intimidate students .
The absence of student leaders suggested that the demonstrations were spontaneous , analysts said .
“ Student leaders do not have a formal presence , ” said Ali Afshari , a former student leader who is currently in Washington and is still in touch with students in Iran .
“ They have all been summoned and threatened .
But the frustration is very widespread and the government can only shut down the universities if it wants to stop the protests . ”
The protest movement , which has produced some of the nation ’s worst unrest in 30 years , emerged as a response to a widespread belief that Mr. Ahmadinejad falsified election results in his favor .
Universities have often been the site of protests , partly because of a student pro-democracy network , the Office for Consolidating Unity , and a law that bars police officers from entering campuses .

BBC News
The Guardian 's editor , Alan Rusbridger , thanked ' tweeters ' for their support
When is a secret not a secret ?
When it 's on Twitter .
An injunction served on the Guardian and at least one other national newspaper was meant to stop the papers reporting that the MP Paul Farrelly had tabled a Parliamentary question about the oil traders Trafigura and its solicitors Carter - Ruck .
And it succeeded - up to a point .
In a front - page story , the Guardian said it was prevented from identifying the MP who had asked the question , what the question was , which minister might answer it , or where the question was to be found .
In a twist the paper described as " Kafka - esque " , it was also banned from telling its readers why it had been banned from doing so .
In one sense , the injunction was effective .
In most of the mainstream media this morning , you would have found no mention of who or what was involved .
Red rag
No injunction was served on the BBC , but ever since the Spycatcher case in the 1980s news organisations which knowingly breach an injunction served on others are in contempt of court , so the corporation too felt bound by the Guardian injunction .
But the lawyers in this case clearly reckoned without the " blogosphere " .
In the anarchic , anything - goes world of the internet , where free speech is a frequently - heard rallying cry , injunctions banning publication of anything are unpopular .
This one seems to have acted like a red rag to a bull .
The social networking site Twitter was soon awash with posts deploring a threat to media freedom and the reporting of Parliament .
It 's a bit like an artist achieving a Radio 1 ban , which can result in chart success .
What you seek to suppress only generates further interest
Econsultancy
Guardian claims victory on ' gag ' Stephen Fry , celebrity tweeter , called it " this barbaric assault on free speech " , and the very information Trafigura and its lawyers were anxious to keep secret was being freely bandied about .
Guido Fawkes 's political blog and the website of at least one mainstream publication , The Spectator , apparently chose to ignore the injunction entirely .
A Google search for Trafigura in mid-morning threw up a dozen online articles on the subject .
Favoured few
The digital marketing company Econsultancy - on its own website - observed all the activity on Twitter , saying : " This tidal wave of tweets makes for particularly bad PR , given the banning order against the newspaper .
" It 's a bit like an artist achieving a Radio 1 ban , which can result in chart success .
What you seek to suppress only generates further interest . "
Imposing injunctions on news organisations has never been a foolproof way of stopping information from leaking out .
But in the old days , when the principal means of transmission was word of mouth , only a favoured few ever got to hear of it .
Trafigura will deny it had anything to do with Twitter , but we know do n't we ?
We know !
Yay !!!
Stephen Fry
The digital revolution has changed all that .
Anyone with a PC or a laptop or an iPhone or a Blackberry , or any other digitally - enabled device , can now discover what all the fuss is about .
On this occasion the injunction seems to have been utterly counterproductive .
The Guardian obtained a High Court hearing to challenge the injunction this afternoon .
But at lunchtime Carter - Ruck bowed to the inevitable , and the Guardian 's website was soon running full details .
The first news , of course , came from the Guardian 's editor , Alan Rusbridger , via Twitter .
" Thanks to Twitter / all tweeters for fantastic support over past 16 hours ! " he wrote .
And the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg tweeted : " Really pleased Guardian ban has been lifted .
This is a victory for freedom of speech and online activism " .
And Stephen Fry 's reaction ?
" Can it be true ?
Carter - Ruck caves in !
Hurrah !
Trafigura will deny it had anything to do with Twitter , but we know do n't we ?
We know !
Yay !!! "

Moved by a new spirit
THE church of La Placita , “ the little square ” , formally called Nuestra Señora Reina de Los Angeles , was founded under Spanish rule at around the same time as the pueblo bearing the same name , the future Los Angeles .
As the land on which it stood became first Mexican and then American , it always stayed Latino in both look and character , says Father Richard Estrada .
Catholicism and Hispanic culture seemed inseparable there .
They still largely are .
Virtually all Father Estrada 's parishioners are Hispanic , most of them of Mexican extraction .
When Guatemalan and Salvadorean refugees showed up in the 1980s , it was natural for them , as good Catholics , to find sanctuary at La Placita , where they slept on the pews and Father Estrada gave them food .
It was natural again in 2006 , when the country went on an anti-immigrant binge , for many of the Latino counter - marches to start from La Placita .
Latinos still come from all over southern California for baptisms and prayer , social services and a sense of community .
But more and more grandmothers also come to Father Estrada with worries about children or grandchildren who have become hermanos separados , separated brothers , after defecting to an evangelical church , usually one with a Pentecostal flavour .
The converts may have followed one of the evangelicals who come to La Placita to recruit , or friends whom they met at a spiritual rock concert or picnic .
“ I do n't worry , but I find it to be challenging , ” says Father Estrada .
Some 68 % of Hispanics in America are still Catholic , according to the Pew Research Centre , a think - tank , and their absolute number , thanks to immigration and higher birth rates , continues to increase .
But about 15 % are now born - again evangelicals , who are fast gaining “ market share ” , as Gaston Espinosa , a professor of religion at Claremont McKenna College , puts it .
He estimates that about 3.9 m Latino Catholics have converted , and that “ for every one who comes back to the Catholic church , four leave it . ”
The main reason , he thinks , is ethnic identity .
Evangelical services are not only in Spanish , as many Catholic sermons are nowadays , but are performed by Latinos rather than Irish or Polish - American priests , with the cadences , rhythms , innuendos and flow familiar from the mother country .
The evangelical services tend to be livelier than Catholic liturgy and to last longer , often turning into an outing lasting the whole day .
Women play greater roles , and there are fewer parishioners for each pastor than in the Catholic church .
The evangelical churches are also more “ experiential ” , says Samuel Rodriguez , a third - generation Puerto Rican Pentecostal pastor and the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference , an evangelical association .
In the Catholic church , a believer 's relationship with Jesus is mediated through hierarchies and bureaucracies , he says , whereas the evangelical churches provide direct access to Jesus .
The Pentecostals go one step further , with the “ gifts of the Holy Spirit ” ( 1 Corinthians ) letting believers speak in tongues and pray for divine healing .
“ This is the first group in America to reconcile both the vertical and the horizontal parts of the cross , ” says Mr Rodriguez .
By this he means that the Latino evangelical churches emphasise not only “ covenant , faith and righteousness ” ( the vertical part ) , as white evangelicals do , but also “ community , public policy and social justice ” ( the horizontal part ) , as many black evangelicals , but fewer white ones , do .
To Latino evangelicals it is all one thing , he says , and the social outreach the church provides goes far beyond any government programme , with pastors snatching young men away from gang life and fighting to uphold the rights of immigrants .
This also means that Latino evangelicals as a political force are distinct from white evangelicals .
Many of the whites have veered hard right , hating abortion and gay marriage and reliably voting Republican , though less so very recently .
Latinos tend to be even more pro-life and traditional marriage than whites , says Mr Rodriguez , but only because they know that “ mom and dad in the home is the prime antidote to gangs and drugs . ”
That same pragmatism makes them believe in government services and the taxes that pay for them , and of course in immigrant rights .
As voters , he reckons , Latino evangelicals are therefore the quintessential independents , up for grabs by either party .
But it may be American Catholicism that changes the most .
About a third of American Catholics are Latino now , and their share is growing .
Their influence is not only physical and linguistic , with more of them turning up at church .
They are also different Catholics , with more than half describing themselves as “ charismatics ” , according to the Pew report .
Charismatics remain in their traditional denomination , but believe in some aspects of Pentecostalism , such as the gifts of the Holy Spirit , especially the speaking in tongues .
Latino charismatics see themselves as a renewal movement within Catholicism , as it converges with other churches .
And in general all churchgoing Latinos tend to see themselves as renewing Christianity in America .
That makes them a powerful force as demographic changes turn America ever more Hispanic , and increasingly different from secular Europe .
' Turnarounds ' the deadliest reform of all ...
Safety at Fenger High School was undermined by ' Turnaround , ' ' School Reform '
[ Editor 's Note :
The following commentary appears in the Chicago Sun -Times of October 2 , 2009 and was provided to www.substancenews.net by Deborah Lynch , who wrote it . ]
Chicago 's Christian Fenger High School at 11220 S. Wallace St. during the week after the murder of Fenger junior Derrion Albert .
Substance photo by George N. Schmidt .
There has n't been much mention in the coverage of the tragedy near Fenger High School of the fact that Fenger is a " turnaround " school .
That means it was subjected to the Chicago Public School system 's latest attack on struggling schools by dumping all the staff , even the engineers , and keeping the same students .
This " reform " was after probation , restructuring , reconstitution and a host of other unsuccessful Daley - team draconian , top - down efforts .
School turnarounds have turned out to be the deadliest reform of all .
How could anyone expect that completely eliminating all the professionals and staff of a tough high - poverty high school could be a good thing ?
Contrary to popular belief , teachers and staff in schools such as Fenger and Gage Park and other neglected neighborhood high schools love their students and ( usually ) love their jobs .
We have relationships with kids who may not even have another adult in their homes , or their lives .
It 's called human capital .
We know brothers and sisters and , in some cases , have taught their parents .
We ask them how their sick mother is or how their job search is going or whether they have met the school 's community service requirement yet .
We give them bus money when they have forgotten theirs .
We share our lunches with those who missed breakfast .
We kid them , we laugh with them , we exhort them to do better , to get to school on time , to work hard .
A colleague buys suit jackets for the guys to wear to graduation .
Another takes kids to get prom dresses .
The list of connections and affection and love and sharing goes on and on .
Oh yes , and we teach them .
Yet you have to have a relationship with these kids in order to teach them .
No , they are not all perfect , but most teachers would say that 90 percent of our students are great kids who want to learn .
No one at Fenger this year has known their kids for more than three weeks .
This is a tragedy for all the students , not to mention the effects of the staff elimination on the staff .
( Many Fenger teachers devoted decades of their lives to these students , only to have their employer kick them to the curb for a newfangled reform to make the mayor look good . )
I am not saying that knowing the kids better could have averted the melee and tragic death of last week , obviously .
But trouble had been brewing at the school even before last week .
Staff reported a riot the previous week inside the building , involving teachers being hit , and that two different police stations had to be called in to quell the disturbance .
Those are the times when the staff members draw on their relationships with kids to urge restraint , to urge calm and peace , to try to talk things out rather than fight things out .
Those are the times when a seasoned staff can identify strategies and resources to address and prevent further problems .
These neighborhood high schools have been underfunded , under - resourced and poorly managed .
For example , CPS provides only one security guard for every 400 students !
If schools need more ( and they do ) they have to cut into classroom funds , further disadvantaging students with larger class sizes .
Our schools do n't have enough social workers or psychologists to provide critically needed support for these students .
Research shows that high - poverty students respond best to low class sizes , but CPS would rather invest in high - priced fancy consulting firms .
One program for high school curriculum redesign , for example , costs CPS more than $ 31 million each year .
This money goes to for - profit firms that provide books and personnel to " coach " teachers .
CPS could use that money for smaller class sizes and enough qualified personnel to really make a difference , but " turnaround " has more media spin .
So another poorly thought out " reform " has been implemented , this time associated with fatal consequences for one poor student and his family .
It 's a tragedy and a travesty .
It will be in the media for a while .
CPS will add security staff to Fenger for a while .
Then it will be on to the next tragedy .
In the meantime , if this policy continues , more schools will be turned around and more staff and students will suffer needlessly .
CPS needs to look to its staff for solutions to addressing the increasingly violent world our students are living in , not continue to view us as the problem .
Deborah Lynch , a teacher at Gage Park High School , is past president of the Chicago Teachers Union . 

My partner and I still own a vehicle .
And it is no micro , go - cart that I need to watch lest a rogue pack of Girl Guides tip it over .
Neither is it a hybrid .
It is a small North American truck with four wheel drive .
It is thousands of pounds of glass , rubber , steel , and old pollution - reduction technology .
But it is black and shiny , and I knew when I first laid eyes on it that we were destined to travel the open and rough road together .
I agreed to feed it regular fuel , oil , and other mechanical fluids , as well as lavish it with a large portion of my monthly income in order to keep it in top shape .
It , in turn , promised to free me from the drudgery of the every day , and propel me and my stuff to any exciting destination of my choice .
And return me home safely .
All the while making me look like a rugged and able individual ( ick , how North American ) .
It was a useful and completely justified purchase , I told myself .
I had visions of stream crossings , water fans spraying up from gnarly tires .
Steep hills , washboard logging roads , and deep snow were now nothing against the four clawing wheels of my uber - mobility device .
It would be worth it .
If you live in North America you need a car , right ?
And if a two wheeler is good , a four wheeler is better .
We haunted the backroads and logging roads of British Columbia for a couple of months each year after we bought the truck .
This was not so long ago when the Provincial Forestry Service maintained hundreds of back country camp grounds , most of them free .
Only a few are free now , and many others have been decommissioned due to funding cuts of years gone by .
While it lasted , though , it was a great way to spend a few weeks of rustic camping for low cost .
However , most of the time our truck , which was " built tough " , was handling the hazards of a modern city : construction zones , potholes , terribly rough pavement , the odd foot or two of snow , and appearances at the opera .
Of course , my friend Sarah handles all that on her daily mountain bike commute , although I am not sure she can get the valet parking at the opera .
Today , living in our truck and driving crazy roads far from everywhere for weeks at a time seems extravagant , both in the outlay of money for fuel , and the environmental impact .
However , it was probably nothing compared to my daily slogging commute to school in the city .
When we were in the city we asked ourselves where we would like to be when fossil fuels ran out .
What if we could n't , or chose not to , drive ?
We figured we better like where we were if the farthest we could get was under our own power .
We decided on the west coast .
When we got here we gave ourselves a limit for driving : an area 50 kms ( 31 miles ) from home .
After a while we reduced that to 40 kms ( 24 miles ) , then 30 ( 18 miles ) .
Since then we have discovered more than enough in our immediate neighbourhood and community to keep us busy and adventuring for the foreseeable future .
I am rediscovering cycling , and am having the best year for cycle adventures since I was a 10 year old hippie - in - training living in Eugene , Oregon ( while my dad went to school ) .
My bicycle has delivered the freedom that the auto manufactures promise , but can't deliver with their current products .
I roll along my local roadways and trails completely carbon - free , feeling fit and completely liberated from the complication , expense , and danger of driving .
Perhaps I can trade the truck for a cycle rickshaw , and transport my partner in style , carbon - free .
Better yet , maybe someone will think of a simple , sustainable solution to our personal mobility needs , although it is difficult to improve on tried and true technologies .

Currently , we drive just a few times a month .
Often that is for work .
The rest of the time I have been using my bicycle for errands .
We are now to the point where we are wondering why we should keep a private vehicle at all .
The shiny truck feels more like an expensive ball and chain than the freedom machine that manufacturers ' ads depict .

TEHRAN - Pakistan ’s former chief of army staff , General Mirza Aslam Beg ( ret. ) , has said the U.S. private security company Blackwater was directly involved in the assassinations of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto and former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri .
Blackwater later changed its name and is now known as Xe.
General Beg recently told the Saudi Arabian daily Al Watan that former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf had given Blackwater the green light to carry out terrorist operations in the cities of Islamabad , Rawalpindi , Peshawar , and Quetta .
General Beg , who was chief of army staff during Benazir Bhutto ’s first administration , said U.S. officials always kept the presence of Blackwater in Pakistan secret because they were afraid of possible attacks on the U.S. Embassy and its consulates in Pakistan .
During an interview with a Pakistani TV network last Sunday , Beg claimed that the United States killed Benazir Bhutto .
Beg stated that the former Pakistani prime minister was killed in an international conspiracy because she had decided to back out of the deal through which she had returned to the country after nine years in exile .
Beg also said he believes that the former director general of Pakistan ’s Inter Services Intelligence was not an accomplice in the conspiracy against Benazir Bhutto , although she did not trust him .
The retired Pakistani general also stated that Benazir Bhutto was a sharp politician but was not as prudent as her father .
On September 2 , the U.S. ambassador to Islamabad , Anne W. Patterson , intervened with one of the largest newspaper groups in Pakistan , The News International , to force it to block a decade - old weekly column by Dr. Shireen Mazari scheduled for publication on September 3 in which Mazari , the former director of the Islamabad Institute of Strategic Studies , broke the story of Blackwater / Xe ’s presence in Pakistan .
The management of The News International dismissed one of the country ’s most prominent academics and journalists due to U.S. pressure .
She joined the more independent daily The Nation last week as an editor .
On September 9 , in her first column in The Nation , Dr. Mazari wrote : “ Now , even if one were to ignore the massive purchases of land by the U.S. , the questionable manner in which the expansion of the U.S. Embassy is taking place and the threatening covert activities of the U.S. and its ‘ partner in crime ’
Blackwater ; the unregistered comings and goings of U.S. personnel on chartered flights ; we would still find it difficult to see the whole aid disbursement issue as anything other than a sign of U.S. gradual occupation .
It is no wonder we have the term Af - Pak : Afghanistan they control through direct occupation loosely premised on a UN resolution ; Pakistan they are occupying as a result of willingly ceded sovereignty by the past and present leadership .
” According to Al Watan , Washington even used Blackwater forces to protect its consulate in the city of Peshawar .
In addition , U.S. journalist Seymour Hersh has accused former U.S vice president Dick Cheney of being involved in the Hariri assassination .
He said Cheney was in charge of a secret team that was tasked with assassinating prominent political figures .
After the assassination of Rafik Hariri in 2005 , the U.S. and a number of other countries pointed the finger at Syria , although conclusive evidence has never been presented proving Syrian involvement in the murder .

Enemy Territory
On a recent trip to Sedona , I decided to feign naiveté and enter a few shops in the guise of an open - minded seeker of knowledge .
( Wait , I really do try to be that !
Guise not needed ! )
I was prepared to have my worldview changed completely based on what I was told and what happened .
I simply would keep my opinion to myself .
I have a friend who has a serious heart condition .
It is as yet undiagnosed , and it causes considerable discomfort .
Many of the shops in Sedona sell crystals which are supposed to solve health problems such as these , so I presented my case to the shop owners and asked for help .
It went like this :
ME : Hello , can you help me ?
I have a friend who 's suffering from a heart condition , and I 'd like to see if crystals could help .
CRYSTAL MERCHANT :
Oh yes , they 're excellent for that .
Crystals are very powerful , and do n't have the side effects of pharmaceuticals .
ME : What should I buy ?
CRYSTAL MERCHANT : Let me consult a book .
She pulled out a large tome called The Crystal Bible .
I could see that it was simply a matter of looking up the word " heart " in the index .
She took out a notepad and wrote down the names of twelve different crystals .
CRYSTAL MERCHANT :
This one is for heart problems ... this one is for .. um .. problems of the heart , yes .
This one is for issues with the heart chakra .
( pause )
There are different approaches , but they wo n't interfere with each other so it 's safe .
She sped around the large store , collecting specimens and putting them into a tray like a fine chocolatier .
Every once in a while , she 'd refer back to the book , and apologize for not having some rare gem or other .
ME : Wow , that 's a lot of stones .
So what do I do with them ?
Should I just give them to my friend ?
CRYSTAL MERCHANT :
The best thing to do is hang them in a pouch from her neck , so that it hangs close to her chest .
( She pointed between her breasts . )
The pouches are over there .
ME : Wow , lots of colors .
What 's the best color for healing the heart ?
CRYSTAL MERCHANT : Green , definitely .
Here , this is a good one .
She grabbed a pouch , which looked hastily sewn out of cheap - looking cloth and attempted to fit all the stones in .
It was a considerable pile at this point , and even with her swapping samples for smaller specimens , she coud n't make them fit .
CRYSTAL MERCHANT : Well , what if you just replaced some stones each day ?
ME : Will that be OK ?
CRYSTAL MERCHANT :
Oh yes , crystals are very forgiving .
Their effects last a long time , so wearing one for even a day should have an effect even if they 're removed .
ME : OK .
At this point , there was a considerable pile of stones on the counter , weighing as much as a pound .
I imagined my friend complaining of neck straining from wearing this thing , but did n't mention it lest crystals for healing necks be added .
ME : So , how much do these cost ?
I really did n't think much about cost yet .
There were relatively small stones , semi-precious at best .
How much could they be ?
CRYSTAL MERCHANT : ( using calculator )
Looks like about $ 472 .
Oh , and $ 2.50 for the pouch .
You get a free pouch for a $ 10 pendant at most jewelers .
Apparently the special green bag of +2 heart - healing demands more than charity will allow .
ME : Wow , that 's a lot .
The last cardiologist appointment was only $ 85 .
Do you think I could just get a few and trying them out ?
CRYSTAL MERCHANT :
Well sure , that is a lot .
The more the better , of course , but you could start with a few and get more later .
I picked through the stones and picked a few of the cheapest ones and one expensive one .
The total ended up being about $ 55 .
Before you chastise me for giving money to one of these stores , I consider this research .
Yeah , she makes profit on what is probably woo woo , but I had to follow the process to see how it worked .
And I did .
I took the bag of stones and gave them to my friend , who wore them just as directed .
There was no noticeable immediate effect , but two days later something definitely changed : the condition got worse , with new symptoms .
When the stones were removed , the condition remained worse .
Is this proof the stones were actually causing heart problems ?
Of course not .
It 's just correlation , and there 's no reason to assume causation .
And if I complained that the stones did n't work , it would be pointed out that I did n't actually buy all the recommended ones .
There is no way to use the results in any useful way .
However , if the heart improved , you can be sure crystal aficionados would be claiming success .
Funny how it only works one way .
So what did I learn from this experience ?
Not a lot directly , but I did gather some new knowledge .
Most interesting to me was that a person who runs a crystal store ( they sold amber by the way , which is not a crystal ) had to look in a book to find the right stones to treat a very common ailment .
And having done so , she recommended EVERY ONE mentioned in the book .
Some of the individual stones were as much as $ 70 .
There is clearly money to be made in rocks .
I was also surprised that no discount was offered , and that even the bag was charged for .
Most small merchants will offer these things if a good customer ( one that spends significant money ) shows up .
Crystal healers ostensibly try heal people and generate good karma in the world , but this store seemed much more dedicated to making money .
I have no problem with that , by the way , but it needs to be pointed out .
Another interesting thing : there was a different feel to the New Age shops — a less friendly , more distrusting atmosphere .
I went to five or six of these shops , and they all had the same sign : " You break it , you buy it . "
Not an uncommon sign , but I only saw them in the New Age stores , and never in the other gift shops that had similarly fragile merchandise .
I looked .
Sure , I 'm a skeptic so maybe I was just uncomfortable in " enemy territory , " but a thought occurred to me : could it be that fraudulent people are less trusting , and take precautions against strangers in the assumption that they 're the same ?
Just speculation , but interesting .
So yes , I 've tried crystals .
They did n't do any good .
Maybe I did it wrong , maybe not , but regardless , I sure would n't recommend them to anyone else .
They are pretty though , and the bag of crystals is currently part of a " pirate treasure , " so at least it was n't a total waste .
In the meantime , I 'm hoping the cardiologists can help my friend .
I 'm writing about arrays in the Modern Perl book now .
While writing about push and unshift yesterday , I looked in perlfunc to see if I 'd missed anything subtle about push -- and I had :
Returns the number of elements in the array following the completed push .
I can't think of a time when I 'd used this in the past decade .
Every use of push I can think of is in void context :
push @some_array , qw ( some list of items ) ;
Curiosity convinced me to look at the bleadperl source code .
The push op is in a file called pp.c in a function called pp_push :
PP ( pp_push ) { dVAR ; dSP ; dMARK ; dORIGMARK ; dTARGET ; register AV * const ary = MUTABLE_AV (*++ MARK ) ; const MAGIC * const mg = SvTIED_mg ( ( const SV *) ary , PERL_MAGIC_tied ) ; if ( mg ) { * MARK -- = SvTIED_obj( MUTABLE_SV( ary ) , mg ) ; PUSHMARK ( MARK ) ; PUTBACK ; ENTER ; call_method ( " PUSH " , G_SCALAR|G_DISCARD ) ; LEAVE ; SPAGAIN ; SP = ORIGMARK ; if ( GIMME_V != G_VOID ) { PUSHi( AvFILL ( ary ) + 1 ) ; } } else { PL_delaymagic = DM_DELAY ; for (++ MARK ; MARK <= SP ; MARK ++) { SV * const sv = newSV ( 0 ) ; if ( * MARK ) sv_setsv( sv , * MARK ) ; av_store ( ary , AvFILLp ( ary ) + 1 , sv ) ; } if ( PL_delaymagic & DM_ARRAY ) mg_set ( MUTABLE_SV ( ary ) ) ; PL_delaymagic = 0 ; SP = ORIGMARK ; PUSHi( AvFILL ( ary ) + 1 ) ; } RETURN ; }
I know this is a big chunk of lots of macros , but it 's not too difficult to understand .
The first if branch handles the case where the array on which to push has magic -- if it 's a tied array , for example .
Ignore that .
The second branch loops through every list item provided to the op and appends them to the array .
I 've emboldened a line at the end of that branch .
The PUSHi macro pushes an integer value ( an IV , in core parlance ) onto the stack .
The AvFILL macro returns the index of the final element in the array .
Adding one to that number gives the number of elements in the array .
Every execution of this branch retrieves that value and pushes it on the stack .
Even if the opcode takes place in void context such that the compiler can determine that at compilation time , this push occurs .
I wrote a patch :
diff -- git a / pp.c b/pp.c index 9cedc3f..fbdc90 c 100644 --- a / pp.c +++ b/ pp.c @@ - 4561,7 +4561,9 @@ PP ( pp_push ) PL_delaymagic = 0 ; SP = ORIGMARK ; - PUSHi( AvFILLp ( ary ) + 1 ) ; + if ( GIMME_V != G_VOID ) { + PUSHi( AvFILL ( ary ) + 1 ) ; + } } RETURN ; }
I 've emboldened the important condition .
The GIMME_V macro evaluates to the current context of the expression .
Usually this context is statically determinable , but if this push is the final expression in a subroutine , the calling context matters .
The G_VOID macro represents void context .
In other words , do n't push anything onto the stack to return a value from this expression unless something wants that return value .
Yitzchak Scott - Thoennes commented on my patch to say that GIMME_V may be more expensive than I intended .
This is because looking up through calling scopes to find the runtime context is not always cheap .
He suggested the simplification of :
OP_GIMME ( PL_op , 0 ) != G_VOID
... to check only the compile - time context of the operator .
You can see that this cheaper check is still correct in ambiguous cases :
$ perl - MO=Concise , check_push_context sub check_push_context { push @_ , ' static void context ' ; push @_ , ' dynamic context ' ; }^D d < 1 > leavesub [ 1 ref ] K/ REFC,1 ->( end ) - < @ > lineseq KP ->d 1 <> nextstate ( main 61 push_ctx.pl:6 ) v: % , *, & , $ ->2 6 < @ > push [ t3 ] vK /2 ->7 2 < 0 > pushmark s ->3 4 < 1 > rv2 av [ t2 ] lKRM /3 ->5 3 <#> gv [*_ ] s ->4 5 < $ & ; gt const [ PV " static void context " ] s ->6 7 <> nextstate ( main 61 push_ctx .pl:7 ) v: % , *, & , $ ->8 c < @ > push [ t6 ]
sK/2 ->d 8 < 0 > pushmark s ->9 a < 1 > rv2av[ t5 ] lKRM/3 ->b 9 <#> gv [*_ ] s ->a b < $> const [ PV " dynamic context " ] s ->c
I 've emboldened the lines representing the push opcodes and I 've emphasized the relevant context flags for these ops .
The first opcode has a flag of v , which indicates that it occurs in void context .
The second opcode has a flag of s , which indicates scalar context .
Thus Yitzchak 's suggestion will work for both cases without ruining any dynamic context call of this function .
As is the case with such optimizations , the question is whether the cost of checking such an optimization possibility is worth the cost of doing the work anyway .
Measuring that , however -- well , you 're not getting huge speed improvements out of this code .
For a one - line patch and a very common use of this op , it may be worthwhile .
[ Guest post by DRJ ]
As reported by Jake Tapper :
“ President Obama ’s Justice Department last night filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia arguing that the 600 or so detainees the U.S. is holding in Afghanistan at Bagram Air Base have no right to have their cases heard in U.S. courts .
Unlike detainees at Guantanamo , those being held in Bagram – many of whom were picked up outside of Afghanistan — have had no access to attorneys or to even hear the allegations against them . ”
In the brief , Solicitor General Elena Kagan argues that whatever limited rights detainees have under the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Boumediene v Bush , which granted habeas rights to Guantanamo detainees , they “ rested heavily on the ‘ unique status of Guantanamo ’ . ”
I think it ’s time for civil rights advocates to stage their own march on Washington .
— DRJ
UPDATE : The Obama Administration also plans to extend key Patriot Act provisions that are due to expire .
This is all fine with me but it should n’t sit well with liberals who voted for Obama , especially those who cared about his vow to “ regain America ’s moral stature in the world ” .
MOLTI si chiederanno come sia possibile che in Italia si manifesti per la libertà di stampa .
Da noi non è compromessa come in Cina , a Cuba , in Birmania o in Iran .
Ma oggi manifestare o alzare la propria voce in nome della libertà di stampa , vuol dire altro .
Libertà di poter fare il proprio lavoro senza essere attaccati sul piano personale , senza un clima di minaccia .
E persino senza che ogni opinione venga ridotta a semplice presa di parte , come fossimo in una guerra dove è impossibile ragionare oltre una logica di schieramento .
Oggi , chiunque decida di prendere una posizione sa che potrà avere contro non un'opinione opposta , ma una campagna che mira al discredito totale di chi la esprime .
E persino coloro che hanno firmato un appello per la libertà di informazione devono mettere in conto che già soltanto questo gesto potrebbe avere ripercussioni .
Qualsiasi voce critica sa di potersi aspettare ritorsioni .
Libertà di stampa significa libertà di non avere la vita distrutta , di non dover dare le dimissioni , di non veder da un giorno all ' altro troncato un percorso professionale per un atto di parola , come è accaduto a Dino Boffo .
Vorrei parlare apertamente con chi , riconoscendosi nel centrodestra , dirà : " Ma che volete ?
Che cosa vi mettete a sbraitare adesso , quando siete stati voi per primi ad aver trascinato lo scontro politico sul terreno delle faccende private erigendovi a giudici morali ?
Di cosa vi lamentate se ora vi trovate ripagati con la stessa moneta ? " .
Infatti la questione non è morale .
La responsabilità chiesta alle istituzioni non è la stessa che deve avere chi scrive , pone domande , fa il suo mestiere .
Non si fanno domande in nome della propria superiorità morale .
Si fanno domande in nome del proprio lavoro e della possibilità di interrogare la democrazia .
Un giornalista rappresenta se stesso , un ministro rappresenta la Repubblica .
La democrazia funziona nel momento in cui i ruoli di entrambi sono rispettati .
Per un giornalista , fare delle domande o formulare delle opinioni non è altro che la sua funzione e il suo diritto .
Ma un cittadino che svolge il suo lavoro non può essere esposto al ricatto di vedere trascinata nel fango la propria vita privata .
E una persona che pone delle domande , non può essere tacitata e denunciata per averle poste .
Non è sulla scelta di come vive che un politico deve rispondere al proprio Paese .
Però quando si hanno dei ruoli istituzionali , si diventa ricattabili , ed è su questo piano , sul piano delle garanzie per le azioni da compiere nel solo interesse dello Stato , che chi riveste una carica pubblica è chiamato a rendere conto della propria vita .
In questi anni ho avuto molta solidarietà da persone di centrodestra .
Oggi mi chiedo : ma davvero gli elettori di centrodestra possono volere tutto questo ?
Possono ritenere giusto non solo il rifiuto di rispondere a delle domande , ma l'incriminazione delle domande stesse ?
Possono sentirsi a proprio agio quando gli attacchi contro i loro avversari prendono le mosse da chi viene mandato a rovistare nella loro sfera privata ?
Possono non vedere come la lotta fra l'informazione e chi cerca di imbavagliarla , sia impari e scorretta anche sul piano dei rapporti di potere formale ?
Chi ha votato per l'attuale schieramento di governo considerandolo più vicino ai propri interessi o alle proprie convinzioni , può guardare con indifferenza o approvazione questa valanga che si abbatte sugli stessi meccanismi che rendono una democrazia funzionante ?
Non sente che si sta perdendo qualcosa ?
Il paese sta diventando cattivo .
Il nemico è chi ti è a fianco , chi riesce a realizzarsi : qualunque forma di piccola carriera , minimo successo , persino un lavoro stabile , crea invidia .
E questo perché quelli che erano diritti sono stati ridotti quasi sempre a privilegi .
È di questo , di una realtà così priva di prospettive da generare un clima incarognito di conflittualità che dovremmo chiedere conto : non solo a chi governa ma a tutta la nostra classe politica .
Però se qualsiasi voce che disturba la versione ufficiale per cui va tutto bene , non può alzarsi che a proprio rischio e pericolo , che garanzie abbiamo di poter mai affrontare i problemi veri dell ' Italia ?
Il ricatto cui è sottoposto un politico è sempre pericoloso perché il paese avrebbe bisogno di altro , di attenzione su altre questioni urgenti , di altri interventi .
Il peggio della crisi per quel che riguarda i posti di lavoro deve ancora arrivare .
In più ci sono aspetti che rendono l'Italia da tempo anomala e più fragile di altre nazioni occidentali democratiche , aspetti che con un simile aumento della povertà e della disoccupazione divengono ancora più rischiosi .
Nel 2003 John Kerry , allora candidato alla Casa Bianca , presentò al Congresso americano un documento dal titolo
The New War , dove indicava le tre mafie italiane come tre dei cinque elementi che condizionano il libero mercato quantificando in 110 miliardi di dollari all ' anno la montagna di danaro che le mafie riciclano in Europa .
L'Italia è il secondo paese al mondo per uomini sotto protezione dopo la Colombia .
È il paese europeo che nei soli ultimi tre anni ha avuto circa duecento giornalisti intimiditi e minacciati per i loro articoli .
Molti di loro sono finiti sotto scorta .
Ed è proprio in nome della libertà di informazione che il nostro Stato li protegge .
Condivido il destino di queste persone in gran parte ignote o ignorate dall ' opinione pubblica , vivendo la condizione di chi si trova fisicamente minacciato per ciò che ha scritto .
E condivido con loro l'esperienza di chi sa quanto siano pericolosi i meccanismi della diffamazione e del ricatto .
Il capo del cartello di Calì , il narcos Rodriguez Orejuela , diceva " sei alleato di una persona solo quando la ricatti " .
Un potere ricattabile e ricattatore , un potere che si serve dell ' intimidazione , non può rappresentare una democrazia fondata sullo stato di diritto .
Conosco una tradizione di conservatori che non avrebbero mai accettato una simile deriva dalle regole .
In questi anni per me difficili molti elettori di centrodestra , molti elettori conservatori , mi hanno scritto e dato solidarietà .
Ho visto nella mia terra l'alleanza di militanti di destra e di sinistra , uniti dal coraggio di voler combattere a viso aperto il potere dei clan .
Sotto la bandiera della legalità e del diritto sentita profondamente come un valore condiviso e inalienabile .
È con in mente i volti di queste persone e di tante altre che mi hanno testimoniato di riconoscersi in uno Stato fondato su alcuni principi fondamentali , che vi chiedo di nuovo : davvero , voi elettori di centrodestra , volete tutto questo ?
Questa manifestazione non dovrebbe veramente avere colore politico , e anzi invito ad aderirvi tutti i giornalisti che non si considerano di sinistra ma credono che la libertà di stampa oggi significa sapersi tutelati dal rischio di aggressione personale , condizione che dovrebbe essere garantita a tutti .
Vorrei che ricordassimo sino in fondo qual è il valore della libertà di stampa .
Vorrei che tutti coloro che scendono in piazza , lo facessero anche in nome di chi in Italia e nel mondo ha pagato con la vita stessa per ogni cosa che ha scritto e fatto a servizio di un'informazione libera .
In nome di Christian Poveda , ucciso di recente in El Salvador per aver diretto un reportage sulle maras , le ferocissime gang centroamericane che fanno da cerniera del grande narcotraffico fra il Sud e il Nord del continente .
In nome di Anna Politkovskaja e di Natalia Estemirova , ammazzate in Russia per le loro battaglie di verità sulla Cecenia , e di tutti i giornalisti che rischiano la vita in mondi meno liberi .
Loro guardano alla libertà di stampa dell '
Occidente come un faro , un esempio , un sogno da conquistare .
Facciamo in modo che in Italia quel sogno non sia sporcato .
Saving money is the hot word at the moment as the world economy gulps for air .
Here I give tips on how you could save thousands by making a few changes to your home and lifestyle .
The items are listed in no particular order , and the amounts I personally saved by trying these tips is listed at the end of each segment .
Enjoy !
15 Take Holidays Closer to Home
Holidays are often seen as a necessity , but luxury holidays can work out more expensive than they are worth .
Traveling to other countries for your holiday can be full of hidden costs , such as airport taxes , insurance , and even the price of a passport , so one thing to consider is just how far do you need to go for have a few weeks of fun ??
At the bottom end of the scale , camping holidays can be enjoyed for the price of a tent and a food budget , and a well planned trip could mean you are waking in a new location every day .
Similarly , consider hiring a camper or motor - home – and take a tour of the wilderness .
Holidaying in foreign parts may still carry a note of prestige , but who needs prestige when you ’re broke ?
Average yearly saving ( £ ) : Over £ 2,000 ( $ 3,000 ) .
14 Do n’t Buy New
Buying ‘ New ’ costs more , and even more so when considering buying cars .
A car can lose up to 50 % of its worth in just 12 months , so the second - hand car market is ripe with good quality almost - new vehicles .
At the bottom end of the market , a good car may cost as little as £ 1,000 and could be just as comfortable , reliable and economical as a brand new equivalent .
The second - hand hard goods market is also awash with good quality gear .
Online auction sites are by far the best places to buy gifts and gadgets at a fraction of the cost of their retail counterparts .
For example , a one - week - old computer processor was found for just £ 90 on EBay – saving £ 60 – £ 80 on the price of a brand new one .
Charity shops can be gold mines for clothing , drapes , toys and dvds , and because charity shops almost always insist on goods being of the best order , whole outfits can be bought for next to nothing .
Average yearly saving by not buying new ( £ ) : Unlimited .
13 Shop Without the Labels
Many items have a higher price tag even though they may be carbon copies of other brands ; simply because they have a popular label .
Many motor manufacturers rebrand imported products to sell the same thing for a higher price .
Many clothing manufacturers do the same .
So if you can swallow your vanity and shift the ego , there really is no need to wear a label in order to look smart .
If you must do , why not just buy a box of sew - on labels and do it yourself !
On the shopping front , you may have to ask why you always buy Pepsi when multipak cola feeds the same need for less ?
Ok , so it might taste better , but it also costs …
Again , if you must be suckered into wearing named brands , there are many places which sell the same things for less ; and charity shops always have a nice selection of pristine labels on offer .
Average yearly saving ( £ ) : £ 250 ( $ 380 ) .
12 Wed Naturally
The second most expensive single item on this list is a wedding .
Weddings happen to most people , and most have to save for years to get what they want .
However , there are always alternatives .
One way would be to organize your own wedding using one of the many priests in your area .
For example , I asked a Shaman to marry myself and my wife - to - be in a special clearing by a river ; I created my own vows ; and the whole thing came to under £ 400 .
There are many people willing to marry folks for the fraction of the price of a church service , and getting married on a beach , or in a forest – or having a themed wedding – may prove much more memorable and special .
Collective saving over a church wedding ( £ ) : Over £ 2,000 ( $ 3,000 ) .
11 Rent
Perhaps the most controversial item on this list is the Rent vs Mortgage argument .
In a lot of cases , renting can be as low cost as getting a mortgage and comes with a number of benefits .
Firstly , you wo n’t owe £ 150,000 to be payable over 40 years !
This means these debts wont be passed on to your next of kin should you die before you pay for the house .
Renting means you can move to a larger or cheaper place as and when you like – or to a new area altogether .
House maintenance should be taken care of by your landlord , and even some utility bills may be thrown into the price .
If you fail to keep up your mortgage repayments , the banks will move pretty swiftly to boot you out , but many rental agencies or private landlords can often be paid much smaller sums in order to keep the roof over your head .
Finally , if you are lucky enough to get help with your housing costs , many agencies will pay more to rented tenants than mortgaged individuals .
Buying a house may still be seen as a good investment should the housing market go up in price – but at the moment it ’s going down !
– turning the whole thing into more of a gamble .
Average lifetime saving ( £ ) : Variable .
10 Wood Burning Stoves
With Gas and Electricity prices rising all the time , by far the easiest way to heat a home is to go back to the old ways – with a wood burring stove .
Stoves can be bought relatively cheaply , and one will pay for itself in a couple of years .
Fuel is never a problem ( and often free ) as long as you live near a wood yard , a coppice project , a paper mill , a saw mill , or even a dump ( where wood is available by the skip load ) .
A cheap circular saw can be bought for as little as £ 10 , and means you can chop up tables , cabinets , dressers , and just about anything else .
Sick and tired of all that junk mail ?
Bung it in , and make it heat your home !
Endless stacks of paper products ? , cereal boxes ? , packaging ?
Recycle it the original way and save the planet .
Supermarkets are also a good source of material – and are usually more than willing to see the back of banana boxes and all kinds of packaging .
On top of all that , a good stove burner could be adapted into the water system of your home ; so you can use it to take a bath .
Stoves can also be cooked upon too !.
Finally , they are great for giving a home that natural heat that helps you feel drowsy and have a good nights sleep .
Average yearly saving ( £ ) : Over £ 140 ( $ 210 )
9 Connect Your TV to the Internet
With the advent of the Internet , technology now allows a cheaper viewing experience .
If you are lucky enough to live in an area where most of the material on TV is available online and on demand , there really is no reason to pay for TV anymore .
In the UK , the cost of a TV license can be over £ 100 a year .
With a good graphics card on your computer , you should be able to connect your TV to it ; meaning ANY output from your machine can be directed to play on the big screen with the touch of a button .
This also means that your television watching habits can be tailored to your own on - demand needs , and you wo n’t be paying for all those waste - of - time shows which clog many networks these days .
Finally , with the advent of shared downloads , you can now have your favorite shows on your hard drive and play them direct – saving you buying or burning all those DVDs .
Average yearly saving ( £ ) : Over £ 120 ( $ 180 ) .
8 Budget
Now this had to come up at some point , but this could make a HUGE difference to your expenditure over a year .
By far the easiest way to budget is to type in all your outgoings and bills in monthly columns on a spreadsheet .
Below these , enter whatever income you have – and then take the outgoings amount away from your combined income .
Hay presto !
Your disposable income pops up at the bottom .
Budgeting a whole year in advance can show you what shape your bank account will be in during the months to come ; helping you save more if things look tight , or to afford those little luxuries without fear of going into the red .
A budget can also help you as you tinker with the figures – shaving money off here and there – allowing you to maximize whatever money you have available to you .
Average yearly saving ( £ ) : Unlimited .
7 House Share
On several occasion I have house - shared as a means of cutting the house - hold bills in half .
A paying guest can ‘ lodge ’ for any price you set – and many are happy to pay as much as you would pay to rent the house on your own .
Similarly , many are willing to split the rent and the bills ; resulting in a very much less expensive way to live .
Of course , house sharing does have a few drawbacks ; such as privacy ;
but at the end of the day it ’s up to you whether you want to keep them or to send them on their way .
House mates can also be very good company , very good partners on a night out , may be great ( free ) babysitters , and may be a convenient way to car share .
Average yearly saving from a house - share ( £ ) : £ 3800 ( $ 5,800 ) .
6 Measure Out Your Water Usage
In some parts of the world , water bills are calculated on the average usage in your community , or at least on your block .
That is fine if you use as much as everyone else ; but not so good if you live on your own or prefer to smell nasty from not taking baths !
For singles or students then , having a water meter installed could save you a small fortune as it means you will only pay for what you use .
So , by not washing the car , or by doing the dishes in a bowl rather than in a dish - washer , or taking showers instead of baths – you can save on your usual water bill .
For quite a few household jobs – such as watering the garden and washing the car – the water you need comes from the sky – for FREE – and is worth collecting if you have a water meter .
Average yearly saving ( £ ) : Over £ 120 ( $ 180 ) .
5 Save Petrol
Running a car can be a very expensive business , so fuel economy can be an easy way to save those extra penny ’s .
First of all , keeping your car in shape is by far the quickest way to start saving .
For example : ensuring the tires are inflated to the correct PSI and have plenty of rubber , changing the air and oil filters , removing excess weight , and driving carefully ; can mean your fuel can last at least 10 - 20 MPG longer .
Race starts , revving the engine , and driving over 70MPH ( 112 k ph ) uses up fuel quickly , and could only result in saving you minutes at the other end .
The best speed for fuel economy is 56MPH ( 90 k ph ) .
Buying a diesel or a car with good fuel economy ( over 50 mpg ) is also a big consideration , and could cut the average fuel bill by half over a year .
Car sharing is great as it means you are sharing the cost of driving between you , and if you alternate between each others cars it could mean you are traveling half as often in your own car .
Small journeys eat into your fuel reserve more than long ones because of the time it takes the car to warm up .
If you reach your destination before the ‘ choke ’ switches off you will have used an extra 10 % of fuel in your journey .
For this reason , it is better to shop around all in one day rather than popping into town every day for little bits .
If you can , walk .
Walking is free , and every trip saved is an extra trip you can make on the same tank of gas .
Average yearly saving ( £ ) : Over £ 100 ( $ 150 ) .
4 Eat In
Now this might sound obvious , but eating take - outs can be far more expensive than eating your own home cooked meals .
Take - outs ; although often very tasty ; can contain materials which actively make you hungrier or thirstier – causing you to consume more as a result .
Ordering out for food or going out for meals can really make a big difference to a shopping budget , and can turn one of life ’s greatest luxuries into a taken - for - granted habit .
Saving take - outs for special days ( i.e. Saturdays ) and special occasions can make the experience even more exciting , even more sumptuous , and a whole lot cheaper .
Average yearly saving by eating less take - outs ( £ ) : Over £ 120 ( $ 180 ) .
3 Ration those Vices
If saving on food is a little beyond your comfort zone then this next classic will have you screaming .
With the credit crunch propaganda infiltrating the airwaves of late , many are left wondering how they will afford the basic household bills .
One way is simply to economize on life ’s luxuries – and by far the most common ( and most expensive ) luxuries are those concerning cigarettes and alcohol .
For example , if you were to smoke 20 cigarettes a day , your yearly expenditure may average around £ 1800 ( $ 2,800 ) .
If you were to cut down from 20 cigarettes a day to 10 , this would go down to £ 900 ( $ 1,400 , a saving of £ 900 a year – or x30 fuel bills ! ) .
7 cigarettes a day , and the cost goes down to around £ 550 ( $ 850 ) a year ; quit smoking and you could save the full £ 1800 ( $ 2,800 ) .
Alcohol is very similar in that a single night out may cost anywhere between £ 20 and £ 60 ; so by going out just once a week less often ; you could save between £ 960 ( 1,470 ) and £ 2880 ( $ 4,400 ) over a year .
Average yearly saving after quitting drinking and smoking ( £ ) : Over £ 6,660 .
2 Shop Around
There are many ways to cut the shopping budget down to size .
For starters , choose your shops carefully .
If it can be ordered and delivered cheaper online ( i.e. hard goods , media ) , this could save up to 50 % on retail prices .
As far as food goes , one supermarkets ’ prices may not be too unlike anothers ’ , but there can be huge saving to be made if you are willing to shop around for the basic items .
Convenience stores often hike their prices thinking that consumers will shop there anyway and swallow the difference .
Milk , for example , may be a third more expensive at your local shop or gas station than it may be at a superstore .
Over the year , these expenses mount up .
However , if the price of a cheaper loaf of bread would cost you more in gas money to drive over and pick one up , then this would be false economy in that it would cost more overall for the same result .
Average yearly saving ( £ ) : Over £ 480 ( $ ) .
1 Eat Your Veggies !
Finally , why not maximize your income by eating healthily !
Contrary to what you may think , eating veggie is very VERY cheap , and a full weeks worth of food may cost from as little as £ 10 ( $ 15 ) a head .
By far the cheapest way to have the best quality vegetables for your pot would be to grow your own .
For the price of a packet of seeds ( or a few carrot tops and sprouting potatoes ) you can grow and rotate your stocks to provide an endless free supply of basic foods .
A good steamer unit , an oven , and a magimix ( for soups ) will also save hours of gas or electricity bills as neither of these use too much juice to run .
Eating veggie does n’t necessarily mean avoiding meat – that ’s up to you – you do n’t have to be a vegetarian to eat veggie !
Meat , fish and chicken can be used as you like , along with eggs , cheese , sauces , pickles and spices .
The point is to avoid shopping for pre-packaged foods ; in whatever variety they come ; and simply eat fresh .
Aside from fresh being far less expensive ( even totally free ! ) , fresh also contains far less additives , comes with far less packaging , and is FAR more beneficial for the mind and body .
Average yearly saving by growing your own veggies ( £ ) : £ 900 ( $ 1,400 ) per head .
Summary :
So there you have it .
If you invest in a good budget and a wood burning stove to heat and cook on , get a suitable house mate , cut down or cut out the cigs , booze and the take - outs , get a water meter , do n’t pay for TV , and grow and eat veggie – you could save a fortune .
I did all the above , and although I did n’t sacrifice too much of my social life I still managed to save … £ 12,700 year - on - year ( $ 19,500 ) .
