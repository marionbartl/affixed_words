Complex
“ A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked .
The inverse proposition also appears to be true : A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work .
You have to start over , beginning with a working simple system . ”
— John Gall
If there ’s a formula to Apple ’s success over the past 10 years , that ’s it .
Start with something simple and build it , grow it , improve it , steadily over time .
Evolve it .
The iPhone exemplifies this strategy .
There ’s a long list of features many experts and pundits claimed the original 1.0 iPhone needed but lacked .
Ends up it did n’t need any of them .
Nice to have is not the same thing as necessary .
But things the iPhone did have , which other phones lacked , truly were necessary in terms of providing the sort of great leap forward in the overall experience that Apple was shooting for .
Gall ’s law raises hard questions .
Where do you start ?
How small ?
How simple ?
Where do you draw the line between simple enough to make it work and complex enough to be interesting ?
That ’s the magic .
The one and only mind - blowing iPhone announcement was its debut on stage at Macworld Expo 2007 .
They nailed the initial system , absolutely dead - on nailed it .
Everything since — and there has been quite a lot since , especially when including iPhone OS 3.0 developer betas Apple started seeding earlier this month — has been evolution and hard work .
( Cf. Edison ’s description of genius . )
One obvious but wrong answer would have been for Apple to start with a phone .
That ’s what most companies in the mobile handset industry have done and it ’s led them to a dead end .
The problem is that while successful complex systems evolve from simple systems that work , not every simple system that works can support additional complexity .
It ’s not enough just to start simple , you have to start simple with a framework designed for future evolution and growth .
Consider that none of the major new features in the iPhone OS 3.0 software is related to the telephone .
MMS comes closest , but even that does n’t pertain to phone calls .
The “ phone ” in “ iPhone ” is much more about ubiquitous always - on wireless TCP / IP networking than it is about the 20th century conception of telephony .
The other obvious path Apple could have taken would have been to start with what we then knew as an iPod .
That would n’t have supported this sort of evolution , either .
Apple started instead with the idea of a general - purpose pocket - sized networked computer .
It no more has a single main purpose than a desktop PC has a single main purpose .
Telephony is simply one feature among many , whereas on most other phones , the features are attached to the side of the telephone .
They sold 30 million iPhone OS devices in the first 18 months after 29 June 2007 , but 13 million of those were non-phone iPod Touches — proving that the platform is clearly appealing even when the “ phone ” is entirely removed .
( Consider too that the iPhone ’s two strongest competitors are BlackBerry and Android , neither of which started as phones . )
The problem with Apple in the ’90s was that they stopped doing this .
The Mac had a great run from its debut in 1984 through the end of the ’ 80s , where both the hardware and software improved every year .
Then that stopped .
Apple became too much concerned with the Next Big Thing and not enough concerned about steady evolutionary improvement to what they already had .
While Microsoft was going from Windows 3.0 to Windows 95 ( a massive improvement ) , the Mac barely moved , going only from System 7.0 to System 7.5 .
That might have been OK if any of Apple ’s Next Big Things had turned into Actual Big Things , but none did .
If Apple had sold even close to 30 million Newton OS devices in its first 18 months , Apple would not have been “ beleaguered ” , they would not have bought NeXT , and Steve Jobs never would have been brought back .
Instead , IDG reported that Apple sold a grand total of only 60,000 Newton units in all of 1996 , the Newton ’s third year on the market .
That ’s about how many iPhone OS devices Apple sold per day — per day ! — for the first 18 months after the iPhone went on sale .
The iPhone was not conceived merely as a single device or a one - time creation .
It ’s a platform .
A framework engineered for the long - run .
The iPhone did n’t and does n’t need MMS or a better camera or a video camera or more storage or cut / copy / paste or GPS mapping or note syncing , because the framework was in place so that Apple could add these things , and much more , later — either through software updates or through new hardware designs .
The way to build a complex device with all the features you want is not to start by trying to build a device with all those features , but rather to start with the fundamentals , and then iterate and evolve .
There ’s no better example than background tasks .
The problem is n’t that the iPhone OS is n’t technically capable of pre-emptive multitasking , like the old Mac OS .
Some of Apple ’s own apps — like MobileSafari , the phone app , the audio player , the new - to - 3.0 Voice Memos — already continue running when in the background .
In fact , because it ’s built on the same Unix underpinnings as Mac OS X , Apple had to do more work to create the upcoming push notification system than they would have had to do to just enable background processing for third - party apps .
Scott Forstall said as much on stage during the iPhone OS 3.0 special event .
The problem is not the software but the hardware — the current CPU is too slow , there is n’t enough RAM , and battery life is already stretched thin .
Apple could do it now , but they could n’t do it well , so they will wait .
There ’s not much I ’d say I ’m certain about regarding future Apple products , but I ’m absolutely certain that eventually there will be an iPhone with a combination of CPU , RAM , and battery life that Apple deems suitable for third - party app background tasking .
All they ’ll have to do is turn it on .
i Phone OS 3 is an impressive year - over - year improvement over iPhone OS 2 , which itself was an impressive year - over - year improvement over iPhone OS 1 .
But we ai n’t seen nothing yet .
( UPDATE : On April 22 FactCheck.org withdrew its flat statement that the president was wrong , saying it could not prove that .
An updated item appeared here . )
On his recently concluded first visit to Mexico as president , a week after telling Europeans that his country had been at times arrogant , President Barack Obama blamed his own country for providing 90 % of Mexico 's recovered crime guns .
According to a report by the independent FactCheck.org this afternoon , that 's incorrect .
By a , uh , long shot .
The president 's assertion , also cited by Mexican President Felipe Calderon during their joint news conference in Mexico City , and the reported inaccuracy seems likely to fuel the eternal American gun-control debate , especially as it relates to the U.S. role in Mexico 's deadly drug world .
Here 's the FactCheck full summary :
There 's no dispute that thousands of handguns , military - style rifles and other firearms are purchased in the U.S. and end up in the hands of Mexican criminals each year .
It 's relatively easy to buy such guns legally in Texas and other border states and to smuggle them across .
But is it true as President Obama said , that " more than 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States ? "
No , it 's not .
The figure represents only the percentage of crime guns that have been submitted by Mexican officials and traced by U.S. officials .
We can find no hard data on the total number of guns actually " recovered in Mexico , " but U.S. and Mexican officials both say that Mexico recovers more guns that it submits for tracing .
Therefore , the percentage of guns " recovered " and traced to U.S. sources necessarily is less than 90 percent .
Furthermore , the 90 percent figure is based on a badly biased sample of all Mexican crime guns .
Law enforcement officials say Mexico asks the U.S. to trace only those guns with serial numbers or other markings that indicate they are likely to have come though the U.S .
Fox News has put the percentage at only 17 percent , but we find that to be based on a mistaken assumption that throws its figure way off .
We can't offer a precise calculation because we know of no hard information on the total number of guns Mexican officials have recovered .
But if a rough figure given by Mexico 's attorney general is accurate , then the actual percentage of all Mexican crime guns traced to U.S. sources is probably less than half what the president claims , and more than double what Fox news has reported .

We have a video report on Obama 's Mexico stay too .

By RICHARD K. P. PANKHURST
Visitors to {www : Addis Ababa} at the turn of the century were far from imagining that Menelik ’s capital founded a few years earlier was destined within the space of little more than fifty years to become the most populous city between Cairo and Johannesburg .
Ethiopia ’s dramatic defeat of the Italians at the battle of Adowa in 1896 had not fully dispelled the doubt as to whether an independent African state could survive in the age of the ” scramble for Africa . ”
Moreover , most European observers believed that the Ethiopian capital was only a temporary headquarters of the monarch and would be abandoned within a few years , as had been the case of earlier Shoan capitals , such as Ankober , Angolala and Entotto .
According to Guebre Selassie ’s Chronicle of the Reign of Menelik , the houses at Entotto , though well constructed , were very cold .
At the end of the rainy season in 1885 ( European calendar ) , the Emperor and Empress accompanied by their retinue descended the mountain to enjoy the hot springs of Filwoha where a large number of tents were erected .
The Empress Taitu admiring the beauty of the scenery from the door of her tent and remarking the softness of the climate , asked the Emperor to give her land to build a house there .
He replied , ” Begin by building a house ; after that I will give you a country . ” ” Where shall I build my house ? ” she inquired .
“ In this spot , ” he replied , ” which my father , King Sahle Selassie , surrounded with a fence : go there , and begin your house . ”
On that spot Sahle Selassie like the prophet Mikias made the following prophecy :
One day as he sat under that great tree , not far from Meouat , hydromel was brought to him while he was playing chess , as was his custom .
Suddenly he said , ” One day my grandson will build here a house and make of you a city . ” ” It was , ” the Chronicle declares , ” the will of God , ” for that very week Taitu decided to construct the house ; her servant received orders to start at once ; the work began , and not long afterwards a beautiful edifice was erected .
In the following year , again according to the Chronicle , Taitu left Entotto and installed herself in her new house by the hot springs .
Then began the building of the town .
Every chief was allocated an allotment on which to build his dwellings .
” The country was beautiful .
The army loved staying there .
And it was Woizero Taitu herself who ordered that the town should be given the name of Addis Ababa . ”
The diary of Jules Borelli for 1887 contains a number of interesting allusions to the movement of Menelik ’s court ; it suggests that the new site was only slowly gaining favor On June 22 the diarist declares his intention of visiting Menelik who is apparently at Filwoha .
On October 13 he reports that the Emperor has again left for the springs .
On the following day , however , he says that he went there and found that Menelik and all his retinue except the Abuna had returned to the Ghebbi or Palace at Entotto .
The next day he refers to the Abuna camping at the ” prairy of Filwoha . ”
On October 28 and 30 he relates that he has met several members of the Court at the springs .
On November 3 he records a rumor he has heard that Menelik is returning from Filwoha to his Ghebbi at Entotto .
On the following day his entry contains a reference to the existence of two royal residences , one at Entotto , the other at Filwoha .
” Menelik , ” he goes on , ” has decided that Filwoha shall henceforth bear the name of ‘ Addis Ababa ‘ ” ( or ‘ New Flower ‘) .
Borelli ’s comment is skeptical in the extreme ; he remarks that Taitu’s ” fantasy , ” as he calls it , will soon pass ; the Emperor , he adds , had first gone to Filwoha several years earlier to enjoy the hot springs ; then he had abandoned them , and only returned there on Taitu ’s account .
The Ethiopian Chronicle tells that at about this time ” magnificent works ” were commenced , among them a house ” worthy of admiration for the government . ”
At the end of 1892 work began on the Palace , the foundation stones of the Elfin or main dwelling , being laid on 13 Hedar , and of the Aderash , or principal reception hall , nine days later .
Building proceeded so fast that it has been said no fewer than fifty edifices were erected in three months .
The Chronicle declares that by 1894 the Palace was virtually complete ; Menelik ordered that the waters of high Entotto be brought to the Ghebbi by pipe ; the piping system , which cost 7,000 thalers , made available two fully adequate supplies of water , one for drinking , the other for washing purposes .
The latter supply , declares the Chronicle , was used to water the Palace gardens , as well as to wash the clothes of the Court and guards .
Until that time it had been necessary to go down to the near - by stream on washing day .
The Chronicle subsequently relates that in 1897 Menelik brought European engineers and workers to build in the Palace compound a huge Adarash or reception hall with a three gabled roof .
Though it was about 60 meters in length and 30 wide , the Emperor ’s army could not all enter at the same time .
One man , it appears , jokingly expressed the hope that the whole sky might be a single piece of bread which he could have all for his own , but his friend replied , ” If you had such a piece of bread , God would send you as many table companions as there are stars ! ”
As the number of soldiers increased Menelik arranged for the workers to build a new Adarash six times as wide .
A number of other houses were also erected for preparing and storing bread , meat and hydromel .
The three - gabled Adarash , the Chronicle explains , contained a single huge room , and outside on each roof one saw fifty goullelat each with an ostrich egg .
During the rains water poured into the carefully built gutters like a torrent .
Inside the building sixteen clusters of electric lights illumined the hall so brightly that it was said one was dazzled as by the rays of the sun .
There were also windows with red , green , yellow and blue panes , as well as a stained - glass window depicting the Cross of the Apostles surrounded by vine branches and squares of divers colors
The roof was supported within by thirty - four pillars of various colors while the walls were covered with marble on which representations of vine branches had also been painted .
The whole presented a most splendid aspect .
When the work of construction was finished , a superb throne was placed in position which shone as gold and was surmounted by a crown , stars and other ornaments which gave the ensemble a ” marvelous appearance . ”
This wonderful edifice , the Chronicle declares , could hold six thousand nine hundred and eighty seven persons ; bread was brought by some hundred and twenty waiters , hydromel by between a hundred and a hundred and thirty and meat by as many again .
It was customary for two doors to be used so that one assembly of diners could enter as another left , the banquet being consumed not only by the Emperor ’s soldiers , but by peasants who had come to receive justice , as well as by many other visitors .
Menelik was ever a town - planner .
In the Ethiopian year 1893 ( European calendar , September , 1900 to September , 1901 ) he laid the foundations of a new town at Mietta ; the construction , Guebre Sellassie declares , was superb , above all the Palace which was built in a very unusual style .
The new town , according to H. Le Roux , owed its name , like that of Addis Ababa , to Empress Taitu who chose for it Addis Alem , or New World .
The title was significant .
The Chronicle says it was found ” less beautiful ” than Addis Ababa and was only intended as a winter capital to avoid the heavy rains of Addis Ababa and also to obtain a better supply of wood .
Foreigners , however , long thought that the forests surrounding Addis Alem would eventually induce Menelik to make that town the capital of the new Ethiopian world .
The Italians were so fully convinced of this that they went so far as to start building a legation at Addis Alem .
It is interesting in this connection to examine the writings of contemporary foreign observers who were almost unanimous in proclaiming the impossibility of Addis Ababa remaining the capital of Ethiopia .
Lieut .-Colonel Wingate , who accompanied the Rennell Rodd mission to Menelik , reported , as a result of his observations in 1897 , that it was widely declared the capital would soon move to Mietta on the west of Entotto .
Gradually , he related , all the wood in the vicinity of the capital had been cut down and consumed , and it had been necessary to start using the forest of Mount Menagesha some fifteen miles away : ” When the distance from the forest becomes inconveniently great the capital must be removed elsewhere . ”
Henry Vivian , writing four years later , declared wood was then being brought a distance of sixteen miles and it “ is certain that within a very short space of time Menelik will be obliged to shift his capital once more to the neighborhood of fresh woods . ”
A. B. Wylde , reporting at about the same time , said that , having revisited the town twice within eighteen months , ” I found it had grown larger . . . perhaps this immense straggling settlement has seen its best days , and some new place will be chosen as headquarters , as it is now nearly impossible to procure firewood for the wants of the inhabitants .
…
As long as a large standing army at headquarters is kept up , this settlement is shortly doomed . ”
Foreign commentators who foretold the demise of Addis Ababa had in mind the fate of Entotto which had been almost completely abandoned though Menelik and his Court still paid occasional visits to the Church of St. Raguel there .
Gleichen reported that at Entotto he had only seen a handful of huts , the ruin of ” an exceedingly strong fortress ” and the two churches of St. Raguel and St. Mariam , while Vivian declared ” only two churches and a few brown ruins ” remained of a town ” which must have comprised fifty thousand souls . ”
Menelik decided , however , to save Addis Ababa , which was probably essential if his plans for the modernization and development of Ethiopia were to be carried to fruition .
The Chronicle relates an incident which occurred during the rainy season of 1902 .
Menelik had left Addis Ababa on account of the rains , but on arriving at Addis Alem he ordered the edifice which had been begun for the use of the Court should be converted into a church .
” The kingdom of heaven , ” he declared , ” is worth more than the kingdom of earth . ”
By thus offering to heaven the new church , fashioned as the Chronicle says in a new style which had never before been seen in Ethiopia , Menelik retained Addis Ababa as the capital of his kingdom on earth .
Immediately after the rains the Emperor gave orders to construct a road from Addis Alem to the capital which the Chronicle likens to those of the Ferengi ( Europeans ) , observing that it made possible for Addis Ababa to obtain an adequate supply of wood and other necessities .
The permanence of the capital was thus assured .
Later a more prolific source of timber was discovered in the swift growing eucalyptus imported from Australia .
When felled to the ground this remarkable tree quickly pushes up new stems as strong and virile as the original .
The decision to hold fast to Addis Ababa marked a new era in Ethiopian history .
In the old days it had been extremely difficult to administer a large empire from a single center because the mountainous nature of the terrain made speedy and efficient communications extremely difficult and because the relatively large army , accompanied by its camp followers , proved a heavy drain on the available supplies of fuel and foodstuffs .
It had therefore been customary to have a series of temporary capitals , though this necessarily militated against the development of a more scientific system of administration .
To develop a modern state Menelik had to have a fixed capital .
Addis Ababa was all the while evolving , reflecting the progress and development of the country as a whole .
It was thus the scene of daring innovation which went hand in hand with ceaseless expansion .
The Chronicle tells us that at the turn of the century talk began of constructing a railway .
The telephone between the capital and Harar , which had been begun by French engineers in 1897 , was working by 1899 .
P. H. G. Powell - Cotton , in a book published in 1902 , has left a description of the first telegraph office , which , he says , was under the supervision of a Swiss engineer , M. Muhle .
Situated in a large circular building it contained ” the latest inventions in telegraphic and telephonic apparatus ” lying side by side with ” a few amole or salts and a pile of cartridge cases ( both empty and full ) , which have been received in payment for messages sent .
Beside the instruments in use , materials of all sorts are scattered about — cells , insulators , receivers , call - bells , and so on ; for here are kept the supplies for the smaller stations between this and Ha The Ethiopian year 1896 ( September , 1903 to September , 1904 ) was another milestone in the progress of the Ethiopian State .
In that year , according to the Ethiopian Chronicle , the capital saw a steam - engine for the first time .
It was actually a small locomotive which ran between Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa .
Before the year was out Menelik had constructed a mint for the production the new Ethiopian currency which had appeared in 1893 to replace the old Maria Theresa dollar , but had hitherto been minted in Paris .
Menelik was successfully laying the foundations of the future in both an administrative and an urban sense .
Vivian noted , for example , that Addis Ababa already covered ” some fifty square miles ” and contained “ a very large population which has never been number . ”
By mule ” three - quarters of an hour at least are necessary for a pilgrimage from the British Agency to the Palace and as much again to the market , ” though ” in either of these journeys you must cross three or four deep ravines with stony , precipitous banks and a torrent bed full of slippery boulders . ”
Vivian ’s account is revealing also in that it depicts something approaching a fervor of constructional work .
He declares with surprise that he had seen a newly erected rail which ” had been laid for the purpose of conveying goods and building material to and fro . ”
The Emperor , he relates , had also introduced wheelbarrows to speed up progress , though often the laborers ” only made use of them when they were under their master ’s eye .
Directly they were left to their own devices , they hastened to return to their accustomed method of carrying things on their backs
Wylde describes the capital ’s stone quarry where laborers were at work blasting lime - stone rock while Arab and Indian masons were dressing stone .
” These men , ” he declared , ” had come from Aden and were getting much higher wages than they could procure there .
They told me they also received rations from the king , and that they were saving nearly all their pay .
The blocks of stone they were dressing were intended for the construction of the king ’s private dwelling , and this work and the road - making were the first examples of what the present ruler is doing to improve his surroundings . ”
The chief stores and artillery depot were also built of stone .
A more significant influence on Addis Ababa architecture was Alfred Ilg , whom Menelik had appointed Conseiller d’Etat .
Ilg popularized wooden balconies , reminiscent of the chalets of his native Switzerland , there by creating a style of wood and stone building which was to remain for a generation to come , thus giving the Ethiopian capital a very distinctive appearance .
By examining the contemporary descriptions of the new town it is possible to build up a fairly comprehensive picture of it .
Wylde , for example , recognized that its site was well chosen , from the point of view of its water supply .
He observed that two streams , which descended from the highlands to the north and west and met in a valley about three miles to the south east of the Ghibbi , always contained ” a plentiful supply of water ” which enabled the Palace to be supplied by pipe , ” the stream utilized being tapped at a higher elevation , so it requires no pumping . ”
Count Gleichen was equally impressed by the climate ; he declared it was ” perfect , ” and far superior to bleak and hilly Entotto which was only reached by a very hilly road and tended to be far too cold at night , as well as being from time to time the scene of thunderstorms , perhaps attracted by neighboring ridges of ironstone .
All the travelers agreed that the most conspicuous sight on approaching the capital , and the one which first caught the eye , was the Emperor ’s enclosure built at the end and on the highest part of an out - jutting lower spur of the Entotto mountains .
There they caught their first glimpse of Menelik ’s red-tiled Palace , surrounded by a plantation of sycamore trees .
Captain M. S. Wellby , who arrived just when Menelik was about to set forth on one of his campaigns , declares that ” on all sides ” he saw ” extraordinary numbers of mules , ponies and donkeys grazing on the excellent pasturage , and in the most suitable spots villages of canvas had been pitched , all indicative of the king ’s impending march into the Tigre . ”
Wylde ’s account , which is complementary to that of Wellby , declares that ” at the foot of the Ghibbi there is lower land in which are situated the hot springs of Filwoha , generally with a thin cloud of steam hanging over them , and quite close to these a small pond and water meadow belonging to the king . . .
We could see groups of soldiers ’ tents dotted over the landscapes belonging to the men of the numerous military leaders of other districts that had come to pay their respects to the king , and through my glasses I could see a constant stream of people both mounted and on foot going to and from the king ’s palace , which seemed densely crowded with a mass of specks like the smallest of ants , in fact the hill might be likened to an ant - heap with its busy workers going backwards and forwards . ”
Lieut - Colonel Reginald Wingate has left a detailed account of the Ghibbi at this time :—
” The dwelling - house is called the Elfin , a two - storeyed white - washed building about forty - five feet high ; the roof is red-tiled , and the various windows and balconies are painted in several colors — green , yellow , red and blue .
Besides this building there are : the aderash , or principal hall of reception , a large oblong construction capable of accommodating six hundred or seven hundred persons ; the saganet or clock - tower , where the Emperor dispenses justice on two days during the week , and the gouda , or depot , a white building which serves as the Emperor ’s storehouse .
” In addition to these buildings there are , within the royal enclosure , the workshops , arsenal , carpenters ’ shop , etc. , and a private chapel .
” All around the Ghibbi are grouped the enclosures of the principal men of State , officers , and others , the importance of the individual being measured by the size of the enclosure and the number of the smaller huts grouped around it .
” All the huts in the town are of the same form , circular or elliptical , with thatched conical roofs ; there are very few two - storied buildings ; but some of the houses , more notably those of the Europeans , are oblong in shape , and the roofs are of the ordinary shape , with three or four small peaks capped with circular moulds , serving the double purpose of keeping the thatch in position , and of ornament .
Almost every Ras or Governor of a province , has his compound in Addis Ababa , and the hut accommodating generally an insufficient number of followers , it is supplemented by tents of all shapes and sizes .
” The capital therefore presents the appearance of a gigantic camp , and this is actually what it is . ”
Nevertheless Addis Ababa was never conceived in the military terms of previous Ethiopian capitals .
Gleichen , for example , was careful to note that the old fortress at Entotto had possessed two parapets and had been surrounded by a ditch which ” formed a complete defence in itself ” ; the Addis Ababa Ghibbi , on the other hand , presented no such marked features of defence : ” all it has consists of a palisade about fifteen feet high — not particularly strong — and two internal stone walls .
Perhaps it is because Menelik wisely desires to rule by love and not by fear . ”
Gleichen has given us a glimpse of the old St. George ’s Cathedral which was later replaced by the one which stands in Addis Ababa today .
” The Church , ” he tells us , ” was of the ordinary circular shape , on a hill about a mile from the Palace and close by the market - place . ”
It possessed an elaborate episcopal gilt cross on the top , and inside ” pictures of all sorts of sacred subjects . ”
Beside the work of Ethiopians depicting the lives of notable saints there was ” a representation of the Day of Judgment , the Emperor ( an excellent portrait ) occupying a prominent position amid the prophets , saints and other worthies . ”
There were in addition four or five pictures presented by the Russian Red Cross Mission as gifts from the Tsar : ” good modern ecclesiastical oil paintings of the Greek Church . ”
Another important church described by foreign travelers was the Sellassie , or Trinity , Church .
This P. H. G. Powell - Cotton found , was a thatched circular building surmounted by an elaborate gilt cross . ” A raised , open verandah surrounded the sacred edifice , the wall of which was hung with colored chintz .
Several large doors led into the interior , the center of which was occupied by a square structure reaching to the roof , thus leaving but a narrow space outside it for worshipers
This is the holy of holies , in which the ark containing the holy books is kept , and may only be entered by one of the officiating priests .
The whole exterior of this shrine was covered with highly colored religious prints , pinned on to the wall .
Among these were two or three European paintings on canvas and a few specimens of Ethiopian art .
The most interesting portion of the church was the vestry , situated in a sort of crypt .
Here were piled in open chests , hung on nails or cords , or stacked in corners , the most extraordinary collection of gorgeous - colored vestments , mitres , crutches , umbrellas , sacred books , sistrums , drums , incense - burners , processional crosses , and all the properties used in the elaborate ritual of the Ethiopian Church , in fact a perfect museum of curiosities . . .
How I should have liked to spend a week turning over and examining these treasures !
but no such luck : the priests hustled us out , after permitting us only a hurried glimpse at them . ”
Foreign observers were always keen on visiting the market which was held on a slope of the hill going down toward the Palace .
The market conducted business every day except Sunday ; the busiest day was Saturday , when from the early morning villagers came from all quarters and might be seen driving their donkeys and mules laden with goods for sale .
Powell - Cotton who knew many of the most famous markets of the East , declared that of Addis Ababa ” the most interesting .
There one obtains a truer notion of the productive powers of the country in both raw materials and manufactured articles , and can learn better what foreign goods find a ready sale among the people than in any of the many markets I have seen in the four continents .
To the market - place at Addis Ababa come grains and spices , peppers and condiments from every corner of the kingdom , coffee from Harar and Lake Tsana , cotton from the banks of the Blue Nile , gold from Beni Shangul , and civet from the Oromo country , while salt from the far north of Tigre is the current change for a dollar .
Fine cotton shammas , heavy burnooses of black , blanket - like cloth , jewelery and arms , saddlery and ploughs , all are here . ”
Vivian was ” amazed by the density of the mob ” who seemed to allow ” scarcely a square foot to spare anywhere . ”
The vast concourse was made up of a multitude of persons sitting in the open air in rows according to the materials they had to sell , their goods either displayed on the ground , or in shallow baskets in front of them .
” Purchasers and loafers , ” Powell - Cotton relates ” wander about between the rows , and a noisy hum of voices goes on all day .
Up aloft in a straw sentry - box sits the Nagadi Ras , or head of the merchants , whose business it is to superintend the market , put a stop to quarrels and settle all disputes that are brought before him . ”
The greater part of the market was devoted to the sale of the commonest articles and provisions , grain , grass , sheepskins , fuel , cottons from America , Manchester or India , and German and Italian hardware .
Captain Wellby considered one of the most interesting corners was where hundreds of ponies were assembled .
Their finer points being discussed by vendors and experts .
He also had something to say of the woodsellers who often had to carry their ” turbs ” or long pieces of wood from a distance of fifteen miles , ” the sellers of honey who sold their wares at a dollar for 8 lbs. , and the various vendors of grain who brought in principally barley and tieff , but also peas , oats , rice and linseed .
” There are also for sale , ” he added , ” silver trinkets , cloth , beads , cartridge - belts , files , skins , leather straps ( machanya ) , saddles , inferior knives , various articles made of iron , hardware , and so forth , and lastly fowls , sheep and cattle .
One is much struck by the appearance of the women who throng the market , for many of them are exceedingly pretty . ”
Power - Cotton ’s description of the market is perhaps the most exhaustive .
The jewelery section , he declares contained ” thick silver - rings , which are threaded and worn round the neck , women ’s ear - rings in the form of highly ornamented solitaire studs , generally gilt , and curious ear - rings worn only by men who have killed an elephant , which are fashioned like elaborate finger - rings , sometimes with little chains pendant to them .
There are also hairpins with filigree heads , like those used for women ’s hats at home , tiny ear - picks in the form of spoons with handles of variegated shapes and patterns , bracelets and rings , necklets of fine chain , and little charm - boxes as pendants , as well as crosses , plain or of filigree - work .
. . .
” Next to the raw - hide market , where you may usually find some leopard skins and occasionally a lion ’s pelt , are established the vendors of imported dressed and dyed leather , colored to bright reds and greens for the decoration of saddles , bridles , and cartridge belts .
There also are for sale the large , soft sleeping - skins which every Ethiopian loves to possess , and leather sacks for holding personal luggage while traveling by mule .
In the crowded corner devoted to the sword - sellers you may see a petty chief , with one or two trusty followers , testing the blade of the big , straight sword taken from the Dervishes , which will fetch as much as ten to fifteen dollars .
Close by , other purchasers are examining the curve of an Ethiopian sword in its bright red scabbard , or perhaps choosing one from a pile of French blades made for the Ethiopian market .
. . .
” Nearby at another stall , are exposed for sale circular convex shields of black buffalo hide , those for the populace ornamented by geometrical figures stamped on the leather , while those borne by officers are decorated with strips and bosses of silver , or of silver - gilt for the higher ranks .
. . .
” Near the top of the hill one long alley is devoted to cotton goods from America , India and Manchester .
Lancashire , I regret to say , supplies by far the smallest quantity , for the English manufacturer will neither make the quality nor supply the lengths required in Ethiopia .
” The money - changers ’ quarter , ” he continues , ” is perhaps one of the most striking , for instead of piles of copper , coin and cowries , as in India , one sees stacks of amole — the Ethiopian currency .
These are bars of crystallized salt , some ten inches long by rather more than two inches wide in the center , with slightly tapering ends bound round by a band of rush .
In the capital four of them are equivalent to the dollar , but their value varies in different parts of the country .
. . .
” The red pepper and the butter bazaars were not places in which to linger , the former on account of the particles getting into one ’s eyes and nostrils and acting like pungent snuff , and the latter on account of the strong , rancid smell .
. . .
” Beside all the commodities I have named there were to be found , each in its own market , coffee - beans , sugar , wax and honey , tej and tella ( mead and beer ) , stored in great jars called gombos , large shawls called shammas , iron ploughshares , knives and spears , rhinoceros - hide whips , bamboos for tent - poles , bundles of split wood ten feet long for building huts , little bundles of long , tough grass for thatching or larger ones for fodder , overgrown faggots for fuel , tobacco for chewing and in the form of snuff ( for the Ethiopian does not smoke ) , every kind of grain for bread , and divers condiments for flavoring ”
” On a flat stretch of ground on the southern side of the market is the mule and horse fair ; here may be seen horses galloped by wild - looking men , with their shammas streaming behind them and the rhinoceros - hide whip in full play .
Presently the owner espies a likely purchaser , and instantly the horse is stopped and thrown back on its haunches .
Mules are being examined for traces of old sore backs , and the air is filled with the shouting , wrangling , and bargaining inseparable from the buying and selling of a horse .
The Ethiopians have an excellent rule , that before a bargain is complete , the vendor and the purchaser must together lead their beast before an official , who registers their names , witnesses the paying over of the money , and exacts a fee from both parties to the contract .
No horse may be sold for more than fifty dollars , but a mule may go up to three hundred . ”
The author of the above catalogue elsewhere discusses the foreign traders who had found their way to the new capital .
There were already , he declares , four or five French merchants , the most important being M. Savore who had just opened a new house and shop , ” a good many Greeks , ” who dealt largely in liquors and scents , a few Armenians , one of whom was a baker , and a Swiss watchmaker .
The premises of the Greek and Indian merchants were mainly situated to the south - east of the town , just below the market .
” The latest arrivals ” were several new Indian firms .
The proprietors owing to their thrifty habits were ” rapidly taking the trade from both French and Greeks , and finding a ready sale for goods in respect of which it was thought there would be no demand .
Instead of sending cash to the coast they lay it out in ivory , civet and gold , and so obtain a double profit . ”
One of the most interesting Greeks was Balambaras Giorgis , a curio dealer , who had served in Menelik ’s victorious army at Adowa , the only European to do so .
Another Ethiopianised foreigner was an Irishman , McKelvie who had remained in the country since the time of Theodore , had married an Ethiopian wife and dressed in a shamma .
Vivian corroborated this account of the success of the Indians ; he declared they were ” completely cutting out the French merchants who have already begun to complain bitterly about the competition .
The fact is that an Indian can travel about with one servant and a minimum of baggage , whereas a French merchant travels like a prince , with a great retinue and every conceivable luxury .
Moreover , the Frenchmen give themselves ridiculous airs .
One of their shopkeepers , who had been summoned to the Palace , sent in after ten minutes to say that he could not wait any longer .
The Indians also derive considerable assistance from the weekly post , which any British subject is allowed to use , while the French postal service is unsafe and irregular . ” ” The French , ” he added , ” expect too much too quickly ” and were not unknown to adopt ” sharp practice , which may pay for the moment , but cannot answer permanently .
…
I had occasion to visit the store of one of the leading French traders . …
He showed me several bottles , and I noticed on the lower ones some very elaborate labels : ‘ Grande Marque Extra Fine , ’ and all the rest of it .
Moreover , many bottles were done up in wire - netting , like the very choicest and oldest brands in Europe .
My curiosity was pricked as to the market which the man could hope to find , but he said with a smile , ‘ I do n’t recommend those .
They are intended for the natives , and contain the filthiest muck you ever imagined . ’
This struck me as a very eloquent , as well as a very frank summary of French colonial trade . ”
Powell - Cotton noted that Menelik ’s new Custom House was near the market , its entrance being next to the horse and mule fair . ” A strong wooden gate , ” he records , ” gives access to a yard , with a large building in the center where the officials sit in an open verandah , receiving dues and granting receipts .
Opposite them lies a long range of buildings , in which the merchandise is stored until it has been valued and the Customs are paid .
Lying about in odd corners are elephant tusks , some whole , others sawn in half , while outside the verandah are piles of forty or fifty each , among them some splendid specimens . ”
Foreign writers also naturally paid considerable attention to the residences of the diplomatic missions , which , as Vivian observed , were then divided into two camps , French and Russian against English and Italian , all concerning themselves with ” little else than political intrigue . ”
Menelik was always generous in granting land to foreign legations so they were invariably surrounded by extensive property .
The British Residency , as it was called , was situated on a kind of terrace , at the foot of a steep hill , a narrow but steep ravine separating it from the Russian a quarter of a mile off .
Wellby noted that it was ” close to Ras Makonnen ’s own important - looking dwelling ” and ” well - fitted for a cricket or polo ground . ”
He seemed slightly disappointed however that because ” almost every tree had been cut up for firewood and the supply had to be carried on men ’s heads from a greater distance day by day ” it had not yet been possible to build anything more pretentious than a round wattle hut .
Powell - Cotton elaborated this account . ” A turf wall some four feet high , ” he noted , ” encloses about ten acres of land , which space is again divided by another turf wall into two unequal portions .
In the upper part of the larger enclosure were two tukuls of the usual Ethiopian pattern , but with European doors and windows .
These were the private dwellings of Captain Harrington ( the British representative ) and Mr. Baird , his secretary .
Slightly nearer the entrance , and to the left , were the two reception - tents , side by side .
The first was luxuriously furnished with arm - chairs and lounges , the tables piled with the latest papers and periodicals from home , and with files of Reuter ’s telegrams , which are forwarded by camel - post from Zeila to Harar , and thence by telephone .
The second and larger served as the mess - tent , where , when seated at a perfectly appointed meal , it was hard to realize you were in Ethiopia .
On the further side of the large tents were other tukuls for Mr. Beru , the interpreter , Mr. Wakeman , the doctor , Bradley , the groom , and the cook - house , while behind these were yet others which contained stores and the treasure and ammunition , guarded by Sudanese police .
The smaller half of the compound was divided into four sections — one a narrow strip at the back , where the Sudanese with their households lived in little huts , next to this a large grass field , in which the ponies were tethered and where the dhobie spread his washing .
Adjoining this came the stable - yard , which contained a long , pent - roofed building , supported down the center by poles , and capable of holding thirty horses ; in front of this structure were other tukuls , comprising a harness - room and fodder stores .
The last enclosure , lying nearest the city , was filled with yukuls for the Ethiopian servants and their wives , in the largest of which grinding corn and making the native bread was continuously going on . ”
Somewhat more imposing was the Russian Residency which Wellby describes as ” a white - washed and suitable house , commanding cheery views of all the neighboring country . ”
Guarded by a tame ostrich which nevertheless sometimes occasioned the visitor some fright , the Russians kept up considerable state and sported a Cossack guard .
Vivian declared it was no uncommon sight to see a long procession of Russian soldiers , ” fair men rigged out in the regular Russian uniform with peaked caps . ”
There were also five Russian doctors in gorgeous uniform who ran a Red Cross hospital where people were attended free at an annual cost of £ 7,000 to the Tsar , and much to the disgust of English writers who looked on the whole affair with considerable jealousy and made many cynical remarks about the ” white Tsar ’s love ” for Ethiopia .
Addis Ababa ’s European community was at that time also discussing the marriage to a Russian officer to an Ethiopian lady , this being , as Powell - Cotton said , ” the first time one of their number had gone through the religious ceremony with an Ethiopian .
. . .
When the bridegroom , an officer in the Imperial Russian Guard , asked Menelik ’s permission to marry her and take her to Russia , the reply was , ‘ Certainly , if you have your Emperor ’s leave to do so . ’ ”
Captain Ciccodicola ’s Italian Residency was in the opinion of Powell - Cotton ” the most luxurious dwelling in Addis Ababa . ”
The Italian being anxious to regain for his country some at least of the prestige lost at Adowa was determined to make a show .
”
As he was anxious to have a suitable place for the Italian Residency as soon as possible , and the collection of timber for a large house in Addis Ababa is a matter of much time and difficulty , he decided to buy an existing compound with two houses .
These he converted into dining and drawing rooms , connected by passages with a circular reception hall , from which the sleeping apartments and offices opened out .
The whole formed one of the most picturesque yet comfortable dwellings I have ever seen .
Entering through a gatehouse into a courtyard , we left our mules and attendants , and then proceeded through a second gate ; on either side was a raised open tukul , in one of which the sentry on guard beat a gong to announce our approach .
We then found ourselves in a second courtyard encircled by a covered way and with beautifully laid out flower - beds in the center
At the further end was the reception hall , hung with leopard skins and trophies of arms .
. . .
This apartment , with its Persian carpets , couches covered with polar - bear skins , statuary , pictures , precious curios and works of art , its shaded lamps and candles , was pervaded by an atmosphere of luxury and refinement . ”
Ciccodicola , Vivian observes , had moreover been empowered to spend Italian secret service funds on an extremely lavish scale and was availing himself of the opportunity .
Mr. Legarde , the French representative , whom Menelik had created Duke of Entotto , also had an important residence , for France at this time was the country with which Menelik had greatest contact .
Wellby describes the residence as being surrounded by a cage - like stockade which ” not only shut out most effectively hyena and jackal , but also most of the sun ’s life - giving rays , ” while Powell - Cotton describes the Legation as ” a large , oblong tukul , with no visible windows . ”
Inside , he declares , ” it was so dark that at first we could hardly see the chairs we were invited to take .
As our eyes became accustomed to the gloom , we found we were seated in an apartment draped throughout in red and blue , and decorated at intervals with gilt stars and shields which displayed the tricolour of France .
In the center of the straight wall , facing the semi-circle in which we sat , stood a gilt throne , raised on a kind of platform and surmounted by a canopy flanked by curtains .
On either side , on the lower level of the floor , a small chair was set .
The whole effect — added to the dim , religious light — was distinctly weird . ”
Such , Vivian commented , was the state kept up by ” the representative of republican France . ”
The Ethiopian Chronicle relates that in 1905 the Bank of Ethiopia was chartered , and in the same year a fire which destroyed many of the Court buildings enabled the replacement of wooden edifices by stone .
Soon afterwards St. George ’s Cathedral was rebuilt in a new octagonal style .
The architect in charge was the Greek Orphanies , and the engineer , an Italian , Castagna ; Greek workers were also employed .
A steam - engine arrived from Europe to transport the stones required for this and other new edifices .
A year or so later the Itieguie hotel was built near the new Cathedral , ” a large house for strangers , ” as the Chronicle calls it , where the finest foods of both Europe and Ethiopia were served .
In 1907 - 8 the first Ethiopian cabinet was formed , for as the Chronicle says , Menelik wished to implant into the country European customs .
The new Menelik II School opened its doors in October , 1907 , and reached a hundred students in the following year .
In December , 1907 , the first motor - car was driven into the capital by two Englishmen , Bentley and Halle , who were soon followed by other drivers .
Clifford Halle , who penned an account of his arrival in what would be today considered a very primitive car , has something to say of the Ethiopian capital at this time .
He refers to several Ethiopian churches built in stone ” and saw in the distance the larger houses of the European merchants . ”
Menelik , he goes on , ” had evidently made good use of his steam - rollers , for the macadamized roads were excellent . ”
The Emperor impressed him as extremely alive to modern needs .
” He was quite enlightened , ” Halle notes , ” to the advantages of a railway up to his capital , and the consequent increase of trade and of the wealth that would follow ; but he was equally well aware that foreign capital meant foreign interests , and sooner or later foreign soldiers following those interests .
He questioned Bentley as to the impressions he had gained of the Japanese people , and let it be seen that he had closely followed the marvelous ascent of that great nation into a world power . ”
As soon as the two Englishmen had presented the car Menelik was not content merely to inspect the new arrival ; he was almost at once in the front seat with the driver proceeding at top speed , ” the old Emperor laughing and puffing for breath , with his goggleless eyes streaming , as happy as a schoolboy , while the now galloping escort was left somewhere on the horizon . ”
Though there is no record of the Empress joining the expedition , she spoke kindly to the driver and expressed satisfaction that he differed from so many ferenge who talked big and did little .
The face of the capital was changing .
At the turn of the century Wylde had complained that Addis Ababa was little more than ” a conglomeration of hamlets and huts with hardly a decent house to be seen anywhere . ” ” The whole settlement , ” he added ” seems to have been built in a hurry . ”
Robert Skinner , who led the first American mission to the Court of Menelik and reported only a few years later in 1906 , saw a city already transformed .
The approach , he declared was ” grand ; high mountains were on both sides and ahead of us , and we marched between fields of waving grain .
. . .
Having entered the city we found ourselves traveling over one of the smooth and well - built roads with which Menelik is introducing modern civilization . ”
You ’ve probably heard of the “ New York University professor credited with calling the current economic collapse and a ubiquitous presence on financial - news shows who continues to forecast gloom and doom . ”
Why , it ’s Nouriel Roubini , of course , as he ’s described in Portfolio.com profile by Helaine Olen .
Thanks in no small part to Dr. Roubini ’s prognosticating abilities , his business , RGE , is booming .
Its website is thriving and he ’s branched out from New York to Hong Kong and London with more international offices due to open .
Nor does it hurt that , as described by Ms. Olen , he ’s a one - man PR agency .
Meanwhile , few are aware that Dr. Roubini also keeps up with the social whirl , frequently throwing parties and consorting with younger women .
Ms. Olen again :
Roubini ’s Facebook presence brought the media - gossip blog Gawker into the Roubini story last fall .
In a post called “ The Secret Pleasures of Dr. Doom , ” Nick Denton , the site ’s founder , flagged what he saw as a disconnect between Roubini ’s “ gloomy public image ” and “ his playboy lifestyle ” :
“ The 50 - year - old Iranian - Jewish economist is a promiscuous [ sic ]
Facebook friend who draws a cosmopolitan crowd to the frequent parties at his Tribeca loft — an apartment with walls indented with plaster vulvas , incidentally . ” …
[ Despite the criticism , Roubini ] ca n’t help himself : After Gawker cheekily noted that both he and dating columnist Julia Allison were going to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos , he made sure to be photographed with her there .
Gawker ’s dry comment : “ Nouriel Roubini partying with intellectual peers . ”
Because there ’s no indication that they ’re dating , one ca n’t truthfully claim that Ms. Allison is the one who put ( or keeps recharged ) the vavoom in Dr. Doom .
For those unfamiliar with New York City , Julia Allison is one of its most , uh , unique celebrities .
In fact , she ’s given new meaning to the concept of “ being famous for being famous . ”
A Wired article from last year , Internet Famous : Julia Allison and the Secrets of Self - Promotion , tells you all you need to know about her :
Her new Web site , xojulia.com — like her previous sites , juliaallison.com , itsmejulia.com , and juliajuliajulia.com
[ No , Wired is not making that up .
— Ed. ] — is dedicated to sharing almost every waking moment of Allison ’s life .
Visitors to xojulia.com can follow her schedule of bachelorette parties and fancy dinners , see photos of her latest outfits , and read her dating advice .
As for the vulvas , Dr. Roubini is , in fact a serious art collector .
Anyway , you can see them — and Ms. Allison — here .
Hey , the life of a prophet is awash in toil and trouble .
Who can blame Dr. Roubini for enjoying the company of a breezy companion to take his troubles away ?
Israel is damaging the prospects for peace with Palestinians by grabbing land and violating civil liberties in East Jerusalem , according to an internal EU report .
During the Six - Day War in 1967 Israel invaded and occupied the city 's eastern part , which is currently home to some 190,000 Israelis as well as 210,000 Palestinians and the third holiest site in Islam , the al - Aqsa Mosque .
Since 2004 , it has demolished 400 Palestinian homes , with 1,000 more demolition orders pending .
But since 2007 , it has approved the building of almost 3,000 new Israeli housing units .
Israeli settlements without building permits are rarely disturbed , the EU report says .
The 20 - page document was drafted by the heads of EU member state embassies in Tel Aviv on 15 December and leaked over the weekend by the Israel Committee Against House Demolitions , a Jerusalem - based NGO .
" Israel is , by practical means , actively pursuing the illegal annexation of East Jerusalem , " it says .
" House demolitions in occupied east Jerusalem are illegal under international law , serve no obvious purpose , have severe humanitarian effects and fuel bitterness and extremism . "
The housing policy problem is made worse by " discriminatory " spending on public services , leaving Palestinian areas with poor roads and sewage systems compared to Israeli districts .
The construction of a 725 kilometre - long security wall around East Jerusalem forces Palestinians in the West Bank to seek temporary passes to enter the city .
In some cases , this leaves people unable to farm their land or obtain cancer treatment at specialised hospitals .
EU diplomats also voiced concern about Israeli " state collusion " in helping " extreme " settler groups organise archeological digs in religiously sensitive areas .
" In this manner , archaeology is becoming an ideologically motivated tool of national and religious struggle carried out in a manner that modifies the identity and character of the city and threatens to undermine its stability . "
The EU maintains friendly links with Israel under a June 2000 " Association Agreement . "
On 9 December , it agreed to " upgrade " relations in an initiative which is to see regular bilateral summits and more trade .
The latest Gaza conflict - which claimed over 1,300 Palestinian lives - exposed divisions within the bloc , however .
The European Commission paused talks on the upgrade .
Ireland and Sweden also called for an enquiry into alleged Israeli war crimes , but Germany , Italy and the Netherlands opposed any probe .
Black and white
British liberal MEP Chris Davies told EUobserver that Brussels should suspend the Association Agreement over Israel 's actions in East Jerusalem and Gaza .
" The idea that our close co-operation with a nation that is in military occupation of Palestinian land gives us ' influence ' in shaping Israeli policy is a complete nonsense , " he said .
Pro-Israeli commentators say the EU report lacks historical context , such as mention that Palestinians between 1948 and 1967 tried to " remove all signs of Jewish historical presence " and built " on land that they did not own . "
" This is the reason that I and many other Jews chose to live in Jerusalem - to make the statement that we will not be moved again , " political studies professor Gerald Steinberg of the Bar Ilan University in Ramat Gan , Israel , told this website .
" This [ EU report ] will increase distrust among many Israelis , for whom Jerusalem is the most sensitive dimension of the conflict . "
Ever wanted a simple , compact , small , yet usable and relatively full - featured operating system using a SunOS kernel with most of its utilities written in Ada ?
Whatever the answer , now you can .
“ AuroraUX is a SunOS - derived kernel and userland .
The core of the project are its utilities written in Ada .
Other , poorly implemented features have been fixed or rewritten , too .
Ada was chosen over other languages because it sucks the least . ”
At least they ’re honest .
“ From the world ’s most advanced reconnaissance aircraft to the desktop : AuroraUX , an OpenSolaris derived distribution , pulls together the best technologies empowering today ’s mission critical data center facilities to fighter jets that require quality software that simply cannot fail without very serious consequences , ” the project ’s about page reads .
Ada is a programming language designed by the US Department of Defence in the late 1970s and early 1980s to supersede the hundreds of other programming languages that were in use then b the Department .
As Wikipedia explains , “ Ada is a structured , statically typed , imperative , and object - oriented high - level computer programming language , extended from Pascal and other languages ” .
It ’s used in mission critical environments , such as avionics .
The project has lots of interesting goals , so be sure to take a look around the website .
Hey Killzone fans !
In a continuing effort to provide support for Killzone 2 Online , and to show you day - 1 fans of Killzone that we mean business , we are very happy to announce the upcoming 1.24 patch .
This patch is the biggest one yet , and addresses a large number of reported issues , exploits and bugs – but it also adds new functionality to the game for you to enjoy !
I would like to highlight the fact that we are adding 3 new ranks to the game , reached at 5000 , 10000 and 100000 points respectively .
These ranks do not give any rewards but it allows the real hardcore players to show off their hard work to everyone in - game !
Other highlights include a new 17 - 24 player search game filter , enlarged HUD radar distance and a much requested “ Join Clan Member ” tab in the join game screen .
The patch also allows you to play against the next batch of contenders : Japan , who will be able to buy their copies of Killzone 2 on the 23rd of April and will be joining the community online .
Allow me to clarify on these new features a little :
The new ranks we ’ve added are basically a reward to all the players out there that have massive amounts of points , and we hope that it inspires other players to keep on playing .
The 17 - 24 player filter was a direct request from the community because a lot of people think the ‘ sweet spot ’ of the multiplayer levels is around 24 players instead of 32 and are creating custom games accordingly .
The Join Clan Member tab was also a direct community request , allowing players to join clan members when they are playing regular non-clan related games .
There has been a lot of discussion on the forums about the lack of a ‘ party system ’ in Killzone 2 and rest assured , we are working hard on creating features that will make it easier for you to play with your friends online .
These features include being able to join the same faction of a friend already in - game directly from the join game menus , manually being able to switch faction during gameplay and making existing squads consistent over multiple rounds ; no more need to create a new squad every single round .
These features will be coming to a patch near you soon !
To read more details about the 1.24 patch specifics , please visit the Killzone 2 FAQ section .
We hope this patch shows how dedicated we are to the game , and that it will allow you to enjoy Killzone 2 Online just that little bit more !
Of course , we will continuously keep looking for more bug and exploit fixes , as well as keep an eye out for other additions we can add to the game .
So please keep reporting on the forums !
And last but definitely not least , a big thank you from the entire Killzone 2 team to all the Killzone players out there for their continuing support !
Keep on fraggin’ !
P.S. : I almost forgot to mention :
The patch also adds DLC support ! …
So you know what that means … ;)
RBS demands £ 40,000 damages from unemployed teenage girl who smashed bank window during G20 protest
Royal Bank of Scotland tried yesterday to recoup the entire cost of damages it suffered during the G20 protests from an unemployed teenage girl .
The bank , which is now two thirds state owned after receiving billions in Government bail outs , asked a court to recover the £ 40,000 of damage to its Threadneedle Street branch from the 17 - year - old protester .
The girl , who can not be named for legal reasons , was caught redhanded smashing computer equipment .
Attack : A demonstrator takes out a window of the Royal Bank of Scotland branch in the City during the G20 protests
She admitted following friends into the branch after its windows were smashed and joining them as they damaged property during demonstrations on April 1 .
Ann Crighton , prosecuting , told West London Youth Court yesterday that the bank wanted to recover its losses from the teenage environmental activist .
Mrs Crighton said : ' She was found smashing one of the computers in the main foyer of the bank .
' She thought it would be a good idea to go into the foyer .
When she got inside she thought it would be a better idea to smash up the computer .
' She said she changed her mind and tried to throw the computer through the window instead .
' She was seen picking up a keyboard and smashing a window . '
But Miranda Ching , defending , said the Scottish - born teenager , who lives in Brighton , is unemployed , does not claim benefits and lives on handouts from friends and family .
She said : ' RBS has gone for compensation in the sum of £ 40,000 .
In my view , this is wholly unjustified .
' It may well be that a substantial amount of criminal damage was caused as a whole by other people on April 1 .
We must look at what my client is charged with and that is IT equipment .
' That seems to be , at most , one computer keyboard and one computer monitor . '
Damage : A computer monitor is thrown at the building
Miss Ching said her client was introduced to political activism by her stepfather , who took her to protests on environmental and nuclear issues from an early age .
At an earlier hearing , the court heard that the teenager drank up to four cans of strong lager before joining the demonstration wearing a mask .
Magistrates were told she had lived an itinerant lifestyle , living at a series of environmental protest sites around Britain .
These included a long - established roads demonstration in Edinburgh and , more recently , a protest against a supermarket development on the outskirts of London .
The teenager was sentenced to an eight - month referral order which may include a smaller sum of compensation , a letter of apology and an agreement not to commit further crimes .
Ha , and you thought paying hundreds of dollars for a NIC was insane .
For one reason or another ( likely " another " ) , AtlasFolder has loaded in 23 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295 graphics cards into a single server rig , and while only 17 were installed at the time of this video ( he 's waiting for a few nuts and bolts before installing the others ) , we 're already amazed .
Call us crazy , but something such is this definitely is n't what NVIDIA had in mind when it revived SLI .

Impressive .
In 1987 , Joe Weber , a physicist at the University of Maryland , claimed to have detected gravitational waves at exactly the same moment that other astronomers witnessed the famous supernova of that year , SN1987A .
His equipment consisted of several massive aluminium bars that were designed to vibrate in a unique way when a large enough gravitational wave passed by .
His claims were ignored largely because other physicists calculated that gravitational waves ought to be several orders of magnitude too weak to be picked up by this kind of gear .
( And he ’d made several similar claims throughout the 60s and 70s that others had failed to repeat . )
But Weber ’s claims may have to be re-examined , says Asghar Qadir , a physicist at the National University of Sciences and Technology in Rawalpindi , Pakistan .
He points out that predicting the strength of a gravitational wave is by no means easy and until recently , only first order effects have been considered .
He and colleagues have now worked out that in certain circumstances , second order effects can enhance the waves .
But this only happens when there is a certain kind of assymetry in the event that created the waves .
But get this : the assymetry can enhance the waves by a factor of 10^4 .
He also points out that SN1987A is aspherical in exactly the way that might create this enhancement .
So if SN1987A generated gravitational waves , Weber would have been perfectly able to detect them .
Qadir concludes :
“ The claim of Weber to have observed gravitational waves from [ SN1987A ] needs to be re-assessed ” .
By all accounts , Weber was a careful experimenter who got something of a rough deal for his efforts ( the most comprehensive telling of the tale is in a book called Gravity ’s Shadow by Harry Collins ) .
Weber died in 2000 but it would n’t do any harm to re-examine his work in the light of this development .

A photographer on Miller Street said the side of the building was blown out and it was the most powerful ATM blast he had seen .
Witnesses told police that a few men were running south on Berry Street after the explosion and left in a late - model red Holden HSV sedan that had a loud exhaust and rear spoiler .
Detectives from Harbourside Local Area Command , Strike Force Piccadilly II and the Police Rescue Squad were investigating the robbery .
Miller Street was closed to traffic and pedestrians walking between Berry Street and the Pacific Highway , and some buses , were diverted .
The street has now been opened .
Police advised anyone who sees a suspicious - looking red Holden HSV sedan not to approach it , but to phone triple - 0 .
Anyone with information is asked to phone Harbourside Local Area Command or Strike Force Piccadilly II detectives via Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 .
The blast follows a string of gas attacks on ATMs in NSW and other states over the past few months .
Two days ago , two Westpac ATMs were attacked at a shopping complex in Erina .
A week ago , bandits struck a National Australia Bank in Lane Cove .
No money was taken in either explosion and no one was injured .
On February 11 , a bank and buildings around it were seriously damaged after an ATM blast at a shopping centre on Mona Vale Road , St Ives .
On February 4 , masked bandits escaped with cash after an ATM was blown up in Military Road in Neutral Bay .
There were 25 ATM blasts in NSW last year , in which millions of dollars were stolen , police said .
But they said most of the explosions were unsuccessful .
On February 20 , detectives from the taskforce arrested two men outside a bank on The Boulevarde at Punchbowl in Sydney 's south - west about 3.30 am .
They seized a BMW they suspected was stolen , and gas cylinders .
But a third man evaded the arrests and was seen running through Punchbowl train station a short time later .
The gas attacks involve feeding gas into ATMs , usually using gas cylinders .
The method , called " plofkraak " , was devised in the Netherlands , and has migrated across continents to Australia .
The Australian Banking Association said banks were considering installing dye packs and gas detection systems in ATMs in a bid to thwart the attacks .
ATM manufacturer NCR said such ink -staining technologies would render the cash useless and help catch the bandits .
" The rationale behind the ink - staining solution is that , with enough time and determination and the right tools , every security measure and safe can eventually be breached , " Phil Chant of NCR , the world 's leading ATM manufacturer , said .
" So our approach is , if you are going to get inside the safe , then we will render the cash worthless by the time you get it .
" That has proven successful in relation to ram - raids and we now make that ink - staining solution linked to gas detection technology . "
Strike Force Piccadilly II , which investigated the ATM ram - raid attacks a few years ago , was reformed to investigate the explosions , with rewards of up to $ 150,000 for information leading to a conviction .
Loading Detective Inspector Greg Antonjuk from the taskforce said public safety was its No.1 concern .
" The recent ATM attacks have the potential to be dangerous to both passers - by , as well as to offenders , " he said in a statement .

The pottery , named Yuanyang II , is one of the collections of Hong Kong Museum of Art now displaying at the Central Concourse of Hong Kong International Airport ( HKIA ) .
It is produced by Tsang Cheung - shing , a ceramic art tutor and product designer .
Yuanyang II is modeled in a distinctive form with two figures indulged in kissing each other .
Their heads support two elegant cups for drinking tea and coffee .
The form and concept design fully complement the theme “ Yuanyang ” ( a typical Hong Kong beverage of mixing tea and coffee ) , a symbol of marriage and love , with a touch of humour for artistic creation .
Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy ( MPIfR ) in Bonn , Germany , Cornell University , USA , and the University of Cologne , Germany , have detected two of the most complex molecules yet discovered in interstellar space : ethyl formate and n- propyl cyanide .
Their computational models of interstellar chemistry also indicate that yet larger organic molecules may be present -- including the so - far elusive amino acids , which are essential for life .
The results will be presented at the European Week of Astronomy and Space Science at the University of Hertfordshire on Tuesday 21st April .
The IRAM 30 m telescope in Spain was used to detect emission from molecules in the star - forming region Sagittarius B2 , close to the center of our galaxy .
The two new molecules were detected in a hot , dense cloud of gas known as the " Large Molecule Heimat " , which contains a luminous newly - formed star .
Large , organic molecules of many different sorts have been detected in this cloud in the past , including alcohols , aldehydes , and acids .
The new molecules ethyl formate ( C 2 H 5 OCHO ) and n- propyl cyanide ( C 3 H 7 CN ) represent two different classes of molecule -- esters and alkyl cyanides -- and they are the most complex of their kind yet detected in interstellar space .
Atoms and molecules emit radiation at very specific frequencies , which appear as characteristic " lines " in the electromagnetic spectrum of an astronomical source .
Recognizing the signature of a molecule in that spectrum is rather like identifying a human fingerprint .
" The difficulty in searching for complex molecules is that the best astronomical sources contain so many different molecules that their " fingerprints " overlap , and are difficult to disentangle " says Arnaud Belloche , scientist at the Max Planck institute and first author of the research paper .
" Larger molecules are even more difficult to identify because their " fingerprints " are barely visible : their radiation is distributed over many more lines that are much weaker " adds Holger Mueller , researcher at the University of Cologne .
Out of 3700 spectral lines detected with the IRAM telescope , the team identified 36 lines belonging to the two new molecules .
The researchers then used a computational model to understand the chemical processes that allow these and other molecules to form in space .
Chemical reactions can take place as the result of collisions between gaseous particles ; but there are also small grains of dust suspended in the interstellar gas , and these grains can be used as landing sites for atoms to meet and react , producing molecules .
As a result , the grains build up thick layers of ice , composed mainly of water , but also containing a number of basic organic molecules like methanol , the simplest alcohol .
" But , " says Robin Garrod , a researcher in astrochemistry at Cornell University , " the really large molecules do n't seem to build up this way , atom by atom . "
Rather , the computational models suggest that the more complex molecules form section by section , using pre-formed building blocks that are provided by molecules , such as methanol , that are already present on the dust grains .
The computational models show that these sections , or " functional groups " , can add together efficiently , building up a molecular " chain " in a series of short steps .
The two newly - discovered molecules seem to be produced in this way .
Adds Garrod , " There is no apparent limit to the size of molecules that can be formed by this process -- so there 's good reason to expect even more complex organic molecules to be there , if we can detect them . "
Senior MPIfR team member Karl Menten thinks that this will happen in the near future : " What we are doing now is like searching for a needle in a haystack .
Future instruments like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array will allow much more efficient studies to discover organic interstellar molecules . "
These may even include amino acids , which are required for the production of proteins , and are therefore essential to life on Earth .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- David Prowse , who played Darth Vader in the original " Star Wars " films , has revealed he is suffering from prostate cancer but is still feeling " fantastic . "
David Prowse signs autographs during the opening day of " Star Wars Celabration IV " in Los Angeles in 2007 .
Prowse , who wore the black suit and helmet to play the Dark Lord of the Sith , told a British radio station he had been undergoing radiotherapy at a hospital in south London and was helping its fundraising appeal .
" I 'm involved with the Royal Marsden Hospital appeal because I 'm undergoing treatment for prostate cancer , would you believe , " he told Absolute Radio .
" I 'm having my very last treatment this morning . "
" I 've had two months ' radiotherapy treatment at the Royal Marsden .
It 's the most fantastic hospital you could ever wish to go to . "
James Earl Jones did the voice for Vader , Luke Skywalker 's father , ( and also for CNN promotional links ) in the films as Prowse 's western English accent was thought to be unsuitable for the part .
Prowse , 73 , added he was fighting the disease .
" The only thing I 've had is hot flushes and my wife tells me I 'm going menopausal , " he said .
" It 's amazing what can be done so long as you catch it early . "
" Every man over the age of 50 should have a PSA test ( a blood test for prostate cancer ) and that just gives you some indication of whether you have prostate problems . "

SASKATOON , Saskatchewan ( Reuters ) -
Six high - risk prisoners escaped a Canadian jail last summer after spending four months chipping a path to freedom with nail clippers and other makeshift tools , according to a government report released on Thursday .
The prisoners , four of whom faced murder charges , used their tools to remove a heating grill and steel plate and win access to a brick exterior wall .
While some inmates played cards at a carefully positioned table to block the guards ’ view , others chipped away at the wall , finally breaking through with a steel shower rod .
They then used braided blankets and bedsheets to scale a wall of the compound and escape .
“ Idle hands are the Devil ’s tools , ” said the Saskatchewan government report , referring to the fact that prisoners at the Regina Correctional Center had little to do in the unit , which was built in 1964 and housed prisoners awaiting court dates .
“ They tend to gravitate toward doing whatever they can get away with . ”
The report team made 23 recommendations , all of which the Saskatchewan government accepted on Thursday .
The government will spend C$ 87 million ( $ 68 million ) building a new center in Saskatoon for prisoners awaiting court dates and C$ 9.4 million to bolster security equipment in prisons .
The report said at least 87 prison workers had supervised the six prisoners ’ unit without detecting the escape preparations .
Some guards had suspected something was being planned , but they did not interview the prisoners .
“ It was shocking , ” said Saskatchewan Corrections Minister Darryl Hickie , a former police officer and prison worker .
After sentencing The Pirate Bay Four the District Court has now asked the police to investigate their own people , as the verdict in the case leaked to the public hours before it was officially announced .
Whether or not the leak will have implications for the sentence is unknown .
Several hours before the verdict was read out in court , a journalist had already informed one of the defendants that they would be found guilty .
The source of the leak will now be investigated upon request from Stockholm ’s District Court .
“ It is extremely serious , ” District Court ’s chief Lena Berke said in a comment .
“ This is a breach of confidentiality , and therefore , we intend to notify the police , ” she added , noting that it has n’t influenced the court ’s ruling in any way .
Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde believes that there might have been more people who knew about the outcome beforehand .
Just 10 minutes after the verdict was announced , movie industry lawyer Monique Wadsted told a Swedish newspaper that the 107 was very well written , and that it would hold up all the way to the Supreme Court .
“ It would n’t surprise me if she wrote the verdict , ” Peter said .
Peter Sunde ’s lawyer Peter Althin was unpleasantly surprised and said he found it totally unacceptable that a verdict could be released in advance like this .
He said that he is unaware of any previous cases where this has happened before .
Sunde himself was not that bothered and joked about the leak .
“ Really , it ’s a bit LOL , ” he wrote on Twitter .
“ It used to be only movies , now even verdicts are out before the official release . ”
The Pirate Bay crew had anticipated a defeat in the case , but the jail time was unexpected .
Nevertheless ,
Peter is still positive about the outcome of the appeal and he ’s going to wrap up the tumultuous day with a party in his hometown Malmo .
“ I ’m gonna play some techno , ” he said .
We do not want this war , this violence , and we ’re ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas .
– Natalie Maines
I do n’t even know the Dixie Chicks , but I find it an insult for all the men and women who fought and died in past wars when almost the majority of America jumped down their throats for voicing an opinion .
It was like a verbal witch - hunt and lynching .
– Merle Haggard
Last night over dinner the subject of The Dixie Chicks came up , and I got mad all over again .
Which is unfortunate , because when you think about artists that talented the last thing on your mind ought to be anger .
But still , it ’s been six long years now since “ the top of the world came crashing down , ” and I ca n’t quite free myself of my rage at the staggering ignorance that led so many Americans to piss on the 1st Amendment by attempting to destroy the careers of Natalie Maines , Martie Maguire and Emily Robinson .
Frankly , I do n’t know how Natalie can make it through a performance of “ The Long Way Around ” or “ Not Ready to Make Nice ” because I can barely listen to the songs without wanting to take a folding chair to every goddamned corporate radio executive and program director in America responsible for driving them from the airwaves .
No doubt that this makes me a lesser man than I should be .
I ca n’t imagine that the Chicks would approve of my violent impulses ( which , I have to admit , are a little too literal for my own comfort ) , given the grace with which they have navigated the turbulence surrounding their lives in recent years .
In truth , they have n’t taken the long way around so much as they have taken the high road , and I regret that I ’m not quite worthy of the example they have set for those of us trying to lead civilized lives in the midst of so much willful ignorance .
In recognition of their willingness to risk their careers speaking truth to power and for their courage in facing the backlash ( which included death threats , let ’s remember ) that ’s all too frequently aimed at uppity women in the less advanced corners of our nation , Scholars & Rogues is proud to honor The Dixie Chicks as our latest Scrogues and accord them a place in our masthead of fame .
And , if it is n’t obvious , then I ’ll apologize in advance for not being up to the standards that Natalie , Martie and Emily have set .
They ’re not to blame for my tribute to them .
What Did the War on The Dixie Chicks Teach Us About Our Freedoms ?
Some time back I read a story in the international press about the rise of fundamentalist Islam in one of Europe ’s leading nations – I believe it was the Netherlands , but ca n’t recall for certain .
They ’re apparently facing the prospect that one day this minority could grow to the point where it could go to the polls and , using the legitimate engines of the democratic system available to it , vote to eradicate the nation ’s religious freedoms .
A politician was asked what should be done in this case .
His answer was that nothing should be done – it must be allowed , since it would be the result of a democratic process .
Quite a conundrum , that .
What to do when democracy is used to dispose of democracy ?
Obviously America is under no immediate threat from organized Islamist voters , but we do have our own Christian Taliban problem , do n’t we ?
What should we , here in the Land of the Free® , think about those who do not value actual freedom of religion ?
How many Americans would we send off to die to preserve the free speech rights of those who ’d squelch the free speech rights of their fellow citizens ?
What should a true patriot do when confronted with the reality that the tools of liberty are being used against Lady Liberty herself ?
My own code of ethics has always said that you cannot allow a barbarian to use your civilization as a weapon against you .
A man who insists on fighting according to a set of honorable rules while his opponent is using a tire iron to liquefy his testicles deserves what happens to him .
In my angrier moments I ’ve said that no , you do n’t fight fire with fire .
You fight fire with a flamethrower .
But that ’s just me , and you ’ll recall from earlier that I ’m perhaps not to be taken as a role model .
Still , we do live in a nation with many who do not share our respect for Constitutional freedoms .
Exactly how many I can’t say , but I feel comfortable with “ millions and millions . ”
It ’s certain that without such people we ’d not have had to endure eight years of Bush / Cheney thuggery .
I ’m Not Ready to Make Nice
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I do n’t mind sayin ’
It ’s a sad sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they ’d write me a letter
Sayin ’ that I better shut up and sing
Or my life will be over I ’m not ready to make nice
I ’m not ready to back down
I ’m still mad as hell and
I do n’t have time to go round and round and round
It ’s too late to make it right
I probably would n’t if I could
‘ Cause I ’m mad as hell
Ca n’t bring myself to do what it is you think I should
This was the message – “ shut up and sing . ”
You ’re not being paid to think , you mouthy little bitches , you ’re being paid to entertain us .
Now dance , girlies .
God Bless America .
History will validate , with a minimum of controversy , the sentiments Natalie Maines expressed at the Shepherd ’s Bush Empire theatre on March 10 , 2003 .
Hopefully the record will point to our present moment and note that already the momentum had shifted and that within a generation people would have an impossible time imagining how such an affront to freedom was ever possible .
Hopefully .
For the time being , “ mad as hell ” does n’t begin to describe the indignation that those of us working to move this culture forward by promoting genuinely intelligent and pro-human values ought to feel , even now .
I wo n’t tell you how to think and act , of course – you have a conscience and a brain , and you can be trusted to take in the information and perspectives around you and form an opinion that you can live by .
But for my part , I have a message for the “ shut up and sing ” crowd : I ’m not ready to back down and I never will be .
Your values are at odds with the principles upon which this nation was founded and true liberty cannot survive if your brand of flag - waving ignorance is allowed to thrive .
You will not be allowed to use the freedoms that our founders fought for as weapons to stifle freedom for others .
You have declared a culture war , so here ’s where the lines are drawn : I ’m on the side of enlightenment , free and informed expression and the power of pro-humanist pursuits to produce a better society where we all enjoy the fruits of our shared accomplishments .
What side are you on ?
" Eyes Right !
" The " Eyes Right " command is the biggest complement troops on paradecan pay and is reserved for dignitaries in reviewing stands .

At a roundtable this past weekend , Intel CTO Justin Rattner emphasized one overriding message to the journalists who made the trek out to the chipmaker 's Berkeley labs : Intel is still spending on research and development .
Rattner 's opening slide featured the following quote from White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel : " You do n't ever want a crisis to go to waste ; it 's an opportunity to do important things that you would otherwise avoid . "
Rattner reiterated this point in his own words , insisting , " we have historically viewed downturns as an opportunity to invest and improve our competitive position .
These times are really opportunities . "
Intel is not alone in keeping up its R&D spending during these lean times .
A recent Wall Street Journal investigation pulled together the R&D numbers for a host of technology companies and found that most of them , with two important exceptions , made relatively few cuts to their fourth quarter 2008 R&D budgets in year - over - year terms .
The two primary exceptions were AMD and Freescale , both of which took out the axe and cut their R&D spending significantly in the final quarter of last year .
It 's no coincidence that both companies made Moody 's recent " Most Likely to Default " list , and have been aggressively reducing costs since the downturn began .
AMD , for its part , has even more cuts ahead .
At this point , though , I have to ask : if AMD has cut loose its fabs , making it a design - focused company , and is now cutting its R&D — where is the company really headed ?
( Of course , a similar directionality question could also be asked of Sun , a company with an R&D budget that remained flat year - over - year . )
Ultimately , for a tech company to cut its R&D budget in a downturn is a desperate survival move — you 're essentially eating your seed corn and , unless you really hit the jackpot with whatever research you keep funding , you 're going to exit the downturn with no future .
But AMD and Freescale are n't the only ones gambling with their future .
Intel , as it turns out , is also taking on a bit more risk , even if it does n't show in dollar terms .
More wood behind fewer arrows == fewer shots
At the roundtable , Rattner described Intel 's R&D approach in this downturn as " putting more wood behind fewer arrows , " with the money specifically targeting Larrabee , Moorestown , and energy efficiency .
In other words , Intel is keeping its overall R&D budget mostly intact , but it is clustering those funds around a more selective slate of initiatives that it thinks have a higher probability of success .
The problem , of course , is that one or more of those shots may miss , as these shots inevitably do .
To abruptly switch analogies , this is the peril of both the AMD approach , which cuts down on the number of eggs and the number of baskets , and the Intel approach , which puts the same number of eggs into fewer baskets : either way , you wind up with all your eggs in fewer baskets .
The other issue is the time horizon of the research that gets funded by most companies — in a downturn , research that is n't likely to be monetizable soon is more likely to get the axe , as companies consolidate their resources into efforts with nearer - term profit potential .
I suspect that this represents a problem that is at least partly behind Rattner 's emphasis , which he has repeated in other venues , on the academy and government partnering with industry on R&D .
The academy and government are the two entities that , in theory , should have the longest research horizons .
There has been a lot of discussion about the ext4 data loss issue , and I see a lot of misconceptions , both about why rename ( ) is used and what guarantees POSIX gives .
I ’ll try to give the background , and then my opinion on the situation .
There are two basic ways to update a file .
You can either truncate the old file and write the new contents , or you can write the new contents to a temporary file and rename it over the old file when finished .
The rename method have several advantages , partly based on the fact that rename is atomic .
The exact wording from POSIX ( IEEE Std 1003.1TM , 2003 Edition ) is :
In this case , a link named new shall remain visible to other processes throughout the renaming operation and refer either to the file referred to by new or old before the operation began .
This gives the rename method some useful properties :
If the application crashes while writing the new file , the original file is left in place
If an application reads the file the same time as someone is updating it the reading application gets either the old or the new file in its entirety .
I.e. we will never read a partially finished file , a mixup of two files , or a missing file .
If two applications update the file at the same time we will at worst lose the changes from one of the writers , but never cause a corrupted file .
Note that nothing above talks about what happens in the case of a system crash .
This I because system crashes are not specified at all by POSIX .
In fact , the behaviour specified predates journaled filesystems where you have any reasonable expectation that recently written data is availible at all after a system crash .
For instance , a traditional unix filesystem like UFS or ext2 may well lose the entire filesystem on a system crash if you ’re unlucky , but it is still POSIX compliant .
In addition to the above POSIX specifies the “ fsync ” call , which can be used in the rename method .
It flushes all in - memory buffers corresponding to the file onto hardware ( this is vaguely specified and the exact behaviour is hw and sw dependent ) , not returning until its fully saved .
If called on the new file before renaming it over the old file it gives a number of advantages :
If there is a hardware I / O error during the write to the disk we can detect and report this .
In case of a system crash shortly after the write , its more likely that we get the new file than the old file ( for maximum chance of this you additionally need to fsync the directory the file is in )
Some filesystems may order the metadata writes such that the rename is written to disk , but the contents of the new file are not yet on disk .
If we crash at this point this is detected on mount and the file is truncated to 0 bytes .
Calling fsync( ) guarantees that this does not happen . [ ext4 ]
However , it also has a number of disadvantages :
It forces a write immediately , spinning up the disk and causing more power use and more wear on flash filesystems .
It causes a longer wait for the user , waiting for data to be on disk .
It causes lower throughput if updating multiple files in a row .
Some filesystems guarantee ordering constraint such that fsync more or less implies a full sync of all outstanding buffers , which may cause system - wide performance issues . [ ext3 ]
It should be noted that POSIX , and even ext4 gives no guarantees that the file will survive a system crash even if using fsync .
For instance , the data could be outstanding in hardware buffers when the crash happens , or the filesystem in use may not be journaled or otherwise be robust wrt crashes .
However , in case of a filesystem crash it gives a much better chance of getting the new data rather than the old , and on reordering filesystems like an unpatched ext4 it avoids truncated files from the rename method .
Both the fsync and the non-fsync version has their places .
For very important data the guarantees given by fsync are important enough to outweight the disadvantages .
But in many cases the disadvantages makes it too heavy to use , and the possible data loss is not as big of an issue ( after all , system crashes are pretty uncommon ) .
So much for the background , now over to my personal opinions on filesystem behaviour .
I think that in the default configuration all general purpose filesystem that claim to be robust ( be it via journalling or whatever ) should do their best to preserve the runtime guarantees of the atomic rename save operation so that they extend to the system crash case too .
In other words , given a write to a new file followed by a rename over an old file , we shall find either the old data or the new data .
This is a less of a requirement than fsync - on - close , but a requirement nevertheless that does result in a performance loss .
However , just the fact that you ’re running a journaled filesystem is a performance cost already , and something the user has explicitly chosen in order to have less risk of losing data .
It would be nice if the community could work out a way to express intent of the save operation to the filesystem in such a way that we avoid the unnecessary expensive fsync ( ) call .
For instance , we could add a fcntl like F_SETDATAORDERED that tells the kernel to ensure the data is written to the disk before writing the metadata for the file to the disk .
With this in place applications could choose either if they want the new file on disk * now * , or just if it wants either the old or the new file , without risk for total data loss .
( And fall back on fsync if the fcntl is not supported . )
This is the current status of the rename method on the commonly used Linux filesystems to my best knowledge :
( In this context “ safe ” means we get either the old or the new version of the file after a crash . )
ext2 : No robustness guarantees on system crash at all .
ext3 : In the default data=ordered mode it is safe , because data is written before metadata .
If you crash before the data is written ( 5 seconds by default ) you get the old data .
With data=writeback mode it is unsafe .
ext4 : Currently unsafe , with a quite long window where you risk data loss .
With the patches queued for 2.6.30 it is safe .
btrfs : Currently unsafe , the maintainer claims that patches are queued for 2.6.30 to make it safe
XFS : Currently unsafe ( as far as i can tell ) , however the truncate and overwrite method is safe .
Last week we ran a monster poll to gauge some level of reception to the current European PSN Store .
The votes were open to anyone , registered or not , and on the whole we averaged about 450 votes per question , which we think is a large enough subset of the European PS3 - owning public to make it all worthwhile .
And besides , pie charts are awesome .
How often do you switch on your PS3 ?
A simple question and one with predictable results , it appears most of you switch on your beloved black box more than once a day , with the remaining majority doing so just once a day .
Those that only switch it on once a fortnight , really ?
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
How often do you check the PSN Store ?
Again , naturally , most of our readers are incredibly savvy and only check when they know something is up that ’s worth checking for , and in this case with the European Store now firmly cemented on a late Thursday afternoon time slot .
How often do you buy PSN Store PS3 games ?
We thought we ’d have a higher percentage on the ‘ buy most ’ category , but it appears we as a group only buy the occasional PSN game .
Whether this is down to pricing or a lack of a demo we ’ll hopefully uncover later in the survey .
Would you download a PSN Store PS3 game demo ?
Thankfully we got the answers we were expecting out of this one : if there ’s a demo there ’s a good chance most people will grab it .
The question was open enough for interpretation of whether we meant just for genres you were interested in , but the results are still relevant anyway .
Do you check online reviews before downloading PSN Store PS3 games ?
Again , it shows our dedication to trying to bring you as many PSN reviews as we humanly can is worth it , as the vast majority of our readers would prefer to read a review of a PSN game before buying it .
But if you walked into a new bar and bought a £ 3.50 pint , would you want a review of that before handing over the money ?
Do you think PSN Store PS3 games are well priced ?
Again , predicatable results – the split is as expected with the vast majority saying that some games are well priced , and some are n’t , with much less of you thinking that all games are well priced .
Do Trophies affect your decision to buy PSN Store PS3 games ?
Frighteningly , a much higher precentage of you wo n’t touch PSN games if there ’s no Trophies .
Guys , they ’re not real , and it means you ’re missing out on some really nice PSN games from the last couple of years .
Which XBLA title would you most want to see on the PSN Store ?
A split right across the board , with Portal coming out on top , followed by the wonderful Braid , but the percentages were fairly level .
What does this show us ?
Well , a perception that XBLA has lots of quality games that we ’d like to see on the PSN , for starters .
What is your perception of the current PS3 game content of the PSN Store ?
A weighted question ; we would n’t expect PS3 fans to suggest that their own Store has any intrinsic faults or leanings , but it does appear that most of you think the content on the Store is well positioned in terms of new and old games .
How much have you spent on PS3 games on the PSN Store ?
Hugely surprising , with the vast majority of you having spent between £ 10 and £ 50 , with the next group down having spent over £ 50 .
Encouraging figures , though , and the sheer number of you that appear to be remortaging their houses just to fund their Store habits : wow .
What do you think the average price of a PSN Store PS3 game should be ?
£ 2 - £ 5 seems to be the sweet spot , with the next block down prepared to pay up to £ 8 for their PSN Store games .
We ’re glad the percentage of people thinking the games could retail for less than £ 2 was so small , as that figure simply is n’t reasonable .
How often do you buy additional DLC from the PSN Store ?
Again , a question we assumed we ’d know the answer to without running it , but it ’s good to see that most of you only buy the content you really want .
We ’re never going to get figures from publishers on how many cars , tracks and costumes are sold , but it ’s worth re-iterating the fact to the men behind the DLC that just throwing stuff on there wo n’t wash .
And DLC that ’s already on the disk as unlocks …
Pah .
Are you happy with the European PSN Store ?
Good , most of you agree with us that the European PSN Store still needs work to bring it up to scratch with the American and Japanese Stores .
Whilst the biggest chunk is a “ not really ” we ’re sure this chunk is a much smaller slice than it would have been if we ’d asked this 12 months ago .
Do you wish SCEE would let you know Store content in advance ?
And finally , it appears 75 % of you would rather we were told what was coming in the weekly stores ahead of schedule .
We do try our best with the Thursday updates , gathering information from everyone we can speak to that ’s prepared to tell us when their stuff is launching , but it ’s not always feasable .
Instead , SCEE like to run the guessing game with us all day , but it ’s clear you ’d rather this was n’t the case .
And that ’s that .
We ’ll get this off to SCEE and if we hear back , we ’ll let you know .
Thanks again to everyone that took part in the poll .

Camera Pills
Health seems is going hi-tech , thanks to scientists who have now developed camera pills and ultra - sound creating maps , which they claim to facilitate accurate surgery without causing stress to patients .
An international team has created a new IT - based window on the inside of the body , which makes a patient transparent on a screen when a surgeon inserts instruments via small openings in the abdominal wall .
What the system actually does is transform X -ray and nuclear magnetic resonance ( MR ) images into three - dimensional maps which the surgeon can navigate when he performs surgery in the abdominal cavity .
Moreover , the system provides information that enables the surgeon to avoid blood vessels and other vital organs while operating through small openings in the abdominal wall .
According to the scientists , the technique enables the surgeon to select a more lenient keyhole approach in operations that otherwise demand large , open interventions , thereby putting less stress on the patient ’s body .
“ With a better view of vital organs , a surgeon can perform keyhole surgery with an extra high margin of safety , and can employ keyhole surgery more often than before to remove tumours in organs that would not otherwise be easily accessible to keyhole interventions , ” said lead scientist Thomas Lange of SINTEF in the Netherlands .

“ But I can tell you we ’re not satisfied with the current state , ” said Paul Nolasco , a Tokyo spokesman for Toyota , which has sold one million Prius vehicles since their introduction a decade ago .
“ The Insight ’s popularity is evidence that the public is recognizing hybrid technology . ”
The market for hybrids could be headed for a huge expansion .
The development of cheaper technology , economies of scale and more government subsidies for environmentally friendly vehicles could take what was a niche technology into the mainstream .
A bigger market for hybrids could also ensure that they stay the green vehicle of choice over full electric or hydrogen cars , which remain prohibitively expensive .
A report released by J. P. Morgan in October predicted that the global market for hybrids “ will rise exponentially ” to 9.6 million in 2018 from 500,000 units in 2007  and the current economic slump will not significantly slow that rise , the authors said .
The Insight could bring about a big turnaround for Honda , which tried selling hybrids for a decade without much success .
In fact , it discontinued a previous Insight model in 2006 , believing consumers found hybrids too expensive .
But when sales of Toyota ’s Prius rose as oil prices spiked , Honda quickly changed course .
Behind the less expensive Insight is an aggressive cost - cutting effort , as well as technological sacrifices .
Instead of the more complicated hybrid system used in the Prius , the Insight ’s main source of power is a lightweight gasoline engine that is assisted by smaller batteries .
That greatly reduces manufacturing costs , but gives the Insight lower fuel efficiency than the Prius  43 miles per gallon on the highway compared with 45 miles per gallon for the Prius .
The Insight also shares parts with other Honda models , which helps the carmaker keep costs to a minimum .
Honda has also struck a chord with an overhaul of the car ’s shape .
One reason its previous hybrids failed to take off , analysts say , was that they did not come in distinctive shapes .
The HRP - 4C robot was developed by Japan ’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology .
The fashion robot is ready for her runway debut .
The 62 inch tall robot has over 30 motors to help her strike the right pose , including 8 motors in her face for the right expression .
Will she soon appear on Project Runway ?
We do n’t know , but she will be appearing on the runway in Japan next week .
The robot will also go on sale soon for about $ 203,000 .

Following the news of a 31 - year - old chimp who evidently likes to plot out attacks on his Swedish zoo visitors , a monkey in Thailand became tired of his owner beating him and forcing him up trees to collect coconuts — so he threw one straight at the owner ’s head .
[ social_buttons ]
Leilit Janchoom purchased the monkey , named Brother Kwan , for $ 180 thinking the animal could help collect coconuts to sell at the market for five cents a piece .
But Brother Kwan frequently became tired of climbing palm trees and would stop for a break .
Janchoom would beat the monkey until he ’d climb up another tree for more coconuts .
Sure enough , after one beating too many , Brother Kwan hurled a coconut straight down onto Janchoom ’s head .
He died instantly .
While Santino , the 31 - year - old chimp in Sweden , was unfortunately castrated for his plotting , it ’s unclear whether Brother Kwan escaped after the killing or faces any punishment .
I think his case would stand up in court as self - defense .
So that makes three cases of captive primates flipping out in the last month — what ’s going to happen next ?

The Singularity .
Ray Kurzweil has popularized it and , by now , some of our readers no doubt drop it frequently into casual conversation and await it like salvation .
( The second “ helping ? ” ) but many more are still unfamiliar with the concept .
The contemporary notion of the Singularity got started with legendary SF writer Vernor Vinge , whose 1981 novella True Names pictured a society on the verge of this “ event . ”
In a 1993 essay , “ The Coming Technological Singularity , ” Vinge made his vision clear , writing that “ within thirty years , we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence .
Shortly after , the human era will be ended . ”
We caught up with Vinge at the 2008 Singularity Summit in San Jose , California , where he opened the proceedings in conversation with Bob Pisani of CNBC .
Vinge ’s most recent novel is Rainbow ’s End .
h+ : Let ’s start with the basics .
What is the Singularity ?
VERNOR VINGE : Lots of people have definitions for the Singularity that may differ in various ways .
My personal definition for the Singularity — I think that in the relatively near historical future , humans , using technology , will be able to create , or become , creatures of superhuman intelligence .
I think the term Singularity is appropriate , because unlike other technological changes , it seems to me pretty evident that this change would be unintelligible to us afterwards in the same way that our present civilization is unintelligible to a goldfish .
h+ : Have n’t there been other Singularities throughout history ?
VV : Some folks will say there have been singularities before — for instance , the printing press .
but before Gutenberg , you could have explained to somebody what a printing press would be and you could have explained the consequences .
Even though those consequences might not have been believed , the listener would have understood what you were saying .
But you could not explain a printing press to a goldfish or a flat worm .
And having the post - Singularity explained to us now is qualitatively different from explaining past breakthroughs in the same way .
So all these extreme events like the invention of fire , the invention of the printing press , and the evolution of cities and agriculture are not the right analogy .
The technological Singularity is more akin to the rise of humankind within the animal kingdom , or perhaps to the rise of multi-cellular life .
h+ : Is the Singularity near ?
VV : I ‘d personally be surprised if it had n’t happened by 2030 .
That does n’t mean that terrible things wo n’t happen instead , but I think it is the most likely non-catastrophic event in the near future .
h+ : Should we be alarmed by the Singularity ?
VV : You are contemplating something that can surpass the most competitively effective feature humans have — intelligence .
So it ’s entirely natural that there would be some real uneasiness about this .
As I said , the nearest analogy in the history of the earth is probably the rise of humans within the animal kingdom .
There are some things about that which might not be good for humans .
on the other hand , I think this points toward something larger .
Thinking about the possibility of creating or becoming something of superhuman intelligence is an example of an optimism that is so far - reaching that it forces one to look carefully at what one has wanted .
In other words , humans have been striving to make their lives better for a very long time .
And it is very unsettling to realize that we may be entering an era where questions like “ what is the meaning of life ? ” will be practical engineering questions .
And that should be unsettling .
On the other hand , I think it could be kind of healthy , if we look at the things we really want , and look at what it would mean if we could get them .
And then we could move forward from there .
h+ :
What signs would you look for which indicated that the Singularity is near ?
VV : There are a number of negative and positive symptoms that a person can watch for .
An example of a negative symptom would be if you began to notice larger and larger software debacles .
In fact , that ’s sort of fun to write about .
One of the simplest of positive signs is simply to note whether or not the effects of Moore ’s Law are continuing on track .
The fundamental change that may be taking place — humans may not be best characterized as the tool - creating animal but as the only animal that has figured out how to outsource its cognition — how to spread its cognitive abilities into the outside world .
We ’ve been doing that for a little while ten thousand years .
Reading and writing is outsourcing of memory .
So we have a process going on here , and you can watch to see whether it ’s ongoing .
So , for instance , in the next ten years , if you notice more and more substitution for using fragments of human cognition in the outside world — if human occupational responsibility becomes more and more automated in areas involving judgment that have n’t yet been automated — then what you ’re seeing is rather like a rising tide of this cognitive outsourcing .
That would actually be a very powerful symptom .
Update 9.55 pm : Wikileaks has published a more up - to - date copy of the ACMA blacklist , current as of the 18 March .
This list includes abortiontv , wikileaks itself and Philip Nitschke 's Poison Pill Handbook as well as a similar smattering of legal material and innocent sites .
The leaking of the ACMA blacklist as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday and commented on by EFA has provoked a lot of interest and we have received many questions from the public and journalists .
Here are a few more comments on the revelation of the blacklist .
I 'll address the authenticity of the list in a moment , but the question is almost irrelevant for a couple of reasons , First , a leak of the blacklist is inevitable once it is distributed to every ISP in the country .
It may happen tomorrow or a month from now , but the leak will occur and the contents will not be substantially different from the list we have seen on Wikileaks .
The leak has clearly demonstrated that the Government 's rhetoric about child - abuse and " ultra - violent " material on the list has not been telling the whole story .
We already knew that the scope of the list was much wider than that - R- rated material has always been on the list - but the inclusion of many online gambling sites and legitimate Australian businesses has surprised many people .
People are now realising that the list could affect sites they themselves visit , that controversial material and politically sensitive material will make the list , and that mistakes are bound to be made .
One of the ( many ) ways that censoring the internet differs from , say , the censorship of movies , is that ordinary Australian individuals and businesses are affected directly .
It 's not that far - fetched to imagine that an Australian retailer could have their website defaced ; a complaint is filed either maliciously or with good intentions ; and they find themselves on a secret blacklist with no way of seeking redress .
All they would know is that nobody in Australia was able to access their web site any more , and that they were losing business .
Additions to the list are not subject to appeal , unlike censorship in other media .
Is this the real ACMA blacklist ?
The list , as published on Wikileaks , is not likely to be an exact copy of the ACMA blacklist at that time in 2008 , as it contains more items than ACMA reported being on the list then .
The Minister is no doubt correct in his denials that this is the ACMA list .
It is possible , however , that the list is a superset of the ACMA list , with a few additions either from a filter vendor or from previous editions of the blacklist .
The list includes information on the dates in which banned URLs were added .
These numbers track very closely with the numbers of RC sites reported by ACMA in the same periods .
We have also had reports that a list labeled " ACMA " can be extracted from one of the approved filtering products who receive the blacklist and that this matches the list leaked .
Therefore , it seems highly likely that the leaked document bears close resemblance to that maintained by ACMA .
In any case , the sites added to the leaked blacklist would almost certainly match ACMA 's criteria for blacklisting .
Time - and further leaks - will tell the whole story .
What criminal sanctions could apply for distributing the blacklist ?
The Minister 's rhetoric on this subject has been pretty uncompromising , with threats of police action and fines levelled at anyone who distributes the list .
The proverbial genie is already out of the bottle , as the document is accessible on the public internet and cannot be expunged even if Wikileaks were persuaded to remove it ( not a likely scenario ) .
Any prosecution would therefore be an exercise in example - setting .
Any charges laid against the public would most likely be laid under statutes targeting the distribution of child - abuse material ( as opposed to , say , a law safeguarding Government secrets ) .
There are many uncertainties in this area of law .
Definitions of child - abuse material can vary , and it is not entirely clear that a list of links might not qualify .
Certainly , a prosecutor could argue that distributing the list constitutes " making available " such material .
Various defences could be offered , including that the dissemination of the information is in the public 's benefit .
Visiting sites on the list is clearly a dangerous affair given the risk some of the sites contain illegal material .
Any would - be investigator disseminating the list is in the precarious position of not knowing for sure whether the list does contain links to illegal material but unable to investigate .
For a more authoritative and in - depth discussion see Nic Suzor 's article Criminal sanctions for distributing the ( ACMA ? ) blacklist .
In any case , until these uncertainties are clarified , publishing the list is not to be recommended .
Potential penalties include up to 10 years imprisonment .
Sadly , this does put a chilling effect on the public 's ability to have an informed and robust discussion about the list and hence , the internet censorship policy .

So – you ’ve set up a Facebook public profile for yourself , your brand or your company , and you ’re starting to post content .
Now what ?
If you ’re like me – a tinkerer and tweaker – you might be interested in ways to fine - tune your profile for maximum affect .
So here are five tips to optimize your activities on Facebook , including the right way to create profile and thumbnail graphics , how to show different content to Fans and non-Fans , creating DIY vanity urls , and how managing what and when you post can lead to greater success .
This post is part of Mashable ’s Facebook Week .
To discuss everything Facebook , join our authors and community at Mashable 's Facebook Page .
1. Creating the perfect profile picture
Facebook specs recommend that profile pictures should be 200 px wide , while height can vary as needed .
What is less documented is how the thumbnail that Facebook uses across the system is generated from this picture .
You 'll find the system crops images when generating a thumbnail , losing information around the edge .
After some initial testing , we ’ve determined that there 's a “ title safe " area within all images .
So when you create your profile image that 's 200 px wide , allow a 12 pixel border around crucial information ( such as typography or a logo ) to allow for automatic cropping .
Also bear in mind that regardless of the shape of your profile image , Facebook thumbnails are square ( with rounded corners ) , and sized based on the length of the shortest side of your image .
So when designing rectangular profile pictures , make sure to keep your desired thumbnail imagery within a square boundary .
2. Optimizing your website ’s Share Preview
A key strength of Facebook – especially for the new Public Profiles – is the viral spread of shared links into news feeds , using the Links application ( now also built directly into the Publisher box at the top of your Wall ) .
When anyone links to your site using this , the application presents the user with a number of images from the page that can be chosen as a thumbnail to accompany the link .
But if your site is mainly Flash - based , or has no suitable graphic components for a thumbnail , you should define a custom Share Preview image .
Facebook provides specific information on how to do this here - with a snippet of code to add to the HEAD of your website pages that points to your desired image .
Again , no guidance is given as to the perfect size for a Share Preview , but we ’ve found that a 100 pixel square preview is optimal .
This not only requires no resizing by Facebook , but also provides a suitable shape for Digg , which uses the same code to pull its own Share Preview ( albeit reduced down to 48 px square ) .
Note that the Facebook Links application will also pull the “ Description ” Meta Tag from your site into the news feed , so ensure that you have made this sufficiently explanatory ( you can also define the media - type icon that Facebook uses in feeds for your site e.g. blog , news , picture , video , etc – full details to be found in the Facebook Share documentation ) .
You can also explicitly add a Facebook Share button to your site as well to encourage your visitors to share it .
3. Displaying different content for Fans and non-Fans
Public Profiles now allow separate default landing areas for Fans and Non-Fans .
This allows brands to display a “ Become a Fan ” incentive in an FBML box or Tab .
A common request we ’ve heard from brands is “ Is there a simple way to display different content for Fans and non-Fans ? ”
This allows for some interesting scenarios , from displaying a simple “ Thank you ” to people who become Fans , to incentivizing visitors to “ Become a Fan to see exclusive content / promo code / offer . ”
So here ’s a quick hack for creating an FBML box that can be used on the Wall or Boxes page ( or in its own Tab ) that displays different information to different users , depending on their Fan / logged - in status :
1. Create a 1 cell borderless table , with a fixed height and width ; for example , 100 px .
2. Create and define a background image for that cell to the same dimensions , which contains the information you want NON - fans to see .
3 . Create a same - sized image that contains the information you want Fans to see and insert that into the cell .
4 . Use the following FBML tag to surround the cell contents - < fb:visible - to - connection > < img src= " insert your image URL " ></fb:visible-to-connection > .
This FBML
Tag only displays its content to Fans who are logged in .
So what we ’re actually doing here is creating a table with a background image , and then covering it up with another one IF you ’re a Fan .
It ’s a bit of a hack , but only takes five minutes to do .
Here ’s some example code if you want to try it :
< table width= " xx " height = " yy " border= " 0 " cellspacing = " 0 " cellpadding = " 0 " >< tr > < td background = " http://www.yourdomain.com/linkto/nonfans.jpg " > < fb:visible-to-connection > < img src= " http://www.yourdomain.com/linkto/fans.jpg " height = " xx " width= "yy " /> </fb:visible-to-connection >
</td></tr></table>
4. Vanity URL , or Custom Domain ?
Vanity URLs are now open to all brands whose Pages have at least 100 fans .
However , if you like you can still make use of a domain you already own to point to your Facebook Page using a domain redirect .
If you own your own domain ( and frankly , who does n’t ) , you can set up http://facebook.mydomain.com to point to your profile .
Easy to remember , easy to share .
Obviously , the same tactic applies to profiles you may set up on Twitter , Linked In , etc. as well .
5 . Defining a publishing schedule for your content
This is n’t really a tip , but more of a best practice .
By creating a calendar to guide your updates , you will achieve the following benefits :
1 . You can spread updates out so that you carry on a persistent but unobtrusive dialog with your Fans .
Post too often and your page updates will start being hidden , or you ’ll lose fans .
Too seldom and you ’ll be forgotten .
Try to mix up different update types – a status update , a Link , a Note , a Photo or video update .
2 . By creating a calendar , you can also schedule moderation periods for comments if you feel this is necessary for your brand .
Most Interaction activity ( including comments ) will occur within 24 hours of an update before it drops out of Fans ’ news feeds .
3 . By recording all activity on a schedule , it ’s easier to map it against exported stats data from your page ’s Insights .
This can show you Total Interactions around different content types to gauge which gets the most traction / conversation , and track Removed Fans against certain update types .

Justin D. Barnard makes the most convincing case I 've seen against cognitive enhancing drugs :
... while the capacities to procure and to process information are indeed goods of human life , they are neither the highest of human goods nor are they ends in themselves .
Yet , the use of cognitive enhancers by the healthy implicitly treats the single good at which the drug aims as though it were the most important or only good of one ’s mental life considered as a whole ... if merely thinking ( very fast ! ) about lots of information were the most important or only good of the human mental life considered as a whole , why not simply replace us with computers ?
エンタープライズ領域に もRuby普及か
独 SAP、自社VMでRuby処理系のサポート追加へ
Java VM、.NET Frameworkに続いて、エンタープライズアプリケーションで使われてるもう1つのメジャーなバーチャルマシン（VM）、「ABAP VM」上でもRuby言語がサポートされる可能性が出てきた。
独 SAPは3月27日、同社のWebアプリケーションサーバで動くRubyの実験実装「 Blue Rubyプロジェクト」について明らかにしている。ABAP（Advanced Business Application Programming）は、 独SAPが提供するWebアプリケーションサーバ「 SAP NetWeaver Application Server 」は、J2EEと独自言語ABAPによるアプリケーション開発が可能なVMを備えている。
Blue Rubyプロジェクトは、開発効率が高くアジャイル開発に適したRubyの世界と、すでに実績があり堅牢なSAPのWebアプリケーションサーバの世界をつなぐもの、という。DSL（Domain Specific Languages）を作成する環境も、Rubyによって実現できる。
Rubyソースコードを中間言語にコンパイル
具体的にはRubyで書かれたコンパイラを使い、Rubyで書かれたソースコードをBRIL（Blue Ruby Intermediate Language）と呼ぶバイトコードに変換。これをBlue Ruby VMと呼ぶスタックマシン上で走らせる。このBlue Ruby VM は、ABAB VM上で動くプロセスの1つで、同じABAPのVM上に載ることから、Rubyアプリケーションから、ABAPのすべてのオブジェクトにアクセスできるほか、オブジェクトの生成や、それらオブジェクトへのメッセージの送信が可能という。逆に、ABAPアプリケーションからRubyのメソッドを呼ぶこともできる。Rubyのソースコードは、仮想ファイルシステムシステムを通してデータベースに保存される。また、RubyソースコードのBRILへのコンパイルは、セーブ時に毎回行われるため、起動時のオーバーヘッドはないという。
BRIL はBlue Ruby向けに作られたバイトコードで、動的言語の特徴を持っている。例えば文法エラーがあっても、コンパイル時にエラーを出すのではなく、実行時に例外を上げるといった違いがあるという。
ABAPが提供するAPI（RFC）をRubyで利用する例。「1」という名称を持つビジネスパートナーを表示している
Blue Ruby VMは、既存のVM環境の中で1つのプロセスとしてサンドボックス化されて動く
Ruby からABAP、ABAPからRubyの双方向の呼び出しには制限もある。Ruby側からは、ABPA側のすべてにアクセスできるできるわけではなく、とりわけ、データベースアクセスに関しては、ブリッジと呼ばれるインターフェイスを通しABAPアプリケーションからのみ可能。これは、Ruby開発者が既存のプラットフォームを破壊しないようにするための設計で、こうしたコントロールがなければ、業務目的での利用は望めないだろうとしている。
Blue Ruby は、2009年3月27日時点でRubyの互換性を検証するrubyspecテストに70％程度パスしているという。ただし、OSに依存するプロセス関連や、低レベルなネットワーク関連ライブラリはなく、I/O関連も仮想化ファイルシステムのライブラリとして実装されているなどの違いがある。
このBlue Rubyプロジェクトは、動的言語をサポートするための汎用的なアプローチであるため、Blue Rubyがうまくいけば、今後はBlue PHP 、Blue Pythonなども計画しているという。
すでにマイクロソフトは.NET上のRuby実装としてIronRubyを提供しているほか、サン・マイクロシステムズはJava VM上のRuby実装としてJRubyの開発を支援している。SAPのRuby言語サポート追加が実現すれば、エンタープライズ用途へのRuby普及が加速するかもしれない。

According to this ABC News headline , Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has offered a “ right - wing mea culpa ” for the report this site played a major role in bringing to public attention .
However , journalist Rachel Martin ( or perhaps her copy editor ) either has a political agenda or they just are n’t all that smart over at ABC .
While the title suggests an apology to the right , the article only mentions mentions issues pertaining to veterans .
The article does n’t cover the tens and tens of millions of Americans who may be “ mainly antigovernment , rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority , or rejecting government authority entirely . ”
It does n’t mention “ groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue , such as opposition to abortion or immigration , ” either .
I ’ll note that in her initial statement regarding the issue , Napolitano referenced the veteran ’s issue , too .
Perhaps she was following John Boehner ’s lead ?
According to the article , it seems that Napolitano ’s meeting with the American Legion ’s National Commander David Rehbein “ seemed to satisfy ” those upset with the report .
This veteran of eleven years is now doubly insulted .
As a civilian political activist , I ’m highly upset that virtually every believer in the principles of small government ( this category describes me well ) or social conservatism ( this does n’t describe this libertarian so much ) has been labeled as a potential terrorist .
That Napolitano , Rehbein , Boehner and ABC News seem to be operating in concert to sweep this attack on having a political ideology under the rug is dangerous .
As a veteran , I ’m now as upset with Rehbein as I am with those who are only focusing on the veteran ’s side of this issue .
I took that “ support and defend the Constitution of the United States ” portion of my oath very damned seriously .
Part of the Constitution I swore I ’d uphold ( and Rehbehn , Napolitano and Boehner should know this general oath even better than I do ) is that pesky little First Amendment .
In case Napolitano , Rehbein , Boehner and ABC News have forgotten , it allows for freedom of speech , assembly and the right to air grievences against the government .
Military service is an honor , and most veterans I know place their defense of the Constitution and the American people ahead of their own personal desires .
This veteran wo n’t even hear of an apology to veterans until people who believe in smaller government have first been apologized to .
This veteran wo n’t even hear of an apology to veterans until people who support the 10th Amendment have first been apologized to .
This veteran wo n’t even hear of an apology to veterans until anarchists have first been apologized to .
This veteran wo n’t even hear of an apology to veterans until people who are pro-life people have first been apologized to .
This veteran wo n’t even hear of an apology to veterans until people who believe in closed - borders have first been apologized to .
I certainly do n’t agree with all of these issues , but I would have willingly died to ensure that people had the right to express these views and to mobilize politically to support them .
Unless something additional happened in their conversation which I have n’t seen in the news , Rehbehn has dishonored each of us who has ever worn our nation ’s uniform .
There is no honor in taking refuge in a photo - op apology while the rights of many American citizens are still being disregarded .
UPDATE : This blog posting seems to have provoked a lot of anger from the left .
Since you ’re here , you might as well read about why your Messiah should replace Janet Napolitano with Andrew Napolitano , too .
SANTA FE , N.M. ( AP )  Gov. Bill Richardson signed legislation Wednesday to repeal New Mexico ’s death penalty , calling it the “ most difficult decision in my political life . ”
The legislation replaces lethal injection with a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole .
“ Faced with the reality that our system for imposing the death penalty can never be perfect , my conscience compels me to replace the death penalty with a solution that keeps society safe , ” Mr. Richardson said at a news conference in the Capitol .
The governor , a Democrat , faced a deadline of midnight for making a decision on the bill that lawmakers sent him last week .

One of my favorite things about writing a blog , are the conversations in the comments and sidebars ( private email conversation ) .
I learn so much from those who have share their stories and advice .
This week I had an amazing private email thread with someone who works as a development professional at a well - established nonprofit institution .
I 'll call him " Sam " ( not his real name ) .
Sam shared a story that illustrates the barriers that many nonprofit organizations face in adopting social media and harnessing its power leading to successful outcomes .
Sam 's story illustrates the pressing need for culture change within nonprofits or as colleague , Allison Fine , puts it " organizational silos prevent people from empowering their edge . "
Source : Working Wikily
Sam 's story illustrates the tension between working as an organization versus in a networked way or working wikily .
He allowed me to share his story if I stripped out all the identifying details .
I am a nonprofit development professional .
I 'm comfortable using social networks and other social media sites , although I use them as an individual , I see great potential for my nonprofit organization 's fundraising efforts .
I asked about a SM policy when I started a new position in a nonprofit institution about seven months ago .
I was told it was being formulated by the marketing department .
The website and branding of this nonprofit institution is controlled by its marketing department ( which oversees memberships and is often at odds with the development department , where my position is housed ) , and so this task fell to them .
Still no policy , seven months later .
Not long ago , I created a minor stir by advocating that our voluntary young professionals group ( host of several fundraising events and a responsibility in my job description ) immediately start using Facebook , including the step of inviting current institution members to join a Facebook group .
I was asked by marketing to submit a full proposal to them about Facebook and get their approval before going forward and for anything I post to the group .
The young professionals group revolted .
They are now using Facebook on their own .
They recently agreed to add me as an administrator for the group .
This could have been avoided if we could just have the conversation across departments about our policy and approach to social network sites - from what we can do personally / individually to how we 'll support , facilitate , or work with self - forming groups on social networks that want to support our institution .
My offer to help kickstart , research and join the social networking policy development process at work ( from a fundraiser perspective ) was also rebuffed .
Why is our institution stuck in silos and how can we transition out of this so we can effectively deploy a social networking strategy across boundaries of departments ?
Does this sound like you and your nonprofit organization ?
How do we change this and pave the way for effective social media use ?
Geoff Livingston has been writing about social media adoption from the perspective of corporations , government , and large nonprofits .
In a post called " The Cultural Challenge to Integration , " he makes a case that short - term experiments can't harness the power of social media unless there is full organizational engagement .
He suggests an " organizational gut check " about organizational culture .
In the end , organizational leaders need to bring the right people to the table and stop thinking about social media in a silo or as tool - driven decisions .
He says it is up to the " c- suite " and whether they are ready to change from working as a silo organization and in a more networked way .
What is the process and pace of making this change ?
Geoff Livingston , in his post , From the Silo to Hive , suggests that to succeed it needs to be evolutionary and not sudden .
He offers this advice :
Applied , social media can serve as an elixir , a means to ease the process of moving towards an extended corporate hive with empowered edges .
A new structure of enterprise social media means empowering internal & external stakeholders with the ability to communicate ( work ) more fluidly across an extended architecture and share information .
Social media is not meant to gut the organization or its purpose .
Nor is it meant to build individual stars in an enterprise .
Instead it should support achieving a better result across teams of people by helping the culture migrate to modern information usage .
The end results could be more productivity , better customer relationships , financial rewards and revamped , better policies .
Geoff goes on to pinpoint some areas for assessment and change .
I 've pulled out a few that I think are particularly relevant for nonprofits :
Is there a process to vet online donor , member , or stakeholder feedback ?
Or does the program department not interact with communications ?
And why ?
Review processes that involve many departments across the organization that take weeks to approve a press release or a web page will not allow for live conversations about real issues
Does the organization have processes that enable rapid adjustment strategies based on evolving conversations .
Impressions and views are no longer viable measurements .
Interactions that lead towards a goal are .
How are people rewarded for communicating ?
Impressions or results ?
Does legal prevent communications from occurring ?
What ’s the barometer ?
Is the protection worth it in the new environment ?
Is your nonprofit effecting culture change within to fully embrace social media ?
Is your social media strategy stopped in its tracks from silo culture ?
Could your organization 's use of social media be more effective if your leadership and whole organization embraced it ?

Federal officials declared a public health emergency Sunday as eight cases of swine flu were identified in New York and one was announced in Ohio , bringing the U.S. total of confirmed cases to 20 .
In a briefing at the White House , the acting head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Dr. Richard Besser , warned Americans to prepare for a widespread outbreak , yet urged the public to remain calm .
Also Sunday , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the government would release a quarter of its 50 - million - unit strategic reserve of antiviral medications , which combat the disease in infected patients , to states where outbreaks had occurred .
Canadian officials , meanwhile , said four cases had been confirmed in Nova Scotia and two in British Columbia , marking the first time that this particular strain had appeared north of the U.S. border .
All six Canadian cases were mild , like those in the United States .

Several other countries have reported influenza - like illnesses that they suspect may be swine flu in travelers returning home from Mexico , but as of Sunday evening , none of them had been confirmed .
Nonetheless , many nations moved quickly to limit the disease ’s spread , in many cases appearing to be near panic .
Some , such as Poland and Venezuela , warned against traveling to the United States or Mexico .
Others , such as Russia and Brazil , began screening some incoming international air travelers for signs of high fever .
China , Russia and Taiwan said they would quarantine returning passengers with flu symptoms .
In Mexico , Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said almost two dozen more deaths had occurred from influenza overnight , bringing the death total to 103 .
At least two of the new cases were confirmed as swine flu , for a total of 22 confirmed swine flu deaths .
It is not clear how many of the others were caused by the virus .

Of the more than 1,600 suspected flu cases in that country , the Mexican government has said most are probably linked to other strains of the flu or respiratory diseases , not the new strain of swine flu .
On NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said swine flu was “ serious enough to be a great concern to this White House and to this government . ”
He added that President Obama was receiving frequent updates on the situation .
“ We are taking the proper precautions to address anything that happens , ” Gibbs said .
“ It ’s not a time to panic . ”
Napolitano said the emergency declaration was a routine move to ensure that the government was prepared “ in an environment where we really do n’t know , ultimately , what the size or seriousness of this outbreak is going to be . ”

It seemed certain , however , that the number of swine flu cases -- mild or otherwise -- would rise .
“ As we continue to look for cases , we are going to see a broader spectrum of disease , ” Besser said .
“ We ’re going to see more severe disease in this country . ”
Because of the situation in Mexico , “ I do feel that we will have deaths here , ” Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at a separate news conference .
She ’s the interim deputy director for science and public health programs .
Besser said the CDC had isolated the swine flu virus and prepared a “ seed stock ” for the manufacture of a vaccine but would not distribute it to pharmaceutical companies until the situation became more severe .
Manufacture of a new vaccine will require months .
Public health officials cast the various moves as aggressive but precautionary , and they counseled calm .

The eight confirmed cases in New York involved students at St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens .
City officials had said Saturday that the virus involved was probably swine flu , and that was confirmed overnight by researchers at the CDC .
Some of those students had taken a spring break in Mexico .
Flu - like symptoms have been reported in some of the parents , but causes have not been confirmed .
Officials also tested children at a New York day - care center where illness had been reported , but those tests came back negative .
The new case in Ohio is a 9 - year - old boy in Lorain County .
He has a mild case of the disease and is recovering at home .

Previously announced cases included two in Texas , two in Kansas and seven in California ’s Imperial and San Diego counties .
All the cases were mild , and the victims have recovered .
The Nova Scotia Department of Health Promotion and Protection said Sunday that four cases had been confirmed in Windsor , Hants County , in eastern Canada .
The four victims were students who had recently traveled to Mexico .
None of them have been hospitalized .
Two teenage boys in British Columbia in western Canada were also confirmed to have swine flu .
Both had mild cases , which were identified as swine flu only because their doctors heeded government calls to perform tests on flu victims who had traveled out of the country .
“ This is moving fast , ” Besser said , “ but I want you to understand that we view this more as a marathon . ”

The symptoms of swine flu are nearly identical to those of other influenza , including high fever , aches , coughing and congestion .
It is spreading by human to human contact .
No cases of infection from pigs have been confirmed .
And although Russia and some other countries have banned imports of pork from Mexico , there is absolutely no evidence that it can be transmitted by eating meat , said Dr. Keiji Fukuda , assistant director - general of the World Health Organization .
Several airlines said they would waive charges for changing tickets for passengers scheduled to travel to or through Mexico .
Health experts have noted that about 36,000 people die in the U.S. during a normal flu season , with deaths worldwide totaling 500,000 to 1 million annually .
Officials suspect that many of the deaths in Mexico were , in fact , caused by seasonal influenza , which is believed to remain a greater threat than swine flu .

The principal difference with the new virus is that -- as with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic -- it seems to be affecting primarily the young and healthy , rather than the children and elderly most severely afflicted by seasonal flu .
Besser and other officials at the news conference emphasized steps that the public could take to limit the spread of the disease :
Wash hands frequently ; stay home and do n’t board airplanes if you feel sick ; and keep sick children out of school .
Meanwhile , California and other affected states have requested CDC assistance in tracking the infections and have recommended increased testing of people with flu symptoms who have been traveling or who have severe cases .
California health authorities have also ordered enhanced veterinary activities to look for outbreaks in pigs .

Gibbs said it was too early to speculate about economic effects of an outbreak .
And he dismissed reporters who asked whether the federal response was hampered by the fact that the Senate had not confirmed Obama ’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services , Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas .
“ It ’s all hands on deck , and we ’re doing fine , ” Gibbs said .
“ I would say that we hope we have a new secretary shortly . ”

Swine flu facts
WHAT IS IT ?
Swine flu is a general term for flu viruses adapted to pigs .
Swine flu can infect humans , most often from a pig to someone handling pigs .
It can pass from human to human via coughing , sneezing or touching infected people or surfaces , then touching the mouth , nose or eyes .
SYMPTOMS
Advertisement
Symptoms are similar to regular flu : fever , fatigue , sore throat , cough , poor appetite , body aches and chills .
Some people also have nausea , vomiting and diarrhea .
HOW DANGEROUS IS IT ?
Experts do n’t know how deadly swine flu is because they do n’t know how many people have been infected .
The World Health Organization says the overall mortality rate is 1 % to 4 % .
PREVENTION
Advertisement
Cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze .
Use tissues and throw them in the trash .
Wash your hands with soap and water .
Use alcohol - based hand sanitizers .
Avoid sick people .
If you are sick , stay home .
People who have been exposed can get a prescription for the antiviral drugs oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) or zanamivir ( Relenza ) .

McClatchy reports that torture was reauthorized in spring of 2003 by four Bush administration officials : Dick Cheney , Condi Rice , John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales .
It has already been revealed by McClatchy that the reason for the reaffirmation to the CIA to go on intensively waterboarding and otherwise torturing Abu Zubayda and Khalid Sheikh Muhammad was to get them to allege an operational tie between al - Qaeda and Saddam Hussein , a link that did not exist .
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell were absent from the reauthorization meeting .
( My guess is that they were too smart to come to it , realizing that it could be a one - way trip to the International Court of Justice at the Hague . )
The McClatchy headline also indicates that these four officials may have pressured the lawyers who wrote bizarre legal opinions saying that torture is OK in US law when it is not .
( If they had written legal opinions saying that murder was OK , would that also be a matter of mere legal interpretation that might legitimately differ from attorney to attorney ?
But then what is the difference between torture and murder in the law , or in ethics ? )
The reauthorization of torture contravenes the Geneva Conventions , to which the US is signatory , which is to say , it contravenes US law .
Liz Cheney defended her father from charges of authorizing torture on MSNBC .
Liz Cheney should be reminded that the Nuremberg process executed at least one person for persistently advocating crimes against humanity even though he never killed anyone with his own hands .
It is therefore a matter for some concern that the offenses may only be investigated and adjudicated in Europe , relatively toothlessly .
Mark Follman reminds us that the legality or uselessness of torture is not the only issue .
There is also the issue of morality and of its warping effect on the torturers .
But note that the March waterboardings were not for the purpose of increasing national security ; they were intended to provide a propaganda victory for an illegal war plan .
That is not just wrong , it is evil .
See also Tom Engelhardt ’s essay on the sacrifices ( of other people ) we think necessary to ‘ make us safe , ’ this time in Afghanistan .
John McCain , himself tortured in North Vietnam , is asking that no Bush administration officials be prosecuted for advising or authorizing torture .

Her name means " a beautiful woman has arrived " and for almost a century the 3,400 - year - old bust of the Egyptian Queen Nefertiti has been regarded as a true likeness .
Now it seems that in the flesh , she was n't that good looking after all .
The delicately featured bust of the wife of the King Akhenaten has been one of the highlights of Berlin 's museum collection ever since it was excavated by German archaeologists and first put on display in 1923 .
It will shortly take pride of place in the city 's recently revamped Neues Museum .
But scientific researchers say they have established that her limestone bust appears to have been given a facelift .
Call it ancient world Botox .
Using the latest computer tomography techniques developed for medicine , the researchers from Berlin 's Imaging Science Institute took a series of scans of the bust and discovered that the sculpture was made up of a limestone core covered in layers of stucco of varying thickness .
Advances in CT technology meant that they were able to probe deeper than a previous scan carried out in 1992 .
They found that the inner facial cast , which would have been taken directly from the queen 's face , differed significantly from the outside of the bust .
It had less prominent cheekbones ; a slight bump on the ridge of the nose ; marked wrinkles around the corner of the mouth and cheeks ; and less depth at the corners of the eyelids .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The cosmetic alterations appeared to have been made by the Egyptian royal sculptor Thutmose , whose studio was dug up by archaeologists at the ancient settlement of Amarna south of Cairo in 1912 .
The scientists assume that the sculptor would have taken the original plaster mask of the queen 's face and used it as a model for the " improved " bust .
" It is possible that the bust of Nefertiti was probably commissioned by King Akhenaten himself to represent her according to his personal perception , " said Alexander Huppertz , the director of the institute .
" The changes could have been made to make the queen adhere more to the ideals of the time . "
The bust is currently a major bone of cultural contention between Egypt and Germany , with Cairo demanding that Berlin hand back the priceless sculpture .
Nefertiti's bust was excavated by the German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt in 1912 and at the time its discovery was hailed as a triumph of Imperial Prussian prowess .
Entries in the archaeologist 's diaries show that he was beside himself with excitement when he unearthed his find .
" Suddenly we have the most alive Egyptian artwork in our hands , " he wrote , " You can not describe it with words .
You can only see it . "
However documents discovered earlier this year suggest that the Germans tricked the Egyptian authorities out of the sculpture by deliberately covering up its true value before they took it out of the country .
Papers found in Germany 's Oriental Institute provide an authenticated account of a meeting between Borchardt and an Egyptian official in 1913 , shortly before the bust was taken to Germany .
The writer of the account recalls how Borchardt , " wanted to save the bust for us " .
As a result the German team were reported to have wrapped up Nefertiti and placed it deep in the bottom of a trunk in a dimly lit room in order to fool the authorities .
At the same time the Germans allegedly supplied the Egyptians with a deliberately unflattering photograph of the bust and claimed that it was made from gypsum rather than limestone .
The deception paid off and enabled the Germans to smuggle Nefertiti out of Egypt .
But the evidence of deception has only served to inflame the row between Cairo and Berlin .
The Egyptians have requested that , at the very least , Nefertiti's bust be returned to Egypt on loan to mark the inauguration of a new museum that is scheduled to open near the Pyramids at Giza in 2012 .
Egypt has threatened never to take part in any future antiquities exhibitions in Germany if Berlin refuses to grant the three - month loan .
So far , the Germans have dug in their heels and refused .
They say that the bust is too fragile to be allowed to travel .
Dietrich Wilding , the head of Berlin 's Egyptian Museum insists that the Nefertiti bust , which attracts more than half a million visitors to the city each year , has attained the kind of global notoriety that would have been less likely had the bust remained in Egypt .
" She keeps her separateness and her uniqueness , yet she belongs here , " he said .
Germany 's Oriental Institute has also been quick to play down suggestions that trickery was used to smuggle out the Nefertiti bust .
It argues that the Egyptians should have been more observant .
" It is not right to complain about a deal that was reached so long ago , " a spokesman said .
Revealed :
The queen 's hidden face
The differences between the faces ( see pictures , above ) , though slight – creases at the corners of the mouth , far left , a bump on the nose of the stone version – suggest to Dr Alexander Huppertz that someone expressly ordered the adjustments between stone and stucco when royal sculptors immortalised Nefertiti 3,300 years ago .

THE FIRE LAST TIME - The 1920 Wall Street Bombing
American Heritage ^ | December , 2001 | By Nathan Ward

The Fire Last Time
When terrorists first struck New Yorks financial district
American Heritage
by Nathan Ward
December , 2001
If you go downtown in Manhattan to the offices of the old J. P. Morgan firm at the corner of Wall and Broad , youll see the pocked - marble scars of the first blow that terrorists struck at Americas financial heart , the Wall Street bombing of 1920 .
The country recovered amazingly well from that outrage , although no one was ever brought to justice for the crime , which was , until the Oklahoma City devastation , the most deadly terrorist attack in American history .
On the very next day following the explosion , the Stock Exchange and curb trading resumed , however shakily .
" Like a strong man who sticks to the line after binding up his wounds and sewing on his wound stripes , " reported the New York Sun , " Wall Street , from its lowly office boy to its most stately financier , went to work yesterday morning with head up and teeth set , determined to show the world that business will proceed as usual despite bombs . "
At noon on the day after the attack , September 17 , New Yorkers came by the thousands to the bomb scene to show their defiance and exorcise their fears .
An event honoring " Constitution Day , " the 133d anniversary of the documents adoption , had been previously scheduled for that day in the area near the George Washington statue , which was surprisingly undamaged by the blast .
The small celebration swelled into one of the largest gatherings in Wall Streets history .
The crowd sang " The Star - Spangled Banner " and listened to speakers defy the nameless radicals responsible for the bomb .
Twenty - four hours before , just after noon on September 16 , 1920 , a horse cart filled with dynamite and sash weights had exploded in front of the Assay Office , near the intersection of Wall and Broad , killing 30 people instantly and injuring about 300 others .
( Eventually , some 40 would die . )
The lunch hour had barely begun , and many of the victims were messengers crossing the street or clerks hit by shattered glass as they ate at their desks .
The hundreds of pounds of sash weights acted like shrapnel .
One piece of iron was blown to the thirty - fourth floor of the Equitable building ; canopies burned and windows broke a quarter - mile away .
" I saw the explosion , a column of smoke shoot up into the air and then saw people dropping all around me , some of them with their clothing afire , " the head of the Stock Exchanges messengers , Charles P. Dougherty , told the Sun .
The Exchange closed within a minute of the explosion , for fear of the falling glass , which might have seriously injured the hundreds of traders caught inside if it had not been deflected by the buildings big silk curtains .
" I first felt , rather than heard the explosion , " an eyewitness reporter for the Associated Press recalled .
" I dodged into a convenient doorway to escape falling glass and reach a telephone and call the office .
Looking down Wall Street later , I could see a mushroom - shaped cloud of yellowish green smoke which mounted to the height of more than 100 feet , the smoke being licked by darting tongues of flame . "
Outside , said a visiting coal magnate , glass covered the street like a snowstorm ; wounded people and severed body parts lay scattered everywhere .
The blast , which witnesses said tossed a nearby automobile 20 feet in the air , also stove in the offices of J. P. Morgan , just across from the bomb cart , decapitating the firms young chief clerk , William Joyce , who had been seated near the front .
Morgan himself was vacationing in Britain .
" This bomb was not directed at Mr. Morgan or any individual , " said the chief of the Secret Service , William J. Flynn .
" In my opinion it was planted in the financial heart of America as a defiance of the American people .
Im convinced a nationwide dynamiting conspiracy exists to wreck the American government and society . "
Whether or not the bomb had been aimed at Morgan , the estates of Morgan , Rockefeller , and other prominent men of the Street were now put under guard .
Two charred horse hooves , the only whole pieces of the horse or the wagon , landed at the foot of Trinity Church , into which a number of the wounded had struggled , seeking refuge from the fire and acrid smoke .
Detectives carried the blackened horseshoes to 4,000 blacksmiths along the Atlantic seaboard but came up only with the recollection of an Elizabeth Street smith , Dominik De Grazia , that he had recently changed a shoe for a " Sicilian " - accented driver .
Ten tons of broken glass were carted off to police headquarters , where they were panned for clues and kept for two years .
Then , as now , most Americans held a particular ethnic picture of a terrorist ; at that time , it was based on the Italian and Russian radicals credited with bombings over the previous 10 years in Los Angeles , Chicago , New York , Boston , and Washington .
A tremendously ambitious terror scheme in which 36 bombs were mailed to wellknown Americans in Gimbel Brothers boxes to be opened on May Day 1919 had nearly succeeded .
Half the packages reached their intended targets , while the rest were discovered in a New York City post office .
As with other suspicious disasters , multiple scenarios for the explosion emerged almost immediately .
Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer thought the Wall Street attack must also be the work of anarchist or Bolshevik groups , and he quickly arrested the head of the Industrial Workers of the World , Big Bill Haywood , " as a precaution . "
A less sinister , and less popular , explanation claimed the horse cart belonged to a dynamite company and had simply gone off upon hitting a cobblestone , but by days end the fire department had accounted for all such deliveries .
" Authorities were agreed that the devastating blast signaled the long - threatened Red outrages , " the Times reported on its front page the day after , while an adjacent article followed the far weirder story of " Two Cards of Warning " sent by the former ninth - ranked mens tennis player , Edwin Fischer , who had vaguely predicted the explosion to his friends .
Fischer , a seldom - employed 44 - year - old sportsman from the Upper West Side , had picked both September 15 and 16 as likely days for the attack ; he had also warned a groundskeeper at his tennis club and a stranger on a train and had told a Toronto bellboy that some millionaires were soon to get what they had coming .
His brother - in - law , who caught up with him in Ontario after he had mysteriously fled , reported that Fischer had twice been committed to sanitariums but had nevertheless shown psychic powers for several years .
Dr. Walter F. Prince , at the American Institute for Scientific Research , told reporters it was possible Fischer had received a " psychic tip " of the bomb plot , like " picking up a wireless message . "
Fischer , it turned out , predicted bad things happening to Wall Street pretty regularly .
He was returned to New York and held at Bellevue Hospital , but after he told detectives that he was an alchemist and a sparring partner for Jack Dempsey and much more , they pronounced him harmlessly ( if annoyingly ) insane .
In his excellent history of Wall Street in the twenties , Once in Golconda , John Brooks suggests other explanations for the bombing : a botched robbery or an attack on the Treasury .
On the day of the explosion , $ 900 million in gold bars was being moved out of the Sub - Treasury Building , which was next door to the new Assay Office , where the deadly wagon was parked .
At the time of the explosion , workmen at the Treasury had just closed the side - entrance doors for lunch , possibly saving themselves as well as the gold .
But the answer to this mystery , unlike later inscrutable tragedies such as the TWA disaster , may have been disappointingly plain .
Postal workers found circulars mailed a block away between 11:30 and 11:58 on the fatal day : " Remember / We will not tolerate / any longer /
Free the political / prisoners or it will be / sure death for all of you / American Anarchist Fighters . "
The Anarchist Fighters had been linked to , among other things , the May Day bombing scheme of the year before and to radical groups ( including what newspapers called the notorious " Galliani gang " ) around Lynn , Massachusetts , a place federal authorities then considered " the most dangerous spot in America , " according to a later investigator .
Still another theory had it that the Wall Street bombing was revenge for the September 11 murder indictment of two Italian - born anarchists in Dedham , Massachusetts , Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti .
Just as now , a recent immigrant group found itself broadly and unfairly blamed for the possible work of a few whose horrific violence had its roots in Old World politics .
Americans of the twenties waited months and then years for the case to break , but no one was ever caught .
Nine years after the attack , Sidney Sutherland wrote in Liberty magazine , " If the Wall Street bomb explosion was the result of a murder plot , it speaks eloquently for the bond of silence which the lawless world imposes on its members . "
Over the decades , the feeling returned that this kind of thing happened in other places ; even after the horror in Oklahoma City , Americans  day - to - day lives were hardly altered , except we now were routinely asked at airports whether wed packed our own bags .
However , with the fiery attack on the Pentagon , the destruction of the Twin Towers , and the taking of so many thousands of lives , that old feeling and style of life will likely never return .
Nathan Ward , an editor of Library Journal , is writing a novel about the Wall Street bombing .

As with other suspicious disasters , multiple scenarios for the explosion emerged almost immediately .
Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer thought the Wall Street attack must also be the work of anarchist or Bolshevik groups , and he quickly arrested the head of the Industrial Workers of the World , Big Bill Haywood , " as a precaution . "
Bombings were used by many labor unions in the early part of the century as a terror tool .
For example , the Los Angeles Times building was destroyed in apx .
1909 .
Clarence Darrow represented the labor union officials accused of planting the bomb .
He pleaded them guilty to avoid the death penalty --- and was himself tried for bribing jurors in the trial .

Really great how someone posted an article on this forgotten incident .
There 's nothing people enjoy more than " old- fogeyism " .... portraying everything in America 's past through idyllic rose - colored glasses and portraying everything today as America going to hell in a handbasket and every new disaster or outrage as something totally new .
There 's very little new under the sun .
Anarchist bombings and assassinations were rampant around the world in the 1880 - 1930 or so period ... including the assassination of President McKinley .
The only reason Anarchists did n't fly a jetliner into a skyscraper is that there had no jetliners at all and no skscrapers until late in the period .
They assuredly would have if there had been both in 1920 ... they used avaliable technology as best they could to cause mayhem .
Another good example is the constant mistake by the media describing Columbine as the " Deadliest US school violence " .. they were totally wrong .
In 1927 some loon who was upset at high local taxes blew up an elementary school in Minnesota and killed 38 kids .
It 's interesting also how the anarchist attacks were largely associated with recent Italian and Eastern European immigrants , and I speculated earlier how many Italian Americans or Eastern Europeans have been among the " deport all the towelheads " crowd on FR .

Forget the good bank / bad bank , I have an even bigger beef with this INSANE absurdity :
Why are the taxpayers making good on hedge fund trades gone bad ?
I cannot figure that one out .
When AIG first faltered , there were two companies jammed under one roof .
One was a highly regulated , state supervised , life insurance company .
In fact , the biggest such firm in the world .
The other firm was an unregulated structured finance firm , specializing in credit default swaps and other derivatives .
The first firm was Triple AAA rated .
They had a long history of steady growth , profitability , excellent management .
They made money ( as the commercial goes ) the old fashioned way :
They earned it .
This half of the company held the most important insurance in many families ’ financial lives :
Their life insurance .
When an AIG policy holder passed away , the company paid off the policy , providing monies that get used to pay off mortgages , kids ’ colleges , and surviving spouse ’s life time living expenses .
Given the importance of this payment , one can see why it is crucial to make sure there are sufficient reserves to make good on the promise of the life insurance policies .
The actuarial tables used are conservative , the accounting transparent .
The policy payoffs rock solid , utterly reliable .
AIG , this insurance company , was well run .
It made a steady income , provided a valuable service to its clients .
It was also very solvent .
The other part of the firm was none of the above .
It was neither regulated nor transparent .
It existed only in the shadow banking world , a nether region of speculation , and of big derivative bets .
This part of the company engaged in the most speculative of trading with hedge funds , banks , rank speculators , gamblers from around the world .
Huge derivative bets were placed , with billions of dollars riding on the outcome .
It served a far more limited societal function than the Life insurance portion , other than a legal pursuit of profit .
This part of AIG was nothing more than a giant structured finance hedge fund .
Despite the fact this hedge fund had no rating , no supervision or oversight , it managed to trade off of the Triple AAA rating of the regulated half of the firm .
Somehow , it was treated as if it was Triple AAA , regulated and guaranteed by the government .
This was nothing more than a giant scam , perpetrated by the people who were running the AIG hedge fund .
It was exempt from any form of regulation or supervision , thanks to the Commodities Futures Modernization Act .
This ruinous piece of legislation was sponsored by former Senator Phil Gramm ( R ) , supported by Alan Greenspan ( R ) , former Treasury Secretary ( and Citibank board member ) Robert Rubin ( D ) , and current presidential advisor Larry Summers ( D ) .
It was signed into law by President Clinton ( D ) .
It was the single most disastrous piece of bipartisan legislation ever signed into law .
As you might have guessed by now , this portion of AIG is the INSOLVENT half .
Here is the question that every single taxpayer should be asking themselves : WHY AM I PAYING $ 1000 TO BAIL OUT THIS GIANT HEDGE FUND ?
Of all the many horrific decisions that Hank Paulson made , this may be his very worst .
That is a very special description , given his track record of incompetence and cluelessness .
~~~
What should have been done ?
Simple :
When we nationalized AIG , we should have immediately spun out the good , solvent life insurance company .
It is a highly viable standalone entity .
The hedge fund should have been wound down in an orderly fashion .
Match up the offsetting trades , the rest go to zero .
End of story .
You as a credit default swap gamblor have no reasonable expectation that anyone other than the incompetent firm you placed your bet with is going to make good .
You had as your xounter party another hedge fund .
Tahatwas the risk YOU — not the yaxpayer — assumed .
That is was under the roof of a legitimate insurance company is irrelevant .
Right now , we are into this clusterfuck for $ 166 billion — every last penny of which is a needless waste .
Taxpayers should not be bailing out hedge fund trades .
This insanity must cease immediately .
Lightpainting by JanLeonardo
Lightpainting : Light Art Photography & LAPP
JanLeonardo ist einer der führenden internationalen Spezialisten der Lightpainting Kunst .
Die Herausforderung des Lightpainting Fotografen ist die Gestaltung mit gesteuertem und choreographiertem , künstlichem Licht .
Light Art Photography und Lightpainting sind eine Symbiose aus Langzeitfotografie und Lichtkunstaufführung .
Durch die Möglichkeit , komponierte und einstudierte ( Choreographien ) Lichtbewegungen sowie spezielle technische Herangehensweisen in einer Performance zu vereinen , kann diese dynamische Bewegung in Langzeitbelichtungen festgehalten werden .
Die lange Belichtungszeit bietet dabei die Zeit und damit die Bühne , um eine Choreographie aufführen zu können .
Bewegte Lichtquellen hinterlassen während der Langzeitbelichtung Lichtspuren auf dem Sensor oder dem Filmmaterial .
Seit 2005 wurden viele verschiedene Herangehensweisen entwickelt , die eines gemeinsam haben : Die Verwendung von Licht und Langzeitfotografie .
Montagen und Collagen am Computer sind verpönt .
Sinn von Light Art Photography ist es , ein Lichtkunstwerk während einer einzelnen Langzeitbelichtungsaufnahme entstehen zu lassen .
Eine Nachbearbeitung am Computer , muss sich daher auf Beschneiden , Nachschärfen , Tonwertkorrekturen sowie Farbanpassungen und Rauschbearbeitung beschränken …

Carrie Milbank is the host of The Hockey Show on the NHL network , and a former Houston Texans Cheerleader .
She also hosts Tennis Week , and People.com ’s Who Looked Hot .
It is no secret that I am fond of Miss Milbank , and I previously featured her with the best gallery of Carrie Milbank photos on the net .
Well apparently Maxim has noticed her now too , as she was recently highlighted in their “ Today ’s Girl ” feature on the website .
The subtitle , “ Poke checking never sounded sexier ” was particularly witty .
As part of that piece , they interviewed Milbank , and lucky for us , there is video below .
So yeah , I guess you can say I am a little jealous .
I too have recently interviewed Carrie , but through e-mail .
She was kind enough to answer Gunaxin ’s Six Questions , and I thank her for providing some saucy answers .
Also , to add to that previous epic gallery , we have some new photos of the Ice Princess .
Several of the photos in this gallery ( including what was on Maxim ) and in our other gallery were taken by her friend and photographer Katie Ambrose .

Balance plays a pivotal role in our lives whether we notice it or not .
We are constantly bombarded with external forces that disrupt our equilibrium .
So much so , that we often fail to notice , as our bodies are so effectively equipped to deal with such disturbances .
We do , however , notice when our systems fail us , resulting in injury or an embarrassing moment , or even worse , both !
Understanding balance in its entirety makes it much easier to comprehend movement , appreciate how incredible our bodies truly are , and realize how something like yoga can develop abilities that we did n’t even know we possessed .
There are three systems in the body that contribute to the function of balance : the visual system , the vestibular system and the proprioceptive system .
The visual system contributes to the execution of balance as it provides feedback as to where we are in space .
The vestibular system is a network of canals in the inner ear which supply information of our head ’s position ( tilted , rotated , flexed or extended ) .
The proprioceptive system is composed of sensory receptors in the muscles and tendons that inform the central nervous system as to the varying lengths of muscles , as well as force loads traveling through tendons .
This notifies us as to how and where our body and limbs are oriented in space .
The human body has many regulating control systems that function via the nervous system .
Receptors exist in our muscles which recognize when the length of the muscle fibers are changing .
These act as a protective mechanism for the muscles .
With excessive lengthening of a muscle , a reflex will be initiated which will cause the muscle to contract in order to prevent a ligament sprain or muscle strain injury .
A similar regulation system exists in tendons , but it instead is dependent on the force being loaded through the tendon rather than on its length .
These two regulatory systems of the muscles and tendons contribute to what is known as proprioception .
Proprioception is the new catch term .
Rehabilitation programs are now focusing their attention on muscle coordination and muscle inhibition with the intention of improving muscle firing ( contracting ) patterns .
Throughout our lives , we develop motor patterns which are essentially the blueprints that muscles follow in order to accomplish a movement task such as walking or even chopping up vegetables .
Typically , muscular weakness , inhibition ( muscle not firing properly ) , and / or pain will cause a normal motor pattern to become abnormal .
For example , the primary function of the gluteus maximus ( buttock muscle ) is to extend the hip .
However , many people have gluteus maximus muscles that are either inhibited or weak .
Therefore , the hamstrings or lumbar spine ( low back ) erector muscles are forced to facilitate hip extension .
Due to this novel , aberrant , motor pattern , these individuals commonly complain of tight hamstrings , irritated sacroiliac joints , and / or chronic low back pain .
The probability of injury increases dramatically , as does the inefficiency of movements when muscles are regularly recruited to compensate for weakness , inhibition or pain .
These abnormal patterns can be corrected ; however , they do require specific rehabilitation .
When an individual ’s balance is jeopardized by external factors such as being bumped into or slipping on ice , the correct muscles must be prepared to engage immediately .
Proprioceptive rehabilitation focuses on training muscles to accelerate their ability to achieve maximum contraction .
( Liebenson , p. 529 )
This is why training on unstable surfaces such as wobble boards and Bosu balls is currently so popular .
By training on an unsteady surface , balance is constantly being challenged .
The correct muscles must contract rapidly in order to counteract the forces that the disrupted balance is placing on the body .
When muscles can respond quickly to perturbations , injury is less likely and performance is more likely to be enhanced .
Proprioceptive training is relevant for all people in all stages of life .
With youth comes silly antics , sports and activities that place us at an increased risk of injury , despite relatively strong , healthy bodies .
With age , our vision becomes diminished and our vestibular system begins to deteriorate ; however , our proprioceptive system can be quite well preserved .
As these changes occur throughout our lives , it is obvious that our balance becomes increasingly endangered .
Decreased bone density is commonly associated with increasing age , as is the concern for deficient balance .
Therefore , it only makes sense that fracture due to falls is the next concern to consider in this equation .
The risks associated with hip fracture in the elderly are severe and often fatal .
Proprioceptive training can aid in the prevention of falls and the subsequent concerns of pneumonia and death .
Hence , in our younger , untamed years , having a well developed proprioceptive system will aid in the avoidance of plaster casts and time away from the activities we love .
Similarly , in our elder years it will assist in the evasion of falls and succeeding complications .
Now that the importance of a healthy proprioceptive system has been made frighteningly clear , it is time to discuss further , how this can be achieved .
The soles of the feet , the sacroiliac area and the neck are the three most richly supplied areas of the body with proprioceptors .
( Liebenson , p.515 )
Due to this fact , these areas can be most affected by proprioceptive training .
A technique now being used is known as sensory motor stimulation ( SMS ) .
The body creates motor patterns which can be altered both negatively and positively .
The principle behind SMS is that abnormal blueprints can be corrected by reeducating the nervous system .
( Liebenson , p.514 ) .
This learning comes from challenging the sensory system to convey messages appropriately and quickly to muscles that are required to fire both rapidly and maximally .
In yoga , it is taught that the longitudinal and transverse arches of the foot should be lifted .
This means that both the inside and outside of the foot should lift while ensuring that all four corners of the foot remain in contact with the floor .
The toes should be spread and should not be used as a lever by which to maintain lift through the arches .
Therefore , they should gently rest on the ground .
This “ yoga foot ” helps to increase the sensory feedback to the CNS , therefore improving the stability of the body in the upright position .
( Liebenson , p.518 )
Working with the yoga foot through poses will heighten the sensory feedback from the body , especially during balance poses during which the proprioceptive system is ultimately challenged .
Via this challenge , great improvements to the system can be made .
As certain poses become less of a challenge , increasing the demands on the systems of balance will allow for continual improvement .
Some balance poses will stress the system more than others .
However , the demand will be determined by the skill level of the practicing yogi .
For example , for an instructor who has been practicing for years , revolved half moon pose is a piece of cake in regards to balance .
However , Tree Pose can be a real tribulation for a beginner .
This illustrates the point that balance can be both trained and improved via the practice of yoga .
Drishti ( gaze ) plays with the visual component of balance as it often involves looking in a direction that makes the body feel unsteady .
By utilizing drishti appropriately , it will further increase the difficulty of balancing in many poses , therefore providing opportunities for improvement of the balancing systems .
Since the cervical spine has such a high density of proprioceptors , rotating the head to follow the correct drishti will often make us feel as though we are off balance .
Again , with practice , this will become easier and with an associated enhancement of balance .
In this sort of training , it is important to ensure that the muscles are as free as possible of both scar tissue and trigger points as they can alter the ability to perform appropriate muscle firing patterns .
Treatments such as Active Release Technique ® and Graston Technique ® are effective methods of ridding the tissues of such hindrances .
Unhealthy tissues decrease the muscle ’s aptitude to contract appropriately , initially causing the abnormal patterns .
Therefore , it is ideal to attempt to have healthy muscular tissue before training .
With well developed balance comes great improvements .
Balance is one very important element to a healthy neuromusculoskeletal system .
If the proprioceptive system is able to adapt well to the forces placed upon it , half of the battle is won .
The other half includes muscular strength and endurance which go hand in hand with proprioception .
Without the former two , the latter can not optimally function .
One should address the health of the muscular tissues and aim to improve the motor firing patterns , strength and endurance of the muscles .
This will aid in the prevention of injury and contribute to peak performance : something which is desirable at every age .
I 'm Running For Mayor
I 've had it with Peter and Tim and and Nick and Richard pansy - assing around about running for mayor .
They announce they 're thinking about it , they think about it , and then they announce that running for mayor is just too scary or too expensive or that Greg is just too formidable an opponent .
Christ , do these guys have one lonely little nut between the four of 'em ?
Because you know what , you pansies ?
Greg Nickels is n't a popular guy .
The first time he ran for reelection , Greg 's opponent — Al Runte — got 35 % of the vote .
Runte was n't qualified to be mayor and he was a loon and everyone knew it and yet 35 % of the voters in this city picked the loon over Nickels .
If Nickels had faced a serious challenger in 2005 he would 've lost .
That no one has the balls to challenge Nickels this time out tells us nothing about Greg and everything about the contents of Peter , Tim , Nick , and Richard 's underpants .
No balls .
Now I do n't think I 'm qualified to be mayor either and I 'm a bit of a loon too .
But here 's the crucial difference between me and Al Runte : I know I 'm not qualified to be mayor .
Another difference : I do n't want to be mayor .
That 's why my entire platform is this :
If elected I pledge to resign the office of mayor 24 hours after I 'm sworn in .
During my short and glorious tenure I 'll issue a few harmless proclamations ( " Lap Dance Day " ) , challenge Portland 's gay mayor to a Big Gay Sex Scandal Contest ( I can put together a better sex scandal in 17 minutes than Sam Adams did in 17 days ) , and attempt to make good on my only other campaign promise .
( I promise to build the original X - shaped , voter - approved monorail plan in 24 hours or resign in disgrace . )
But after Lap Dance Day is over , and the monorail is n't completed in 24 hours , I will resign .
And that 's where this part of the city charter comes into play :
B. MAYOR AND OTHER ELECTIVE OFFICES :
If the office of Mayor shall become vacant , the President of the City Council shall become Mayor ; provided , that said President may within five days of such vacancy decline the office of Mayor , in which event the City Council shall select one of its members to be Mayor in the manner provided for filling vacancies in other elective offices .
So not to worry , Seattle :
If elected , I will not be your mayor long enough to do any real damage .
My plan is n't perfect , I realize .
Richard Conlin , who does n't have the balls to challenge Nickels himself , is the President of the City Council and my resignation would make Conlin mayor , something Conlin does n't have the balls to make himself .
But I think my plan for a passive - aggressive coup d’état just might appeal to the city council 's most passive - aggressive member , and people I like — hey , Dave Meinert ! — are always telling me that Conlin is n't that bad .
And after the last eight years I 'll take not that bad over Greg .
Of course Peter Steinbrueck has n't ruled out running for mayor .
He 's currently thinking about it and flouncing around like a douchebag .
( Yes , douchebags flounce if you toss 'em right . )
" Please send meeeeeeee three reasons why yoooooooooo think I should be mayor , Seattle ... "
Christ almighty , Peter , shit or get off our faces .
Run or do n't run .
Want it or do n't want it .
But enough with the reluctant savior routine .
We 're not drafting your ass — in or out , kraut .
But if Peter does n't announce — and announce soon — then I 'm in it to win it , Seattle .
For me , for you , for our children , for our children 's children , for our children 's children 's children 's pets , for growing our green economy , for Lap Dance Day , for a Big Gay Sex Scandal Contest , and for the la de da of it .
I 'm not qualified and I know it and I promise , if elected , to resign the day after I 'm sworn in and make that chickenshit Conlin mayor .
A post on how you can help get my name on the ballot later in the day .
Washington
IT is disheartening and disconcerting , at the very least , that here we are today — almost exactly eight years after Senator Jim Jeffords left the Republican Party — witnessing the departure of my good friend and fellow moderate Republican , Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , for the Democratic Party .
And the announcement of his switch was all the more painful because I believe it did n’t have to be this way .
When Senator Jeffords became an independent in 2001 , I said it was a sad day for the Republicans , but it would be even sadder if we failed to confront and learn from the devaluation of diversity within the party that contributed to his defection .
I also noted that we were far from the heady days of 1998 , when Republicans were envisioning the possibility of a filibuster - proof 60 - vote margin .
( Recall that in the 2000 election , most pundits were shocked when Republicans lost five seats , resulting in a 50 - 50 Senate . )
I could have hardly imagined then that , in 2009 , we would fondly reminisce about the time when we were disappointed to fall short of 60 votes in the Senate .
Regrettably , we failed to learn the lessons of Jim Jeffords ’s defection in 2001 .
To the contrary , we overreached in interpreting the results of the presidential election of 2004 as a mandate for the party .
This resulted in the disastrous elections of 2006 and 2008 , which combined for a total loss of 51 Republicans in the House and 13 in the Senate — with a corresponding shift of the Congressional majority and the White House to the Democrats .
It was as though beginning with Senator Jeffords ’s decision , Republicans turned a blind eye to the iceberg under the surface , failing to undertake the re-evaluation of our inclusiveness as a party that could have forestalled many of the losses we have suffered .

Park Ridge , Ill. ( February 17 , 2009 ) – A research review published recently in Nutrition Today ( 1 ) affirms that the high - quality protein in eggs makes a valuable contribution to muscle strength , provides a source of sustained energy and promotes satiety .
High - quality protein is an important nutrient for active individuals at all life stages , and while most Americans consume the recommended dietary allowance ( RDA ) for protein , additional research suggests that some Americans are not consuming enough high - quality protein to achieve and maintain optimal health .
( 2,3,4 )
Study Findings
The Nutrition Today review analyzes more than 25 protein studies and concludes that the all - natural , high - quality protein in eggs contributes to strength , power and energy in the following ways :
Sustained energy :
The protein in eggs provides steady and sustained energy because it does not cause a surge in blood sugar or insulin levels , which can lead to a rebound effect or energy " crash " as levels drop .
Eggs are a nutrient - rich source of high - quality protein and provide several B vitamins required for the production of energy in the body , such as thiamin , riboflavin , folate , B12 and B6 .
Muscle strength : Dietary protein intake directly influences muscle mass , strength and function in people of all ages .
One egg provides more than six grams of high - quality protein ( 13 percent of the Daily Value ) , which can help individuals build and preserve muscle mass , and help older adults prevent muscle loss .
Eggs are also rich in leucine , an essential amino acid that contributes to the muscle 's ability to use energy and aids in post - exercise muscle recovery .
Gold - standard protein :
The high - quality protein in eggs provides all of the essential amino acids our bodies need to build and maintain muscle mass .
In fact , the quality of egg protein is so high that scientists frequently use eggs as the standard for evaluating the protein quality of other foods .
( 5 )
" While many Americans may be getting enough protein , they need to focus on consuming sources of higher - quality protein .
Our review of the science suggests that eggs are an ideal protein choice , plus , they are very affordable , " says Donald K. Layman , Ph.D. , co-author of the research review and professor emeritus at the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at the University of Illinois .
" In addition , individuals should focus on when they consume high - quality protein .
Most protein consumption occurs in the evening , even though there are significant benefits to consuming more protein at breakfast , such as stimulation of muscle protein synthesis and long - lasting satiety . "
Additional Benefits of Eggs ' High - Quality Protein
The high - quality protein in eggs provides additional benefits , including :
Satiety & Weight Management : A 2008 study showed that eating two eggs for breakfast helped overweight dieters lose 65 percent more weight and feel more energetic than those who ate a bagel breakfast of equal calories and volume .
(6) Another recent study found that when individuals ate high - quality protein foods for breakfast , including eggs , they had a greater sense of fullness throughout the day compared to when they ate more protein at lunch or dinner .
( 7 )
Value & Versatility : In addition to providing high - quality protein , eggs are affordable and versatile .
Serving for serving , eggs cost less than other sources of high - quality protein .
For an average of just 15 cents per egg , Americans get a number of important nutrients in addition to high - quality protein , including choline , riboflavin and vitamin B12 , all for only 70 calories per egg .

Enlarge AP Mad Money host Jim Cramer , left , set himself up for a confrontation on Jon Stewart 's show after appearing on other shows , including Today and Martha Stewart .
WHAT'S ON TV THIS MONTH ?
WHAT'S ON TV THIS MONTH ?
You'd think people on TV would have a better idea of how it works .
Yet clearly they do n't , to judge from the insane TV parade staged by CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer .
In his search for justice , attention or both , Cramer inserted himself into a comedy battle between Jon Stewart and CNBC's Rick Santelli , turning what had been a one - day story into week - long , front - page news — and diminishing his reputation and that of his network in the process .
Let 's just say if Cramer were a stock , the best advice today would be " sell . "
For those few who may have missed it , the feud began when Stewart 's Comedy Central series , The Daily Show , answered Santelli 's rant against the bad judgment shown by homeowners with a video reel mocking CNBC 's own bad judgment in covering the economic meltdown .
Cramer complained that the reel took some of his comments out of context , which led Stewart to do an even funnier , nastier clip reel aimed solely at him .
At this point , a wise media investor would have simply walked with his losses .
As Stewart himself said Tuesday : " I said my piece , somehow he thought my piece was about him , he said his piece , and so then I made it about him .
And we move on . "
But no .
Instead Cramer went on a media tour , starting at the Today show , moving on to MSNBC's Morning Joe and then The Martha Stewart Show and ending , in flames , on The Daily Show itself on Thursday .
It 's hard to say which was the worst or oddest performance : trading bluster with Joe 's Joe Scarborough , seeking comfort from Martha , or the almost embarrassingly contrite groveling he did on The Daily Show by admitting he made mistakes and pledging to do better .
Well , despite what you may have heard from the lazily cynical , all publicity is not good publicity — particularly not when respect is your stock in trade .
No one expects Cramer to be an expert in media relations , but when you appear this publicly clueless in one area , it makes people wonder how far that cluelessness extends .
What should Cramer have done ?
Here are three rules to consider : 1 . Choose your friends wisely .
You can understand why Cramer would appear on a well - regarded corporate cousin like Today , but that should have been the start and end of the tour .
Scarborough merely added oil to the fire , using Cramer as an excuse to attack Stewart and cutting his guest off when he tried to cool the rhetoric .
As for cooking with Martha Stewart , not only did that make Cramer look desperate , it risked making him look guilty by association .
Fairly or not , Stewart 's conviction for obstruction of justice has left her as something less than a go - to role model for Wall Street redemption .
And now , Cramer is being defended by Tucker Carlson , who was badly burned in his own public battle with Stewart over CNN 's thankfully canceled Crossfire .
Really , with friends like that ...
2 . Know your enemy .
When Cramer dismissed Jon Stewart as a " comedian " running " a variety show " on Today , you could practically hear the death knell ringing .
Stewart may be a comic , but he's an incredibly smart and increasingly influential one — a media darling whose comments get amplified by print , TV and the Internet .
Stewart also can be unrelenting , something Cramer must have missed when he agreed go on his show .
The Daily Show is not Saturday Night Live , where merely showing up wins you a kid - glove - treatment pass , and Stewart is not the kind of host who strikes whatever pose the audience and guests prefer that night .
He has strongly held positions and a forum that allows him to express them with blistering precision — as he did Thursday , to the dismay of a seemingly shell - shocked Cramer .
To go into that forum unprepared , as Cramer appeared to do , is suicidal .
3 . Know when to shut up .
It 's hard enough to defend yourself against a comedy assault when you 're right .
When you 're wrong , it 's impossible .
Yes , Stewart " cherry - picked " quotes to make Cramer look as bad as possible — that 's what he does , as he readily admits .
And it 's almost certain that Stewart overstated the impact of Cramer 's mistakes and CNBC 's coverage on the stock market crash .
Yet in the end , as Cramer himself said , mistakes were made .
His main line of defense was that others made mistakes as well .
Though that 's no doubt true , it 's hardly a line you want to fight over , particularly when , considering the different audiences the networks serve , chances are most CNBC viewers would never have heard Stewart 's devastating take - down of the network had Cramer not kept the story growing and spreading .
By picking a fight he could not win , Cramer gave Stewart time and ammunition to launch a broader , more damaging attack on CNBC itself .
The thrust , as he laid it out Thursday , is that the network gave up its role as watchdog and began to treat the market as a game and CEOs as star quarterbacks , forgetting what was at stake should the market fail .
At a time when the market and the media are held in equally low regard , that 's an argument that can easily take hold .
And yet that could also be the one upside .
If this affair makes the media reconsider their coverage and the rest of us consider how easily distracted we are by , say , stories about feuds between TV personalities , Cramer may have unintentionally done us all a service .
Funny how that works .

Washington Report , March 2006 , pages 14 - 15 United Nations Report Real Scandal Not Oil - for - Food , But CPA - Administered Development Fund for Iraq By Ian Williams President George W. Bush bestows the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Ambassador Paul Bremer , former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq , at a Dec. 14 , 2004 White House ceremony ( AFP Photo / Luke Frazza ) .
IN THE dogwatch of the U.N. year , between Christmas and New Year , the International Accounting and Monitoring Board ( IAMB ) charged with overseeing the spending of the Development Fund for Iraq held a press conference at United Nations headquarters in New York .
It was hardly reported at all — calling to mind the Sherlock Holmes case of “ The Dog that Did Not Bark . ”
If ever there were watchdogs that should have been howling to the moon , however , it is these worthy auditors .
Instead they spent the best part of an hour acting as if the effective disappearance of billions of dollars was nothing terribly memorable .
The IAMB bared its gums and refused to bark at the clear evidence of gross waste , mismanagement and corruption by the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) .
The press was puzzled but , sticking to the usual norms of American news reporting , had nothing to report since the inspectors themselves said virtually nothing .
One can only speculate about the laid - back auditors , but the Briticism that came to my mind was they had been “ nobbled ” — that someone had made plain to them that barking was undesirable and would disturb the neighbors , especially those who live on Pennsylvania Avenue .
When this reporter raised the fate of these funds at Secretary - General Kofi Annan ’s press conference just before Christmas , I was promptly berated as an “ apologist for the U.N. ” by John Bolton ’s press officer , who questioned my journalistic integrity and accused me of “ blurring the line ” between the Oil - for - Food kickbacks and what he characterized as the CPA ’s accounting irregularities .
I informed him that , far from blurring the line , I was drawing a straight line between them .
Consider .
During its blessedly short lifespan , the American - dominated CPA under Paul Bremer spent nearly $ 20 billion of the $ 23.34 billion of Iraqi funds it had under its control in the so - called Development Fund for Iraq ( DFI ) .
In the same period , it spent just $ 300 million of the U.S. taxpayer - funded pledges of $ 18.4 billion for Iraq ’s reconstruction .
By the time it was handed over to the Iraqis the DFI — characterized by no-bid and non-fulfilled contracts , unqualified contractors , and the handing over of bundles of $ 100 bills as walking round money to occupation officers — was pretty much cleaned out .
Much of the money involved presumably came from the $ 10 billion surplus that the Security Council ordered the U.N. Oil - for - Food Fund to hand over to the CPA - controlled DFI .
The rest came from oil sales and from former Saddam - era funds that had been confiscated by various countries and released by order of the Security Council to the Development Fund for Iraq .
As Congressman Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) said back in June , “ There has been a stark and telling contrast between Congress ’ approach to the Oil - for - Food Program and the DFI .
Five separate congressional committees have been investigating U.N. mismanagement of the Oil - for - Food Program , and more than a dozen hearings have been held .
But before today there was not a single hearing in Congress on U.S. mismanagement of the Development Fund for Iraq ” — which , as he pointed out , is the successor to the Oil - for - Food program .
Waxman reported that the CPA withdrew no less than $ 12 billion in cash from the New York Federal Reserve Bank DFI account and flew it to Iraq .
In a final feeding frenzy , in its last month the CPA took out $ 4 billion from the mother of all ATMs in New York , including the largest cash withdrawal in history , $ 2.4 billion .
Who says the U.S. has no exports ?
No less than 363 tons of greenbacks were flown to Iraq — and seemingly blown to the winds .
In a partial audit of $ 120 million of the $ 600 million handed out to U.S. military officials for local reconstruction , more than 80 percent could not be accounted for , and $ 7 million was simply missing .
In December , the U.S. charged two colonels who had worked for the Coalition Provisional Authority with accepting bribes of $ 200,000 a month for steering contracts to companies that seemingly were just shells .
They worked with someone whom the CPA hired as comptroller with a budget of $ 82 million — despite his previous felony conviction for fraud .
During its press conference the IAMB did not refer to this case .
Indeed , there was a lot it chose not to refer to .
It emerged that the IAMB simply examined 24 sole - sourced contracts , worth more than $ 5 million dollars each , that the CPA had awarded .
In fact , we discovered during the press conference , the IAMB watchdogs had paid KPMG to “ audit ” 23 of them , representing some $ 600 million , which mostly involved examining American government audits .
The Pentagon had heavily censored what it originally — and reluctantly — provided to the IAMB until Congressman Waxman posted their devastating reports on his Web site .
Then the IAMB got them .
Nevertheless , one of its members now told the press conference , “ No one questions the will of the Iraqi or U.S. government to cooperate . ”
The biggest sole - sourced contract was with Kellogg Brown Root , the Halliburton subsidiary which walked off with $ 1.6 billion .
KPMG recused itself from this , so the IAMB relied on the work of the Special Inspector and the Pentagon auditors whose work the Pentagon was at such pains to hide .
Think about that .
The U.S. gave a sole - sourced contract , largely financed with Oil - for - Food money , to a subsidiary of the company that had had Vice President Dick Cheney as CEO and from which he is still rolling up deferred compensation .
The audit was carried out by Stuart Bowen , the special inspector general , appointed by President George W. Bush , whose lawyer he had been in various forms way back to his time as governor of Texas .
According to Bowen , a whopping $ 8.8 billion of DFI money could not be accounted for .
And the IAMB , charged with looking after the interests of the world community and the Iraqi people , lolled its tongue and wagged its tail .
Nor did it even attempt to examine the allegedly contested contracts , not even to check the openness and fairness of the bidding , let alone see if the money from the DFI was in fact spent on behalf of the Iraqi people as mandated .
Two years of high - decibel media outrage at the U.N. ’s handling of the Oil - for - Food funds resulted in one unproven allegation that the head of the program had reported $ 160,000 in income over four years , which the Volcker commission thought was fishy .
Contrast that with the sound of silence from the media and the IAMB over the fate of these billions .
If Kofi Annan had appointed his own lawyer to conduct the inquiry that Volcker actually headed , can you imagine the frothy indignation ?
It stinks to high heaven , and yet the media , most of the Congress and the IAMB itself seem to have clothespins on their noses and blinkers on their eyes .
The other news of the year that seems never to get mentioned is that while the taxpayers and governments of the world are asked to forgive Iraqi debts and to pay toward Iraqi reconstruction , 5 percent of all Iraqi revenues are still being sequestrated and handed over to the Iraq compensation fund , which then promptly hands most of it over to Kuwait .
There is no doubt that Saddam Hussain committed war crimes and an act of aggression against Kuwait .
It is also true that this was quite popular among Iraqis at the time , even if one suspects that , 15 years of misery later , they may now regret it .
But with the Iraqis , now that the Oil - for - Food program has gone , suffering worse conditions , and being shot at and bombed by both sides , it is hardly the thing for an Arab brother state like Kuwait to insist not only on the debts being repaid , but also on war reparations .
And it is rarely mentioned , although in the interests of combating the pernicious amnesia of our age , I often do .
More people should raise the issue , and see if somewhere between Capitol Hill and Kuwait City , not to mention the U.N. , there might not be a crisis of conscience .

More Than Vaguely Terrifying : The Peekaru
It ’s like a Snuggie and a chestburster from Alien all in one :
Gizmodo has all the disturbing details here .
Curses !
We 'll get you next time , super - jerks !
Oh , and enjoy this Cracked Classic .
- Cracked
Note :
When we ran this article ( and others like it ) five years ago , we had one goal : expose Batman , Superman , the X - Men and Green Lantern as the blatant rip - offs they are , and scuttle the popularity of superheroes once and for all .
We figured that if you knew that these characters were n't 100 % original , you 'd stop going to their movies , stop buying their merchandise , and move on to other stories -- but our plan failed !
All you did was laugh at the jokes and use the trivia to get laid , and both Batman and Superman have made a hundred bajillion dollars at the box office since .
But it 's hard not to feel betrayed when you find out that some of the stories around which your entire childhood revolved were , for the most part , copied and pasted in with a cavalier attitude of , " the little bastards will never know the difference ! "
They say there are no original ideas out there , and we can believe that .
Storytelling themes are universal and we understand when a character or scene gets " borrowed " here and there .
6 The X - Men
Mutated freaks gathered by their wheelchair bound mentor in order to protect a world that fears and hates them .
You think we are talking about the X - Men ?
No we are not .
Well , we will be in a second , and technically we are , but not in this paragraph , except for the parts where we do .

They are a Rip - Off of :
The Doom Patrol , which debuted in comics three months before everybody 's favorite , more marketable mutants .
Unlike the X - Men , the Doom Patrollers were once normal people who suffered an accident that disfigured them but also gave them superpowers .
Shunned by the world for just being plain ugly , the freaks were gathered by Doctor Caulder , a paraplegic , who thought that maybe the world would n't dislike them so much if they used their powers to save the normal people 's asses from giant robots once in a while .
If this sounds somewhat familiar to you , it 's because the same thing as X - Men with the only difference that the smart guy in the wheelchair was bald in one and X - Men uses mutants as an allegory for minorities instead of people with elephantiasis or whatever the heck Doom Patrol was going for .

Even the tag line is the same !
At least make an effort , guys !
Possibly , the most unnecessary thing borrowed by X - Men was the name of the Doom Patrol 's enemies : The Brotherhood of Evil .
In Doom Patrol the name made sense ; because they were a group of evil assholes , which got together to do asshole things .
There was never any confusion about what the group was about .
On the other hand Magneto stole the name , added the word mutant at the end of it and then whined endlessly about how humans persecuted and hated him .
Maybe people hated you , Magneto , because your group 's name was The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and you went around the world trying to wipe out humanity ?

How successful would the American Paraplegia Society be if they called themselves the Brotherhood of Child Molesting Guys on Wheelchairs ?
Magneto's weak PR skills are n't the only reason the original Brotherhood looks awesome by comparison ...

If you 're connecting to the Internet from China , you have n't been able to access YouTube since Monday .
Not only a particular part of the site , but all of it .
The reason is a video purportedly depicting Chinese security personnel beating Tibetans ; the Chinese government now claims the video is fake .
Fake or not , now that one of the biggest sites on the Internet is unaccessible to a huge number of people , it has everyone 's attention .
Normally , the video would probably be noticed by a handful of people interested in the matter ; this way , everyone has seen it ( or heard of it ) .
This is not the first time that China has blocked YouTube ( the ban usually gets lifted within a couple of days ) , and it 's probably not the last .
But one has to wonder how effective these bans are , since tools like Twitter make it incredibly easy for people to spread the news about incidents like this one .
Proving that a video is fake would probably be a much better tactic than banning a site viewed by millions of people every day , and then claiming you 're not afraid of the Internet ; it just does n't hold water .
CNBC ’s Jim Cramer has positioned himself as yet another champion of the people against the evil government .
A couple of days ago , the method - actor / CNBC host of “ Mad Money ” stirred up a hullabaloo when he pretended to be angry and attacked the Obama government ’s economic program as “ the greatest wealth destruction I ’ve seen by a president . ”
Right .
Let ’s leave aside for a moment the fact that Cramer is a giant welfare queen whose salary is subsidized by the $ 139 billion taxpayer dollars to his parent company , General Electric .
For now , let ’s just try and answer this simple question : “ Who destroys your wealth more : Obama or Jim Cramer ? ”
Last Friday , when his company GE announced a massive dividend cut , Cramer told his viewers to buy .
His counter - intuitive reason was that even though under normal circumstances a dividend cut means that the company is going broke and can’t pay dividends , in this case , oddly enough , “ it was positive . ”
“ I applaud management for doing it , ” he said , deep - throating his bosses for cutting investors ’ returns so that there ’s more money in the bank to pay Jim ’s salary .
GE ’s stock subsequently plummeted for four straight days after his recommendation .
One of the biggest problems , according to a Bloomberg article , is that GE is trying to sugarcoat a dire situation , and sophisticated investors ( i.e. the types who do n’t listen to Cramer ) are n’t buying it :
“ The rub against GE at this point is they have been pretty slow to admit some problem assets ” in the finance unit , said Peter Klein , senior portfolio manager at Cleveland - based Fifth Third Asset Management , which holds the shares among $ 18 billion under management .
“ If assets are impaired in some way you would like to know to that . ”
So while your taxpayer subsidies to GE and their dividend cuts to shareholders be bery bery good to Jim , any poor sucker who believed his recommendation for GE stock on Friday be bery bery fucked .
The day of Cramer ’s recommendation on February 27 , GE ’s stock rose to over 9 dollars per share in intraday trading ; yesterday , the stock fell to as low as $ 5.72 per share , its lowest price in 17 years .
In just 4 days , Jim Cramer lost you , the gullible viewer , 1/3 of your investment .
And at the same time picked your pocket for your tax dollars .
Folks , that ’s what we call “ wealth destruction you can believe in ! ”
[ Update : Click here for a graph showing all the stocks Cramer has pimped to his viewers in 2009 , and how they actually performed . ]
What this shows is that Cramer is perfectly willing to scam John Q Public and pimp his boss ’s snake oil .
It ’s just that Cramer does n’t know which boss he really should serve : it ’s not GE , but the Obama government , and whatever government agency that writes out Jim ’s welfare checks .
We ’re pretty sure that as soon as Cramer is told who his real boss is , a whore like him will quickly get on his knees and start pushing viewers to buy U.S. Treasuries along with “ green ” windmill - operated energy plants .
Cuz that ’s the kinda principled guy Cramer is .
In the meantime , can someone answer this question : why the fuck are we taxpayers subsidizing the pay of a lying sack of shit snakeoil salesman like Jim Cramer , who turns around bashes the government for paying his salary , while trying pawn off worthless GE shares to the rest of us ?
Are these assholes tenured - for - life ?
Bad Times for Blackwater , ahem , Xe .
This morning , Erik Prince , the co-founder and chief executive officer of Blackwater stepped down .
A former Navy SEAL and heir to a multi-million dollar auto - parts fortune , Prince was the brains behind and public face of the company , which garnered a billion dollars ’ worth of government contracts between 2001 and 2008 .
But , the company ’s fortunes have changed with the administration .
Five of its former employees are currently on trial for manslaughter , for killing unarmed civilians .
This year , Iraq ousted Blackwater and it lost a State Department contract worth a third of its revenue .
Prince ’s resignation comes as part of a “ comprehensive restructuring , ” initiated last month .
Blackwater fired a number of employees , and announced it would no longer seek U.S. security contracts , instead focusing on training law enforcement officials and security guards in its facilities across the world .
It also rebranded itself “ Xe , ” pronounced “ zee . ”
( The firm provided no explanation for the name , the symbol for the noble gas Xenon . )
Rep. Jan Schakowsky , chair of the Intelligence Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations , responded :
“ This is the second time Blackwater has tried to change its image by rebranding itself .
No matter what it calls itself , Blackwater ca n’t change the fact that its lethal actions have resulted in the deaths of innocent Iraqi civilians .
The company ’s reckless actions have also put our troops in harm ’s way and jeopardized our mission in Iraq .
I ’m glad that the State Department under Secretary of State Clinton has decided not to renew Blackwater ’s contract in Iraq .
Blackwater ’s notorious reputation will outlast its name . ”
Maybe a new jingle ?

DIY : How To Grow Your Own Fresh Air
March 26th , 2009 by Jerry James Stone
According to GreenSpaces , these three plants not only lead to fresher indoor air … but also an increase in productivity !
GreenSpaces has tested these plants for the past 15 years in a 20 year old , 50,000 ft2 building with over 300 occupants , and 1,200 plants !
A study published on September 8 , 2008 found that there is a 42 % probability of increasing blood oxygen by 1 % if one is inside the building for 10 hours .
In fact , the building is rated the healthiest building in Delhi by the Government of India .
So how does this increase productivity ?
Compared to other buildings in Delhi , the incidence of eye irritation reduced by 52 % , lower respiratory symptoms by 34 % , headaches by 24 % , upper respiratory symptoms by 20 % , lung impairment by 10 - 12 % and Asthma by 9 % .
Some info on the plants :
Areca Palm ( Chrysalidocarpus lutescens )
Works well in the day time
Great for living areas
One needs about 4 shoulder high plants / person
Needs to be put outdoors once every 3 - 4 months
The leaves of the plant need to be wiped everyday in Delhi and perhaps once a month in a cleaner city
The soil used should be of vermi manure or use hydroponics
Mother - in - law ’s Tongue ( Sansevieria trifasciata )
Converts CO2 into O2 at night
One requires about 6 - 8 such waist high plants per person in the bedroom
Leaves need to be wiped in the same way as the Areca Palm
The soil used should be of vermi manure or use hydroponics
Money Plant ( Epipremnum aureum )
Excellent for removing Formaldehyde and other VOC’s
Best grown using hydroponics

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
CHICAGO / SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Some U.S. public school districts are turning to mass layoffs of teachers and support staff to ease ballooning deficits in the latest sign of how the recession is hurting ordinary Americans .
The looming layoffs contrast with President Barack Obama ’s pledge to improve education in the United States .
On Tuesday , Obama proposed lengthening the school year and paying top teachers more .
And the $ 787 billion federal stimulus package includes billions of dollars for schools .
On Friday , the Los Angeles Unified School District -- the nation ’s second largest -- will issue preliminary layoff notices to nearly 9,000 staff members , including teachers .
“ The deficit we ’re looking at over the next 17 months is just over $ 700 million , so it ’s a significant , devastating cut we need to prepare to balance out this budget , ” Megan Reilly , the district ’s chief financial officer , said in a telephone interview .
The district ’s money woes arise from reduced state funding for local school districts , which rely heavily on California ’s general fund for their budgets , she said .
State officials recently closed a $ 42 billion state budget gap through July 2010 with the help of cuts to education spending from the general fund .
California ’s revenues have tumbled as the recession and financial crisis worsened .
“ We are waiting hopefully and anxiously on federal stimulus dollars , ” Reilly said .
An initial $ 44 billion in federal stimulus money will start flowing to states in 30 to 45 days , U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said on Saturday .
MICHIGAN’S WOES
In Michigan , the Pontiac School District put all 774 of its employees , including about 560 teachers , on notice that they may be laid off at the end of the school year , according to school spokeswoman Georgette Johnson .
The move was part of a plan to address declining enrollment , a big contributor to an $ 11.6 million deficit in the district ’s $ 92 million budget .
Pontiac -- about 30 miles northwest of Detroit and the birthplace of General Motors ’ Pontiac motor division -- also plans to shutter about half of its 18 buildings and restructure the curriculum , Johnson said .
“ We have 20,000 seats and only 7,200 kids , and projections are that ’s going to decline next year , ” she said .
The $ 27 million the district expects to receive in federal stimulus funds wo n’t help because much of that money is tied to programs for poor students , Johnson said .
Even the Chicago Public Schools , the third - largest school district in the United States and Obama ’s home base , is not pinning its hopes on the stimulus program .
The district faces a record $ 475 million projected fiscal 2010 deficit .
The school system ’s chief executive officer , Ron Huberman , said on Wednesday that the lion ’s share of the federal money will be used to fund state - mandated set - asides such as tutoring and after - school and summer school programs .
Federal stimulus dollars can’t arrive soon enough for California school districts , said Rick Pratt of the California School Boards Association .
Pratt said , “ I ca n’t think of a school district right now that is n’t thinking about how much it has to cut . ”
Huge surge of lobbyists for climate change WASHINGTON
House Democrats opened the congressional debate on climate change Tuesday by unveiling an ambitious plan to boost renewable energy and simultaneously slash domestic greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent over the next decade .
And California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer is poised to lead the fight in the Senate .
But the new focus on climate change in the nation 's capital has been accompanied by another kind of change : an explosion of lobbyists trying to influence the final shape of proposals by Boxer and Reps .
Henry Waxman , D - Los Angeles , and Ed Markey , D - Mass .
The number of climate change lobbyists has more than tripled in the past five years to roughly 2,340 in 2008 , according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of Senate lobbying disclosure forms .
Climate change lobbyists now outnumber members of Congress by more than a 4 to 1 margin .
The explosion comes at a time when the overall number of Washington lobbyists has declined from 15,397 to 15,139 over the past year , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
' Huge , huge deal '
" The bottom line is , this is a huge , huge deal , " said Jeffrey Holmstead a lobbyist with Bracewell & Giuliani , a top climate lobbying firm .
" In terms of its importance to the U.S. economy and the energy sector , ( climate change ) is really a much bigger deal than anything that has come before Congress .
The stakes are very , very high . "
The climate change cadre spans the political spectrum , from environmental activists and Hollywood stars on the left to conservatives who argue global warming is a hoax .
But at the center of the debate are California environmentalists .
Environmental groups have stepped up their lobbying efforts and have about 180 lobbyists on Capitol Hill , as opposed to less than 50 five years ago .
San Francisco 's green giant , the Sierra Club , spent more than seven times as much money on environmental lobbying in last year than it did five years ago , up from $ 100,000 in 2003 to $ 730,000 in 2008 .
The Environmental Defense Fund , which has regional offices in San Francisco , Los Angeles and Sacramento , filed 21 lobbying reports under the issue " environment and superfund . "
It filed only four in 2007 .
Even so , business and energy lobbyists outnumber environmental lobbyists and alternative energy lobbyists by a margin of 8 to 1 , says Marianne Lavelle , a staff writer for the Center for Public Integrity .
The increase in corporate lobbying is " alarming , " says Frank O'Donnell , president of the environmental watchdog group Clean Air Watch .
Because it will be too difficult to satisfy the demands of large numbers of lobbyists and their clients , it will be more difficult for Congress to pass legislation , he said .
" Blocking controversial legislation is always easier than passing it , " he said .
Tony Kreindler , an Environmental Defense Fund spokesman , says his organization is well aware of the challenge .
A bit of David and Goliath
" It is a bit of a David and Goliath situation , " he said .
" We may be outnumbered compared to industry muscle , however we do have quite a bit of forward - looking companies who are pushing for action . "
The bill introduced Tuesday by Waxman and Markey would tie the reductions to a mandatory cap - and - trade system , under which oil refineries , manufacturers and other industrial operations could comply with escalating new nationwide limits on carbon dioxide by buying and selling allowances to release the heat - trapping pollutant
Boxer , chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , says she 'll do her best to work with anyone who seeks to move legislation quickly .
" The lobbying activity is divided into two : those who understand the need to act to avert catastrophe , and those who are pushing for no action , " she said .
" What guides me is the science , and therefore I am doing everything I can to move forward on an action plan . "
The boom in climate change lobbying , some experts say , can be traced to the passage of an energy bill in late 2007 when members of Congress wrangled over whether to require utilities to use renewable energy sources .
The provision was eventually dropped from the bill , but it pointed the way the green debate was going .
During the presidential campaign , both candidates Barack Obama and John McCain endorsed a significant shift in Bush - era climate policies , forcing companies to face a new political reality no matter which candidate prevailed .
Waxman and three other Democratic House leaders sent an open letter to President Obama Friday declaring " now is the time for Congress to pass comprehensive energy and climate legislation , " calling it " both economically and politically achievable . "
The House bill introduced Tuesday could be the best shot at getting climate legislation passed , O'Donnell said .
The Senate , including the Boxer 's committee , " is lying low for now " and letting the House move first , he added .
Cap - and - trade is costly
The approach to climate change favored by the Obama administration and top congressional Democrats , called cap - and - trade , would significantly increase the costs of doing business for energy companies .
Businesses that are heavy energy consumers also would be forced to pay higher taxes .
With so much at stake , energy companies are bulking up by hiring the top lobbying talent available .
Chevron , for example , hired Drew Maloney , who served as legislative director for former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay , R - Texas .
Dynegy Inc. , a Houston - based natural gas and coal giant , paid Bracewell & Giuliani $ 200,000 for " strategic advice on energy and environmental issues " and other lobbying , according to reports from the Senate Office of Public Records .
But while just about every energy company has a stake in the game , they 're not all on the same side .
ConocoPhillips and Shell Oil , for instance , are working with the Environmental Defense Fund in a coalition called the U.S. Climate Action Partnership .
It is pushing for Congress on greenhouse gas reduction .
" There are more people saying ' Yes , we 've got to do something ' than there are saying ' no , ' " EDF 's Kreindler said .
With the battle about to begin , Boxer also is optimistic .
" At the end of the day , when we act , we will not only avert the catastrophe of global warming , we will also create millions of green jobs , " she said , " and so we are pushing harder than ever to address this issue . "
Canadians strongly support tougher sentencing to deal with an apparent surge in gangs , a new Angus Reid Strategies poll says .
But half of Canadians also back the legalization of marijuana , the drug which fuels most organized crime activity , especially in B.C .
A huge majority of those polled ( at least 93 per cent ) support two measures recently proposed by the Conservative government : treating any gang - related homicide as a first - degree murder and ensuring mandatory minimum prison sentences for drive - by - shootings and other serious drug - crimes .
The Angus Reid Strategies online poll surveyed 1,007 randomly selected Canadian adults from Feb. 26 to Feb. 27 .
The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 per cent , 19 times out of 20 .
There is also strong support for three measures recently suggested by B.C. Attorney - General Wally Oppal : relaxing the evidence disclosure law to allow for a quick prosecution of gang members ( 81 per cent ) , eliminated the sentencing provision that gives offenders two days credit for every day spent in custody awaiting trial ( 76 per cent ) and allowing police to wiretap access to intercept cell phone conversations ( 68 per cent ) .
While Canadians want tougher laws against gangsters , they are less enamoured with the Harper government ’s moves to curb illegal drug consumption .
Almost half of Canadians reject Ottawa ’s move to scrap the previous Liberal government ’s marijuana decriminalization legislation .
A slight majority ( 51 per cent ) opposes the termination of the “ harm - reduction ” programs , including the supervised injection sites and needle - exchange programs .

The Terms , And What Each Means For Readability
There are many factors that play into the readability of text .
There are also a number of terms , all very important .
Here are a few of the more common Web typography terms and an explanation of how each term affects readability .
Hierarchy Every typographic layout needs the essential element of hierarchy .
Hierarchy defines how to read through content .
It shows the user were to start reading and where to read through .
It differentiates headers from body text .
Although colors of text boxes can be used to contrast headers and body text , hierarchy refers to the difference in size between these elements .
Hierarchy plays a huge part in how scannable a layout is .
It is an important technique that needs to be mastered to achieve readable Web typography .
UXBooth uses a very clean hierarchy to achieve readable Web typography .
Contrast Contrast is the core factor in whether or not text is easy to read .
Good contrasts will make text easy on the eyes , easy to scan quickly , and overall more readable .
On the other hand , poor contrast will force the user to squint and make reading the body text almost painful , not to mention a lot slower .
As shown in the following illustration , black on white is very readable .
Black on white is obviously the standard contrast colors , and to achieve readable content it is good to stay in the range of black - on - white contrast .
This one , however , pink on blue , is nearly impossible to read .
This example my be a little extreme , but it shows how such an awful contrast can have a major impact on the text .
You probably wo n’t see websites using such poor contrast , but it still shows why you need to be very smart about it .
Line Height
Line height is a very common term meaning the space between individual lines of text .
Line height is another factor in the readability of body text and even headers .
Sufficient line height is especially important in Web design because it makes the text ultimately more scannable .
Line height that is too short will cause users to squint while reading .
If it is too large , the text will seem like separate bodies instead of grouped together as one .
Letter Spacing
Like line height , letter spacing affects readability in Web typography .
Letter spacing is , as the name suggests , the space between each letter in words .
In print layout , negative letter spacing is a common technique to add a more fun feel to the layout , but it should never be used in body text .
In any text , letter spacing is an obvious factor in legibility .
Line Length
Line length is often overlooked in Web typography but should not be .
Line length is , of course , the number of words per line .
A good line length is one that allows the reader ’s eyes to flow from the end of one line to the beginning of the next very easily and naturally .
The Keys to Readable Typography
Achieving readability is relatively easy ; all it takes is to follow a few key practices .
A readable Web page can go a long way with your users , and readability has a huge impact on their experience .
Designing for the Web is all about making the user ’s experience as pleasant as possible .
Here are 9 tips that will help you work towards readability .
1. User -Friendly Headers
Headers are a key element in typography , Web and print alike .
As mentioned , they are part of the text hierarchy and a major factor in scannable content .
First off , header size is just as important as the size of the body text .
Going too big with the header with a large amount of content can throw the user off balance when reading and cause them to lose their spot .
It will ultimately ruin the flow of the content and be a distraction .
Headers that are too small will ruin the hierarchy of the article , too .
If the header is too small , it will not draw the user ’s attention as it should .
Next , it is important to provide ample space between the header and body text .
2. Scannable Text I have already mentioned “ scannable ” text many times , and you have surely heard it elsewhere .
Scannable text goes hand in hand with readable text .
Making copy scannable consists of good use of headers , hierarchy and focus points to guide the user through the content .
So , what makes copy scannable ?
Well , there are many factors , most of which have already been mentioned .
Header size and position , body text size , text line height , text contrast and the way focus points are differentiated all impact how scannable copy is .
Focus points are certain elements or objects within the layout that attract , or are supposed to attract , the user ’s attention .
This could be a header , a graphical element , a button , etc .
3. White Space
In content - heavy layouts , spacing contributes to the readability of content .
White space helps to offset large amounts of text and helps the user ’s eyes flow through the text .
It also provides separation between elements in the layout , including graphics and text .
In the example below , white space and only white space is used to separate text elements .
The layout is very clean and efficient .
The user ’s eyes flow from text element to text element with ease , because of the large amounts of white space .
4. Consistency Consistency is often regarded as an important technique for usability , but it also applies to readability .
Consistency in the hierarchy is important to a user - friendly layout .
This means that all headers of the same importance in the hierarchy should be the same size , color and font .
For example , all < h1 > headers in an article should look identical .
Why ?
This consistency provides users with a familiar focus point when they are scanning , and it helps to organize the content .
5. Density of Text Density of text refers to the amount of words you place in one area .
Density of content has a major impact on your content ’s readability .
Density is affected by spacing options such as line height , letter spacing and text size .
If you find a balance between all of these so that the content is neither too compact nor too widely spaced , you will have perfect density that is both readable and scannable .
6. Emphasis of Important Elements
Another key factor is emphasis of certain elements within the body content .
This includes highlighting links , bolding important text and showing quotes .
As mentioned , focus points are essential in Web typography .
By emphasizing these objects , you provide focus points for the user .
These points and objects help break up monotonous text .
Scannable text is extremely important .
By providing these focus points , , you make the body text extremely scannable .
Bolding key lines of text immediately attracts the user ’s eye and is therefore a very important element in presenting important information .
Pictured below is an article from UXBooth .
This article uses bolding and italics to point out important information in the article .
This is a very readable article and very easy article to scan for information .
7. Organization of Information Believe it or not , the way you organize information in an article can strengthen readability .
Users are guided with ease through content that is properly organized because information is easier to find .
This veers into issues beyond the scope of this article but is still very important .
8. Clean Graphical Implementation
Every text body needs some sort of visual support , be it an image , icon , graph or illustration .
Placing the graphic in the article can be challenging .
Sufficient space is needed between the graphic and text .
If the graphical element is an image , then a clean border is a good idea for providing a clean separation from the text .
Borders can help guide the user ’s eyes and are good for adding style to content .
It is important , however , to keep borders in content simple .
They should have a subtle color palette and should n’t be too large .
In the case of graphical elements such as icons and illustrations , space is the only separator that should be used .
The content should move cleanly around the graphic without disrupting the text .
9 . Use of Separators Separators are a simple and easy way to divide text into sections in a clean and organized manner .
They can be used to divide hierarchy elements , such as headers and body text .
They can also be used to divide content into sections .
The simplest form of divider is a single line .
These are most often used to divide hierarchy elements and are very useful for making subtle divisions that still play a big role in readability .
Another common way to divide content is to use boxes .
Text boxes are excellent for separating unrelated content on a single page .
They help move the user ’s eyes through a complex layout .
Below is an example of this on Pixelmator ’s website .
It uses boxes to separate content in a clean way .
Notice how the boxes are defined by their background instead of a border .
10 . Good Margins
You hear people say that you should use white space , but why ?
White space actually helps draw the user ’s eye to the text .
The blank area ( white space ) forces the eye to focus on the text .
So white space will influence the flow and readability of content .
Margins are one of the best white space elements and support text elements well .
Margins on either side will force the user ’s eye to focus inward on the core content of the article .
Margins also support the article in another way .
They help separate content from the rest of the design and layout .
Text should n’t bleed into other layout elements , especially if it is a long article .
Margins help define the article and its separation .
In the grid - based layout below , margins and only margins are used to set apart bodies of text .
The result is a clean , clear and concise page .
Effects To Give Typography Some Flair
For the most part , text is text , simply words on a plain single - colored background .
Not too complex , but it works .
Occasionally , though , the text layout will need some styling and decoration .
This may be a header or typography used in the overall design of the website ( as opposed to the article content ) .
No matter what the form , it is important to always stay within the limits of readability .
Yes , it is essential to be creative and use decorative styling , but the typography must be legible or else it becomes almost useless .
Fancy Text
One good way to style typography is to use a fancy or unique font within the layout along with standard fonts .
It is important to use simple and standard fonts for body text , but using fancy fonts elsewhere is an easy way to mix it up and add a little more to the theme .
Using a single font throughout the entire website gets boring and , although readable , should n’t be done .
Letterpress
Another very common form of Web typography styling is letterpress .
The example below uses a letterpress technique to add depth and embellish the layout .
It looks very nice and flows cleanly , and the text is still completely readable .
Style the Background Adding a nice background can be just as effective as styling text .
By decorating the text body background , you are styling the text .
Styling the background can be visually beautiful but can also reduce legibility .
This is potentially a big problem but easily avoidable .
Keep the Contrast First and foremost , it important to keep contrast within a readable range .
For the background , use colors that are much subtler and duller than those of the text .
This will allow the user ’s eye to focus on the text and not be distracted by the background .
Textures Work Nicely
The best road to take with the background is to use a nice texture , which wo n’t detract from the typography .
Here is a dark website with a good typographic style .
The typography has a decorative background , but the contrast still works nicely .
The text itself has no styling , but the background makes up for it .
This is another great texture that supports the typography .
The background texture resembles a canvas , and the typography takes on the form of a watercolor .
Link Styling
Within long text , links are one more type of focus point , and you should find a way to make them pop .
In sum , the best way to do this is to use underlining , a different color than the body text , italics and a different font .
You can combine these to great effect or just use one .
The example below underlines and uses a different color for links .
Showcase of Help Elements
Help elements are integrated in many websites , and you often do n’t notice them .
Here are a few examples of usable help elements .
Blog Articles Readability is important in blog articles especially .

In his whirlwind debut European tour of summits in Britain , France , Germany and the Czech Republic , Barack Obama has delivered two speeches , both exactly 26 minutes long .
On Friday , in Strasbourg , he was rapturously applauded by French and German students when he said he wanted to rid the world of nuclear weapons .
In Prague yesterday , he spelled out his hopes , outlining a host of means to that end and denouncing fatalism in the face of the nuclear threat as a " deadly adversary " .
The world 's estimated arsenal of 24,000 nuclear warheads - all but 1,000 in the US and Russian armouries - was the worst legacy of the cold war , Obama said .
If the risk of all - out nuclear war had faded , the danger of nuclear attack had increased , he added .
Disarmament
The president pledged a drive on nuclear disarmament , possibly bigger than any ever attempted .
He spelled out how he would accelerate arms control agreements with Russia , following his first summit meeting with President Dmitry Medvedev last week .
The deal to conclude a new arms reduction treaty with Moscow , which would slash stockpiles by about a third was a beginning , setting the stage for further cuts .
Building on the momentum of a new agreement with the Russians , Obama said he wanted to cajole the other nuclear powers into agreeing international arms cuts .
This would include Britain 's independent nuclear deterrent as well as France 's force de frappe and could run into resistance .
John Hutton , the defence secretary , said at the weekend " there would have to be a very significant breakthrough in international nuclear weapons negotiations " before Britain 's arsenal could be put on the table .
Nuclear testing
" It is time for testing of nuclear weapons to be banned , " Obama said .
He called for a resuscitation of the 1996 comprehensive test ban treaty outlawing all nuclear tests .
Obama 's Democrat predecessor , Bill Clinton , signed the treaty , but then gave up on it after running into resistance from the Republican - controlled Senate which refused to ratify it a decade ago .
George Bush did not pursue the issue .
America is the most important country that has not ratified the treaty , although other nuclear countries such as China , Israel and Pakistan , as well as Iran have also declined to ratify .
Obama said he would pursue US ratification " immediately and aggressively " .
Proliferation
As well as supporting the test ban treaty , Obama pledged to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which dates from 1968 and is the cornerstone of the effort to try to curb the spread of nuclear weapons .
He specified two ways of reinforcing the NPT regime - banning the production of fissile material used for nuclear warheads and establishing an " international fuel bank " which would supply and keep tabs on low - enriched uranium for peaceful nuclear purposes in electricity generation for countries that need it .
This is aimed at keeping countries , such as Iran , from developing their own fuel enrichment programmes and at restricting the growth of nuclear knowhow .
Low - enriched uranium is used in power plants .
High - enriched uranium is used for warheads .
The material can be diverted for weapons use and once you have mastered the fuel cycle for power generation , it is relatively easy to produce bomb - grade material .
Obama also insisted on greater resources and authority for international inspections - and " real and immediate consequences " for countries that violate the treaty .
Loose nukes
Over the past 15 years there have been various efforts , mainly by the US , to secure and store nuclear materials stemming from the collapse of the Soviet Union to offset the dangers of " loose nukes " , nuclear contraband , and black market trading in radioactive materials .
Obama said he wanted to re-energise this campaign to get all " vulnerable " nuclear materials in secure storage within four years .
He also said he would convene a world summit on nuclear security in the US within a year .
The agenda and participants for such a conference remain unclear .
But the spread of nuclear knowhow and technology had to be stopped , he said , since it would become increasingly easy to " buy , build or steal " a nuclear bomb .
The risk of terrorists being able to obtain a nuclear device was " the most immediate and extreme threat to global security . "
National security
Obama also promised to rewrite American military and national security strategy to downgrade the centrality of nuclear weapons , reversing a tendency among some senior former military officials to argue in favour of an increased reliance on nuclear weapons and a commitment to embrace preemptive nuclear strikes as an option .
The timetable
The president conceded the nuclear challenge was daunting , would be a long haul , and could fail .
" This goal will not be reached quickly - perhaps not in my lifetime .
It would take patience and persistence .
But now we , too , must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change . "
But he said it was time for a new , more robust international regime .
" Rules must be binding , violations must be punished , words must mean something . "
The double assassination could have come straight from a Forsyth thriller Author Frederick Forsyth has told the BBC of his surprise to find himself in Guinea - Bissau on the day the president and army chief were assassinated .
The British writer flew in to research a new book as the country was plunged into a drama that could have leapt from the pages of one of his thrillers .
The Day of the Jackal author told of the " bizarre " events as renegade troops " rather slowly " killed the president .
He said the drama was " garnish on the cake " that might be in his new novel .
The writer was at pains to point out : " I can assure you I had nothing to do with the coup d'etat . "
FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .

More from BBC World Service Forsyth has previously admitted helping to finance a 1973 coup attempt in another West African state , Equatorial Guinea .
Those events were the inspiration for his 1974 book The Dogs of War , which chronicles a failed plan by a group of European mercenaries to topple the government of a fictional African country .
Forsyth added that this week 's turmoil in Guinea - Bissau was more a battle between two bitter political enemies than a coup .
The best - selling author arrived in Guinea - Bissau from the Portuguese capital Lisbon just after the army chief - of - staff , General Tagme Na Waie , was assassinated on Sunday .
He was trying to sleep in his hotel room in the early hours of Monday morning when he heard an explosion .
President Vieira had a long and bloody death , according to Forsyth
It was the roof of the presidential villa collapsing as soldiers launched an apparent tit - for - tat attack on veteran ruler Joao Bernardo Vieira .
" They went to his villa , threw a bomb through the window which hurt him , but did n't kill him , " Forsyth told the BBC's World Today programme .
" The roof came down , that hurt him but did n't kill him either .
He struggled out of the rubble and was promptly shot .
This , however , still did n't kill him .
" They then took him to his mother - in - law 's house and chopped him to bits with machetes . "
Mr Forsyth , who had dinner with the forensic pathologist investigating the assassination on Monday evening , has a theory why this happened .
We are not talking about two Mother Theresas here
Frederick Forsyth
History of crisis haunts G - Bissau " Basically these two men absolutely loathed each other , " he said .
" The president was a very violent man and the chief - of - staff was a pretty violent man too .
We are not talking about two Mother Theresas here " .
His pointed out the army chief - of - staff was a member of the old military junta which governed the country before President Vieira was returned to power in 2005 .
" There was no love lost between them because the old general did n't like the newly arrived populist president , " said Forsyth .
He added : " It looks like one tried to get rid of the threat the other posed . "
The writer said he was " rather upset " because the double assassination had disrupted his travel plans .
" I ca n't get out now , " he said .
" I was due to fly out tomorrow afternoon , and I rather think that they 're going to keep the airport closed , which is very inconvenient . "
But all is not lost .
Mr Forsyth said he will probably use some of the real - life drama for his new novel .
" What I was researching had nothing to do with bumping off generals or bumping off presidents , " he said .
" But it 's a little extra garnish on the cake , so I 'll probably use it eventually in the book . "
Forsyth appears to attract trouble whenever he visits this part of the world .
The former BBC foreign correspondent recalled that while flying into the region decades ago to cover the Biafra War , a bullet passed between his legs as he sat in the back of an ammunition plane .
" I 'm not vastly enamoured of the place , but there we are , " he said .

Want to know more than you can fit in your head ?
Well , you 're living in the right age .
The precise dimensions of a suspension bridge , the complete literature of Russia and the DNA records of a thousand serial killers can now be slung at your brain from a planet - wide selection of computers in a millisecond - long fibre - optic screech .
Never have we been more effective in our delivery of fact .
Except when it comes to the Oscars .
The whole Academy Awards palaver must be the most long - winded method of disseminating a tiny amount of information that has ever been devised .
Staying up to watch them is about as efficient a way of finding out the results as building a time machine , travelling back to 1939 , and then living there for six years , would be of discovering the outcome of the Second World War .
It 's all very well if you want to soak up the atmosphere , but the rate of delivery of pertinent facts could be matched by two Sinclair ZX81s sending each other smoke signals .
I 'm missing the point though .
Like all award ceremonies , the Oscars are an exercise in garnering publicity and prestige , in making people care about something that does n't really affect their lives .
The razzmatazz creates artificial jeopardy .
When someone gets the results of a cancer test , they do n't need a red carpet , a big ceremony and a thousand designer dresses to make them give a shit .
I 'm not saying " film stars need to get a sense of perspective and be grateful they 're not dead " , particularly as one of the winners is ( now that 's what I call triumphing over adversity ! ) .
But I get annoyed by the amount of empty Oscar hype , largely because of all the glamour .
I hate glamour .
Glamour is boring .
Show me someone who 's genuinely interested in glamour and I 'll ask you why you 've introduced me to your twat of a friend .
For half the week , the papers have been full of dressed - up film stars smiling , accompanied by horrible articles about whether their outfits are deemed " hits " or " misses " - hundreds of presumptuous remarks by fashion journalists who think both that they know how to dress better than film stars do and , most infuriatingly , that that 's a skill that matters .
It 's ridiculous enough that this is attractiveness advice being dispensed to women who have shagged Brad Pitt by women who , I 'm guessing , have n't - but it 's also really rude .
Everyone going to the Oscars has made an enormous effort to look nice .
The polite response to that , in public at least , is : " You look nice . "
It 's the thought and effort that counts - by all means have a pop at anyone who turns up in jeans and a T - shirt with gravy down it - but while they 're all trying their best , we should say nice things or nothing at all .
And if that means that fashion journalism as a profession becomes unsustainable then good .
Obviously people are always going to have a laugh when a film star on the red carpet looks daft ; thinking about their lengthy deliberations to such little or counterproductive effect is funny .
We 've all giggled behind the backs of friends who come to parties dressed in something expensive and grim .
I 'm sure it would happen to me if I ever wore anything expensive .
But I resent the implication that those whose outfits do n't pass muster with self - appointed fashion experts have let themselves down or been in some way deliberately perverse .
Phrases like " no excuse " and " should know better " abound .
Well , there 's every excuse and why should they know better ?
It 's only some actors togged up for a party .
And they 've been photographed .
If they look like crap , surely the public can come to that conclusion unaided and without a leg - up of bitchy prose from a bitch .
I know this kind of reporting is nothing new and that the stars collude in the process because it 's good for them to have their pictures in the paper , even in the context of some hack saying they look like a seal in a glitter bag .
But that still does n't make it OK .
It 's a nasty display of rudeness and a much better reason to get offended than hearing someone say : " Fuck . "
The harshest sartorial judgment last week was reserved not for a Hollywood star but the wife of a British politician .
Frankie Burnham , who 's married to the culture secretary , turned up to the unveiling of a statue of the Queen Mother wearing what , from the reaction of some of the press , you 'd think was a crotchless leotard covered in swastikas .
It was described as " hideous and inappropriate " , with a dress she did " not have the legs for " and a hat " left over from some awful suburban wedding " .
This poses some questions .
First , what is that journalist 's problem with suburban weddings ?
Does she only attend sophisticated metropolitan ones as a matter of principle ?
There 's nothing wrong with suburbia - it's where millions of us live and I hope her many suburban readers are n't duped into the knee - jerk self - loathing about suburbia that everything from Revolutionary Road to the music of Pulp has made a staple of our culture .
But the main question is whether she actually believes Mrs Burnham was trying to do anything other than wear something smart and appropriate .
Because if not , she should shut up .
Mrs Burnham 's clothes looked fine to me , although I suppose they were quite cheerful .
But then it was the unveiling of a statue , long posthumously , to a woman who had an amazing life , lived in a palace and died at 101 .
What exactly is there to be miserable about ?
Whether or not Frankie Burnham judged the mood of an unusual occasion correctly , she was clearly trying to .
If her aim had been to offend , surely she'd have gone further than a glimpse of knee and a floppy hat .
Being unkind about someone 's appearance under those circumstances is the only thing that is remotely hideous or inappropriate or disrespectful to the Queen Mother about the whole event .
Arctic sea ice extent has begun its seasonal decline towards the September minimum .
Ice extent through the winter was similar to that of recent years , but lower than the 1979 to 2000 average .
More importantly , the melt season has begun with a substantial amount of thin first - year ice , which is vulnerable to summer melt .
Figure 1 .
Arctic sea ice extent for March , 2009 , was 15.16 million square kilometers ( 5.85 million square miles ) .

At the end of last summer ’s melt season , extensive areas of open
water froze up quickly , once air temperatures cooled in
the fall .
By February 28 , ice extent had reached its annual maximum .
Although the maximum ice extent occurred slightly earlier than usual , ice extent remained close to the maximum level through much
of March .

High - resolution image March 2009 compared to past Marches Including March 2009 , the past six years have all had ice extent substantially lower than normal .
The linear trend indicates that for the month of March , ice extent is declining by 2.7 % per decade , an average of 43,000 square kilometers ( 16,000 square miles ) of ice per year .

Arctic winter warmer than average
Overall , it was a fairly warm winter in the Arctic .
Air temperatures over the Arctic Ocean were an average of 1 to 2 degrees Celsius ( 1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) above normal , with notable regional variations .
The Barents Sea region was over 4 degrees Celsius ( 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit ) warmer than average this winter .
This warmth probably stemmed from unusually low sea ice extent in the region throughout much of the winter , which allowed the ocean to pump heat into the atmosphere .
The Bering Sea , in contrast , experienced a cool winter , with temperatures 1 to 2 degrees Celsius ( 1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) below average .
The cooler conditions were consistent with the above - average sea ice extent in the Bering Sea through much of the winter .

Sea ice young and thin as melt season begins
How vulnerable is the ice cover as we go into the summer melt season ?
To answer this question , scientists also need information about ice thickness .
Indications of winter ice thickness , commonly derived from ice age estimates , reveal that the ice is thinner than average , suggesting that it is more susceptible to melting away during the coming summer .
As the melt season begins , the Arctic Ocean is covered mostly by first - year ice , which formed this winter , and second - year ice , which formed during the winter of 2007 to 2008 .
First - year ice in particular is thinner and more prone to melting away than thicker , older , multi - year ice .
This year , ice older than two years accounted for less than 10 % of the ice cover at the end of February .
From 1981 through 2000 , such older ice made up an average of 30 % of the total sea ice cover at this time of the year .
While ice older than two years reached record lows , the fraction of second - year sea ice increased compared to last winter .
Some of this second - year ice will survive the summer melt season to replenish the Arctic ’s store of older ice ; however , in recent years less young ice has made it through the summer .
To restore the amount of older ice to pre-2000 levels , large amounts of this young ice would need to endure through summer for several years in a row .
But conditions may not always favor the survival of second - year and older ice .
Each winter , winds and ocean currents move some sea ice out of the Arctic ocean .
This winter , some second - year ice survived the 2008 melt season only to be pushed out of the Arctic by strong winter winds .
Based on sea ice age data from Jim Maslanik and Chuck Fowler at the University of Colorado , since the end of September 2008 , 390,000 square kilometers ( 150,000 square miles ) of second - year ice and 190,000 square kilometers ( 73,000 square miles ) of older ( more than two years old ) ice moved out of the Arctic .

This is supposed to be an introductory presentation on Agile .
In this presentation I give some examples of heavy weight methods and their implications on your project .
Then I give a quick overview of Agile methods , the rationale behind it , its origin , its values and principles .
I move on to describe that what I see happening today in the industry is really waterfall in the name of Agile .
I give some reasons why this is happening and then I give some pointers to move away from this flawed thinking .
Bottom line , Agile is not a Silver Bullet and do n’t fall pray to marketing gimmicks .
Question dogmatic claims .
Adapt Agile to your needs and take baby steps .
The front page for Houston - based Web host The Planet proudly boasts the " lowest price on the planet . "
But you probably wo n't see them advertising the most striking proof of their global competitiveness : prices so low that the Taliban prefers to run its propaganda sites out of the Lone Star State !
The situation has outraged some bloggers , but there 's reason to think American intelligence officials are only too happy to have the enemy 's data flowing across US soil .
One such Taliban propaganda site billed itself as the official voice of the " Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan , " and regularly provided enthusiastic ( if highly dubious ) reports of successful attacks on coalition troops in the region .
It was pulled offline last week after conservative blog The Jawa Report urged readers to complain to companies " unknowingly and unwittingly giving the Taliban some of the necessary tools they need to prolong the war . "
( The blogger also provided Taliban officials ' contact emails , and suggested signing them up for sheep porn . )
Within days , however , it had reappeared online under a slightly different name — now apparently hosted in Canada .
So why would extremist groups boiling over with rage at the United States bring their business to the United States ?
As Rita Katz of the terror - monitoring SITE Intelligence Group ( that 's " Search for International Terrorist Entities " ) explained to The Washington Post , " the relatively cheap expense and high quality of US servers seems to attract jihadists . "
Almarrah1 , the paper reports , was costing Mullah Omar about $ 70 a month .
While the Post does n't mention it , there 's also a good chance they love us for our freedoms , at least compared with some of the local alternatives : neighboring Pakistan , for instance , routes all traffic through a centralized Pakistan Internet Exchange under government control .
While US bloggers continue their whack - a- mole campaign to have these sites pulled down as quickly as they pop up — providing business services like Web hosting to a hostile power is illegal under the International Emergency Economic Powers
Act — there 's some reason to think that US intelligence services are only too happy to have these sites based on their home turf .
Thomas Burling of Atlanta - based Tulix told the Post that his company has " routinely " been contacted by federal agencies regarding terror groups use of the firm 's Free Web Town service .
The article even quotes an anonymous Pakistani official complaining that the US routinely ignores requests to shut down these propaganda pages because " Washington prefers to keep the sites running for intelligence purposes . "
Of course , unless we 're dealing with unusually stupid terrorists , it 's unlikely that osamab@gmail.com is talking in the clear with talipally@aol.com .
But plenty of surveillance effort is devoted to traffic pattern analysis , rather than content interception , which means it could be convenient to be able to keep a close eye on the timing and origin of , say , user visits or administrative logins .
And while sites taken offline invariably show up again shortly thereafter , having them hosted locally should at least make it easier to quickly remove them if , for some reason , it 's important that they be cut off during some specific window of time .
So why pull the sites at all ?
Recall that in World War II , the British had cracked the German Enigma code , but could n't actually be seen to use all the information they gleaned — otherwise it would be too obvious that the system had been compromised , and the Germans would switch to another code .
In other words , if American officials are happy about playing host to Taliban sites , they have ample reason not to be too loud about it .
We have had killings where the stated motive was to kill liberals .
We now have a man killing cops because " Obama wants to take away our guns " , which is a flat out lie being perpetuated by bottom feeders like Glenn Beck , Sean Hannity , " Human Events " and others within the right wing hate machine .
Leading republicans , including the most recent Vice Presidential candidate ( and one of the republican Presidential contenders ) joke about Obama being shot or try to link him to terrorists .
There is an increase in right wing militia activity .
Fears and anger are deliberately being stoked in a violent and dangerous way .
People have been killed .
Multiple times ( not people being killed multiple times , but multiple instances of people being killed in mass murders ) .
And in the past , it was dismissed or explained away or excused for whatever reason by those who purposely incited violence with loaded terms or threats or just flat out lies .
Hell , this is n't even about gun control laws .
It is about LYING about gun control laws .
However , now their words and lies have resulted in three officers being killed .
The rightists are faced with two facts : ( 1 ) They lied purposely about Obama ’s " hidden agenda to take away guns " and ( 2 ) because of this , a man shot and killed three police officers .
Will they admit that their violent rhetoric has gone too far and should be reigned in at the risk of more mass killings ?
Or will they stand with cop killers and against the brave officers who were needlessly taken from their families because of lying political propaganda ?
These people need to be challenged not just on the actions , but on their participation in bringing these actions to fruition .
PACIFIC PALISADES , Calif. , Feb. 22 ( UPI ) -- Phil Mickelson shot a 1 - over - par 72 Sunday , good enough to win the Northern Trust Open in Pacific Palisades , Calif. , for the second straight year .
Mickelson used a pair of late birdies to finish at 15 - under 269 , a stroke ahead of Steve Stricker , who closed with a 67 but bogeyed the final hole at the Riviera Country Club .

K.J. Choi , ( 69 ) , Fred Couples ( 69 ) and Anders Romero ( 70 ) shared third place at 13 - under 271 .
The victory was the 35th on the PGA Tour for the 38 - year - old Mickelson .
Mickelson , who won $ 1 million , needed birdies on the 16th and 17th holes and a 6 - foot , par - saving putt on the 18th to beat Stricker , who finished ahead of him .
" It was an exciting finish .
Obviously , I did n't want it to be that close .
I felt like I got off to a good start and was n't able to keep it going , " Mickelson said .
" But to fight through a round where I did n't have my best stuff and to make some key putts coming down the stretch and key shots , it feels terrific to pull off the victory . "
Cmdr Bainimarama said the government was corrupt
Military commander Frank Bainimarama has seized control of the country , marking the fourth coup in two decades .
Britain reacted by suspending military aid , and New Zealand called the development an " outrage " .
Commodore Bainimarama has dismissed PM Laisenia Qarase , who said the army had brought " shame to the country " .
Cmdr Bainimarama accused the prime minister of corruption and leading Fiji on a path of doom .
The two have long been in dispute , largely over the commodore 's opposition to a proposed amnesty for those responsible for a 2000 coup he helped put down .
' Tragic setback '
Fiji 's police force , elected officials and media joined international powers in condemning the coup .
Foreign ministers from nations within the Commonwealth Secretariat will meet in London this week to make a decision .
Australia and New Zealand have called for economic sanctions , and Commonwealth officials said that matter would also be discussed .
FIJI TENSIONS TIMELINE 2000 : Brief coup put down by army chief Bainimarama July 2005 : Bainimarama warns he will topple government if it pardons jailed coup plotters May 2006 : PM Laisenia Qarase wins re-election 31 Oct : Qarase tries - and fails - to replace Bainimarama November : Qarase says he will change law offering clemency to coup plotters - Bainimarama warns of coup 5 Dec : Military declares coup
Fiji voices : Coup impact Fears for future History of coups
New Zealand 's Prime Minister , Helen Clark , said it was " an outrage what is happening in Fiji " and that Cmdr Bainimarama had " taken leave of his senses " .
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said the coup was a " tragic setback for democracy in Fiji " .
Mr Howard said he had turned down a request from Mr Qarase to send troops to prevent the coup .
" The possibility of Australian and Fijian troops firing on each other in the streets of Suva was not a prospect that I for a moment thought desirable , " Mr Howard said .
Cmdr Bainimarama named a doctor , Jona Senilagakali , as caretaker prime minister , and said that next week he would ask the Great Council of Chiefs to restore executive powers to President Ratu Josefa Iloilo .
The president would then appoint an interim government and elections would follow at an unspecified date , the military chief said .
But Mr Qarase said : " The government they want to set up will be totally illegal .
" What the military has done is raped our constitution . "
Ethnic tension
Cmdr Bainimarama said Fiji had reached a " crossroads " and that the government had been " unable to make decisions to save our people from destruction " .
He warned that more troops would be seen on the streets but said there was no curfew , and urged the population not to be intimidated .
The capital is largely calm .
Bainimarama is a man with power and intelligence who is not joining hands with the corrupt but is going against them to help the people of Fiji

Cmdr Bainimarama said the prime minister had created tension in the army by trying to have him removed .
Fiji 's police chief , Andrew Hughes , who is on leave in Australia , said he could " foresee a popular uprising " .
" [ Bainimarama ] does n't have the support of the government , of the president , of the police , of the churches , of the chiefs , of the people of Fiji , " he said .
Fiji 's largest daily newspaper , the Fiji Times , said it was suspending publication rather than accept censorship .
Fiji has a population of only 900,000 but is a major tourist destination and attracts up to 400,000 visitors a year .
It has also witnessed considerable political tension over the past 20 years between ethnic Fijians , who make up about 50 % of the population and ethnic Indians at around 44 % .
The BBC's Phil Mercer in Suva says some Fijians believe the army is taking the right action and insist the government was corrupt and was discriminating against the Indian minority .
But critics of the move , he says , insist that what Cmdr Bainimarama wants is to establish a military dictatorship in the south Pacific .
Such an outcome would add to the concerns of Australia and New Zealand about political instability in the wider Pacific islands region .
The remains of a giant meat - eating sea monster that patrolled the oceans during the reign of the dinosaurs have been unearthed on an island in the remote Arctic archipelago of Svalbard .
Norwegian fossil hunters recovered the rear half of the formidable reptile 's skull in south - west Spitsbergen in what has been described as one of the most significant Jurassic discoveries ever made .
The predator has been identified as a new species of pliosaur , a group of extinct aquatic reptiles that had huge skulls , short necks and four flippers to power them through the water .
Measurements of the partial skull and 20,000 other bone fragments uncovered at the site showed that the creature was at the top of the food chain , preying on squid , fish and other marine reptiles .
The pliosaur 's head was twice as big as that of a Tyrannosaurus rex and was filled with an impressive set of 12 - inch teeth .
Palaeontologists estimate the beast was 15 metres long , weighed 45 tonnes and hunted the oceans 147 million years ago .
" This is really big .
We have parts of the lower jaw that are huge compared with anything we 've ever seen , " said Espen Madsen Knutsen , a palaeontologist on the team at the University of Oslo that studied the creature .
" It could have eaten anything it came across . "
Researchers got their first glimpse of the beast 's remains on the last day of an expedition in 2007 , during which they uncovered bones from a smaller pliosaur .
Jørn Hurum at the University of Oslo's Natural History Museum , who led the expedition , noticed some large bones sticking out of the ground .
The team marked the site , took a GPS reading of the location , and returned last August to excavate the remains .
Hurum 's team was stunned to find the remains were from a larger pliosaur than any uncovered to date .
They have spent recent months cleaning and measuring the bone fragments to build up a picture of how the creature would have looked when it was alive .
Among the remains , the team noticed a spherical bone , called a basioccipital condyle , found in all mammals and reptiles that joins the base of the skull to the spinal cord .
The bone measured 15 cm across , making it the largest of any pliosaur known , and twice the size of the same bone in T. rex .
To find out how the beast moved in the water , they called in Frank Fish , an expert on the biomechanics of flippers , at West Chester University in Pennsylvania .
Using a wind tunnel , they reconstructed the forces that the creature 's huge flippers generated and found that it probably cruised the oceans using its front two flippers only , deploying all four to lunge forwards and take its prey by surprise .
Using a CT ( computed tomography ) scanner on loan from the Natural History Museum in London , another team member , Patrick Druckenmiller from the University of Alaska , created a three dimensional image of the beast 's brain , which showed it was small and elongated , similar to that of a great white shark .
The team then travelled to Florida 's St Augustine Alligator Farm and Zoological Park to join evolutionary biologist Greg Erickson from Florida State University to work out how powerful the creature 's bite was .
Calculations based on the animal 's jaw bones suggest it could have bitten into its prey with a force of 150 kilonewtons , or four times the force thought to be exerted by the jaws of a T. rex .
The discovery was announced as Canadian experts unveiled their own remarkable finding , the fossilised remains of what may have been the least fearsome predator ever to stalk the continent .
The carnivorous dinosaur , the smallest ever found in what is now North America , was the size of a small , skinny chicken , ran about on two legs wielding razor - sharp claws , and had an enlarged sickle - shaped claw on its second toe .
" It was half the size of a domestic cat and probably hunted and ate whatever it could for its size , " said Nick Longrich , a palaeontologist at the University of Calgary , who led the expedition .
Among its prey would have been insects , small mammals , amphibians and possibly small dinosaurs that lived in the swamps and forests of the late Cretaceous .
The remains of the diminutive dinosaur , called Hesperonychus , were excavated at the 75 m - year - old Dinosaur Park Formation site in Alberta in 1982 , but had lain unstudied for 25 years .
When Longrich began studying the bones , he suspected they were from juveniles because they were so small , but closer inspection revealed them to be from adults , according to a report in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Its discovery just emphasises how little we actually know , and it raises the possibility that there are even smaller ones out there , " said Longrich .
" Small carnivorous dinosaurs seemed to be completely absent from the environment , which seemed bizarre because today the small carnivores outnumber the big ones .
It turns out that they were here and they played a more important role in the ecosystem than we realised .
For the past 100 years , we 've overlooked a major part of North America 's dinosaur community , " Longrich said .
We said our goodbyes and , feeling both slightly extravagant and ashamed , I raced off with knees close together towards the modern and sophisticated city of Osijek , where I was the only guest in a well - equipped and comfortable hostel that had space to sleep about 30 .
The hostel had been set up about six months ago I was told by Boris , the owner 's son .
" We are still learning , " he said , adding hopefully that two Australian tourists had stayed there the night before .

Surfers Wiped Out By Gigantic Waves
Surfing is a way of life , a very attractive lifestyle , too .
The people surfing get to experience an adrenalin rush that is unknown to those who have never tried surfing .
It ’s only you , your board and the forces of nature , the sea to be exact .
And the most powerful force the sea provides is , of course , the waves .
A lot of these brave guys have surfed and won over some of the greatest waves .
But , sometimes the forces of nature prevail and at that moment the surfer is wiped out .
It may seem funny , but it would n’t be that funny if you were in the place of these men .
All in all , it ca n’t be disputed that these look pretty impressive .
Des progrès ont été accomplis dans la lutte contre le paludisme , en Afrique en particulier , là où la prévalence de la maladie est la plus élevée , mais il faut redoubler d’efforts contre ce fléau mondial , a déclaré le Fonds des Nations Unies pour l’enfance ( UNICEF ) lors de la publication vendredi d’un rapport à la veille de la Journée mondiale du paludisme . «
Pour la première fois dans l’histoire , nous sommes sur le point de faire du paludisme une cause rare de décès et d’invalidité » , a dit la directrice générale de l’UNICEF Ann Veneman .
«
Le rapport montre que les pays d’endémie africains ont reçu au cours de la période 2004 - 2008 suffisamment de moustiquaires pour couvrir plus de 40 % de leurs populations à risque . »
Les données présentées dans le rapport intitulé « Paludisme et enfants : progrès dans la couverture des interventions » , une initiative commune du partenariat ‘ Faire reculer le paludisme ’ et du Fonds mondial de lutte contre le SIDA , la tuberculose et le paludisme , montrent d’importants signes de progrès dans la lutte contre le paludisme dans toute l’Afrique , et témoignent en particulier de l’augmentation du nombre de moustiquaires traitées à l’insecticide qui ont été distribuées .
Depuis 2004 , le nombre de ces moustiquaires produites dans le monde a plus que triplé , passant de 30 millions à 100 millions en 2008 .
« Chaque année , cependant , cette maladie tue un million de personnes selon les estimations , pour la plupart des enfants d’Afrique , » a rappelé Mme Veneman « et le paludisme affecte également environ 50 millions de femmes enceintes chaque année , contribuant à l’anémie maternelle , à la naissance de bébés souffrant d’insuffisance pondérale , et même aux décès maternels . »
Cette année , le thème de la Journée mondiale du paludisme , célébrée le 25 avril , est « Le compte à rebours est lancé » .
Il reste en effet à peine 600 jours avant le 31 décembre 2010 , date limite fixée par le Secrétaire général à laquelle tous les pays d’endémie devraient assurer une couverture universelle au moyen d’interventions antipaludiques essentielles .
« En faisant passer à vaste échelle les interventions efficaces , on a fait reculer le nombre de cas de paludisme , et de décès , dans les établissements de santé de nombreux pays , y compris l’rythrée , le Rwanda , la Zambie et Madagascar » , a affirmé Mme Veneman .
«
Et cela a permis d’alléger le fardeau d’hôpitaux et de cliniques surchargés et aussi de diminuer le nombre de personnes incapables d’aller au travail ou à l’école à cause de la maladie . »
De son côté , le Secrétaire général de l’ONU , Ban Ki-moon , estime dans un message à l’occasion de la Journée mondiale du paludisme que celle - ci est « plus qu’une commémoration ». « Il est temps de rassembler nos forces pour stopper cette maladie » .
« En ces temps de crise économique , nous devons protéger les investissements en matière de santé mondiale et ne pas laisser cette maladie remonter » , ajoute - t - il .
Pour sa part , l ’Organisation mondiale de la santé ( OMS ) indique qu’une évaluation indépendante sur les tests de diagnostic rapide du paludisme montre que certains tests actuellement sur le marché sont exceptionnellement efficaces sous les températures tropicales permettant même de dépister des densités parasitaires faibles dans les prélèvements sanguins .
« D’autres , en revanche , ne dépistent les plasmodies que lorsque leur densité est élevée » , ajoute l’agence des Nations Unies dans un communiqué publié vendredi .
Quarante et un tests de diagnostic rapide trouvés dans le commerce ont été soumis à une évaluation de laboratoire en aveugle .
Les résultats permettront aux pays de choisir en connaissance de cause parmi les dizaines de tests disponibles dans le commerce les mieux adaptés aux conditions locales .

I need to make a sky for my city .
So … I guess I better add one .
This is not religious iconography .
There are a lot of techniques for rendering skies .
The most common is probably the “ skybox ” , which is a simple box with pre-rendered images pasted on it .
Sometimes the images are taken with a special camera , but more commonly they ’re designed by artists .
To the right is an example of a skybox , which I gleefully pilfered from Google .
( You could cut that image out and fold it up along the white lines to form a real - world skybox if you wanted . )
Imagine folding up the box and wearing it on your head with the images facing inward .
Note that all around you would be a seamless mountain vista .
Also note that you would look like an idiot and likely bump into things .
On the computer , it ’s possible to draw this box , and then render everything else in the world on top of it , which creates the illusion that the mountains are a huge distance ( infinite , actually ) away .
Now , my skybox is n’t going to be box shaped .
Since I ’m focusing on making a night time scene , I do n’t need the top or bottom .
So I ’ll make some textures and place them on in side of a shortened tube instead of a cube .
So , the viewer of my program is unwittingly wearing a lampshade on their head .
Ha ha .
I make a smear of colors and put it on the lampshade .
It ’s amazing how you can blur just about any two colors across the view and see it as a horizon .
I start with a random warm color , which then fades to a blue , then fades to a very dark blue , and then to black .
The specific colors are randomly chosen .
I do n’t know if it ’s supposed to be a sunset or simply city lights bouncing off the atmosphere .
It ’s a little bright and colorful to be ambient light .
But it goes all the way around the horizon , which is something sunsets do n’t usually do .
I add some stars .
That ’s good , but I ’m going to need clouds if I really want to make this lampshade look sky - esque .
For some reason , I thought I ’d try and generate some puffy clouds fractally .
It became apparent very early on that this was a foolhardy approach , but I messed with it a bit longer than I should simply because it was generating such interesting images .
The method I was fooling around with worked like this : I draw this blurry circle of light , and then within that circle I draw several smaller ones , and within each of those I draw more , on and on , recursively .
They get brighter as they get smaller .
By varying the parameters – how many circles , how bright , how much smaller they get with each iteration – I come up with a lot of very interesting images .
Some look like a relief map of a gorge - ridden desert landscape .
Some look like cauliflower .
None of them look like clouds .
One of the many fractal non-clouds :
Eventually I stop playing around and get back to work .
This is very far from my mission parameters .
My goal is to sell the scene using simple tricks , and trying to create believable clouds using fractals is the opposite of that .
I save the fractal code elsewhere in case I want to play with it again , and devise a simple trick :
I draw my fading circle texture onto the canvas , only I color the circle black .
Then I squash it vertically and draw it again , only slightly lighter .
The further down the canvas I go , the more I compress my circles vertically .
So the circles near the top will be nearly round , but those at the bottom will be nearly a horizontal line .
The result :
And now I slap that texture over top of the gradient and the stars :
This is the way to go .
I spend some time fussing with the color parameters : Cloud size , opacity , density , the contrast of the lit underside of the cloud , and the degree to which they flatten out as they approach the bottom of the texture .
( The horizon , from the user ’s point of view . )
Unlike the buildings , these parameters are n’t something I can just plug into the random number spewer and create infinite content .
Most of these numbers are tradeoffs , and making it look better one way will diminish it in another .
Eventually I decide to stop messing with it :
We ’re getting close now .

In any field that is sufficiently nuanced , only the experts will be able to evaluate the ability of other experts .
This is why both the free market and the government can not be truly meritocratic with regard to the arts and sciences .
In the first case , the " elites " are selected and promoted based on their appeal to the people , and in the second case , they 're selected based on their appeal to bureaucratic standards made or selected by people who are n't themselves experts .
In neither case are the criteria for selection very well informed .
Do n't take this as an endorsement for trade unions .
I do n't think very many , if any , organizations that live up to this standard exist or ever have existed .
The closest thing that i can think of would be the university system , and that has its own problems and bureaucratic and ameritocratic tendencies .
The theatre gets in the way of the substance .
The G20 summit has all the correct dramatic elements .
There are of course the characters , including the new male lead , the Mr Nasty , the ageing roués , the former top model and so on .
There are the props : the helicopters , the motor cavalcades , Air Force One .
And there is the plot , with the staked - out positions of the different players , the staged rows between them with threats of walk - outs and , finally , the dramatic conclusion when the show will be declared a success and everyone can go home .
But this show does matter .
The overriding rule of economic governance should be the Hippocratic Oath , " first , do no harm " .
The world economy is unusually fragile at the moment and it is perfectly possible for the major players to cause harm in the coming months .
If at the margin this summit can inhibit that possibility then it will have done something useful .
The big issues are not the staged rows .
There is some difference of emphasis on the appropriate size of the fiscal boost , with Germany and France urging caution at home and the US , UK and Japan wanting them to borrow big .
You could call this a row and , from private conversations , I know that there is a sharp difference of view between Germany and the UK in particular .
You can see , too , why Japan is so anxious to get other countries to boost demand .
Its own exports have halved , yes , halved , over the past year , and it needs consumers in other countries to buy more of its goodies fast .

But none of this is vitally important .
At the margin it matters , of course , but only at the margin .
It is not reasonable to believe that it is crucial whether the German budget deficit in the coming year will be 5 per cent of GDP or 7 per cent .
Or the UK one 10 per cent or 12 per cent ?
Or the Japanese ... no , let 's not go there .
After 15 years of stagnation , Japan 's total national debt is now some 200 per cent of GDP , nearly as high as Britain 's after the Second World War .
If it goes to 220 per cent , then that mercifully is their problem , not ours .
Nor really are changes to banking regulation or global financial architecture , whatever that is , that vital – though it is profoundly unfashionable to say so .
Yes , of course , the banks have to be better regulated , but that is a five - year task at least .
The last time new banking regulation was agreed ( very bad regulation by the way because it helped create the present mess ) it took 12 years to get the deal done .
But it does not matter now because the destruction of the banks ' balance sheets that has taken place will inhibit them doing anything stupid for a long time .
As for the changes to the capital and voting powers of the International Monetary Fund , and other issues such as whether the dollar should be replaced as a reserve currency , well , it is all worth thinking about and in the case of the IMF moving reasonably swiftly .
But none of this matters right now .
To focus on that , or indeed the issue of tax havens and so on , is to worry about the home insurance before you have put the fire out .
The fire , I am afraid , is still raging and it will continue to rage for some months yet .
Even those of us who think that when we can look back on this in five years ' time , this recession will , at least for the UK , have been no more serious than that of the early 1980s – even we have to acknowledge that the recovery will not be secure until well into this year , and maybe well into 2010 .
The months ahead are dangerous because they are the stage of the economic cycle when governments are most likely to do stupid things .
As far as the world economy is concerned , top of that list will be protectionist measures .
There has been some retreat from free trade already .
Even here in Britain there has been " British jobs for British workers " , while in the US it seems that companies that get financial help from the taxpayer have to favour US employees .
Elsewhere , India has banned the import of Chinese toys , China the import of Irish pork .
The list goes on : some two - thirds of the countries in the world have brought in some form of protectionism in the past year .
So far , though , this has not got out of control .
We have been here before .
Remember how Japan protected its ski manufacturers by banning foreign skis on the grounds that Japan had different snow .
( True : I remember sitting in front of an official in Tokyo who patiently explained to me that it was not actually the snow itself , but the snow conditions . )
The danger is obvious .
Globalisation , for all the benefits it has brought , not least to the billion people it has lifted out of poverty in Asia during the past two decades , is under threat .
You can have a debate about how serious this recession will turn out to be compared with previous ones but there is no debate about the fact that it is the first serious one to happen since China , India and the other emerging economies became fully integrated into the world economy .
China will this year become the world 's second largest economy , passing Japan .
Brazil will probably pass Canada next year , and India may well pass Spain .
That is why this is a G20 meeting , not a G7 one .
At the moment most of the big emerging economies are still doing reasonably well .
To take some Goldman Sachs forecasts both China and India are expected to grow by around 6 per cent this year , whereas Japan will shrink by 6 per cent , and the US and Europe by more than 3 per cent .
It makes the UK , which it forecasts will shrink 2.5 per cent , look not too bad .
The significance of this is power is shifting away from the old developed world .
We knew that and we knew that shift is seismic .
The significance is that power is shifting even faster as a result of the downturn .
This is the first chance that the leaders of these " new " powers have to meet the leader of the largest of the " old " powers .
Keeping global growth moving , not just this year or next , but for the next decade – indeed the next generation – depends first and foremost on the relationship between the US and China .
The relationship between the other major players , India , Russia and the EU , matters too of course but not as much .
Those leaders have just had to cope with a disappointing American president .
They do n't know whether the new one will disappoint too : be another Carter .
They do n't know whether they can trust him to deliver on what he says .
There are practical financial questions such as whether the US will be a safe haven for their savings or should they diversify ?
There are practical trading questions , most notably will the US remain an open market for their goods ?
And there will be geo-political questions too .
The parallel is not the 1933 London summit , wrecked by the then new US president , Franklin D Roosevelt , who failed to show up .
The parallel is much more the global situation a century ago , during the last great burst of globalisation , when the economic progress proved far more fragile than anyone knew .
You do n't need to invoke fears of 1914 to want the leaders of today 's great powers , new and old , to know that they need to avoid doing harm .

Okay , I ’ll admit it …I was the friend who ’s source sparked the “ almost ” article yesterday about a bacon emergency .
I was told by a reliable source that there was “ a bacon warehouse on fire in Pomona , CA . ”
When I heard those words my heart sank .
Poor bacon .
Poor , poor bacon .
I called Mr. B. right away with the news and he went on the hunt for the news item .
Unfortunately , he came up dry .
Today , I learned exactly why the story was nowhere to be found .
Turns out our usually reliable source needs a hearing aid .
The radio program our source heard did n’t say “ bacon warehouse on fire ” .
Turns out the announcer said “ vacant warehouse on fire . ”
Now , some folks will say it was an honest mistake .
They will say live and let live .
But fellow bacon lovers , we would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for this unnecessary fright .
No bacon was harmed during the writing of this article .

Dead weights are for the second stage plus satellite , the red line is the orbital threshold , required Isp for each dead weight is read off by looking where each blue line crosses the red line
I ’m sure that anyone following ACW ’s discussion of the Safir - Omid will have picked up that a number of us find it hard to accept that a two - stage Safir could put the Omid satellite into orbit .
I thought I ’d try to explain why , if it really only used two stages , this is so surprising / worrying .
Fortunately , this can be done rather simply without worrying about the details of the trajectory if a couple of simplifying assumptions are made .
Both of these make it seem easier for a two - stage Safir to get into orbit so if it still seems surprising then you know it is really surprising !
These assumptions are
1 ) The second stage does n’t lose any energy due to atmospheric drag
2 ) The total second stage burn time , regardless of how many times it is turned off and on or coasts before being lit , is short compared to the flight time to its orbital altitude .
( Gravity is , of course , included during all of the “ coast ” period . )
The second assumption means we are ignoring the effects of gravity during the burn time of the second stage ; this effectively adds an unknown Delta V ( change in velocity ) to the second stage .
But , as I said , I am loading up the assumptions on the side of making the 2 - stage hypothesis easier to accept because it will end up still being so surprising !
My model for the Safir gives a first stage burn out at about 30 km altitude and a speed of 1.4 km / s .
Thirty km altitude is pretty high but there should still be some aerodynamic drag .
Again , however , I am giving this “ bonus ” to the two - stage hypothesis .
In order to put the Omid satellite into its observed orbit , the second stage needs to lift it to an 243.5 km altitude and give it a speed ( relative to the Earth ) of 7.54 km /s.
Converting that change in potential energy into a change in speed and adding in the change in speed needed to boost it up to orbital speed means that the second stage needs to supply a total of 8.16 km /s .
This is the threshold and is shown in red in the plot above .
That plot shows the change in speed ( Delta V ) supplied by various engine / propellant combinations that vary in strength ( specific impulse or Isp ) for several different dead weight fractions .
This dead weight not only includes the engine masses and the propellant tank masses but also the navigation and control units and the satellite mass .
Notice that even a 5 % dead weight , which would be an amazing improvement in the stage ’s structure , requires an effective Isp of 278 s while an optimistic SCUD - type rocket might have an Isp of 240 !
More “ realistic ” dead weights require an even greater improvement in engine / propellant power .
This is why some of us have a hard time accepting a two - stage Safir .
It is also why a two - stage Safir , which all the experimental data seems to point to , would indicate why the rocket would have to be so much more sophisticated and worrying than what we expected .
WASHINGTON -- Instead of funneling taxpayer money into big financial firms , the government should take the radical step of breaking them up into smaller , more transparent companies , top economists told lawmakers Tuesday .
" We have little to lose , and much to gain , by breaking up these behemoths , which are not just too big to fail , but also too big to save and too big to manage , " said 2001 Nobel Prize recipient and Columbia University Prof.
Joseph Stiglitz , one of the witnesses testifying before the Joint Economic Committee ...
Montana State Rep. Bob Wagner
A bill being considered in the Montana Legislature blasts the Federal Reserve 's role in America 's money policy and permits the state to conduct business in gold and silver instead of the Fed 's legal tender notes .
Montana H.B. 639 , sponsored by State Rep. Bob Wagner , R - Harrison , does n't require the state or citizens to conduct business in gold or silver , but it does require the state to calculate certain transactions in both the current legal tender system and in an electronic gold currency .
It further mandates that the state must accept payments in gold or silver for various fees and purchases .
While Wagner was unavailable for comment , the bill 's language clearly alleges the nation 's current financial system , with its reliance on the private Federal Reserve system for money supply , is a danger to American freedom .
" The absence of gold and silver coin , whether in that form or in the form of an electronic gold currency , as media of exchange , " the bill states , " abridges , infringes on and interferes with the sovereignty and independence of this state … and exposes this state and Montana citizens , inhabitants and businesses to chronic problems and potentially serious crises that may arise from the economic and political instability of the present domestic and international systems of coinage , currency , banking and credit . "
TRENDING : Alleged attacker behind carnage at pro-Trump event linked to ' Caravan 4 Justice ' group
Further , the bill states , relying only on the depreciating legal tender issued by the Fed subjects citizens to " losses in purchasing power " inflicted by the government , a dilemma the bill says amounts to the " incremental confiscation " of property by government in violation of the U.S. Constitution 's protections for just compensation and due process .
The Fifth Amendment states , " No person shall be … deprived of life , liberty or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation . "
Critics of the current financial system argue that using Federal Reserve notes as legal tender , rather than gold - or silver - backed currency , means the value of Americans ' money – and thus their " property " – is siphoned away by inflation , a process perpetuated by the government 's reliance on legal tender .
Gold and silver , critics say , do n't lose their value on the whims of the Federal Reserve .
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , even favors abolishing the Fed 's system of fiat currency to return to dollars backed by gold .
" Throughout its nearly 100 - year history , the Federal Reserve has presided over the near - complete destruction of the United States dollar , " the Texas Republican said .
" Since 1913 the dollar has lost over 95 percent of its purchasing power , aided and abetted by the Federal Reserve 's loose monetary policy .
" How long will we as a Congress stand idly by while hard - working Americans see their savings eaten away by inflation ?
Only big - spending politicians and politically favored bankers benefit from inflation , " he said .
Wagner joins legislators in several other states encouraging their respective governments to reconsider accepting gold as a form of payment .
Indiana's S.B. 453 , Colorado's H.B. 09-1206 , Missouri's H.B. 0561 , Georgia's H.B. 430 and Maryland 's H.J.R. 5 are among the gold currency bills introduced just this year in various legislatures .
Montana 's H.B. 639 has been referred to the Legislature 's State Administration Committee .

kevin86 : It was clear that mate was inescapable and that black must sacrifice both rooks and queen to draw by stalemate .
Black just needed a sequence where the sacs could n't be declined .
Apr -17-09 YouRang :
Not hard to find when you know what you 're looking for .
White threatens Rh8 # and black has little to say about it .
However , our king and pawns are all immobile , so the best hope is to jettison all 3 moving pieces with check and take the stalemate draw .
( Anyone doing puzzles this weeks could see this coming . )
How ?
At first I considered 44 ... Qxg2 + , but it loses to 45 .
Kxg2 Rg3 + 46.Kxg3 47.Re3 + f3 !
Then I tried 44 ... Qe1 + 45 . Kh2 Qh1 + 46. Kxh1 Re1 ( not ... Rc1 , since we need this rook to prevent escape to the 3rd rank ) 47 .
Kh2 Rh1 + 48.Kxh1 ...
Here I sunk into despair when I realized that 48 ... Rc1 + 49 .Kh2 Rh1+ 50 .Kg3 !
Rh3 + 51.Kf4 ! Rf3 + 52.Ke5 ! and the king eventually hides from checks at d6 .
It 's no good taking the queen since white still wins easily with K+R .
However , despair was replaced with glee when I tried checking from the other angle : 48 ... Kh3 +!! 49.Kg1 Rh1 + and there 's no escape thanks to white 's pawns , " protecting " the white king . :-)
Apr -17-09 The ChessGuy : Important considerations :
Yes , Black has a rook for three pawns .
However , he must act critically , because White has a forced checkmate .
Noticing that his king is stalemated and his pawns are immobilized , Black sees that he can swindle half a point via stalemate with a triple heavy piece sacrifice !
Such opportunities are rare and should always be savored , especially the look on the recipient 's face when they shake your hand .

Oops !
It appears I stand corrected .
Taimanov vs Geller , 1951 is the game in question in my last post .
It looks like Hugh Alexander got his dates mixed up . :)

playground player :
Finding the stalemate really was n't all that hard .
White 's Queen and Rook were poised to kill Black 's King , so obviously Black 's current move must lead either to a forced stalemate or a win -- no other chance to survive .
I did spend a lot of time trying to find a win , but that eluded me .
Apr -17-09 awfulhangover :
I knew it 's stalemate week .
If not , I had searched for a win !
Apr -17-09 hedgeh0g :
Although the position looks promising for Black upon a quick first glance as he is a Rook up , it quickly dawns on you that his King is hopelessly trapped , and , if Black 's next move is n't a check , will be mated .
With the week 's stalemate theme in mind , it is n't difficult to spot the combination which salvages a draw for Black : Qe1 + Kh2 , Qh1 +!
Kxh1 , Re1 + Kh2 , Rh1 + Kxh1 , Rh3 + Kg1 , Rh1 + Kxh1 draw .
Easy to calculate since
White 's king only has one escape square for each check .
I feel confident I would spot this one in my own games .
Apr -17-09 Big Easy : I did n't get it .
I had forgotten that this week the theme is draws by forced stalemate , so I was looking for a win .
It 's funny , the last few moves resemble a game of losers chess .
Apr -17-09 njchess :
I got this one , even without knowing this week 's theme .
The tip off was since
White has mate in one with Rg8++ , Black must check with every move .
White must have just stared st the board in disbelief after that ending sequence !
Apr-17-09
keypusher : I thought there was a win with 44 ... Qb1+ 42 . Kh2 Qb8 + 43 . g3 Qxg3 + 44 . fxg3 Re2+ 45 . Kg1 Rc1 +... unfortunately 46 . Qf1 spoils the fun . :)
Apr-17-09 pacorrum : Just as a curiosity , were the black rook on b8 instead of e8 it would be a very nice mate for black : 44 ...
Rb1+ 45 . Kh2 Rh3 +!
46 . Kxh3 Rh1+ 47 . Kg3 Qg4 ++ ( 46.gh is also mate ) .
Apr -17-09 Marmot PFL : I saw this stalemate idea fairly quickly , but it took a while to realize that black had nothing better .
I do n't recall any other game where the side with more material had to go for stalemate .
Apr -17-09 TheaN : Friday 17 April
The week of draws , so it seems .
< 44 ....?>
Material : -/♖ vs 3 ♙\(! ) w : ♕ + ♖ + 5 ♙ b : ♕ + 2 ♖ + 2 ♙ ( ENDGAME ) Candidates : Rc1† , <[ Qe1 † ] >
Target : 6:00
Taken : 1:24 ( !)
Par : by far
-ML -
I found this one so quickly because I have seen a similar position , or maybe the same position .
Black , although up a Rook for three Pawns , is in a bind and cannot ' defend ' against the mate on h8 .
However , with a stalemated king and pawns , one would imagine that there MIGHT be a stalemate possibility .
In this position , it is not just a possibility .
Black will , completely forced , throw all his major pieces on the White King and draw .
< 44 .... Qe1 † 45 . Kh2 Qh1 † 46. Kxh1 Re1 † 47.Kh2 Rh1 † 48.Kxh1 Rh3 † 49.Kg1 ( 49.gxh3 stalemate 1/2 ) 49 .... Rh1 † 50 . Kxh1 stalemate 1/2 > Quite beautiful , nonetheless .
Apr -17-09 TheaN : 4/4 ( with Thursday delayed )
Yep , nice resource here .
I obtained a draw yesterday against a stronger opponent , but that was in a probably winning position >_ > ; we both evaluated that wrong in the first place : a completely different draw if you ask me .
Still , I was happy with it .

In this line , white can simply play 45 .
Kh3 and save the queen .
Black can no longer force stalemate because he runs out of useful checks , e.g. 45 ... Rxg3 + 46.Kxg3 Rg2 + 47.Kf4 Rf2 + 48.Ke5 Re2 + 49 .Kd6 Re6 + 50 .Qxe6 +

Well , shows how much I know :/
Thank you .
Apr -17-09 5hrsolver :
It took me a while to get this one .
I saw that if black can give up all the heavy pieces it would be stalemate .
But how to give up material without allowing the white king to walk up the board is the problem .
It is tempting to give up the rooks first before the queen .
It took me a while to find the stalemating idea .
It is amazing that all white 's pieces were given up on the h1 square .
Apr-17-09 xrt999 : I forgeted the theme was stalemate
Apr-17-09
patzer2 : For today 's Friday puzzle , Black avoids mate after a clever defensive stalemate combination which begins with 44 ... Qe1 +!
Apr -17-09 waustad : I 'm impressed .
I had n't a clue where to start here .
Apr-17-09 zooter : < YouRang : >
Same thoughts as me ... except that my despair was not replaced by glee till I checked the game score
Apr -17-09 TheBish : A Romero Holmes vs B Kantsler , 2002 Black to play ( 44 ...? )
" Difficult "
This is definitely draw week !
If this keeps up , Sunday 's problem wo n't be " insane " , but merely difficult at best .
Of course , CG will probably throw us a loop and give us an option of a draw , with a harder - to - find win !
( You heard it here first . )
Black is ahead in material , up a rook and three pawns , but is faced with mate in one ( Rh8 ) .
So , Black is playing defense , since there is no forced win .
In fact , it looks like he only has a few spite checks before impending doom .
Black can't even sacrifice his queen to prevent mate , since 44 ... Qh7 ? 45 . Rxh7 Kxh7 46 . Qf7 + drops a rook as well , leading to an easy win for White .
But with Black 's pawns all blockaded , a stalemate opportunity presents itself , if Black can manage to give away all his pieces ...
44 ... Qe1+ 45 . Kh2 Qh1 +! ( or Qg1 + ! ) 46 . Kxh1 Re1+ 47 . Kh2 Rh1 +!
48 . Kxh1 Rh3 +! 49 . Kg1 Rh1+ 50 . Kxh1 ( forced ) stalemate !
Note that Black loses after 48 ... Rc1 +?? ( instead of 48 ... Rh3+!) 49 .
Kh2 Rh1+ 50 .
Kg3 Rh3 + 51 . Kf4 Rf3 + 52 . Ke5 ( or Kg5 Rg3 + 53 .
Kxh5 Rg5 + 54 . Qxg5 + ) Re3 + 53 .
Kxd5 Re5 + 54 . Qxe5 ! and Black 's king has a move .

Pet owners will often go to any length to protect the health of their furry and feathered friends .
Now a new survey suggests that one in three smokers would consider kicking the habit after learning that smoking poses a danger to pets .
Survey of pet owners show 28 percent would stop smoking to prevent secondhand smoke to animals .
Secondhand smoke causes almost 50,000 deaths in adult nonsmokers in the United States each year , and there 's a mountain of evidence that secondhand smoke can affect a pet 's health as well .
George Korin is a New York City veterinarian who has " seen bronchial disease in both dogs and cats , either due to home environment or air quality . "
Studies have linked smoke exposure to oral cancer and lymphoma in cats and nasal and lung cancer in dogs , says Korin , who was not involved in the new survey .
Health.com : Dogs sniff out clues in the fight against cancer
Even birds can be victims : A 2007 study found a link between secondhand smoke , lung cancer , and eye , skin , and heart problems in pet birds .
The survey results are not a surprise , according to Korin .
He 's found that pet owners will do just about anything to safeguard their animals ' health , including faithfully placing dogs with spinal paralysis into special carts each day so they have greater mobility .
Health.com :
Are cats or dogs better for your health ?
" People are motivated to help their pets , " says Korin .
" At the least , they will do their very best to arrive at a diagnosis , even it involves fairly expensive procedures such as MRIs and CT scans . "
Pet owners spent an estimated $ 10.5 billion in the United States in 2008 on pet supplies and over - the - counter medications .
Health.com : Puppy love hikes your health
The survey , which included nearly 3,300 pet owners , was published this week in the journal Tobacco Control .
Overall , 28.4 percent of smokers said they would consider quitting after learning that secondhand smoke posed a danger to their pet .
One in five smoking pet owners said they would ban smoking inside their home .
For doctors who treat people , this could be one more way to motivate smokers to kick the habit .
" Clearly people love their pets , " says study author Sharon Milberger , of the Henry Ford Health System 's Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in Detroit .
" This may be a way to reach them . "
Because its participants were mostly from southeastern Michigan , researchers can't be sure it 's representative of pet owners nationwide .
And they 're not sure if pet owners who say they 'd quit smoking for an animal would actually do so .
Health.com :
How my pet helped me heal
" What people say and do are two different things , but it's an opportunity for additional research , " says Milberger .
Currently , the researchers are conducting a follow - up study that follows pet owners who smoke to see if this motivation actually changes their behavior .
" We 'll have to get a better sense of how this information could motivate people , but it potentially could be a way to target smokers from a new angle , " she says .

I spent the better part of an hour earlier today scanning the various sites and blogs to try and understand what specifically the Fox - Pajamas tea parties are about .
Having absorbed about as much of the literature as I can , I have to say I 'm still befuddled .
Option 1 : It 's a protest of the bank bailouts orchestrated by Bush and now Obama .
But surely these tea-partiers understand what would happen if we did n't bail the banks out .
Are they advocating letting major banks fail ?
Or are they advocating a Krugman - style government take - over ?
No idea .
Option 2 : It 's a protest against tax hikes .
But there have barely been any !
Are they arguing that the planned return to Clinton era marginal rates is an outrage worthy of the colonists ... only months after an election in which the winning candidate ran on exactly that platform ?
Is that postponed future increase so radical that it demands a protest modeled on one in which people were taxed with no representation at all ?
Truly bizarre .
And when you consider that we have gone through a very long period of relatively low taxation for the very successful , and a very long period in which their wealth has soared , and after an election where a majority of such people voted for Obama , the extremism seems unrelated to anything substantive underneath it .
' Kumar ' Goes to the White House , Gets a Job
Kal Penn campaigning for Barack Obama at the University of Maryland in February 2008 . . . ( Ricky Carioti / Washington Post )
We 've had actors - turned - mayors , and actors - turned - governors ... but actors - turned - White House staffers ?
That 's a new one !
" House " star Kal Penn -- whose character was killed off on Monday 's episode -- is taking a sabbatical from acting to work for President Obama .
The 31 - year - old actor , first launched to fame as a stoner student in the " Harold and Kumar " movies , is coming to Washington to be associate director in the White House Office of Public Liaison , Entertainment Weekly first reported yesterday .
Seriously ?
The former " cynical independent " met Obama at a fundraiser in late 2007 and became a dedicated , high - profile presence in the campaign 's youth - outreach efforts .
He 'll work primarily with the youth , arts and Asian American communities , the White House told us .
. . . and with John Cho , right , in 2004 's " Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle . " ( Sophie Giraud / New Line Productions )
" I was having a great time " on the show , Penn said yesterday in a conference call with reporters .
" The word I still use to describe it is bittersweet .
It 's not like I 'm retiring from acting .
I certainly intend to come back at some point .
Right now , I just felt like my calling was in public service . "
The New Jersey native said he 's always had two passions : acting and politics .
His Indian grandparents marched with Gandhi , and he 's been studying international security at Stanford University .
He spent a lot of time on the campaign trail and got an itch to continue working on the issues .
He mulled it over for months , then broached the idea to Obama during the inauguration .
( " We discussed it briefly . " )
Penn also talked to presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett , who runs the White House public liaison shop , and his agents , managers and accountants .
" This is what I really want to do , " he told them .
" But am I crazy ? "
Maybe : " Associate directors " at the White House job earn somewhere in the $ 60,000 - $ 70,000 range per year ;
Penn would n't say exactly how much he made on " House , " but TV actors at his level make around $ 50,000 per episode .
Producers of the Fox drama said they were " thrilled " for him when they found out he was leaving to work for Obama , then pulled off a major surprise by having his character , Dr. Lawrence Kutner , unexpectedly commit suicide .
Penn wo n't accept any acting jobs during his time in Washington , which he said would last " at least " a year or two .
He 's not sure when he 'll start the new job , but he 's coming to D.C. next week to look for an apartment ; he already has a lot of college friends and buddies in town .
" While I have n't lived here before , I think I have a pretty good sense of what D.C. 's all about , " he said .
" I 'm definitely looking forward to being part of it . "
He still has to figure out what to do with his L.A. home .
Sublet ?
Refinance ?
( Stars !
Just like us ! )
Whatever Penn 's future as an actor may hold , there 'll be no more " Harold and Kumar " sequels for now .
And forget those lame stoner jokes or questions about legalizing marijuana .
" I do n't smoke weed in real life , " he said , " so it 's honestly not something I 've given much thought to . "
The father of missing child Haleigh Cummings ' married his 17 - year - old - girlfriend , who was the last one known to have seen the child alive , the girl 's grandmother told Nancy Grace producers .
Ronald Cummings proposes to Misty Croslin Sunday at a local Chili 's restaurant .
On Sunday Ronald Cummings asked his teenage girlfriend , Misty Croslin , for her hand in marriage at a local Chili 's restaurant .
While he was with several family members , Cummings got down on one knee , asked Croslin to marry him and gave her Haleigh 's grandmother 's diamond ring .
Because Croslin is only 17 years old , her mother filled out the paperwork so the two could be married .
On Thursday , the pair tied the knot , after the three - day waiting period required by Florida law .
Croslin , who was beaming earlier in the week after the engagement , told CNN affiliate WJXT - TV that while she knows there will be critics of the marriage and the timing , " everything is still about Haleigh . "
Croslin said she wanted to be together as a family , just as Haleigh would have wanted .
" Everybody is probably going to take this marriage thing the wrong way , " Croslin told WJXT .
" This is what Haleigh wanted .
She has always talked about it , and even if she 's not with us , she is still with us . "
Croslin told police she tucked Haleigh and her 4 - year - old brother into bed about 8 p.m. February 9 in their Satsuma , Florida , home .
She said she went to sleep herself about 10 p.m. but woke at 3 a.m. to find Haleigh missing and a back door propped open by bricks .
Police are still actively searching for the girl , with a new search happening this week , and investigators Wednesday took the back door that was found propped open .
In the middle of the search for the girl , the newlyweds will fly to New York Thursday night for their honeymoon and an exclusive appearance on the Today show .
Haleigh 's grandmother , Teresa Neves , also acknowledged the timing might seem " unusual . "
" Well , it is unusual for some onlookers , but those people did n't live with my two grandchildren , " she told Nancy Grace .
" My grandchildren , both Haleigh and Junior , have very often said that they would love for their daddy to marry Misty and that they wanted Misty to be their mommy .
And so I feel like they are just trying to fulfill a wish for Haleigh so that when she comes home she will have that extra happiness to come home to . "
Before the wedding , Neves told CNN affiliate WKMG - TV the wedding would be difficult without Haleigh .
" It 's an event that Haleigh really should be at , but when she comes home , we 'll have a great big wedding so she can be the flower girl and see it all again , " Neves said .

Conficker 's April Fool 's joke – the huge , menacing build - up and then nothing – is a good case study on how we think about risks , one whose lessons are applicable far outside computer security .
Generally , our brains are n't very good at probability and risk analysis .
We tend to use ­cognitive shortcuts instead of thoughtful analysis .
This worked fine for the simple risks we encountered for most of our species 's existence , but it 's less effective against the complex risks society forces us to face today .
We tend to judge the probability of something happening on how easily we can bring examples to mind .
It 's why people tend to buy earthquake insurance after an earthquake , when the risk is lowest .
It 's why those of us who have been the victims of a crime tend to fear crime more than those who have n't .
And it's why we fear a repeat of 9/11 more than other types of terrorism .
We fear being murdered , kidnapped , raped and assaulted by strangers , when friends and relatives are far more likely to do those things to us .
We worry about plane crashes instead of car crashes , which are far more common .
We tend to exaggerate spectacular , strange , and rare events , and downplay more ordinary , familiar , and common ones .
We also respond more to stories than to data .
If I show you statistics on crime in New York , you 'll probably shrug and continue your vacation planning .
But if a close friend gets mugged there , you 're more likely to cancel your trip .
And specific stories are more convincing than general ones .
That is why we buy more insurance against plane accidents than against travel accidents , or accidents in general .
Or why , when surveyed , we are willing to pay more for air travel insurance covering " terrorist acts " than " all possible causes " .
That is why , in experiments , people judge specific scenarios more likely than more general ones , even if the general ones include the specific .
Conficker 's 1 April deadline was precisely the sort of event humans tend to overreact to .
It 's a specific threat , which convinces us that it 's credible .
It 's a specific date , which focuses our fear .
Our natural tendency to exaggerate makes it more spectacular , which further increases our fear .
Its repetition by the media makes it even easier to bring to mind .
As the story becomes more vivid , it becomes more convincing .
The New York Times called it an " unthinkable disaster " , the television news show 60 Minutes said it could " disrupt the entire internet " and we at the Guardian warned that it might be a " deadly threat " .
Naysayers were few ( bit.ly / schneier37 ) , and drowned out .
The first of April passed without incident , but Conficker is no less dangerous today ( bit.ly/ schneier41 , bit.ly / schneier42 ) .
About 2.2 m computers worldwide , are still infected with Conficker .
A and B , and about 1.3 m more are infected with the nastier Conficker .C.
It 's true that on 1 April Conficker .
C tried a new trick to update itself , but its authors could have updated the worm using another mechanism any day .
In fact , they updated it on 8 April , and can do so again .
And Conficker is just one of many , many dangerous worms being run by criminal organisations .
It came with a date and got a lot of press – that 1 April date was more hype than reality – but it 's not particularly special .
In short , there are many criminal organisations on the internet using worms and other forms of malware to infect computers .
They then use those computers to send spam , commit fraud , and infect more computers .
The risks are real and serious .
Luckily , keeping your anti-virus software up - to - date and not clicking on strange attachments can keep you pretty secure .
Conficker speads through a Windows vulnerability that was patched in October ( bit.ly / schneier48 ) .
You do have automatic update turned on , right ?
But people being people , it takes a specific story for us to protect ourselves .

Let ’s admit it .
Liberals had a fun week watching conservatives demand the head of RNC Chair Michael Steele for daring to differ with the conservative movement ’s newly crowned Obi-Wan Kenobi , Rush Limbaugh .
Ann Coulter told Glenn Beck that she was disappointed in Steele for calling Limbaugh “ ugly and incendiary . ”
Gov. Bobby Jindal ( R - LA ) went on " Larry King Live " and proclaimed Limbaugh “ a great leader for conservatives . ”
Bill O’ Reilly said Steele would n’t “ want to get into a fight with Rush Limbaugh — that would be suicide . ”
Steele hastily apologized for his comments , claiming a Descartian mind - body disconnect : “ I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said were n’t what I was thinking , ” Steele told Politico .
“ It was one of those things where I thinking I was saying one thing , and it came out differently . ”
And now Rush Limbaugh is demanding a one - on - one debate with the president of the United States .
We say , “ Bring it on . ” Rush can start by explaining some of this .
But there is a deeper specter haunting conservatism , one involving its entire identity .
It surfaced while Coulter and Beck discussed the Conservative Political Action Conference , otherwise known as CPAC .
Coulter : Now they [ conservatives in Congress ] can vote their principles .
Some of them did n’t vote their principles —
Beck : ( head in hand ) :
What principles do they have ?
Name one .
Coulter : Small government , freedom — Beck : Really ?
Which one ?
Was that George Bush who gave us smaller government ?
A shiver of self - doubt appeared to shoot through Coulter .
You know you ’re in trouble when Glenn Beck is your go - to guy for sensible self - criticism .
But Beck is not alone in his attempt to sever the connection between the Bush administration and the conservative movement for which it professed to speak .
In his unintentionally hilarious response to the State of the Union Address , Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal made a similar statement : “ In recent years … our party got away from its principles . ”
And this year ’s CPAC extravaganza was all about reuniting conservatives with their long - lost ideology .
By contrast , Jon Stewart gently reminded us that when President George W. Bush arrived at CPAC last year , he was greeted with cheers of “ Four more years !
Four more years ! ”
Some highlights from this year :
Chairman of the American Conservative Union and lead organizer of CPAC , David Kleene : " We did n’t object to things that were going off the track … .
If you lay down with the politicians you entrusted with your vision and if you lay down when they are off the track , then it ’s your fault . "
Rep. Mike Pence ( R - IN ) : “ Republicans did n’t just lose a few elections , we lost our way . ”
Rep. Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) : “ The Republican party disregarded its principles , roots ; it sacrificed and it failed to operate a vision relevant to most Americans . ”
Rep. Connie Mack ( R - FL ) : [ House Republicans ] have found out the way to regain the majority is to go back to our old ways . ”
Former Gov. Huckabee ( R - AK ) ( referencing the Bush government ’s disastrous response to Hurricane Katrina ) : “ We ’re no longer Reagan ’s shining city on a hill ; we are the ruined city by the sea . ”
Two CPAC speeches in particular went viral .
Thirteen - year - old Jonathan Krohn garnered more than 100,000 views on YouTube , explaining that the Republican Party was merely the “ shell ” to conservatism ’s “ filling ” of core principles .
He told Huffington Post reporter Sam Stein that the GOP “ started losing it [ elections ] because the American people saw the American party was n’t really based on conservatism , ” using Bush - era policies on immigration and TARP as prime examples .
( The kid needs to spend some more time in history class — at least long enough to reach 2006 ) .
Of course , El Rushbo , whose hour - long speech reaped hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube alone — despite his cleavage - heavy get - up reminiscent of a ( very ) white Barry White — did not apologize for Bush , but he did harken back to the era of Reagan .
Limbaugh celebrated the conservative movement ’s bread and butter , its ideas : “ Conservatism is a universal set of core principles , ” he said .
“ You do n’t check principles at the door … .
Nothing stale about freedom .
There ’s nothing stale about liberty .
There ’s nothing stale about fighting for it .
Nothing stale whatsoever . ”
We ’ve come a long way since 1947 when Friedrich Hayek and 38 others gathered at the foot of Mont Pélerin in Switzerland to discuss free - market values and political change .
And we ’ve come a long way since 1960 , when the Young Americans for Freedom assembled at William F. Buckley , Jr. ’s estate in Sharon , Connecticut and drafted the famous Sharon Statement , articulating their principles as young conservatives .
They did n’t co-opt words like freedom ( as if other Americans simply detest freedom ) .
Instead , they defined a conservative vision .
But coming out of Limbaugh ’s mouth ( coming out of Coulter ’s mouth , too ) , these principles have become self - parodies .
In fact , Limbaugh highly discouraged grappling with conservative beliefs and , in a rather weird passage , thinking ahead :
For those of you in the drive - by media watching , I have not needed a teleprompter for anything I ’ve said .
[ Applause ]
And nor do any of us need a teleprompter , because our beliefs are not the result of calculations and contrivances .
Our beliefs are not the result of a deranged psychology .
Our beliefs are our core .
Our beliefs are our hearts .
We do n’t have to make notes about what we believe .
We do n’t have to write down , " oh do I believe it , do I believe that . "
We can tell people what we believe off the top of our heads , and we can do it with passion and we can do it with clarity , and we can do it persuasively .
He continued : “ Conservatism is what it is and it is forever .
It ’s not something you can bend and shape and flake and form . ”
Limbaugh ’s conviction is a testament to the conservative movement ’s talent for translating its ideas into a clear , if un-nuanced , message .
And it reflects unparalleled recognition that defining and expressing underlying political principles is important , not just for winning elections , but for creating valuable and long - lasting policy .
Limbaugh tells a nice story , but it sounds like one made up by someone who ’s been on drugs for the past eight years .
Conservatives did n’t just misplace those principles after the Reagan era , as so many at CPAC tried to suggest .
They misplaced them the moment they came to power .
Last year , during Pulitzer season , Greg Anrig at The Century Foundation posted a thoughtful blog about this :
Almost all of this year ’s Pulitzer winners in journalism owe a debt of gratitude to the conservative movement for creating and implementing the ideas that produced the calamities unveiled in their exceptional reporting .
I would add , though , that the media in general have largely failed to draw the connections linking the right - wing ’s belief system and policies to outcomes like children harmed by unsafe toys and cribs , the importation of poisonous pharmaceuticals from China , the transgressions attributable to private security contractors in Iraq , abuses of power based on the sham " unitary executive " concept , negligent management of a government - run hospital , and the subprime fiasco .
Even in most of those award - winning articles themselves , relatively little effort was made to underscore the reality that the conservative movement ’s hostility toward government was the root cause of those failures of government .
Perhaps this is why Gov. Jindal irked so many people with his enthusiasm for limited government in a speech that criticized the Bush government ’s catastrophically unfit response to Hurricane Katrina .
And , either tragically or hysterically — depending on one ’s point of view — he picked disaster readiness as the one example of allegedly wasteful government spending .
And perhaps this is why some of the more thoughtful denizens of the right - wing blogosphere are as worried about the future of their movement as liberals are gleeful .
Here ’s a sample .
( We read right - wing blogs so you do n’t have to … ) .
Reihan Salam , co-author of Grand New Party , writes at Forbes :
Limbaugh is enraged by the likes of David Brooks and David Frum and Jim Manzi and Ramesh Ponnuru , conservatives who consort with the liberal enemy .
Though all of these writers and thinkers disagree amongst themselves about a great deal , they share a basic belief that the party needs to do more than just promise tax cuts we ca n’t afford .
And they recognize that a healthy political movement is always open to new ideas , and to questioning old convictions .
Ross Douthat , Salam ’s co-author , asks :
What if the keynote speaker at a liberal version of CPAC insisted that the “ only blueprint liberals need to win elections is the one that Lyndon Johnson used to rout Barry Goldwater ? ”
He writes at The Atlantic :
The Right has a messaging problem , yes — but it also has a message problem .
It could be America ’s natural governing party , sure — but as long as its economic agenda looks like Jim DeMint ’s alternative stimulus , full stop , nothing else to see here , it wo n’t be .
Republicans are in deep trouble because the economic meltdown was piled on top of George W. Bush ’s personal unpopularity — but they would be in some kind of trouble no matter what , because the right - wing message on domestic policy has n’t been resonating with " the people in the middle culturally and economically , " who [ Patrick ]
Ruffini rightly identifies as the backbone of any plausible conservative majority , for going on years and years now .
The current crisis has n’t created the problem ; it ’s taken an existing problem and throw [ sic . ] it into sharp relief .
David Paul Kuhn , author of The Neglected Voter , writes at RealClearPolitics :
After Democrats trounced Republicans in two national elections , CPAC ’s panels deal with " new challenges in the culture war " or " whether President Obama ’s tax policy will ‘ kill entrepreneurship ’ ? "
There are also panels for a Hispanic coalition and one for young Republicans on " rebuilding the movement . "
However , there are no panels on why the movement has withered , what new ideas are required to regain power or why the GOP is repeatedly losing first - time voters .
Anxiety over the party ’s future is conspicuously absent .
Rick Moran , lead blogger at Right Wing Nut House , criticized this inflexible take on current conservative principles at Pajamas Media :
But conservatism has gone off the rails , becoming in some respects a parody of itself .
A philosophy that is all about honoring and conserving tradition while allowing for change that buttresses and supports important aspects of the past , has been hijacked by ideologues who brook no deviation from a dogma that limits rather than expands human freedom .
Patrick Ruffini drives it home at The Next Right :
If the average apolitical American walked into CPAC or any movement conservative gathering would they feel like they learned something new or that we presented a vision compelling to them in their daily lives ?
In the meantime , let ’s all join the die hards and offer up a thank - you to the almighty for Rush Limbaugh .
Liberal scientists , working for decades in a federally funded research lab , could never have invented a better counterpoint at a time of national crisis .

PIRATES II :
The most expensive porn film ever made will no longer be shown to students .
An attempt to distract US students from late - night drinking , with a feature - length porn movie , has been blocked after threats to cut college funding .
The two - and - a - half - hour Pirates II : Stagnetti's Revenge - the most expensive pornographic film ever made , at a cost of $ US10 million ( $ NZ17.6 million ) - would have been shown at a University of Maryland student union theatre on Saturday .
Organisers at the College Park campus , 16 km north of Washington , had championed educational aspects of the screening , with health group Planned Parenthood planning to hold a presentation on safe sex practices beforehand .
The event was also previously seen by university officials as an " alternative to late - night drinking and other dangerous activities , " the Baltimore Sun reported before the cancellation .
Republican state senator Andy Harris , however , proposed an amendment to the state budget to deny millions of dollars in funding for any educational institutions that screen a porn movie .
Harris said he had been " shocked and dismayed " to hear the college was going to screen the movie , and denounced what he described as the " dangers of pornography . "
He said he was " extremely concerned that the policy of our public colleges and universities would allow `hard core ' pornography " to be shown .
" I am pleased to know that the university did the right thing and cancelled this movie .
However , I remain concerned that they do not have a policy prohibiting this , " the senator said in a statement after the university reversed its decision .
Harris added he was " working to seek assurances that this will not happen again . "
The Sun said that during a lengthy debate Thursday morning at the state legislature in Annapolis , Maryland , senate president Thomas Miller indicated he would back Harris ' threat to cut millions of dollars in funding .
Linda Clement , the university 's vice president of student affairs , denied the cancellation was linked to threats made by state lawmakers .
" No , we cancelled the ( showing ) because the educational context of the movie has been lost in the titillation that 's been associated with the movie itself , " according to Clement 's spokesman Millree Williams .
" That 's hard to believe , " responded Adam Kissel , director of the Individual Rights Defence Program at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education based in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
The university 's claim , he said , was extremely unlikely because beforehand " university administrators had known about it , had expected it to go on and they had no problem with it . "
Kissel said his education rights group was " very concerned " about the likely constitutional violation , namely the First Amendment that protects free speech .
" Strictly based on the plot and the trailer , the movie has plenty of action beyond the sexual action -- it has a plot , it has intrigue , just like any movie .
" So it 's almost 100 percent certain that the university is violating the free speech rights of the students , " said Kissel , noting that a First Amendment case was strengthened because of the educational component of Planned Parenthood 's presentation .
Digital Playground , the adult film company behind " Pirates II , " said on its website it had already shown the film to thousands of students on several college campuses this year , including the University of California , Los Angeles ; Northwestern University in Chicago ; and Southern Connecticut State University .
On - campus showings of X - rated movies such as " Behind the Green Door " and " Deep Throat " stirred sensation and controversy in the 1970s and 1980s , but porn has become commonplace on campuses over the past decade with virtually unlimited access to X - rated material via the internet .

As the AP video here reports , countries around the world are reacting to the Swine Flu ( H1N1 ) outbreak in Mexico with quarantines and travel warnings .
The United Nation ’s World Health Organization convened an emergency meeting Saturday to develop a response to the “ pandemic potential ” emerging from Mexico ( although the threat is apparently not considered serious enough to prompt officials in the United States to close the border ) .
If the outbreak indeed turns into a global pandemic , as WHO seems to think , we can expect not only quarantines , but the imposition of martial law in the United States .
In fact , the government has planned for just such a scenario for some time now .
In late 2007 , the Bush administration issued a “ directive ” establishing a “ National Strategy for Public Health and Medical Preparedness ” based on Biodefense for the 21st Century ( see PDF ) .
HSPD 21 , short for Homeland Security Presidential Directive ( signing statement bypassing Congress ) , defines “ catastrophic health event ” as “ any natural or manmade incident , including terrorism , that results in a number of ill or injured persons sufficient to overwhelm the capabilities of immediate local and regional emergency response and health care systems . ”
HSPD 21 established an academic Joint Program for Disaster Medicine and Public Health housed at a National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences .
It teamed up the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense to “ carry out respective civilian and military missions . ”
Prior to this , in May of 2007 , the U.S. military had the foresight to “ plan for a possible avian flu pandemic that could kill as many as three million people in the United States in as little as six weeks , ” according to Yahoo News .
Guidelines and “ planning assumptions for US military services and combatant commands ” were published in a document entitled “ Implementation Plan for Pandemic Influenza . ”
“ Possible scenarios include US troops being called in to put down riots , guard pharmaceutical plants and shipments , and help restrict the movement of people inside the country and across its borders , ” Yahoo summarizes .
“ The plan envisions fast moving , catastrophic waves of disease that would overwhelm health facilities and cripple the ability of state and local authorities to provide even basic commodities or services . ”
The military would be used to restrict traffic within states to contain the spread of the virus , according to the document .
“ It said the military will be called on to evacuate non-infected people from areas abroad that are having problems , and to help allies . ”
In other words , think FEMA during Hurricane Katrina — the relocations , the toxic camps , the confiscation of firearms .
A key military role will be to distribute medical supplies and medications and provide security for the production and shipment of vaccines on orders of the president .
DoD ’s “ Implementation Plan for Pandemic Influenza ” proposes nothing less than the militarization of health care .
In short , the military — provided to “ augment civilian law enforcement ” — will be used to vaccinate the population , as “ directed by the president . ”
Considering the above , the purpose of the brand spanking new KBR camps ostensibly built for “ an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S. , or to support the rapid development of new programs ” comes into focus .
As Michel Chossudovsky wrote in 2005 , the “ hidden agenda consists in using the threat of a pandemic and / or the plight of a natural disaster as a pretext to establish military rule ” and “ suspend Constitutional government and allow the Military to intervene in civilian affairs in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act . ”
Bush said as much when he announced that in the event of a flu outbreak in the U.S. he would consider using the military to “ effect a quarantine ” and place National Guard troops under federal , rather than state , control .
Dr. Irwin Redlener , associate dean of Columbia University ’s Mailman School of Public Health and director of its National Center for Disaster Preparedness , told the Associated Press that a law enforcement role for the military would be an “ extraordinarily Draconian measure . ”
Since Redlener made his comment , the military , under the Northern Command , according to the Army Times , announced the transfer of the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team and its “ dedicated assignment … as an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks . ”
Training for homeland operations commenced last year at Fort Stewart and at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs .
[ efoods ]
Over the last few months , the military has steadily increased its collaboration with local law enforcement in violation of Posse Comitatus , most notably and egregiously in Alabama and Tennessee ( see Damage Control : U.S. Army Investigates Deploying Troops in Samson , Alabama and Massive Checkpoint Operation in Tennessee Violated Posse Comitatus , Fourth Amendment ) .
The federalization and militarization of law enforcement has continued apace since 1994 when the DoD issued a directive allowing military commanders to take emergency actions in domestic situations .
Is it possible a mutant influenza virus would be used as an excuse to impose martial law now that the military is in place ?
“ Our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic Avian Flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the United States , fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 Pandemic , misnamed the ‘ Spanish Flu ’ , with the DNA of the innocuous H5N1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells , according to the National Institutes of Health and the vaccine ’s manufacturer .
Some virologists believe that this would insure that the man -made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them , ” writes Rima E. Laibow , MD , head of the Natural Solutions Foundation , a citizen watchdog group monitoring the pharmaceutical industry .
Laibow underscores what we stress above : “ Given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un-weaponized H5N1 virus , how can we explain the Bush Administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 States , for what it calls the ‘ inevitable Bird Flu pandemic , ’ which they say could kill half or more of all Americans and similar numbers of people around the globe ? ”
Of course , the current swine flu is not H5N1 .
It is the H1N1 virus .
It is however an odd duckling with a suspicious composition : the virus contains genes of human , bird and swine origin .
As the virus spreads , more and more people — and even a few virologists — believe H1N1 is a human - engineered pathogen .
On April 25 , the journalist Wayne Madsen wrote :
Our Mexico City source said a top scientist for the United Nations , who has examined the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Africa , as well as HIV / AIDS victims , concluded that H1N1 possesses certain transmission “ vectors ” that suggest that new flu strain has been genetically - manufactured as a military biological warfare weapon .
The UN expert believes that Ebola , HIV / AIDS , and the current A - H1N1 swine flu virus are biological warfare agents .
Past swine flu outbreaks have been spread from pigs to humans , who then passed the flu on to other humans .
However , with A - H1N1 , there have been no reported infections of pigs .
In fact , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , A - H1N1 has gene segments from North American swine , bird and human flu strains and a segment from Eurasian swine flu .
Costa Rica , Brazil , and Peru have issued alerts to check all incoming passengers from Mexico at border crossings , airports , and seaports for symptoms of the swine flu .
Meanwhile , in the United States , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has instituted “ passive surveillance ” of travelers entering the country .
Napolitano announced this on Sunday .
On Friday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was too late to contain the swine flu outbreak in the United States .

I received the following email and , since he ’s already done an adequate job describing the… uh … issue at hand …
I ’ll leave it as -is .
I ’m sure you know this but , I doubt if the Douche Bags at Fox News are aware of the real definition of the term “ Tea Bagging ” .
Hannity and Cavuto et/al , ca n’t wait to promote and take part in the big Tea Bag Celebrations taking place on 4/15 .
If you ask any red blooded , beer drinking , American guy , ( under the age of 30 ) , you ’ll most likely learn that “ Tea Bagging ” really means ( the usually drunken ) act of dragging one ’s Sweaty , Hairy , Scrotum over the unsuspecting face of a passed out or , sleeping person !
I hope you ’ll share this actual definition with your audience before 4/15 .
It will put next week ’s events in a proper perspective .
Keep up the great work !

Former Merrill Lynch CEO John
Thain was ordered by a New York court to testify on Tuesday on bonuses paid out to Merrill executives just before the brokerage giant merged with Bank of America .
The decision , by a state Supreme Court judge , came after New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo filed a motion Monday saying that Thain , who was ousted shortly after the merger , had refused to provide more information about the compensation .
Cuomo's office alleged that Thain did n't answer the questions under instructions from Bank of America , and as a result , the bank is interfering with its investigation of the bonus payments .
Cuomo has been investigating $ 3.6 billion in bonuses Merrill Lynch executives received less than a month before the company completed its sale to Charlotte , N.C. - based Bank of America , and whether investors were properly informed about Merrill 's finances .
The payments came as New York - based Merrill was on the brink of reporting a more than $ 15 billion fourth - quarter loss .
The investment bank was among the hardest hit by the ongoing credit crisis .
The bonuses stirred controversy because Merrill 's bigger than expected loss prompted Bank of America to seek more government bailout money to complete the acquisition .
The government agreed to give Bank of America an additional $ 20 billion in January to absorb Merrill .
Merrill set those bonuses Dec. 8 , according to the court filing .
At the time Merrill set the bonuses , it had anticipated losses that were $ 7 billion less than what its actual results eventually were , the filing said .
Despite the actual results , the bonus pool was not altered , according to the filing .
During his deposition Thursday , Thain indicated Bank of America was deeply involved in paying out the Merrill bonuses .
Earlier this month , Cuomo subpoenaed Bank of America 's chairman and chief executive Ken Lewis , as he investigates the timing of the bonuses .
Last month , Cuomo subpoenaed Thain and Bank of America 's chief administrative officer , J. Steele Alphin .
When questioned about the Merrill bonuses during Congressional testimony Feb. 11 , Lewis said he had " very limited " involvement in the decision making regarding the payments .
Lewis said : " We had no authority to tell them what to do to .
Just urge them what to do .
We did urge . "
Bank of America has also repeatedly said that Merrill Lynch was an independent company last year , and its board of directors had ultimate approval over how much to pay employees .
Lewis testified before a Congressional committee along with other banking executives whose firms have received funds from the government .
The government helped orchestrate the acquisition of Merrill by Bank of America over the same weekend in September that another investment bank , Lehman Brothers , went under , setting off the most intense period of the financial crisis .

Mr Fujimori's trial was suspended several times due to his poor health Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has been sentenced to 25 years in jail for ordering killings and kidnappings by security forces .
At the end of a 15 - month trial , judges found him guilty of two death - squad killings of 25 people during the conflict with guerrillas in the 1990s .
After being sentenced , Mr Fujimori said he would appeal against the verdict .
Human rights group Amnesty International described the verdict as " a milestone in the fight for justice " .
" Justice has been done in Peru .
This is an historic day , " said the group 's spokesman , Javier Zuniga .
" It is not every day when a former head of state is convicted for human rights violations such as torture , kidnapping and enforced disappearances .
" We hope that it is just the first of many trials in both Latin America and throughout the world . "
Abuse of power Mr Fujimori is already serving a six - year term after being found guilty in 2007 on separate charges of abuse of power .
The trial , which took place at a special - forces police base on the outskirts of the capital , Lima , was the first time a democratically elected Latin American leader had been tried and found guilty in his own country for human rights abuses .
Outside the base , anti-Fujimori activists clashed with his supporters , attacking each other with sticks , fists and stones before being separated by riot police .
In reading the court 's ruling , Chief Judge Cesar San Martin said the charges were proven beyond all reasonable doubt .
Correspondents say Mr Fujimori apparently anticipated a guilty verdict .
He sat alone taking notes as the verdict was read out .
FUJIMORI CHARGES 1991 Barrios Altos killings : 15 dead 1992 La Cantuta killings : 10 dead 1992 illegal detention : journalist Gustavo Gorriti and businessman Samuel Dyer Separate trial on corruption and illegal wiretapping charges
Head to head : Fujimori verdict Profile : Alberto Fujimori
As the televised " mega trial " neared its end last Friday , the former leader told the court that the charges against him were exaggerated and motivated by revenge .
There was no proof , he said , that he had overseen a death squad as part of a " dirty war " against suspected Maoist Shining Path guerrillas in the early 1990s .
" I completely reject that I gave any orders in an allegedly parallel system to put into practice a dirty war to defeat terrorism , " he said .
The trial heard from about 80 witnesses in more than 150 court sessions .
The prosecution argued that Mr Fujimori authorised the counter - insurgency actions of a death squad known as La Colina that killed 25 people in 1991 and 1992 .
Mr Fujimori was also found guilty of ordering the brief abduction of a journalist and a businessman .
Some Peruvians remain vocal in their support for the former president Mr Fujimori 's decade in power came to a dramatic end in November 2000 when he fled to his parents ' native Japan in the wake of a bribery scandal involving his intelligence chief .
He spent five years in self - imposed exile in Japan before flying to Chile in 2005 where he was arrested .
Two years later he was extradited to Peru to stand trial .
Proceedings over the past 15 months have frequently been held up because of Mr Fujimori 's poor health .
However , correspondents say Mr Fujimori is still a political figure .
Have Your Say
Why does a president who strategically fought and defeated terrorism get jailed ?
Eder Medina , Lima , Peru
He is popular among those Peruvians who credit him with saving the country from rebel insurgency and economic collapse .
He also has 13 supporters in Peru 's 120 - member congress , among them his daughter Keiko .
She has not formally announced her candidature for the 2011 elections .
But the 33 - year - old was the front - runner in a recent Lima - based opinion poll .
She has said she would not hesitate to pardon her father if she became Peru 's president .

The tent - city in Sacramento , the capital of California , is so big and entrenched that the city is debating installing plumbing and other amenities .
Meanwhile Sacramento's vacancy rate is higher than the national average : " 10.4 percent of rental housing units are vacant and 4.8 percent of owned units are vacant . "
The primitive settlement sits in the shadow of the state capitol and is home to about 300 people who have no toilets or running water , creating unsanitary conditions that advocacy groups worry could promote diseases like cholera .
With the downturn in the economy and more working - class people losing their jobs and their homes , the tent city is expanding .
The mayor of Sacramento , Kevin Johnson , said in an interview that he wants to create a permanent tent city for the homeless , although he is not sure where it should be .
He said he recognized that doing so would be difficult politically .
But he said a permanent site could bring sanitation services and regulations like a ban on drugs and alcohol .
How to Make Electricity From Wasted Energy
March 12th , 2009 by Sarah Lozanova
Energy efficiency is low hanging fruit in the clean energy movement .
Low - grade waste heat may not have the allure of shiny solar panels or a row of wind turbines , but it presents an opportunity that is too good for Michael Newell , CEO of Ener - G - Rotors to pass up .
The company is developing a product that generates electricity from low - grade waste heat .
“ We are making electricity from a free fuel and not using a fossil fuel , ” Michael Newell said this week in an interview with TriplePundit .
“ Every kilowatt you are generating from our system is a kilowatt you do n’t need from fossil fuels . ”
The generator is fed with hot water , steam , or steam condensate between 150 and 400 degrees F .
There are currently other products on the market that are suitable for higher temperature applications , but the low - grade waste heat market has been largely untapped .
Not surprisingly , Ener - G- Rotors received an award for the Most Promising Technology last week at the CleanTech Forum XXI in San Francisco .
The 5 kw unit is currently in the beta phase .
The company hopes the product will be complete at the end of the year and then they can ramp up production next year .
They also plan to scale - up to a 50 kw product for industrial use , which the company wants to deploy next year .
Eventually the products may range in size from 1 to 150 kw in capacity and be suitable for a variety of settings , from residential to industrial applications .
Large - scale Applications
Chemical manufacturing plants , combined heat and power plants , paper mills , and oil and gas companies commonly have low - grade heat as a by - product .
This energy goes to waste or in the worst - case scenario the company pays to cool it .
Michael Newell estimates that 15 to 20 percent of all the energy used in the US is lost just to low - grade waste heat .
This presents a wonderful opportunity that is too good to pass up .
Ener - G-Rotors expects their 50 kw product to have a payback period of less than three years for most applications .
Installation is relatively simple and maintenance is minimal .
Small - scale Applications
This product is compatible with solar thermal or geothermal installations and will likely be manufactured in 1 to 5 kw sizes .
The payback period for smaller applications will be much longer than in industrial - scale applications , with off - grid use as a possible exception .
The Technology
“ We bring heat into a heat exchanger , where there is a working fluid , a refrigerant , ” explains Michael Newell .
“ The heat boils that refrigerant .
We take the energy from the heat source coming in and transfer it to the refrigerant and that goes to the expander .
The energy causes rotary motion that drives the generator .
The working fluid is cooled back to a liquid . ”
Organic rankine cycle technology is not new .
The first prototype was displayed by Israeli scientists in 1961 .
Michael Newell said that the innovation that Ener - G - Rotors brings is efficiency , durability , and more favorable economics .
Good timing is always a key component for a product coming to the market .
Although the cost of energy has dipped and many companies are not eager to spend money right now , companies are still happy to save energy .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Workers who surf the web online can relax - employees who regularly sneak a peek at Facebook or shop online during office hours could actually be more productive .
Melbourne University 's Dr Brent Coker says workers who surf the internet for leisure , known as ' Workplace Internet Leisure Browsing ' ( WILB ) , are more productive than those who do n't .
A study of 300 employees found 70 per cent of people who used the internet at work engaged in WILB .
" People who do surf the internet for fun at work – within a reasonable limit of less than 20 per cent of their total time in the office – are more productive by about nine per cent than those who don't , " said Dr Coker , from the university 's Department of Management and Marketing .
" Firms spend millions on software to block their employees from watching videos on YouTube , using social networking sites like Facebook or shopping online under the pretence that it costs millions in lost productivity .
However that 's not always the case . "
Reading online news sites and searching for product information were rated among the most popular WILB activities , while playing online games and watching YouTube movies also ranked high .
And if workers need an excuse for the lapse , they can put it down to a lack of concentration .
" People need to zone out for a bit to get back their concentration .
Think back to when you were in class listening to a lecture – after about 20 minutes your concentration probably went right down , yet after a break your concentration was restored , " Dr Coker said .
" It 's the same in the workplace .
" Short and unobtrusive breaks , such as a quick surf of the internet , enables the mind to rest itself , leading to a higher total net concentration for a day 's work , and as a result , increased productivity . "
But he warned excessive time spent surfing the internet could have the reverse effect .
" Approximately 14 per cent of internet users in Australia show signs of internet addiction – they do n't take breaks at appropriate times , they spend more than a `normal ' amount of time online , and can get irritable if they are interrupted while surfing .
" WILB is not as helpful for this group of people – those who behave with internet addiction tendencies will have a lower productivity than those without . "
Nothing is possible without lunch
So Aman Gupta ( tmm1 ) and I were eating lunch at the Oaxacan Kitchen on Tuesday and as usual , we were talking about scaling Ruby .
We got into a small debate about which phase of garbage collection took the most CPU time .
Aman ’s claim :
The mark phase , specifically the stack marking phase because of the huge stack frames created by rb_eval
My claim :
The sweep phase , because every single object has to be touched and some freeing happens .
I told Aman that I did n’t believe the stack frames were that large , and we bet on how big we thought they would be .
Could n’t be more than a couple kilobytes , could it ?
Little did we know how wrong our estimates were .
Quick note about Ruby’s GC
Ruby MRI has a mark - and - sweep garbage collector .
As part of the mark phase , it scans the process stack .
This is required because a pointer to a Ruby object can be passed to a C extension ( like Eventmachine , or Hpricot , or whatever ) .
If that happens , it is n’t safe to free the object yet .
So Ruby does a simple scan and checks if each word on the stack is a pointer to the Ruby heap , if so , that item can not be freed .
GDB to the rescue
We get back from lunch , launch our application , attach GDB and set a breakpoint .
The breakpoint gets triggered and we see this seemingly innocuous stack trace [ Note :
To help with debugging , we compiled the EventMachine gem with - fno - omit - frame - pointer ] :

Looks pretty normal , nothing to worry about , right ?
We started checking the rb_eval frames because we assumed that those would be the largest stack frames .
The rb_eval function inlines other functions and call itself recursively .
So how big is one of the rb_eval frames ?
( gdb ) frame 10
# 10 0x00000000004150b7 in rb_eval ( self=26066936 , n=0x1941018 ) at eval .
c:3357
3357 result = rb_eval ( self , node -> nd_head ) ;
( gdb ) p $rbp-$rsp
$ 2 = 1904
1,904 bytes – pretty large .
If all the stack frames are that large , we are looking at around 47,600 bytes .
Pretty serious .
Let ’s verify that Ruby thinks the stack is a sane size .
There is a global in the Ruby interpreter called rb_gc_stack_start .
It gets set when the Ruby stack is created in Init_stack ( ) .
When Ruby calculates the stack size it subtracts the current stack pointer from rb_gc_stack_start [ remember on x86_64 , the stack grows from high addresses to low addresses ] .
Let ’s do that and see how big Ruby thinks the stack is .
( gdb ) p ( unsigned int)rb_gc_stack_start - ( unsigned int)$rsp
$ 3 = 802688
Wait , wait , wait .
802,688 bytes with only 23 stack frames ?
WTF ?!
Something is wrong .
We started at the top and checked all the rb_eval stack frames , but none of them are larger than 2 kb .
We did find something quite a bit larger than 2 kb , though .
( gdb ) frame 1
# 1 0x00007ffff6c0b220 in EventMachine_t::_RunEpollOnce ( this=0x158d7e0 ) at em.cpp:461
461 s = epoll_wait ( epfd , ev , MaxEpollDescriptors , timeout == 0 ? 5 : timeout ) ;
( gdb ) p $rbp-$rsp
$ 28 = 786816
Uh , the RunEpollOnce stack frame is 786,816 bytes ?
That ’s got to be wrong .
WTF ?
Time to bring out the big guns .
objdump + x86_64 asm FTW
I pumped EventMachine ’s shared object into objdump and captured the assembly dump :
objdump -d rubyeventmachine .so > em.S
I headed down to the RunEpollOnce function and saw the following :
2f12b : 48 81 ec 78 01 0c 00 sub $ 0xc0178, %rsp
Interesting .
So the code is moving %rsp down by 786,808 bytes to make room for something big .
So , let ’s see if the EventMachine code matches up with the assembly output .
struct epoll_event ev [ MaxEpollDescriptors ] ;
Where MaxEpollDescriptors = 64*1024 and sizeof ( struct epoll_event ) == 12 .
That matches up with the assembly dump and the GDB output .
Usually , doing something like that in C / C++ is ( usually ) OK .
Avoiding the heap whenever you can is a good idea because you avoid heap - lock contention , fragmenting the heap , and memory overhead for tracking the memory region .
When writing Ruby extensions , this is n’t necessarily true .
Remember , Ruby ’s GC algorithm scans the entire process stack searching for references to Ruby objects .
This EventMachine code causes Ruby to search an extra ~ 800,000 bytes drastically slowing down garbage collection .
The patch
Get the patch HERE
The patch simply moves the stack allocated struct epoll_event ev to the class definition so that it is allocated on the heap when an instance of the class is created with new .
This does not change the memory usage of the process at all .
It just moves the object off the stack .
This makes all the difference because Ruby ’s GC scans the process stack and not the process heap .
On top of all that , this patch helps with Ruby ’s green threads , too .
If the epoll_wait causes a Ruby event to fire and that event creates a Ruby thread , that Ruby thread gets an entire copy of the existing stack .
Each time that thread is switched into and out of , that thread stack has to be memcpy ’d into and out of place .
Reducing those memcpys by ~ 800,000 bytes is a HUGE performance win .
Want to learn more about threading implementations ?
Check out my threading models post : here .
Fixing this turned out to be pretty simple .
A six ( 6 !!) line patch :
Speeds up GC by 2 - 3 x because of the huge decrease in stack frame size .
because of the decrease in stack frame size .
Fixes an open bug in EventMachine where using threads with Epoll causes lots of slowness .
The reason is that each thread will inherit an ~ 800,000 byte stack that gets copied in and out every context switch .
that gets copied in and out .
This results in an increase from 500 requests / sec to 7000 requests / sec when using Sinatra + Thin +Epoll + Threads .
That is pretty ill .
Conclusion
All in all , a productive debugging session lasting about an hour .
The result was a simple patch , with 2 big performance improvements .
A couple things to take away from this experience :
Spend time learning your debugging tools because it pays off , especially nm , objdump , and of course GDB .
, , and of course .
Getting familiar with x86_64 assembly is crucial if you hope to debug complex software and optimize it correctly .

Hijack suspect lived a life , or a lie - 9/25/01
Although a Brooklyn apartment lease from 1995 - 1996 bears Ziad Jarrah 's name - and landlords there have identified his photograph - his family insists he was in Beirut at the time .
How was he in Brooklyn and Lebanon at the same time ?
.. two days before the hijacking , his nephew called and told the family he'd be coming home for a cousin 's wedding in mid-September .
" He said he had even bought a new suit for the occasion . "

The CIA suspected Ziad Jarrah had been in Afghanistan and wanted him questioned because of " his suspected involvement in terrorist activities , " UAE sources said .
A CIA spokesman vigorously denied that the CIA knew anything about Jarrah before September 11 or had anything do with his questioning in Dubai .

Many of the investigators believe that some of the initial clues that were uncovered about the terrorists ' identities and preparations , such as flight manuals , were meant to be found .
A former high - level intelligence official told me , " Whatever trail was left was left deliberately - - for the F.B.I. to chase . "
In interviews over the past two weeks , a number of intelligence officials have raised questions about Osama bin Laden 's capabilities .
" This guy sits in a cave in Afghanistan and he 's running this operation ? " one C.I.A. official asked .
" It 's so huge .
He could n't have done it alone . "
A senior military officer told me that because of the visas and other documentation needed to infiltrate team members into the United States , a major foreign intelligence service might also have been involved .

Tracing Trail Of Hijackers - By Thomas Frank - 9/23/01
At Freeway Airport in Bowie , Md. , 20 miles west of Washington , flight instructor Sheri Baxter instantly recognized the name of alleged hijacker Hani Hanjour when the FBI released a list of 19 suspects in the four hijackings .
Hanjour , the only suspect on Flight 77 the FBI listed as a pilot , had come to the airport one month earlier seeking to rent a small plane ....
However , when Baxter and fellow instructor Ben Conner took .... Hanjour on three test runs during the second week of August , they found he had trouble controlling and landing the single - engine Cessna 172 .
..... chief flight instructor Marcel Bernard declined to rent him a plane without more lessons .

The plane circled 270 degrees to the right to approach the Pentagon from the west , whereupon Flight 77 fell below radar level , vanishing from controllers ' screens , the sources said ....
Aviation sources said the plane was flown with extraordinary skill , making it highly likely that a trained pilot was at the helm ...
Someone even knew how to turn off the transponder , a move that is considerably less than obvious .

The S.Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants
Restaurant magazine has just released the 2009 list of the World 's 50 Best Restaurants .
The awards were based on 4,185 votes cast by 837 restaurant critics , chefs , restaurateurs and other qualified restaurant experts .
You can see more about the voting process on the website Ferran Adria ’s culinary mecca , El Bulli , and Heston Blumenthal 's Fat Duck restaurant once again top the list .
Michelin 3 - star restaurant , Restaurant Gordon Ramsay , owned by the Hell 's Kitchen chef , failed to make the top 100 which is surprising since it was 13th on the list last year .
Thomas Keller 's flagship restaurant dropped 7 notches to # 12 and was beat out by it 's New York cousin , Per Se , which took 6th place .
Grant Achatz from Chicago breaks into the top 10 with Alinea .
Manresa squeaked in at # 93 .
The United States had 8 restaurants in the top 50 and 12 restaurants in the top 100 .
Not bad when you consider this list of compiled of the greatest restaurants in the world and is bound to have a slight European bend .
This can probably best be seen in the fact that Les Creations de Narisawa was the first Japanese restaurant to make the list , yet Japan racked up an insanely high number of Michelin stared restaurants last year .

Wilmington
Climate
Delaware is the second smallest state in the country , but its narrow borders hold significant diversity .
During the American Civil War , the citizens of Delaware were split in their loyalties , and even today , the state seems to have two distinct identities , one taking its cue from the industrious North , the other following the relaxed pace of the South .
In northern Delaware , the rolling , wooded hills of the Brandywine Valley provide a captivating backdrop to the state 's colonial history , refined elegance and industrial prominence .
It was here that the du Pont family built its empire , harnessing the river for gunpowder mills in 1802 .
But the du Pont legacy includes a commitment to the community as well .
It lives on today in the mansions , gardens , museums , libraries and parks established by the family over the years and now open for visitors to enjoy .
Wilmington is Delaware 's largest city , which grew along with the du Ponts ' fortunes .
It and nearby upmarket towns like Hockessin and Greenville offer the smart shops and boutiques , trendy nightspots , historic pubs and excellent restaurants - Mediterranean cuisine is a specialty , due to the city 's large Italian community - visitors would expect from bigger cities on the northern East Coast .
Most residents of Wilmington and its surrounding areas identify with their northern neighbors .
It is not unusual to hear them describe themselves as living not in Delaware but ' just south of Philadelphia ' .
Central and southern Delaware have a decidedly different flavor .
Small towns are surrounded by farmland .
Charming bed and breakfasts take the place of grand hotels .
In Dover , the quiet state capital , visitors might see Amish buggies traveling alongside regular traffic .
A strong connection with the environment is apparent , as outdoorsmen revel in waterfowl hunting and fishermen take advantage of the many inlets and tidal marshes that crisscross the region .
The sandy beaches along the Atlantic Ocean are popular destinations and cater to all tastes , from sleepy Bethany Beach with its large family homes to livelier Rehoboth with its boardwalk and outlet shopping malls - even more enticing , as Delaware is sales - tax free .
Delaware has a humid and temperate climate with hot and humid summers and cold winters .
Summer months are also the wettest with August receiving the most rainfall .
Winters are dry , but cold with snow .
The southern part of the state is generally milder than the north .
Wilmington has undergone a revitalization in recent years , and though business is perhaps still the main attraction , there are pockets in and around the downtown area that are well worth a visit , beginning with the Riverfront on the Christina River .
Visitors can stroll along a waterfront path leading to the Shipyard Shops , the rowing center and various restaurants and museums .
The city comprises many distinct neighborhoods , and for those seeking a less touristy experience , Trolley Square is an excellent option .
It 's full of shady sidewalk cafés , cosy bistros and lively pubs , including Kelly 's Logan House , a local institution since 1864 and the only place to be on St Patrick 's Day .
Stately old homes and restored townhouses surround the area .
Not far away is Little Italy , home to Mrs Robino's , one of the city 's oldest and most popular spots for authentic Italian food .
During the summer , the best way to cool off is with a treat from one of the historic community 's countless Italian water ice stands .
For many visitors , the most appealing attractions lie just outside city limits , in the beautiful Brandywine Valley .
The area is a horticultural delight , with endless gardens and arboretums , as well as the ' American castles ' of the du Pont family , including Winterthur and Nemours , magnificently preserved and packed with artwork and antiques . :
Wilmington has hot and humid summers , but winters are usually mild , averaging 32 °F ( 0 °C ) in January , the coldest month .
Snowfall is light and often mixed with rain and sleet meaning that it melts quite quickly .
Summer months experience about 75 percent humidity and are the wettest time of year , usually with thunderstorms .
Mircrosoft founder Bill Gates has resumed his title as the world 's richest
The financial crisis is taking its toll on the world 's richest people , wiping 332 names off Forbes magazine 's " rich list " of world billionaires .
Just 793 people can now lay claim to a place on the list , but on average they have lost 23 % of their wealth .
The stock market collapse helped Microsoft founder Bill Gates regain the top spot , despite his wealth declining $ 18 bn ( £ 13.06 bn ) to $ 40bn .
He ousted investor Warren Buffet , whose fortune declined by $ 25 bn to $ 37bn .
In 2008 , Mr Buffet had managed to end Bill Gates ' 13 - year reign at the top as shares in his firm Berkshire Hathaway surged to a record of $ 150,000 per share just before Forbes formulated its 2008 ultra-rich list .
Declining fortunes
However , the financial crisis has since taken its toll on Berkshire Hathaway , with its share value sinking 50 % over the past 12 months .
BILLIONAIRES IN 2009 Total number : 793 ( 1,125 in 2008 )
Net worth : $ 2.4tn ( $ 4.4tn in 2008 ) Women : 72 ( 99 in 2008 ) Average age : 63.7 ( 61 in 2008 )
Youngest billionaires lose money Mexican ' drug lord ' on rich list Indian businessman Anil Ambani experienced the biggest reversal of fortunes , slipping to number 34 on the list from number six last year , as his net worth sank by $ 31.9 bn to $ 10.1 bn .
The declining health of the world economy meant that to make the top 20 on the Forbes list this year a net worth of just $ 14bn was needed - compared with $ 21bn in 2008 .
And in the past year , only 44 people on the list managed to increase their fortunes , compared with 656 who lost money .
Mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg was the only member of the top 20 who managed to increase his net worth .
His wealth rose by $ 4.5 bn after a re-evaluation of his financial data firm Bloomberg LP .
Discount success
But the credit crunch did prove to be a boon for some names on the rich list , with nine out of the top 20 boosting their fortunes from discount retailing .
Japan 's Tadashi Yanai , founder of budget retailer Uniqlo , was one of the few newcomers to the 2009 list entering it at number 76 with a net worth of $ 6bn .
Meanwhile German Karl Albrecht moved up from number 10 to number six as his supermarket chain Aldi cashed in on its cut price credentials .
His rise in position came despite the fact that Mr Albrecht 's net worth in absolute terms declined to $ 21.5 bn from $ 27bn last year .
Regional shifts
In the regional stakes , countries like India and Russia lost ground this year to the US , which reasserted its dominance over the world 's wealthy elite .
The three richest men in India all saw their fortunes plummet by more than half , while Russian billionaires lost a total of $ 369bn between them .
US citizens now lay claim to 10 of the top 20 spots - up from four last year - while the US is also the country with the most billionaires .
As a result New York has also toppled Moscow as home to the most names on the rich list with 55 billionaires .
The Russian capital itself has slipped to third place , with 27 members on the list , while London has edged into second place with 28 billionaires .

A prominent Massachusetts anesthesiologist allegedly fabricated 21 medical studies that claimed to show benefits from painkillers like Vioxx and Celebrex , according to the hospital where he worked .
Baystate Medical Center , Springfield , Mass. , said that its former chief of acute pain , Scott S. Reuben , had faked data used in the studies , which were published in several anesthesiology journals between 1996 and 2008 .
The ...
Israel 's second - ranking military officer admitted Wednesday the army made mistakes that caused civilian deaths during the January Gaza war against Hamas , but he reiterated the Army 's assertion that it did not violate international conventions on warfare .
Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen .
Dan Harel said the Army will forward to Israel 's military prosecutor and the attorney general the findings of an internal inquiry into accusations of illegal use of white phosphorous munitions , targeting humanitarian and civilian infrastructure .
" We found a very small amount of cases where we had operational or intelligence mistakes during the fighting , " General Harel told journalists attending a briefing at the military 's national headquarters .
Still , Harel insisted , the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) " conducted itself in the Cast Lead operation under international rules of law . "
The briefing was an attempt to address charges at home and abroad of war crimes .
Palestinians and human rights groups allege that the Army used disproportionate force in Gaza 's densely packed residential areas that left more than 1,000 Palestinians dead , thousands more injured , and a swath of physical destruction .
The UN is investigating some of the charges , and the International Court of Justice is mulling its own inquiry .
Human rights lawyers abroad have said they are planning to introduce lawsuits in European domestic courts willing to exercise principles of universal jurisdiction over accusations of war crimes in third - party countries .
On Wednesday , six Norwegian lawyers said they were planning to bring charges of war crimes against former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and other top officials , according to Agence France - Presse .
Army :
We hit 1,400 Hamas targets
The Army said the deadliest error occurred Jan. 6 when Israeli soldiers killed 21 civilians who were taking cover in a house .
The soldiers mistook the house for a nearby weapons storehouse .
Harel said the mix - up was due to an " intelligence mistake , " but insisted that the Army successfully identified some 1,400 Hamas other targets during the war .
In a reiteration of the military 's defense of the civilian toll at the time of the fighting , Harel said Hamas was to blame for the destruction for booby - trapping residences and hunkering down near hospitals .
Israeli human rights organizations disputed the findings and called on the government to cooperate with independent human rights groups seeking to investigate the war .
Military commentators have reported that the Army used overwhelming firepower inside Gaza for fear that a high casualty rate among its own soldiers would sap support among the Israeli public for the offensive .
" The doctrine of using extreme armed force was a doctrine set from above , " says Sarit Michaeli , the spokeswoman of the human rights watchdog B'tselem .
She adds that the military inquiry " is not the correct forum to conduct this investigation " into accountability .
Inquiries at home and abroad
Israel so far has refused to cooperate with a UN fact - finding team to investigate the war on both sides of the Israel - Gaza divide .
The Army denied accusations that it illegally used artillery shells with the incendiary white phosphorous agent against civilian areas .
While saying it launched white phosphorous shells into open areas to target its fire , the military also acknowledged using smoke bombs that scattered fragments with small amounts of phosphorous over civilian areas .
The munitions were used to obscure forces and did n't endanger civilians .
" I can not buy it after being on the receiving end , " said Eyad Sarraj , the director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Program .
" I felt it .
I sniffed the white phosphorous in my house .
My children almost suffocated by it . "
Human rights and international news groups have documented medical experts who assert that numerous Gazans were injured by white phosphorous burns .
During the war , accusations that Israel used excessive force against third - party civilians in Gaza instead of Hamas militants helped erode the initial understanding internationally of Israel 's opening response to continued rocket fire from the Gaza Strip at southern Israeli towns and cities .
Last month , Israel 's military prosecutor opened and then closed an inquiry into the testimony of several war veterans who claimed that soldiers had fired indiscriminately on noncombatants .
The stories were dismissed by the Army as " hearsay . "
The Army says it is investigating additional allegations of misconduct , but it 's unclear whether the military prosecutor will open its own inquiry or even press charges .
Israel said it destroyed 636 residential buildings over the course of the war .
Palestinians say about 4,000 structures were destroyed and some $ 2 billion in damage was caused .
The Army also reiterated that about 1,100 Gazans were killed , about 70 percent of whom were identified as Hamas operatives .
Palestinians say the number was about 1,400 and that only 30 percent of the casualties were militants .
Israel also was accused of targeting UN installations and humanitarian workers , though some of those claims were dropped .
Israel still is grappling with the international fallout from the war .
The Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday that Britain will review all weapons shipments to Israel following the war .
California has more than a 99 % chance of having a magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquake within the next 30 years , according scientists using a new model to determine the probability of big quakes .
The likelihood of a major quake of magnitude 7.5 or greater in the next 30 years is 46 % - and such a quake is most likely to occur in the southern half of the state .
The new study determined the probabilities that different parts of California will experience earthquake ruptures of various magnitudes .
The new statewide probabilities are the result of a model that comprehensively combines information from seismology , earthquake geology , and geodesy ( measuring precise locations on the Earth 's surface ) .
For the first time , probabilities for California having a large earthquake in the next 30 years can be forecast statewide .
" This new , comprehensive forecast advances our understanding of earthquakes and pulls together existing research with new techniques and data , " explained USGS geophysicist and lead scientist Ned Field .
" Planners , decision makers and California residents can use this information to improve public safety and mitigate damage before the next destructive earthquake occurs . "
The new information is being provided to decision makers who establish local building codes , earthquake insurance rates , and emergency planning and will assist in more accurate planning for inevitable future large earthquakes .
The official earthquake forecasts , known as the " Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast ( UCERF ) , " were developed by a multidisciplinary group of scientists and engineers , known as the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities .
Building on previous studies , the Working Group updated and developed the first - ever statewide , comprehensive model of California .
advertisement
The organizations sponsoring the Working Group include the U.S. Geological Survey , the California Geological Survey and the Southern California Earthquake Center .
An independent scientific review panel , as well as the California and National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Councils , have evaluated the new UCERF study .
The consensus of the scientific community on forecasting California earthquakes allows for meaningful comparisons of earthquake probabilities in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area , as well as comparisons among several large faults .
The probability of a magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquake over the next 30 years striking the greater Los Angeles area is 67 % , and in the San Francisco Bay Area it is 63 % , similar to previous Bay Area estimates .
For the entire California region , the fault with the highest probability of generating at least one magnitude 6.7 quake or larger is the southern San Andreas ( 59 % in the next 30 years ) .
For northern California , the most likely source of such earthquakes is the Hayward - Rodgers Creek Fault ( 31 % in the next 30 years ) .
Such quakes can be deadly , as shown by the 1989 magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta and the 1994 magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquakes .
Earthquake probabilities for many parts of the state are similar to those in previous studies , but the new probabilities calculated for the Elsinore and San Jacinto Faults in southern California are about half those previously determined .
For the far northwestern part of the State , a major source of earthquakes is the offshore 750 - mile - long Cascadia Subduction Zone , the southern part of which extends about 150 miles into California .
For the next 30 years there is a 10 % probability of a magnitude 8 to 9 quake somewhere along that zone .
Such quakes occur about once every 500 years on average .
The new model does not estimate the likelihood of shaking ( seismic hazard ) that would be caused by quakes .
Even areas in the state with a low probability of fault rupture could experience shaking and damage from distant , powerful quakes .
The U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) is incorporating the UCERF into its official estimate of California 's seismic hazard , which in turn will be used to update building codes .
Other subsequent studies will add information on the vulnerability of manmade structures to estimate expected losses , which is called " seismic risk . "
In these ways , the UCERF will help to increase public safety and community resilience to earthquake hazards .
The results of the UCERF study serve as a reminder that all Californians live in earthquake country and should be prepared .
Although earthquakes cannot be prevented , the damage they do can be greatly reduced through prudent planning and preparedness .
The ongoing work of the Southern California Earthquake Center , USGS , California Geological Survey , and other scientists in evaluating earthquake probabilities is part of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program 's efforts to safeguard lives and property from the future quakes that are certain to strike in California and elsewhere in the United States .

" The Boy Scouts were green before it was cool to be green , " said national spokesman Deron Smith .
But in recent decades , local Boy Scout councils around the nation have ordered clear - cutting or other high - impact logging on tens of thousands of acres of forestland they own , often in a quest for a different kind of green : cash .
A Hearst Newspapers investigation has found dozens of cases in which the scouts ordered the logging of prime woodlands or sold them to big timber interests and developers , turning quick money instead of seeking ways to save the trees .
" In public , they say they want to teach kids about saving the environment , " said Jane Childers , a longtime scouting volunteer in Washington state who has fought against scouts ' logging .
" But in reality , it 's all about the money . "
Scout councils nationwide have hired loggers to carry out clear - cutting and salvage harvests in ecosystems that provided habitat for a host of protected species , including salmon , timber wolves , bald eagles and spotted owls , records show .
At times , the scout councils have logged or sold wild properties that had been bequeathed specifically for use as scout camps .
In some cases , councils have sought revenues from logging or land sales to make up for funding lost because of the organization 's controversial bans on gays and atheists .
" The Boy Scouts had to suffer the consequences for sticking by their moral values , " said Eugene Grant , president of the Portland , Ore. , Cascade Pacific Council 's board of directors .
" There 's no question " that the Scouts ' anti-gay , anti-atheist stance has cost the organization money , he said .
As a result , he said , " every council has looked at ways to generate funds ... and logging is one of them . "
The scouts insist they manage the wild lands they own with sensitivity and care .
But the investigation - a nationwide review by five newspapers of more than 400 timber harvests , court papers , property records , tax filings and other documents since 1990 - also found that :
-- Scout councils have ordered the logging of more than 34,000 acres of forests - perhaps far more , as forestry records nationwide are incomplete .
-- More than 100 scout groups - one - third of all Boy Scouts councils nationwide - have conducted timber harvests .
-- Councils logged in or near protected wildlife habitat at least 53 times .
-- Councils have authorized at least 60 clear - cutting operations and 35 salvage harvests , logging practices that some experts say harm the environment but maximize profits .
A renewable resource
Scout officials generally defended logging as sound land stewardship .
Trees are a renewable resource , said some , and the income from logging is put back into scouting , providing needed funds to underwrite programs and maintain scout camps and other properties .
Forestry records confirm that many councils practice only sustainable forestry .
They selectively log to remove hazard trees , reduce fire risks and improve habitat , records show .
With the help of professional foresters , dozens of councils have implemented long - range management plans to better manage woodlands , records also show .
But the investigation also revealed that some stewardship plans were ignored .
Most scout timber harvests were relatively small - 50 to 100 acres - and occurred mainly in the Western timber states .
But scout councils across the country have authorized logging , Hearst Newspapers found .
" Every time ( a council ) gets a new scout director , they call a state forester to come out and see if there is any good timber to harvest , " said Paul Tauke , Iowa state forester .
" There 's always pressure to make money . "
Some scout councils say they have reluctantly resorted to logging simply to shore up sagging operating budgets .
" I butchered the property , " said Bruce Faller , a district commissioner for a Vermont scout council , describing a 2006 logging operation he ordered for financial reasons .
" It was old , big beautiful wood ... I would n't have done it if there ( were ) any other way . "
26 logging councils
Others unabashedly identify themselves as logging councils that manage scout camps as for - profit tree farms .
The Cascade Pacific Council in Portland , Ore. , and the Andrew Jackson Council in Jackson , Miss. , are among 26 councils nationwide that log camps as tree farms under what they view as sustainable management plans .
" This is pine country , " said Arnold Landry , the Mississippi council executive .
" We cut when it 's best for us to cut .
We replant and ... make the best use of the property . "
Properly managed logging is simply another resource councils can tap , some say , in an era when funding is hard to find .
" People talk about what a bad , evil , horrible thing it is to cut a tree , " said Tim McCandless , executive for the Spokane , Wash. , Inland Northwest Council .
" But our mission is kids , not trees . "
In southwest Washington , along a gravel county road , a denuded hillside piled with logging debris at the Pacific Harbor Council 's Camp Delezene offers testament to how , even amid today 's stagnant timber markets , trees are like gold .
The scout council obtained $ 140,000 by clear - cutting 12 acres of 80 year - old Douglas fir , said scout volunteer Douglas Dorr .
The income allowed the scouts to put a new roof on the old lodge at the camp and make other improvements .
The logging was done by the book , he said .
But a conservation biologist hired by Hearst Newspapers to review the project said the scouts ' logging broke state rules meant to protect endangered salmon in a nearby stream .
" There are blatant rules violations here , " said the consultant , Chris Mendoza .
He said the council failed to leave a buffer zone of trees along the bank of the stream and on the slopes of a hillside - measures that would have protected the stream from mudslides and erosion .
" These were some big , valuable trees , " Mendoza said .
" It looks like they wanted to take as many as possible and broke the rules to do it . "
Council officials disagreed , saying the logging followed all regulations and was thoughtfully planned to minimize impact .
The logging at Camp Delezene was one of several cases in which scouts were criticized for allegedly deviating from environmental laws , forestry rules or rules written into logging plans .
" It pays to do that , " said Mendoza , who has worked for timber corporations and also serves on a state forest practices committee .
" Some landowners are more prone to bending the rules , because if they get away with it , it can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars . "
Smith , the Boy Scouts national spokesman , says the scouts are not just out to make a buck at the environment 's expense .
The scouts are " good stewards of their resources , " he said .
Funding scout programs
Among nonprofit groups , the scouts are perhaps the nation 's biggest landowners , some scout officials say .
How their land is used is largely left up to administrators and volunteer board members running the 304 local scouting councils .
Tapping a council 's assets , such as timber , can help ensure that there 's money to fund scout programs , scout officials say .
In California , scout councils often cited moneymaking as an important goal of logging projects proposed for scout wildlands .
Public records show that the foresters hired by the scouts to log their properties have usually followed California forestry rules .
But critics caution that forestry agencies - even in heavily regulated timber states like California - can be lax in enforcement .
Around the country , critics have complained that logging operations on scout lands were n't conducted as promised .
Logging carried out by the Central Minnesota Council at its Parker Scout Reservation north of St. Cloud in 2005 - 2007 earned the scouts more than $ 100,000 , records show , but it also drew complaints .
One neighbor said she thought the project would be low - impact .
" I have watched with horror the devastation being exacted on the camp , " neighbor Mary Novakowski wrote to a state forester .
" The equipment being used has moved through the forest crushing many small trees that might have had a chance to benefit from the open canopy . "
Logging at Virginia 's Pipsico Scout Reservation led to a " direct discharge " of sediment into a pond and Chesapeake Bay , degrading waters and harming fish , a consultant 's report said .
On a remote hillside in the Siskiyou National Forest in southwest Oregon , the McCaleb Scout Ranch overlooks the pristine Illinois River , an unobstructed stream with wild runs of salmon and steelhead .
Salvage logging
Officially declared a state Scenic Waterway in 1970 , the Illinois made the nation 's list of Wild and Scenic Rivers in 1984 .
Nevertheless , the Crater Lake Council conducted widespread logging at its camp after the huge Biscuit Fire in 2002 .
More than six years later , a massive mound of logging debris remained piled on a ravine 's edge above the protected salmon stream .
" They savagely logged it , " Roy Keene , a former timber industry forester - turned - activist , said of the scout camp .
Council officials say that after the wildfire , they simply salvaged what revenues they could from the scorched but still valuable timber at the camp .
They used the revenue - $ 67,000 - to rebuild camp buildings lost in the fire .
But a growing number of forestry experts say such post - catastrophe logging is ecologically harmful .
The case is among at least 35 salvage harvests conducted by scouting groups nationwide since 1990 , Hearst found .
" Salvage logging is almost never a positive for ecological recovery , " said Jerry Franklin , professor of ecosystem analysis for the University of Washington 's College of Forestry .
" It is done to salvage economic values . "
Recent scout - pursued salvage harvests have occurred in Georgia , California , New York , Montana and Pennsylvania after hurricanes , tornadoes , ice storms and insect infestations .
After fires in 1999 and 2002 , the scouts ' National Council conducted by far the largest of scout salvage harvests reviewed - in all , nearly 3,400 acres - at the nation 's premier scouting camp , the Philmont Scout Reservation in New Mexico .
Some critics say the 2002 salvage at the McCaleb Ranch on Oregon 's Illinois River never should have happened anyway .
" The old woman who donated that property to the scouts had entered into an agreement with the state to protect it from logging , " said Keene , senior forester for the Institute of Wildlife Protection
" No trees , shrubs , or brush shall be destroyed , cut , or removed from the restricted area without a written permit from ( the state ) , " according to the 1974 easement signed by the donor , the late Betty McCaleb .
Nevertheless , the state gave the scout council permission to cut all " fire - killed trees of merchantable size " from the 106 - acre ranch just a couple weeks after the fire burned across it .
Jan Houck , a parks official who approved the plan , said such logging " is n't necessarily prohibited " under the easement , " it just needs our permission first . "
Scout council executive Rick Burr , who was hired after the logging , defended the harvest as " a one - time deal . "
" The money from the ( timber ) sale was used to rebuild the structures , " he said .
To critics , it was a dispiriting transaction .
" I 've got nothing against the Boy Scouts , " said Joseph Vaile , an Oregon environmental activist .
" But it was really disheartening to see clear - cut logging right next to a Wild and Scenic River . "
Mr Falk throws doubt on the legality of Israel 's mission in Gaza UN human rights investigators have questioned the legality of Israel 's Gaza offensive in a wide - ranging report to the UN Human Rights Council .
One investigator , Richard Falk , asked how a military assault with modern weapons could have been made " against an essentially defenceless society " .
The report found civilians appeared to " have taken the brunt of the attacks " with schools and clinics also hit .
Israel has accused Council members of seeking to " demonise " it .

More from BBC World Service Many international organisations have raised concerns about possible war crimes during the three - week offensive , which ended on 18 January .
An Israeli rights group has also criticised Israel for hitting medics and impeding medical evacuations .
The Israeli military says it is investigating specific claims of abuses and argues that it did its utmost to protect civilians during a conflict in which militants operated from populated civilian areas .
' One - sided ' fight Because Mr Falk , a UN human rights investigator , was unable to enter the Palestinian territories , his latest findings focus on the legality of Israel 's January operation in Gaza in general , rather than on specific cases or claims that disproportionate force was used .
The overall ratio of deaths ... is suggestive of the one - sidedness of the military encounter
Richard Falk
UN human rights investigator
Israel troops admit Gaza abuses
Who can probe Gaza war crimes claims ?
Gaza conflict :
Who is a civilian ?
Mr Falk argued that in order to determine if the war was legal , it was necessary to assess whether Israeli forces could differentiate between civilian and military targets in Gaza .
" If it is not possible to do so , then launching the attacks is inherently unlawful , and would seem to constitute a war crime of the greatest magnitude under international law , " he said in Geneva .
" The overall ratio of deaths , 1,434 on the Palestinian side , 13 on the Israeli side , is suggestive of the one - sidedness of the military encounter , " he added .
Gaza 's borders were closed , he stressed , so civilians were unable to flee the fighting .
Mr Falk called for an independent inquiry to examine possible war crimes committed by both Israel and Hamas .
He also suggested that the Israeli blockade of Gaza was in violation of the Geneva Conventions and must be lifted .
Radhika Coomaraswamy , the UN secretary general 's special representative for children and armed conflict , cited a long series of incidents to back her charges , in her report to the UN Human Rights Council .
In one , she said , Israeli soldiers shot a father after ordering him out of his house and then opened fire into the room where the rest of the family was sheltering , wounding the mother and three brothers and killing a fourth .
' Demonising Israel ' Israel 's ambassador to the UN Human Rights Council , Aharon Leshno Yar , said the report " wilfully " ignored and downplayed terrorist and other threats faced by Israel The 43 - page document was , he added , part of a pattern of " demonising Israel " in the Council .
Israeli authorities denied entry to Mr Falk last December , when he attempted to conduct his regular investigative mission to the Palestinian territories .
Israel was angered by a series of comments he had made accusing it of war crimes and comparing its actions in Gaza to Nazi Germany in World War II .
On Monday , the Israeli organisation Physicians for Human Rights released a report saying Israel had violated international law and ethics codes during the Gaza operation .
It accused Israeli forces of " attacks on medical personnel , damage to medical facilities and indiscriminate attacks on civilians not involved in the fighting " .

The dreadful Organisation of the Islamic Conference – campaigners for an international blasphemy law – have released a statement about the “ Faith Fighter ” computer game which has led to its removal from the Molleindustria website .
When his attention was brought to an internet report posted by metro.co.uk on an online game depicting holy figures such as Prophet Jesus and Prophet Muhammad ( PBUT ) fighting each other to the death , a spokesman of the OIC Islamophobia Observatory in Jeddah today expressed his concern stating that the computer game was incendiary in its content and offensive to Muslims and Christians .
He said that the game would serve no other purpose than to incite intolerance .
He called on the Internet service providers who are hosting the game to take immediate action by withdrawing it from the web .
The anonymous spokesman was correct when he said it would incite intolerance – the intolerance of rabid Muslims , intolerant of anyone who does n’t take them as seriously as they take themselves .
But that ’s probably not what he meant .
Fortunately , the game is still available to play here and here .
UPDATE : ( 22:40 )
A rather silly addendum to Molleindustria ’s statement about the withdrawal :
In few hours this statement generated a way more heated reactions than the release of the game .
We are not “ bowing to the foundamentalists ” , we have no sympathy for any religion but we are aware that muslims are victim of widespread racism in the western world .
This islamofobia is functional to the imperial interests in Middle East and all over the world .
We just want to make clear that the game was not intended to contribute to the media - assisted narrative “ islamic world vs freedom of speech ” .
Sigh .
Islam is not a race .
“ Islamophobia ” is an artificial construct designed to discourage criticism of Islam by equating such criticism with racism .
And the “ islamic world vs freedom of speech ” narrative is assisted not so much by the media as by the Islamic world itself , which in the shape of the OIC is campaigning vigorously for an international law forbidding defamation of religion .
That would make games such as this one illegal .
The makers of the game have confirmed to MWW that the withdrawal was a “ media tactic ” to encourage further discussion of the issue in the press .
But withdrawing it immediately the OIC release a statement only gives that organisation encouragement , and confirms its already over - inflated sense of self - importance .
Bad move .
Protesters stormed their way into the Royal Bank of Scotland 's City branch The Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) has demanded £ 40,000 compensation from a 17 - year - old girl who admitted attacking a branch during G20 protests in London .
The girl , who cannot be named , admitted burglary and criminal damage when protesters targeted the Threadneedle Street branch of the RBS on 1 April .
Prosecution counsel told West London Youth Court the bank wanted to recover the losses incurred during the protest .
The girl , who lives in Brighton , was given an eight - month referral order .
As part of her sentence she may be asked to pay a smaller sum of compensation to RBS .
RBS have gone for compensation in the sum of £ 40,000 - in my view , this is wholly unjustified
Miranda Ching , defence counsel Prosecutor Ann Crighton said three plate glass windows were broken and several pieces of computer hardware , which cost an estimated £ 40,000 , were stolen .
Police saw the girl smashing a computer monitor with a keyboard and flinging the keyboard against a window , breaking it .
Mrs Crighton said : " She admits breaking through the police cordon and said she had done so to rescue some of her friends who had been contained in a police ' kettle ' .
" At the time she got caught up in the heat of the moment .
She thought it would be a good idea to go into the [ bank 's ] foyer .
" When she got inside she thought it would be a better idea to smash up the computer .
" She said she changed her mind and tried to throw the computer through the window instead .
" She was seen picking up a keyboard and smashing a window , " Mrs Crighton said .
' Other people '
Defence solicitor , Miranda Ching , said that the girl , who was born in Scotland , was unemployed and lived on handouts from friends and family .
" RBS have gone for compensation in the sum of £ 40,000 .
In my view , this is wholly unjustified .
" It may well be that a substantial amount of criminal damage was caused as a whole by other people on 1 April .
" We must look at what my client is charged with and that is IT equipment .
" That seems to be , at most , one computer keyboard and one computer monitor , " she said .
The court heard that the teenager , who was introduced to political activism by her stepfather at an early age , had participated in a series of protests across Britain .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - Paris city authorities are planning to build small wind turbines into one of the world ’s most famous skylines to take advantage of the strong winds which sometimes sweep high points such as Montmartre .
The Sacred Heart Basilica ( Sacre Coeur ) is seen in Paris in this March 4 , 2008 file picture .
With strong winds sweeping some of Paris high points such as Montmartre , the city 's authorities are planning to build small wind turbines on the rooftops of one of the world 's most visited cities .

“ We are not talking of big models like those we see in the countryside .
We are in Paris and we mus n’t disfigure the landscape , ” Denis Baupin , a deputy mayor in charge of sustainable development , told Le Parisien newspaper .
No-one at the Paris townhall was immediately available to comment .
The turbines would be installed on flat rooftops in four neighborhoods , which experience strong winds , he said in the interview published Wednesday .
One of them is Montmartre in northern Paris home to the celebrated Sacre - Coeur Basilica and the Moulin Rouge cabaret , whose name translates as “ Red Windmill . ”
Jean - Louis Butre , head of the French Federation for Sustainable Environment , which lobbies against large - scale wind power , said turbines in Paris would disfigure the landscape .
“ If the plan is to install 15 - meter high wind turbines on the roofs , I think we are destroying Paris ’ historical heritage and I fear these are utopist solutions , ” Butre said .
Integrated systems , such as less visible internal wind turbines in buildings would however be acceptable , he said .
Other capital cities such as London have already installed big wind turbines on their city fringes and a huge turbine is expected to be built for the 2012 Olympic games , the paper said .
The turbines in Paris will produce electricity which will be sold to the state - owned utility EDF or directly used in the buildings where they will be installed , Baupin said .
Baupin said the city ’s authorities were also studying setting up water turbines under the capital ’s bridges of the Seine river .
“ The first tests will start in 2011 or 2012 , ” he said .
France aims for terrestrial wind energy to reach 20,000 megawatts by 2020 , or around 20 percent of current capacity , up from 3,000 MW now .
One of the most controversial European custom shops is Sweden ’s SE Service , run by Stellan Egeland .
The latest SE motorcycle is the Harrier , a radical BMW - powered machine that Egeland is promoting as the first in a new line of ‘ modern customs ’ .
The Harrier reminds us a little of Bimota ’s Tesi series , and took second prize last month at the 2009 European Championship Of Custom Bike Building — as much for its advanced engineering as its looks .
Apart from the obvious steering hub , the front brakes are six - piston monoblocs and the bike is also packing switchable ABS .
The internal document , leaked on the EUobserver website . , read : " Each official must be aware that all his / her documents , including meeting reports and emails can potentially be disclosed .
You should keep this in mind when writing such documents .

Who said satire was dead ?
In the US , at least , plenty did .
Once President Bush left office , they argued , political comedy would be moribund , irrelevant – specifically that scourge of the Bush administration , The Daily Show with Jon Stewart .
Yet Stewart has reasserted his relevance by confronting the Consumer News and Business Channel ’s fiery financial pundit Jim Cramer over his network ’s mishandling of the economic crisis .
By buying into the boom , Stewart argued in an encounter last week , Cramer and his competitors were implicated in the bust .
Stewart was incisive , quick - witted and unrelenting .
Cramer got served .
The pundit , host of CNBC ’s Mad Money , has since tried to make light of the interview , but he ought to remember the example of CNN ’s Crossfire : a “ news comment ” show that pitted two interviewers , Paul Begala and Tucker Carlson ( ostensibly from opposing ends of the liberal / conservative spectrum ) , against each other and their interviewees .
When Stewart was invited on in 2004 and asked to “ be funny ” , he instead told the presenters that their dumbed - down approach to serious news was “ hurting America ” .
Crossfire was cancelled six months later .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Stewart may hold the political class to account , but his greatest gift is for highlighting the failings of the media class that follows them – people like Carlson and Cramer .
Perhaps the UK news networks provide less mockable material ; yet we should ask , nonetheless , why we have no Jon Stewart of our own .
Despite a long and distinguished history of political satire , British television lacks the figure to fill Stewart ’s singularly influential role .
BBC
Four put comedian Marcus Brigstocke at the helm of The Daily Show clone The Late Edition in 2005 , but the programme and its presenter enjoyed nothing like the success of their American predecessors .
On the satire side , we boast such formidable talent as Chris Morris , Rory Bremner and the regulars on Have I Got News For You – none of whom regularly confront their targets in person .
On the talk show side , we have Jonathan Ross and Graham Norton – neither of whose shows have the political content of that of their US counterparts , David Letterman , Jay Leno et al .
In fact , The Daily Show ’s format originated on this side of the Atlantic , with That Was The Week That Was , the seminal satirical news show of the 1960s .
Anchorman David Frost would open each programme with a Stewart - like comic riff on the week ’s current affairs ( from behind a Stewart - like desk ) , before opening up the floor to his fellow funnymen for skits and interviews .
So where is this generation ’s TW3 when we need it ?
His wit was one thing , but no one gave the young Frost much credit as a political interviewer .
He was , as the writer Peter Morgan ’s Oscar - nominated movie Frost / Nixon demonstrates , thought a lightweight by politicians and his peers alike .
Until , of course , that famous post - Watergate interview with Nixon .
Stewart , too , was mocked as a mere “ comedian ” by Cramer , until the pundit was forced to face his foe ’s very serious interrogation .
Stewart himself frequently emphasises that yes , he is a comedian , and no , he should n’t be the one posing these difficult questions .
But , if nobody else will … Tim Walker

A bit of buff and polish
Ewan McGregor in Velvet Goldmine , Nicky Wire in the Manic Street Preachers , Bowie and Iggy Pop in the Seventies … there ’s a time and a place for nail varnish on men .
So when Prince Harry appeared at the west London nightclub Raffles last Friday night sporting a lick of pink varnish across the nails of his left hand , it was bound to make headlines .
There was no apparent reason for the controversial royal ’s flirtation with glam - rock chic , which he tried hard to hide from fellow revellers ( although sadly not the paparazzi working for the Sunday red- tops ) .
Such antics could be written off as youthful high - jinx , but is there any place for nail care and manicures in the adult ( military ) male ’s busy life ?
“ The girls I know always comment if there ’s a man who is groomed in the hand and foot department as well as everywhere else , ” says manicurist Leighton Denny , whose salons include a popular “ nail studio ” in the basement of Harrods .
So , in the spirit of the times , Hit & Run ventured to the Canary Wharf branch of Nails Inc , a popular chain of nail “ salons ” across Britain .
Fellow customers smiled at me a tad patronisingly – had n’t they ever seen a metrosexual before ? ) but my manicurist , Sam , put me at my ease .
She gave me a buff , file and polish for £ 17 , and suggested I return for the full monty ( from £ 27 ) which would involve pushing back my cuticles .
The end sensation ?
Tingly , moisturised , and feeling clean .
It almost makes you too precious to touch a keyboard .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Skype is planning to launch its service for iPhone users on Tuesday and for BlackBerry in May as part of its effort to expand beyond desktop computers .
Skype has been pushing to make its service work on the most popular advanced phones with an aim to expending its more than 400 million users who were mostly lured by the promise of cheap and sometimes free calls made using its computer application .
Skype Chief Operating Officer Scott Durchslag said he has high hopes for the application 's success on Apple 's popular iPhone as he expects
Skype 's most feature - rich mobile offering to appeal to new and existing customers .
" The No. 1 request we get from customers is to make Skype available on iPhone .
There 's a pent - up demand , " Durchslag said in an interview before the CTIA annual mobile showcase in Las Vegas , where Skype plans to launch the service on Tuesday .
In May it will launch Skype for Research In Motion 's BlackBerry devices , which popularized mobile email .
It has already announced Skype for Nokia phones and for phones based on Android , Google Inc 's mobile system , and Windows Mobile , from Microsoft Corp .
CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood said the new applications give
Skype a chance to boost its mobile phone position , which has been weaker than that of social sites such as Facebook , Twitter or News Corp 's MySpace .
One of Skype 's unusual iPhone features is the fact that it allows subscribers use to the phone numbers in their existing iPhone address book so they do not need duplicate lists .
" Whether you 're Twitter , MySpace or Facebook you want to be embedded in the address book , " said Wood .
" This puts Skype firmly into the game . "
Skype 's iPhone application will be free to download and will allow free calls between Skype users .
As with Skype on the desktop , fees will be charged for calls to traditional phones .
The service will also work on later versions of Apple 's latest iPod Touch device , which has Wi-Fi links but no cellular connection .
The iPod Touch launched September 2008 has a microphone , unlike the first iPod Touch launched in 2007 .
While Skype video is very popular with desktop customers , Durchslag said that the company is still considering whether it will offer video for the iPhone or other phones .
" We 're considering video carefully but we have a really high bar on the quality , " and how the user interaction will work with other applications on iPhone , he said .
" If we do it we will have to do it incredibly well . "
CCS 's
Wood said that if Skype can replicate the popularity of its desktop video feature on the cellphone it would help a mobile category that has been slow to take off , as well as boost its own status in cellphones .
" I 'm firmly convinced that if Skype could find a way to bridge all those cellphone cameras and laptop cameras it might kick start a video telephony opportunity , " he said .
While mobile Skype has been available for some time in other countries such as the United Kingdom , it has been slow to catch on in the United States partly due to carrier concern that it would cannibalize their phone call revenue .
In the United States for example , AT&T Inc has had a monopoly on calls made from iPhones , as it is the exclusive carrier here .
But Wood said that Skype has actually shown that it can boost consumer spending on cellphones as it encourages use of the phones for other services such as data .
For example he said that its success on networks such as 3 UK , owned by Hutchison Whampoa Ltd , suggests that carrier fears have been unfounded .
" The only area where I think there are some question mark is that it could erode roaming revenues , " he said , noting that some consumers particularly in Europe hesitate to use their phones while outside of their carrier territory because of notoriously high roaming fees .
" The carriers will be suspicious of this service but what we 've learned from other markets is that ( Skype ) did not have the detrimental effect feared , " he said .

On 10 July , Bruno hits the big screen - and so may a few unlucky members of the Alabama National Guard .
AP reported today that a cadet spotted Sacha Baron Cohen going through training at the Alabama Military Academy in Anniston and alerted officers to the comedian 's presence on campus in mid-February .
Staff sergeant Katrina Timmins called the incident an embarrassment , but Cohen 's people did n't comment .
The news story was short on detail , but I 'm already imagining what Cohen - cum - gay - fashion - presenter got himself into down south ...
For decades , the " three Gs " have been a defining feature of the American political landscape .
Guns ,
God and gays have been reliable hot - button issues constantly used to fire up Republicans and lambast Democrats .
But there are signs of a fundamental shift away from the so - called " culture wars " that have raged across American public life since at least the 1970s .
In his first two months in office , Barack Obama has moved forward on a series of controversial issues yet his popularity has barely suffered .
The president has taken a stand against anti-abortion rules in clinics and legalised funding for stem cell research .
He has praised Islam and Iran on his recent overseas trip and held a Passover ceremony in the White House .
Meanwhile , a series of states , including Iowa , deep in the American heartland , have legalised gay marriage and more are expected to follow suit .
Yet , for all the sound and fury this has prompted on the extreme right , Obama remains a popular president .
That has led some to wonder if the culture wars are finally losing some of their power .
" People are tired of this .
A lot of them are thinking : let 's move on , " said Professor Shaun Bowler , a political scientist at the University of California , Riverside .
Certainly that has been Obama 's strategy .
His public stance has been one of reaching out to Republicans on major legislation .
Such moves have often been rebuffed , but even so he went as far as keeping George Bush 's defence secretary , Robert Gates , at the Pentagon .
In one recent poll , Obama - though still unpopular with Republicans - saw his approval rating tick up from 59 % to 61 % .
Another had it attaining a healthy 66 % .
Experts believe the economic crisis is largely responsible for the failure of Republicans to make any headway by trying to attack using the " three Gs " .
In tough times , fear of losing one 's job and home far outweighs the cultural issues that have previously dominated US politics .
Americans are just too afraid of the collapsing economy to pay much attention to things that have no material impact on them .
" When you are losing your home , what do you care if two guys in Iowa can now wear a frock and get married ? " said Bowler .
There other things going on , too , beyond the simple fact of the worst recession since the Great Depression .
Many believe there is a generational shift going on in America , as young voters come of age having grown up more tolerant of issues such as homosexuality and gay marriage .
For these voters the culture wars seem a relic of the past .
There is also a slight slip in the number of Americans identifying themselves as Christian , down 10 points over the past 20 years .
" There is some generational change , especially in Christian conservative circles .
That perhaps is contributing to the diminution [ of the culture wars ] , " said Corwin Smidt , an expert on religion in politics at Calvin University and author of the book Religion and the Culture Wars
Even in many religious circles - and these include the powerful evangelical movement - there is a growing engagement with other issues such as the environment , aid to the developing world and combating HIV .
Obama has actively cultivated his own religious image and courted powerful evangelical leaders such as Pastor Rick Warren , who spoke at the president 's inauguration .
The decision to court Warren 's approval outraged many gay activists , but Obama 's team ignored their protests in favour of carving out the middle ground .
Yet a powerful wing of the Republican party refuses to let go of the culture wars .
Led by right - wing media figures such as Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck , they have sought to portray Obama as a socialist - in - waiting and a threat to US democracy .
They have painted him as pro-gay , anti-religious and anti-American .
One Republican congresswoman , Michele Bachmann from Minnesota , even claimed last week that Obama planned to set up " re-education camps " for young Americans to be brainwashed in political correctness .
But the impact of such extreme talk appears to have had little effect on ordinary Americans and served only to inflame conservatives who were already anti-Obama .
Indeed , much of it has become fodder for jokes on late - night TV chat shows rather than serious political debate .
Against a background of moderate Democratic moves , such as deciding not to move forward on anti-gun legislation , the Republican party seems to be moving further to the right at a time when the American public rewards those politicians who play to the centre .
Increasingly the party is seen as retreating to its core support of white southerners , which few experts see as a path to power .
" In the future , they will need to expand their base in some form , " said Smidt .
The move towards moderation and toleration in the era of Obama seems to have been typified by Iowa .
The fact that the farm - belt state , often cited as an example of " heartland values " , has moved forward on gay marriage is regarded as a sign that the culture wars ' fire and fury is abating .
Certainly Steven
Thrasher , a gay writer based in New York , sees it that way .
" A lot of people found that the reaction to this happening in Iowa was minimal .
Their bluff was being called , " he said .
Iowa 's move was doubly poignant for him as the child of a biracial couple who married in Iowa in 1958 because the state allowed such unions at a time when many others would not .
" One hopes that some day , throughout the nation , gay marriages , like my parents ' union , will just be seen as marriages , " he said .
Money works like a drug on the human brain – and even just the thought of earning a higher salary gives us a physical buzz , a study has found .
Scientists have discovered that thinking about cash stimulates the reward centres involved in pleasure and the higher the salary – even if it is just imagined – the greater the pleasure generated in the brain .
This may be no great surprise , but the most intriguing aspect of the research is that the findings hold true even if what we want to buy costs more , for example in times of high inflation , and our actual spending power drops .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The results of the study suggest that the human brain is innately susceptible to the illusion of wealth that money can bring .
This is known in economics as " money illusion " – when people get fixated on the nominal value of money , rather than on its actual purchasing power .
Some economists have proposed that people behave irrationally when it comes to wages by being happier with higher salary increases in times of high inflation than they are with lower salary rises in times of low inflation .
It has now emerged that more money really does seem to generate the feelings of reward in the brain that are also involved in irrational or addictive behaviour , even if the purchasing power of higher salaries is reduced by high inflation .
A study by Professor Armin Falk , of the University of Bonn , has found scientific support for the theory of money illusion being embedded in the human mind by examining the brain activity of 18 volunteers who took part in a series of tests involving different salary payments and prices .
The volunteers were asked to earn their " salaries " by performing a series of mental tasks on a computer .
The salary rates were at two levels , with the higher level being 50 per cent greater than the lower level .
They could then spend this money on a selection of goods listed in two types of catalogue .
Each catalogue was identical except that one was 50 per cent cheaper than the other .
In practice , the volunteers had the same purchasing power , irrespective of which salary they earned .
But the brain scans show that the reward centres in their brains were far more active when stimulated by the idea of the higher salary .
" Intuitively , money illusion implies that an increase in income is valued positively , even when prices go up by the same amount , leaving real purchasing power unchanged , " Professor Falk said .
" Economists have traditionally been sceptical about the notion of money illusion , but recent behavioural evidence has challenged this view , " added Professor Falk , whose study is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
For instance , studies have shown that people report being happier when they receive a 5 per cent increase in their salaries at a time of 4 per cent inflation , compared to a 2 per cent increase in salary at a time of low inflation .
But a limitation on these previous studies is that they rely on questionnaires rather than brain scans , which has led other economists to suggest alternative , more rational explanations .
The present study sidesteps this potential flaw in the research by looking directly at the reward centres of the brain that are directly involved in making decisions , Professor Falk explained .
The scientists measured higher blood flows in regions of the brain known to be involved in the experiencing of rewards , such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , which lies directly behind the eyes in the front part of the brain .
" This result means that reward activation generally increases with income , but was significantly higher in situations where nominal incomes and prices were both 50 per cent higher , which supports the hypothesis that activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is subject to money illusion , " Professor Falk said .
Michael Ignatieff began his press conference in the National Press Theatre in Ottawa today by saying that the Harper government 's budget was deeply flawed .
For a moment , I thought he was about to do something interesting , to propose serious and substantive amendments to the budget .
But then he dropped the clunker .
The Liberals , he said , will propose an amendment requiring the government to provide periodic updates on how the budget is working .
There you have it .
Michael Ignatieff went away last night , laboured , and brought forth a mouse .
Explaining himself in answer to questions from the media , the Liberal leader was embarrassingly sophomoric .
The Liberal - NDP coalition had been useful , he said , because it had forced the government to put many useful measures in the budget .
On the other hand , he said the budget remained a " Conservative " budget that likely would not work .
Nonetheless , he said he intended to vote for it .
Provided , of course , that his " Mickey Mouse " amendment is acceptable to Stephen Harper .
By turns , Ignatieff sounded like Demosthenes , thundering down condemnation on a government that has repeatedly failed Canadians , and then like an apple - polishing pupil asking for a report card from the head master .
Rule number one in politics : you can't have it every which way .
If you vote for the Conservative budget , it becomes your budget Mr. Ignatieff , no matter what font the government uses to print its reports for you .
In answer to questions that suggested that perhaps he had thrown the game away , Ignatieff could have replied in the manner of Hamlet : " Do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe . "
Having decided " not to be " as a serious opponent of the Harper government , Michael Ignatieff could consider a career on the stage .
Meanwhile , Jack Layton has become the real leader of the opposition .
He showed courage when he reached out to the Liberals to form a progressive coalition that could provide Canadians with the leadership they need to cope with the economic crisis .
He tried the option of working with the Liberals .
Michael Ignatieff has walked away from that option .
Layton has retained his integrity and his clear understanding of what the country needs .
Progressives now have one party and one party only available to them : the NDP .
Proving once again that the best way to reach Americans ' brain is through their funny bone , Jon Stewart of the Daily Show continued his warpath aimed at irresponsible financial reporting by CNBC , specifically calling Jim Cramer out for his comments on how easy it was to profit from misinformation aimed at Apple .
Calling it " disingenuous at best and criminal at worst , " Stewart grilled Cramer , the host of the frantic energetic " Mad Money " entertainment show , for his act of being " doe- eyed innocent " while celebrating the admittedly illegal shenanigans of hedge fund managers .
Stewart played clips of Cramer describing — shortly before the iPhone was first announced — how hedge fund managers could spread lies about the product through either gullible or willing media sources , creating either fear or excitement that would distort the company 's stock , allowing the fund manager to profit .
Fomenting the market
In the clip filmed for The Street , Cramer notes that this practice of " fomenting the market " is " actually blatantly illegal , but when you have six days and your company may be in doubt because you are down , I think it is really important to foment . "
Cramer specifically cited the example of stirring up rumors that Apple 's iPhone would be rejected by both AT&T and Verizon Wireless , and that it would n't be ready to demonstrate in time for Macworld in 2007 .
Apple 's stock performance leading up to the 2007 unveiling of the iPhone made it a prime candidate for foment and manipulation , as media figures spewing misinformation could easily cause temporary , panic - induced drops that manipulators could then use to profit dramatically from .
Other companies , including Microsoft , had seen so little change in their stock price since the 2000 bubble popped that they simply could n't be manipulated as easily .
Fomenting the market against Apple , however , " is very easy , because the people who write about Apple want that story .
And you can claim that it is credible because you spoke to someone at Apple , because Apple isnât in [ a position to comment on unannounced products ] .
It is an ideal short . "
Along with Apple , Cramer also cited RIM as a company that was easy to beat down with false information .
" It might cost me $ 15 to $ 20 million to knock RIM down , " he said , " but it would be fabulous because it would beleaguer all the moron longs [ investing in RIMâs success ] . "
" Who cares about the fundamentals ? "
Cramer said , " Research in Motion just blew out the quarter .
But look what people can do .
Thatâs a fabulous thing .
The great thing about the market is that it has nothing to do with the actual stocks . "
" Itâs important to get people talking about it as if something is wrong with RIM .
Then you would call the [ Wall Street ] Journal and talk to the bozo reporter on Research in Motion and you would feed that Palm has got a killer it is going to give .
These are the things that you must do on a day like today .
And if you are not doing it , maybe you shouldnât be in the game . "
Cramer added , " I think itâs important for people to realize that the way that the market really works is to have that nexus of : hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders that can push it down , then leak it to the press , and then get it on CNBC ; thatâs also very important .
And then youâll have a vicious cycle down .
Itâs a pretty good game .
It can be played for a percent or two . "
Cramer vs Cramer : The Street and CNBC
While playing a comical character on CNBC , Cramer 's articles and video clips on his own " The Street " website reveal an entirely different side .
" When I watch that , " Stewart said , " I can't tell you how angry that makes me .
Because what it says to me is you all know , you all know what 's going on [...] a game you know is going on but that you go on television as a financial network and pretend it isnât happening . "
The Street 's War on Apple
Following the original iPhone pre-launch rumors Cramer talked about in The Street video clip , his site continued a merciless attack on the iPhone over the next year , including a " report " by Brett Arends which claimed that buying the iPhone would actually cost users $ 17,670 , followed up by Arends ' lists of reason not to buy it , many provided directly by industry flacks working for competing companies .
Cramer himself floated a false story immediately after the iPhone 's launch that Apple 's wireless partner Cingular ( later renamed as AT&T ) would provide a year and a half of free mobile service for the iPhone .
The story was picked up by blogs and widely publicized on syndication sites like Digg .
A myth busting report on the scam noted , " Saying that Cingular will give away $ 1440 worth of free service to perhaps ten million subscribers in order to earn just $ 480 from them across two years is an insane prediction . "
The Street 's Scott Moritz also served as a willing accomplice in filing dubious reports aimed at nailing Apple 's stock , including the idea that Apple 's spectacular launch weekend was actually disappointing because the company had really intended to ship a million units within three days , citing unnamed " whisper " sources .
In reality , legitimate analysts had actually expected Apple to ship 150,000 to 350,000 iPhones at launch ; Apple reported selling 270,000 in the last two days of June quarter which made up most of the launch weekend .
However , Moritz described a bleak scenario where Apple had failed to sell out its inventory , despite very constrained availability of the iPhone at most of Apple 's 200 retail stores and many of AT&T 's outlets over the first month .
Because of this supposed failure to launch , Moritz insisted , " Thereâs a lot of rejoicing at Sprint , Verizon and T - Mobile . "
The Street would also frequently take factual reports and add a hysterical , frantically panicked spin , sometimes to directly bring the stock down and other times to create impossible expectations invented to cause a temporary bubble .
One suggested that Apple 's AT&T revenue sharing deal was " unheard of , " despite the fact that similar revenue sharing had long been underlying RIM's BlackBerry success .
That provided Cramer with the timing to announce " I am being abject and adamant : Sell some Apple ahead of earnings . "
Never mind the iPhone 3G : Steve Jobs is sick !
Last year , the Street continued badgering Apple , brushing aside the global launch of the iPhone 3G to try to focus coverage on Steve Jobs ' health in a video segment titled " Without Steve Jobs , There is No Apple . "
" This is a company that thrives on innovation , and the innovation is all being driven by one man.â 
Cramer said of Apple .
â Thatâs okay , the one man is not a stock .
I mean , you canât .
The multiple of one person is zero .
Well , one .
But I would warn people that this companyâ ¦ I donât want to call it nothing without him , but it is not investible without him , because he is the driver of ideas .
Now behind anybody thereâll be other ideas , but I remember the original Apple , and it was all him , too . "
A privilege escalation flaw in udev
LWN .net needs you !
Without subscribers , LWN would simply not exist .
Please consider signing up for a subscription and helping to keep LWN publishing
A vulnerability in udev , the user - space tool that manages the Linux / dev tree , has left unpatched systems vulnerable to a local root privilege escalation .
Exploits are already circulating on the full - disclosure mailing list , so it is rather important for users and administrators to update their systems .
The problem was caused by the way udev processes the messages it receives — certain kinds of messages , which could be generated by user processes , were not considered .
That oversight led to the vulnerability .
The ever - expanding nature of the / dev tree , along with the rise of more dynamic hardware environments , led to the creation of udev in 2003 .
It replaced the devfs filesystem that was an earlier attempt to solve those problems .
Unfortunately , devfs codified device naming policy into the kernel — something the kernel hackers try to avoid .
By moving those decisions to user space with udev , that problem — along with a number of others — was resolved .
In order for udevd ( the udev daemon ) to do its job , it needs a way to be informed by the kernel when devices come and go—typically because the user attached or detached some device .
A standard Linux way to send messages between the kernel and user space is via a netlink socket .
Netlink sockets are an inter-process communication ( IPC ) mechanism that is geared for kernel to user space ( and vice versa ) IPC .
It provides the well - understood sockets API to user space programs and is a much more flexible IPC mechanism than other possible choices .
One of the nice features of netlink sockets is the ability to multicast messages ( i.e. a message sent to multiple recipients ) .
Each netlink protocol type can have up to 32 multicast groups associated with it .
Typically , multicast messages can only be sent and received by root , though some netlink protocol types will allow non-root processes to send and / or receive multicast messages .
In fact , a recent change to the kernel allows non-root processes to receive — but not send — the udev multicast messages ( which are also known as uevents ) .
Since only root processes can send the multicast uevents , it would seem there is no hole to exploit .
Unfortunately , no one considered unicast messages .
Any process can send a unicast netlink message to any other process , just by addressing it to a particular pid .
It is up to the recipient to decide whether to accept and process the message .
Because these unicast messages fell through the cracks , udevd would happily process them — creating devices as specified by a potentially malicious user .
One of the more obvious exploits would be to create world - writeable block device corresponding to the root filesystem — other , nastier exploits are likely possible as well .
The fix was straightforward : enabling credentials ( a header placed on each message by the kernel that includes the uid and pid of the sender ) for the netlink socket , then requiring that all messages received have a uid of zero , which Kay Sievers added on April 8 .
Scott James
Remnant added some additional checks shortly thereafter , requiring that messages received are not unicast and have been sent by the kernel .
Sievers says that either patch " alone would be sufficient " to fix the problem and that doing both is , in some sense , defensive programming .
The credentials check is needed for upcoming changes , he said , and Remnant 's checks will take care of a theoretical concern : " a confined root process inside SELinux or AppArmor jail , which in fact is not root in the usual sense , has no privileges , but could have the uid 0 " .
While Sievers did n't think the theory was particularly viable , checking for a sender pid of zero ( as Remnant 's change does ) will take care of that problem as well .
This vulnerability illustrates a fairly common mistake : not considering all of the ways that input can reach a program .
Every input mechanism factors into the " attack surface " of a program ( or system ) .
In this case , messages that — up until very recently at least — could n't even be seen by non -root processes , could be sent by them .
It is not uncommon for developers to focus on the " normal " usage of an input mechanism and miss a lesser , but still valid , use .
Will Washington Capitals left winger Alexander Ovechkin , the top goal scorer in the NHL again this season , repeat as the winner of the Hart Trophy ?
Or will the title of most valuable player go to Art Ross Trophy winner Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins or Detroit Red Wings center Pavel Datsyuk The voting members of the Professional Hockey Writers '
Association had a tough challenge this season under the terms of the Hart , which is awarded to the " player adjudged most valuable to his team .
" Ovechkin is seen as the dominant player on the Capitals and the prime reason they won the Southeast Division and finished second in the Eastern Conference .
Malkin is seen as a co-leader of his club , along with Sidney Crosby , the 2007 Hart winner .
With Crosby affected until midway in the season by the high ankle sprain he suffered a year ago , it was Malkin 's steady point production and clutch goals that kept the Penguins in the race until the Penguins got things together under coach Dan Bylsma For his part , Datsyuk is regarded by many as the NHL 's top all - around player , showing tremendous offensive and defensive abilities .
Ovechkin is hoping to become the first forward to repeat as the Hart winner since Wayne Gretzky led the Edmonton Oilers to the Stanley Cup in 1984 - 85 .
Gretzky won the Hart Trophy eight times in a row and nine times total , tops in both categories .
No left winger had won the Hart since Bobby Hull in 1966 .
Frank Nighbor of the Ottawa Senators was the first winner in 1923 .
The trophy was donated by Dr. David Hart , team physician of the Montreal Canadiens and father of longtime Canadians coach and general manager Cecil Hart .
For the first time in NHL history , all three finalists for the Hart are Russians .
Ovechkin and Malkin were nominated last year , when Canadian Jarome Iginla , of the Calgary Flames , was the other finalist .
Sergei Fedorov won in 1994 .
Dominik Hasek and John Vanbiesbrouck were the other finalists .
Datsyuk , Malkin and Ovechkin will be on hand for the 2009 NHL Awards , which will be broadcast live from the Pearl Concert Theater inside the Palms Hotel Las Vegas on June 18 on VERSUS in the United States and CBC in Canada .
Tickets to the 2009 NHL Awards are on sale at ticketmaster.com / nhlawards and at the Pearl Concert Theater Box Office .
Here is a closer look at the finalists .--
Datsyuk is the best all - around NHL player .
The fourth - leading scorer this season also is bidding for his second - straight Frank J. Selke Trophy as the league 's best defensive player and fourth - straight Lady Byng Trophy as the player who combines the best performance with sportsmanship .
He plays the game the way it should be played .
Datsyuk is a dynamic skater , extremely fast going straight - ahead and quick and shifty with his offensive and defensive moves .
He takes pucks away from opponents who did n't realize they were in his sights .
He converts those turnovers into breakaways and odd - man rushes in every game .
There may be no better passer in the NHL .
His 65 assists ranked fifth this season .
He was second a year ago , one behind Joe Thornton , and has been in the Top 10 the past four seasons .
Over and over again , Datsyuk 's passes are right on the tape , the effect of years and years of practice .
Datsyuk , the oldest of the three finalists at 30 , is seen as the most professional , a quiet , dedicated hard worker who inspires his teammates to higher goals .
Datsyuk was third in the NHL with a plus - 34 rating , after leading the league in that category late in the season .
He finished ninth by winning 56.3 percent of his faceoffs and second with 89 takeaways .
He further helps the Red Wings ' defensively by staying out of the penalty box .
Datsyuk had only 22 penalty minutes .
Datsyuk had 11 power - play goals , three game - winners and one short - handed goal .
Datsyuk is listed at 5 - foot - 11 and 194 pounds , but has always seemed smaller , going back into his youth .
When his father took him to the local sports club in Sverdlovsk , he signed him up for the chess team .
But Datsyuk overcame his childhood poverty and diminutive size to become a big , big man in the NHL .-- Malkin is a man-child in the NHL , still very much a boy , but a big one at 6 - foot - 3 and 195 pounds .
He is just beginning to come into his physical and emotional maturity .
That 's the reason that Malkin , the No. 2 selection in the 2004 Entry Draft , is in only his third NHL season .
He played his first professional season for his hometown Magnitogorsk team and then stayed another season because he lacked the core body strength to handle the NHL style of play .
He developed well under coach Dave King that year , learning a North American style that produced a 33 - goal , 85 - point rookie season two years ago .
He advanced to 47 goals and 106 points last season , when he was sixth in assists and second in points .
He advanced beyond production to leadership this season , carrying his team during Crosby 's struggles and leading the points race wire - to - wire .
He had only five games without a point through Christmas and only 18 all season .
Malkin led the NHL with 113 points and 78 assists and played in all 82 games .
He had 14 power - play goals , eighth in the NHL , two short - handed goals and fourgame - winners .
He took 290 shots , tenth - highest , and was plus - 17 .
Although is defensive game is overlooked , Malkin led the NHL with 94 takeaways and his 39 blocked shots were six more than Datsyuk and seven more than Ovechkin .
Malkin 's versatility can't be overlooked .
Malkin is adept at playing right wing on a line with Crosby or centering his own line .
If Crosby and Malkin played together all the time , there 's no doubt they would be the best line in the NHL but the ability to combine the two gives the Penguins , in essence , three strong lines within their top six forwards .
He seems a natural right winger anyway .
His preferred route into the offensive zone is from the right side and he 's strong in his play along the boards .--
If the Hart honored the best player in the League , it would probably go to Ovechkin .
But it does n't , it rewards the most valuable to his team .
But Ovechkin has a strong case there , too .
Ovechkin repeated as the winner of the Rocket Richard Trophy by leading the NHL with 56 goals .
Alexander Semin , whose hot start was instrumental in the Capitals grabbing control of the division , had 34 and defenseman Mike Green , a finalist for the Norris Trophy , had 31 .
Ovechkin's 110 points led the Capitals and were second in the NHL .
The next nearest Capitals player was Nicklas Backstrom with 88 .
Semin had 79 and Green had 73 .
The Capitals are a young , talented team with several emerging stars in Green , Backstrom , Semin , Tomas Fleischmann Brooks Laich and Simeon Varlamov .
Ovechkin has clearly helped make them better .
Green , Semin and Backstrom spent considerable time on ice with him this season , boosting their point totals .
Ovechkin's 54 assists were tenth - best in the NHL .
Ovechkin , 23 , led the NHL with 526 shots and was second with 19 power - play goals .
His 10 game - winning goals were third - best .
His 10.6 shooting percentage was excellent .
If there is a weakness in his candidacy , it was his plus - 8 finish , well below Malkin and Datsyuk and only tied for fifth on the Capitals .
But Ovechkin is the productive and charismatic leader of an emerging club that promises to be good for years to come .
He is fast , strong , brave , and determined to win .

UPS has issued a statement that it has not , but has stated that they do not have any pending advertising plans with O’Reilly ’s show .
“ We are writing to clarify our statement of last Friday because it appears to have been misinterpreted .
UPS has not ‘ pulled ’ any advertising from Fox News nor has the company taken a position on the ‘ ThinkProgress ’ campaign .

Peter Hain rightly challenges Guardian readers and fellow Labour members to take the threat of the BNP seriously .
They are on the verge of winning seats on the European parliament , and thus acquiring up to £ 2 m in funds .
It is a pity that Peter Hain had to be the one to say it .
For one thing , it could be seen as an attempt to shore up Labour 's vote , which is on the precipice of a sudden deadly plunge .
This was quite obviously the case with Harriet Harman 's appeal earlier this month ( though I note that at least Peter Hain does n't just say ' vote Labour ' , as Harman did ) .
Secondly , as much of the comment on the thread suggests , few people really want to take their lead from a former New Labour minister who backed the ' war on terror ' ( unfortunately , the thread is also crawling with fascists and demented complaints that Labour " sold out to Islam " - you might want to pop over there and bash the fash if you have a minute ) .
This is a party that has vilified asylum seekers , bullied Muslims and promoted people like Hazel Blears to blither about political correctness .
You might wonder who needs lessons in anti-fascism from such people .
The hostility to New Labour is bracing .
I for one am completely uninterested in rewarding Gordon Brown 's crawling to the City , his ' British Jobs for British Workers ' schtick , or his proposed austerity programme .
And it is tragic that we do n't have the kind of unified left - wing alternative that France and Germany both have , although there will still be left - of - Labour alternatives out there .
Still , that does n't change the fact that Hain is right about the BNP , and that complacency is not an option .
After all , the BNP are not just a racist , violent and authoritarian party .
They are that .
Their call for the ' repatriation ' of black and Asian Britons - whom they deem " racial foreigners " - is a call for ethnic cleansing , sure to be backed up with the " well - directed fists and boots " that Nick Griffin used to drool about .
It is n't just that their hardcore bully - boys , often integrated into the terrorist Combat - 18 group that was formed to act as stewards for BNP rallies , are often violent criminals and sociopaths .
The BNP is a party whose leadership and core members are marinated in the ideology of the Third Reich .
It is a Nazi party .
If this germinal junta gets European representation and funding , then it is a step toward barbarism in a continent where the far right is making atrocious headway .
One comment on the CiF thread suggests that the far right can be relied on to disintegrate due to its often violent internal schisms .
The BNP is not exactly short of factional ructions , as the 2007 split and a recent leaked document illustrates , but that has n't really stopped them making worrying inroads in local elections .
It does n't stop them having 56 council seats and a seat on the London assembly .
In the last European parliament elections in 2004 , the BNP gained over 800,000 votes , just short of 5 % of the total vote .
This time round , they may get Nick Griffin elected to that body , and would need only 8 % - easily within reach , I would have thought .
That would shift the centre of gravity to the right and benefit every racist and reactionary current in the UK .
This means that a priority of the Left should be backing the campaign by Unite Against Fascism during the upcoming elections .

Fifteen months ago the then energy secretary , John Hutton , came within days of giving permission to build the first new coal - fired power station in Britain in more than 30 years , at Kingsnorth , Kent .
The move would have delivered a huge blow to the government 's claims to be leading the world in tackling climate change and almost certainly triggered an intensification of the long - running conflict with activists , who had turned it into one of the green movement 's totemic issues .
A last - ditch campaign by green cabinet members , including the then environment secretary , David Miliband , and his brother Ed , backed by Greenpeace and other environmentalists , first delayed the Kingsnorth decision and yesterday , having persuaded the Treasury , overturned the old energy department stance .
" This is a complete rewrite of UK energy policy .
Instead of a laissez - faire system where companies told government what they wanted to build and where , government has decided that reducing climate change emissions cannot be left to the market and it must now tell industry what needs to be built to what pollution standards , " one government source said yesterday .
No new coal - fired power station will now get government consent without it having equipment to capture and bury at least 25 % of emissions now and 100 % by 2025 when the technology is expected to be technically and commercially proven .
Details of how the four demonstration CCS projects , each costing around £ 1bn , will be paid for are still unclear , with both government and industry expecting the consumer to pay eventually with a 2 % levy on electricity bills by 2020 .
But yesterday the industry signalled it was pressing for government subsidies .
Paul Golby , chief executive of E.ON UK , said : " We are committed to fit capture technology to Kingsnorth in accordance with the government 's proposed conditions , as long as it is properly funded . "
The energy secretary , Ed Miliband , said he hoped Britain would lead an emerging world industry .
" There is no alternative to CCS if we are serious about fighting climate change .
We need new coal - fired power stations [ for energy security ] but only if they can be part of a low carbon future .
With a solution to the problem of coal we greatly increase our chances of stopping dangerous climate change emissions .
Without it we will not succeed , " he said in a statement to the Commons .
Environment groups joined the CBI , unions , and energy companies in applauding the decision , but there was concern that the new coal plants would be allowed to operate for up to 10 years while still pumping three - quarters of their emissions into the atmosphere .
" Will existing coal plants like Drax , which are slated to continue operation into the 2020s , be allowed to continue operating unabated despite their massive emissions ?
How will the government ensure that , if CCS technology does n't work , the UK wo n't be left with a legacy of new coal plants emitting huge amounts of CO2 at a time when we must be slashing emissions ? " asked John Sauven , director of Greenpeace .
His organisation 's analysis suggested yesterday that the four CCS coal demonstration projects operating for 15 years before fitting 100 % capture equipment may still emit up to 275 m tonnes of CO2 - some 50 % of current UK annual emissions .
Others suggested CCS would unleash a coal " rush " and add to pressure for damaging new open cast coal mines in the UK .
" CCS will need 50 % more coal for the same generation and it will add 70 % to the costs , " said independent energy analyst John Busby .
" As we import 75 % of our coal , the CCS stations would radically decrease our energy security and worsen the balance of payments . "
But there was widespread approval for the announcement .
" Carbon capture and storage could be a transformative technology , " the CBI said .
" We know it can work on a small scale but is not yet fully commercially viable for large plants , so we welcome this financial support for demonstration CCS projects . "
" The government has now stepped up to the mark on coal .
The ban on new unabated coal - fired power stations is the most important UK climate policy we have seen so far , " said Matthew Lockwood , senior research fellow at Labour thinktank the Institute for Public Policy Research .
In response to criticisms , Miliband said that existing coal plants and new gas ones would be considered for CCS legislation .
" We will have to think seriously how we deal with them .
We will consult on how other plants get treated . "
The most optimistic government analysis suggests the four new coal - fired power plants will lead to major reductions in emissions after 2025 because they will largely replace ageing coal stations .
Of the four plants , at least two are expected to use pre-combustion technology which removes all emissions before burning the coal .
One will collect emissions after they have been burned , which is less efficient but can be fitted to existing stations .
" If the four coal plants are 50 % efficient by 2020 , and we expect 34 % of electricity to be generated by renewables and roughly 20 % by nuclear , then that would lead to a decarbonisation of the electricity supply of 60 % - 66 % by 2020 , " a government source said .
" The rest would come by 2050 . "
Political pressure is expected to be placed on the Environment Agency , the government 's pollution watchdog , which is to be given the role of independently assessing whether the technology works and decide when companies should move from 25 % to 100 % CCS .
" This is one of the most important environmental decisions the government has taken , " said Lord Chris Smith , chairman of the agency .
" We need to reduce dramatically the emissions from coal power stations and carbon capture technology offers real hope of a new era of ' clean coal ' .
It is an essential element of any sensible energy policy for the next 20 years .
" We will do all we can to ensure it is developed as soon as possible to help us meet the ambitious carbon emissions reduction target of 80 % by 2050 . "
The shadow energy and climate change secretary , Greg Clark , welcomed the move .
" But there are still gaps in today 's announcement , including the refusal to make a clear commitment to an emissions performance standard , which would set a legal limit on the level of CO2 pollution that a power plant could emit .
We also need to know who will pay the new consumer levy and how much will be added to fuel bills . "
Lump sums : the new coal rush
Given that world reserves of coal amount to more than 500bn tonnes and every country with the resource plans to dig it up and use it at some point to drive its development , the introduction of carbon capture and storage is more urgent than ever .
In a 2006 report BP found that the UK had coal reserves of 220 m tonnes .
At the current rate of consumption , around 19 m tonnes per year , this would last just under 12 years .
But undiscovered coal could push this further - according to the World Coal Institute as yet unknown deposits could push the UK 's reserves up to 1bn tonnes .
The UK's use of coal far outstrips its production , with the country importing around 23 m tonnes a year from places such as Russia .
The largest deposits of coal exist in the US , Russia , China and India with 122bn , 69bn , 59bn and 56bn tonnes respectively .
Of these , the US and China mine the most every year , around 564 m and 707 m tonnes a year .
India digs up around 167 m tonnes a year but experts agree that this figure is set to increase rapidly in the coming decades .

Lets face it :
The dream of having our very own personal spa chef whip up delicious , good - for - us grub probably isnt happening in this economy .
So we found the next best thing — great stuff that makes eating healthy affordable and , honestly , almost effortless .
Check out our top picks : 1 . The end of the brown rice rut
Because nobody has an hour to devote to a midweek side dish , quick - cooking quinoa and whole - wheat couscous are truly revolutionary .
With the same satisfying texture and nutty flavor as brown rice ( plus more fiber ) , these 10 - minute grains give new meaning to fast food .
2. Almonds by the pound
If youre sick of schlepping to crunchy co-ops to buy nuts , dried fruit , and grains in bulk , youll be happy to hear that mass grocery stores are rediscovering these money - saving bins .
That means we can buy less - processed , less - pricey raw almonds , unsalted sunflower seeds , organic trail mix , and more where we stock up on milk and other basics .
3. Generation 2.0 market bag
Buying fresh means buying often .
And if youre biking or walking to the market to stock up , you need a tote thats up to the task .
The new reusable , planet - friendly bags do it all — theyre big enough to carry loads of goodies , truly leakproof , and way cuter than granny carts .
On the fence about bringing your own ?

6 . The mini movement
One downsizing trend were on board with — guilty - pleasure foods ( think : burgers , cupcakes ) getting shrinky - dinked .
Twee portions are de rigueur on restaurant menus and at bakery counters .
And with all the mini baking pans out there , we can whip up sane - size muffins , cupcakes , quiches , and more without feeling the least bit guilty .
7. Souped - up sea salts
Leave it to gourmands to take a humble essential element and turn it into something spectacular .
With a gazillion types of flavored and specialty sea salt — from hickory - smoked to Hawaiian Red Alaea — on shelves now , its never been easier to add tons of flavor and complexity to a dish .
Coarse - grain sea salt has slightly less sodium than table salt and contains trace minerals that may have added health benefits .
Theyre definitely pricier , though , so sprinkle a hint on a finished dish instead of using it to salt your cooking water .
8. Frozen edamame
These protein - packed pods were once a rare treat found only in Japanese joints .
But now theyre staples in the frozen - foods aisle , serving as a healthy snack or emergency side .
Its hard to beat the nutritional wallop of whole soybeans :
Theyre 60 % richer in calcium than peas , a source of cancer - fighting isoflavones and vitamin E , and a great vegetable source of complete protein .
For a snack , sprinkle steamed edamame pods with olive oil and sea salt ; pop the beans out and discard the pods .
9 . A free - range chicken in every store
Its never been easier to find real chicken — the kind raised on a veggie diet sans growth hormones or antibiotics .
For years , these pampered birds were exclusive to expensive gourmet markets or out - of - the - way farmers markets , but theyve finally gone mainstream .
Were thrilled about the health perks ( fewer chemicals in our bodies ) , but what do we really love ?
Its chicken that tastes like , well … chicken .
So first off I 'd like to apologize for not being around much .
Apparently a few of you have missed me and I am sorry .
I have just been redonculously busy lately .
And to make matters worse ... today was shit .
I had a lovely Easter .
All my family came over to my parents ' and we had a great lil brunch get - together .
Afterward , my mom was driving me back to my apartment in the city .
She asked me what I thought of the new church they were going to ( where we went that morning ) and I sort of gave an ambivalent response .
She asked if I missed church at all , and I decided that I was n't going to lie about this anymore .
So one question led to another and she finally asked :
" So what do you believe in ? "
to which I responded
" I do n't believe in god . "
She freaked .
She started crying and yelling .
She wondered how I could just give up god after so long .
She did n't understand where I got my answers then .
She wants to know how I could let science get in the way of my faith ( when I told her religion contradicted too much with scientific fact ) .
She told me ... that she felt like a failure because all she ever wanted was to raise good christian children .
What the fuck am I supposed to say to that ?
Nevermind that I am a good girl and have never gotten into any serious trouble .
I do well in school and am responsible .
I am ( I feel ) a pretty good daughter .
Obviously none of that matters .
I feel that I could have told her I was pregnant and it would have been less of an issue as long as I still wuvved jeebus .
It went on a bit , then she dropped me off in awkward silence , saying " this is n't the end of this . "
Great .
Just fucking great .
So this was n't a very meaty post , but I needed to vent .
And who better to share my coming out story with than all my thinkatheist pals .
Anyone else with sticky outting stories have any advice for a very stressed out Sniz ?
We had a rough day , and I 'm happy it 's over .
SSgt Thomason told us we should sleep during the day , and travel at night .
I found out something about Geithner that I never wanted to know - he suffers from night terrors - even during the day .
Every time we fell asleep , we would awaken to his screams .
Screams of things that scare liberals " Free Market ! " one moment , " Fair Tax " the next .
The screams were horrifying .
Finally , after Geithner tried to cuddle up next to SSgt Thomason , I heard a thump and Geithner went quiet .
Unfortunately , it was already too late .
We were n’t the only ones too hear Geithner 's screams .
We were first alerted to the presence of the Iranian platoon when a shot rang out , and SSgt Thomason slouched over .
Then something truly bizarre happened .
I remember hearing Geithner scream " Noooooooo ! "
I know this sounds silly , but I can swear he also said " I loved him " - funny what the desert can do to your hearing .
Anyway - this is where it starts to get weird .
Geithner charges the Iranian platoon and engages them in a style of martial arts I have never seen before .
He looked like a limp wristed , effeminate ninja .
Here 's the strange part - he was singing and dancing through the whole fight .
" On the first part of the journey - step 2,3,4 " he said , all the while running and leaping toward the Iranians .
" I was looking at all the life - roundhouse ! " and an Iranian went down as Geithner frolicked on .
" There were plants and birds and rocks and things .
There was sand and hills and rings " and then he leapt 6 feet into the air - landing on an Iranian , the Iranians head buried in Geithner 's groin .
" I 've been through the desert on a horse with no name .
It felt good to be out of the rain " , then Geithner flexed his thighs and snapped the mans neck .
It went on like this until .
Geithner finished the song .
There was silence as he faced the last standing Iranian .
They both surveyed the area , and then the Iranian dropped his rifle and ran off into the desert .
We were safe for the moment .
Geithner ran back to SSgt Thomason .
He cradled the man 's head in his lap and said " Do n't leave me , baby " .
Then , amazingly , SSgt Thomason 's had shot straight up and grabbed Geithner 's neck .
I heard SSgt Thomason scream " Get off of me you douche ! "
We later found out that we was wearing a bullet proof vest , and had only suffered 2 broken ribs and a bruised liver .
As SSGT Thomason choked Geithner we heard the four bladed Hueys swoop in .
The UH - 1 Z 's were here to take us home .
After the long day , I was willing to skip the fritters and get to London .
I wonder what happened to Rahm ?

AT TUWANI , West Bank – “ I could n’t run .
My pregnancy was too far advanced , and there was nowhere to hide , ” said Amna Salman Rabaye , 31 , as she recalled the terrifying incident several months ago .
Rabaye from the Palestinian Bedouin village of At Tuwani in the southern West Bank was grazing her sheep when she was assaulted by a security guard from the adjacent illegal Israeli settlement of Ma’on .
“ We saw a group of masked Israeli settlers armed with sticks and chains heading towards us .
The younger shepherds ran and managed to escape , leaving me with the flock of sheep , ” Rabaye told IPS .
“ It was physically impossible for me to run , and I also did n’t want the settlers to kill or steal my sheep .
The security guard pushed me over , but I was not injured , ” recalled Rabaye , who was then seven months pregnant .
At Tuwani was established over 300 years ago by nomadic tribes of Bedouin who first moved into the area seeking shelter in the nearby caves .
However , Israeli settlers built the adjacent Ma’on settlement in 1982 .
The nearby illegal outpost of Havot Ma’on was built at a later date .
Outposts normally comprise small settlements ranging from a few caravans , which are sometimes connected to water and electricity , to slightly larger settlements .
They are referred to as outposts by the media , as they are generally not recognized by the Israeli government .
The settlements , however , which are legal under Israeli law can number from several hundred residents to small towns with thousands of inhabitants , and all the associated infrastructure .
There are nearly 300,000 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank and nearly 200,000 in East Jerusalem , according to the Israeli information center for human rights , B’Tselem .
Under international law , including various UN Security Council resolutions , the settlements are built illegally on Palestinian land .
The Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits an occupying power from transferring citizens from its own territory to the occupied territory ( Article 49 ) .
The Hague Regulations prohibit an occupying power from undertaking permanent changes in the occupied area unless these are due to military needs in the narrow sense of the term , or unless they are undertaken for the benefit of the local population .
Nevertheless , Israeli settlement - building on the West Bank has accelerated at an unprecedented rate in the last few years .
This has included the enlargement of already existing settlements and the establishment of new ones , contrary to every understanding and peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians .
Israeli human rights group Peace Now released a report several weeks ago stating that the Israeli government is currently building an additional 73,300 illegal housing units in the West Bank .
The report added that this would increase the total number of Israeli settlers in the area by 100 percent .
International human rights organizations have argued that the motive behind the accelerated settlement - building is to establish facts on the ground and to make the establishment of a viable , contiguous , and independent Palestinian state nearly impossible .
Currently , the West Bank is effectively divided into three cantons by military checkpoints and the settlements .
Palestinian towns and villages are surrounded by Israeli settlements while swathes of their land has been confiscated to build settlers - only bypass roads .
While Israeli officials are furthering the facts - on - the - ground scenario through official government policies , an unofficial war between Israeli settlers and Palestinian villagers over the continued land expropriation continues unabated .
“ The settlers are carrying out a deliberate policy to try and drive us off our land and intimidate us into leaving so that they can take our land , ” said Hafez Hreini , 37 , one of the villagers .
Hreini ’s mother , 79 - year - old Fatima , was left bleeding after a settler threw a rock at her head in another encounter with the settlers .
“ It is very hard not to physically retaliate when you see people attack your elderly mother but I know if I had done anything back , the Israelis would have used this as an excuse to arrest me and a lot worse , ” Hreini told IPS .
“ So we are deliberately applying a policy of nonviolence and we are determined to stay here and keep our land . ”
In 2006 the villagers lost over 100 sheep after the settlers sprayed pesticides on their grazing land .
Several donkeys belonging to the village were stabbed to death .
The village ’s water wells have also been poisoned on numerous occasions while crops have been set ablaze .
The children of the village and the surrounding villages have been regularly attacked by the settlers as they try to make their way to school .
A group of outraged Israeli intellectuals wrote to incumbent Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert several years ago requesting action be taken against the settlers .
This led former Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz to order the demolition of Havot Ma’on settlement but the demolition never took place .
The Israeli Knesset , or parliament , also ordered the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) to escort children to and from school to protect them from the settlers .
But according to international members of the Christian Peacemaker Teams ( CPT ) who live in the village , the IDF patrols are irregular , unreliable , and sometimes sources of hostility toward the children .
The CPT have created their own school escorts for the children , and have themselves been assaulted by the settlers .
One member received head injuries severe enough to require hospitalization .
The Israeli police seem disinterested .
“ It does n’t help if we go to the police because they never do anything , ” Hreini told IPS .
The Israeli rights group Yesh Din has stated repeatedly that only a very small number of settler attacks against Palestinians are investigated by the Israeli police .
These result in even fewer arrests and practically no convictions .
Radio Legend Paul Harvey Dies
The " Rest of the Story " host became the most familiar voice in American radio .
March 1 , 2009  --
The " most listened to man " in broadcasting passed away Saturday .
After more than seven decades on the air , venerable radioman Paul Harvey 's folksy speech and plain talk are no more .
Harvey died at the age of 90 at a hospital near his winter home in Phoenix .
His death came nine months after that of his wife , Lynne Cooper Harvey , whom he often called " Angel " on air , and who was also his business partner and the first producer ever inducted in the the Radio Hall of Fame .
She died in May 2008 at age 92 .
" My father and mother created from thin air what one day became radio and television news , " Paul Harvey Jr. said Saturday .
" So , in the past year , an industry has lost its godparents .
And , today millions have lost a friend . "
Harvey 's career in radio spanned more than 70 years , and his shows " News & Comment " and " Rest of the Story " made him a familiar voice in Americans ' homes across the country .
From his humble beginnings as a teenager helping out cleaning up at a local radio station , Harvey went on to have his broadcasts carried by 1,350 commercial radio stations , as well as 400 stations of the Armed Forces Radio Service , and he was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1990 .
" Paul Harvey was one of the most gifted and beloved broadcasters in our nation 's history , " said ABC Radio Networks President Jim Robinson in a statement released Saturday .
" As he delivered the news each day with his own unique style and commentary , his voice became a trusted friend in American households .
" Countless millions of listeners were both informed and entertained by his ' News & Comment ' and ' Rest of the Story ' features , " Robinson said .
" Even after the passing of his loving wife Angel in May 2008 , Paul would not slip quietly into retirement as he continued to take the microphone and reach out to his audience .
We will miss our dear friend tremendously and are grateful for the many years we were so fortunate to have known him .
Our thoughts and prayers are now with his son Paul Jr. and the rest of the Harvey family . "
Former President George W. Bush said he and former first lady Laura Bush were saddened to hear of Harvey 's death .
" Paul was a friendly and familiar voice in the lives of millions of Americans , " Bush said in a statement released late today .
" His commentary entertained , enlightened , and informed .
Laura and I are pleased to have known this fine man , and our thoughts and prayers are with his family . "
Bush presented Harvey with the nation 's highest civilian honor , the medal of freedom , in November 2005 .
Harvey entertained and informed generations of Americans by paying attention to the people and places most others overlooked .
Born in Oklahoma in 1918 , he was broadcasting from Tulsa by age 14 .
His love and respect for simple American values permeated his broadcasts , and he celebrated that life .
" Emporia , Kan. , is home to this state 's national champion honeymooners : Margaret and Joe Pearson , " he said in one broadcast .
" Theirs has endured 72 years . "
Harvey started working at a local radio station at the suggestion of one of his high school teachers .
He started out just helping clean up , but soon was on the air himself , filling in with reading the news or commercials .
After a stint at radio station KFBI in Abilene , Kansas , he moved to KXOK in St. Louis .
By 1940 , Paul Harvey 's easy wit and laconic speech made him Chicago 's most popular newscaster and gave him his own show .
He also settled down with Cooper , whom he had met the year before .
Harvey said he invited her to dinner , proposed to her after a few minutes of conversation and from that moment on called her Angel .
Cooper was credited with coming up with many of the programming innovations that became Harvey 's trademarks .
Among her ideas were the concepts of including news features within hard - news broadcasts and the humorous " kicker , " which became a Paul Harvey trademark .
She also developed and edited her husband 's best - known feature , " The Rest of the Story . "
In 1951 , " Paul Harvey News " went national with broadcasts stretching coast - to - coast and reaching millions of listeners each night .
Though he broadcast six days a week for more than half a century , it never seemed like hard work .
His gift for drawing in listeners and making them see what he did was an art form .
Harvey explained it simply : " As a boy , I fell in love with words and ran away from home and joined the radio .
And it really was something . "
By the early 1960's , Harvey was trying his hand at television .
He conducted interviews from the floor of the Republican National Convention in Chicago .
Angel produced the 1968 television series " Paul Harvey Comments " that ran without interruption for 20 years in national syndication .
But television was not quite suited to Harvey 's brand of storytelling .
In a medium meant to convey images , his power was in conjuring them out of thin air .
He , better than anyone , understood this and said as much in a speech he gave in 2003 .
" You trust me to paint pictures on the mirror of your mind , " he said , " and I will let you feel such agony and ecstasy ... as you would never be able to feel by looking at it . "
Over the years , Harvey won nearly every honor or accolade imaginable .
He was named Salesman of the Year , Commentator of the Year , Person of the Year , Father of the Year , and American of the Year .
He was elected to the National Association of Broadcasters Radio Hall of Fame and Oklahoma Hall of Fame and appeared on the Gallup poll list of America 's most admired men .
In addition he has received 11 Freedom Foundation Awards as well as the Horatio Alger Award .
In 2005 , he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the United States ' most prestigious civilian award , by President George W. Bush .
Paul Harvey 's particular style relied on exaggerated pronunciation , pregnant pauses , delayed revelations and a staccato delivery .
His quirky openings and catchphrases were often parodied -- " Hello , Americans , this is Paul Harvey !
Stand by … for News ! " -- but his rapt audience ate it up .
This devoted following made him an advertiser 's dream :
He could as effortlessly weave a pitch into his program as he could capture images in words that lingered in his listeners ' minds .
His programs , " News and Comment " and " The Rest of the Story " , were carried on the ABC Radio Network and could be heard Monday through Saturday for more than five decades .
" The Rest of the Story , " a look behind the stories of events and people , was developed and produced by Harvey 's only son , Paul , Jr .
At the age of 82 , when most broadcasters have long been off the air , Paul Harvey signed a 10 - year contract with ABC Radio in 2000 .
An executive with another network , who had hoped to sign Harvey to a deal , said " Call me when the contract 's over so I can try again . "
Traug Keller , then president of ABC Radio Networks , explained the rationale behind the 10 - year deal .
" Paul Harvey is , without question , one of the most influential Americans of our time , " Keller said .
" In fact , political adviser and communications specialist Frank Mankiewicz noted that Paul Harvey 's name appears most often in lists of the 10 most influential opinion - shapers of each decade since the 1930s . "
Harvey 's voice was carried on more than 1,200 radio stations , 400 Armed Forces Network stations that broadcast around the world and 300 newspapers .
The program also aired twice daily on the Internet , bringing the wit and wisdom of Paul Harvey to a whole new audience .
All told , with more than 25 million listeners tuned in each week , Paul Harvey was the largest one - man network in the world .
A Chicagoan throughout his life , Paul Harvey resisted offers to move the broadcasts to New York .
" That would never have been a good choice ; I would have lost touch with so much of the country had I done that , " he told The Chicago Tribune in 2002 .
" From here I think I can see the world with a wider lens . "
Fellow broadcaster Bob Sirott summed up Harvey 's longevity to The Tribune succinctly and simply : " He stands for the America that sits west of the Hudson . "
Good day , Paul Harvey .
Good day .
A content - tracking software company wants the internet 's biggest advertising networks to siphon money from advertising on copyright - infringing websites and divert it to the material 's original owners .
No major ad network has signed up yet .
Attribute is forming the Fair Syndication Network , a grouping of publishers who will use Attribute 's content - tracking technology to identify websites which use whole chunks of other people 's material in order to attract advertising .
The Network will then try to divert advertising money from those sites to the creators of the content .
" What if you received a portion of the ad revenue from the reusing party whenever a full copy of your content is found on another site ? " says Attribute 's description of the Fair Syndication Network .
" Technology now exists that can identify your content wherever it is monetized and ensure that you get your fair share from the ad networks serving the ads . "
To ensure that creators get their ' fair share ' , though , the Network will have to persuade advertising networks to divert money from website owners to the original creators of content .
The system is designed to divert money to content creators from spam blogs , websites which simply reproduce masses of content in full in a bid to appear like news sites and attract pay per click advertising from the major ad networks , such as Yahoo ! 's or Google's .
Technology news publisher Techcrunch was invited to a demonstration of the system and said that Attribute surveyed such sites and found that 94 % of the sites were served ads by one of the three biggest networks : Yahoo ! , DoubleClick and AdSense .
Google acquired DoubleClick in 2008 and AdSense is Google 's advertising programme for publishers .
The Network aims to convince those three networks that when ad money is earned by sites that take content without permission , some of that money should be diverted to content creators .
Attribute chief executive told the Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) , that although it is in discussions with major ad networks , none has yet signed up .
He told the paper that he believed the US 's Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) created ad network liability when networks were informed that sites breached copyright law .
One problem automated systems face is that copyrighted material can be legally used under exceptions to copyright laws , such as those for news reporting .
The Attribute system would only register uses of material above a certain word limit and would ignore excerpts within quotation marks to try to take account of ' fair use ' exceptions .
The biggest content producer that has signed up to the Network is news agency Reuters .

Britain is on " constant alert " over the threat of deadly swine flu spreading from Mexico , Health Secretary Alan Johnson said today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Johnson confirmed that a man taken to hospital after arriving at Heathrow on a flight from Mexico City yesterday did not have the H1N1 strain of the virus , which has been blamed for more than 80 deaths in the central American country .
The Health Secretary told BBC1's The Politics Show he had no doubt that there would be more cases of travellers coming into the UK with flu - like symptoms and promised that they will be examined " very , very quickly " by the NHS .
But he said that , so far , no cases of swine flu have been confirmed in Britain or the rest of Europe .
The NHS has a stockpile of more than £ 500 million worth of the Tamiflu anti-viral drug which has proved effective on patients in Mexico , and scientists are working on developing a vaccine against the new strain , said Mr Johnson .
The World Health Organisation rated Britain as one of the two countries best prepared for an outbreak , alongside France .
The global health watchdog today warned countries around the world to look out for unusual flu cases as the outbreak spread to the USA and probably New Zealand , where a group of 10 students is ill after a school trip to Mexico .
Israel 's Health Ministry has reported one suspected case and France is investigating four possible cases .
A male air steward was taken to hospital yesterday after complaining of flu - like symptoms when he arrived at Heathrow on board a British Airways flight from Mexico City , but laboratory tests at a north London hospital today showed that he does not have swine flu .
WHO director - general Margaret Chan said the outbreak , caused when the H1N1 strain associated with pigs crossed over to the human population , constituted a " public health emergency of international concern " .
Nations will be expected to step up reporting and surveillance of the contagious respiratory disease , which she said had " pandemic potential " .
Health authorities were monitoring the situation as tests were carried out to assess the potential of the virus to spread .

Mr Johnson told the BBC : " The WHO says that the UK and France are the two best - prepared countries in the world and we have about half a billion pounds worth of the anti-viral which has worked in Mexico .
" The good news from Mexico is that , given anti-virals like Tamiflu early enough , the people who get this recover .
" We have got a whole range of measures in place .
The thing that has to happen now is the WHO must give an analysis that shows whether there is a propensity for this to spread .
" We have a stockpile of the drugs and we have an agreement with a manufacturer so as soon as the scientists can find a vaccine , they can produce it . "
Mr Johnson ruled out a travel ban to try to prevent the virus being brought to the UK from Mexico by plane .
" That is usually futile and does n't work at all , and it causes so many other problems that it really is not part of the planning , " he said .
The advice for anyone experiencing symptoms including fever and fatigue after travelling abroad was to stay at home and contact the NHS Direct telephone helpline , he said .
" If you have flu - like symptoms , do n't go to your GP but stay at home and call NHS Direct ...
The whole point about these kinds of epidemics is you do n't want to spread them and you spread them by going out and mixing with other people . "
The UK Health Protection Agency said it was keeping a close eye on the situation .
A spokesman said : " The HPA is monitoring this situation closely and is working with the UK Government to review the current incident and any threat it poses to UK public health . "
There was currently a " very low level " of flu activity in the UK , according to the HPA , which added that H1N1 was treatable with antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza .
" The HPA and the NHS have systems in place , which will alert public health authorities of any unusual strain circulating in the UK , " it said .
Britons are not currently being advised to avoid travelling to affected areas of Mexico and the US , although anyone visiting those destinations or who has recently returned should consult a doctor if they experience flu - like symptoms .
To prevent the spread of illness , the HPA advised people to cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing , to throw away dirty tissues promptly and carefully , and to wash hands and surfaces which are regularly touched .
Scotland 's health secretary later revealed that two people have been admitted to a Scottish hospital after returning from Mexico with flu - like symptoms .
Nicola Sturgeon said the pair - who arrived in Scotland on April 21 - had not been in an area affected by recent outbreaks of swine influenza .
She said : " The patients have displayed mild flu - like symptoms and their current condition is not causing concern . "
Britons planning to travel to Mexico were warned about the swine flu outbreak there .
The latest advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated : " Visitors to Mexico should be aware of an outbreak of influenza .
" The Federal Health Ministry issued a nationwide alert on April 22 after learning that a number of people had died from what appears to be a new form of influenza .
" Cases have been reported in Mexico City , together with the states of Oaxaca , San Luis Potosi , Mexicali and Baja California .
" Travellers should consult a doctor immediately if they show signs of flu - like symptoms .
" The Mexican Secretariat of Health has advised people to avoid large crowds , shaking hands , kissing people as a greeting , or using the subway .
" Maintaining a distance of at least six feet from other persons and frequent hand washing may decrease the risk of exposure . "
Nicky Paull , president of the British Veterinary Association , said scientists would work together to study the virus .
She told Sky News : " Our role will continue in the background and the ongoing surveillance that we are doing in Europe and particularly in the UK will continue , but certainly from what we are hearing here today it very much now appears to be a human problem .
" We have amazing facilities in the UK , for instance at Weybridge , the laboratories there will be working on this .
" I am sure that the veterinary profession , the scientists if you like , will be working on this alongside the human ones because of the expertise that we will already have in identifying influenza in animals .
" So they will be looking at the fine - tuning and looking exactly at the genetic make - up of these viruses . "
Mrs Paull added that eating pork products did not pose a risk , especially if people chose British meat .
" There is always concern because I know during avian influenza there was concern about handling meat , " she said .
" I am almost certain that there is nothing to be concerned about but where people are concerned , if they go for the quality standard mark they know that 's British and we know for sure that in Britain we do not have that problem at this moment in time . "
The Government 's chief veterinary officer Nigel Gibbens added his reassurances , saying : " There is continual surveillance of pigs in this country and there is currently no evidence of this variant of the disease .
" Swine influenza can not be transmitted by eating pork products .
" Eating properly handled and cooked pork and pork products is perfectly safe .
" Existing EU rules which prevent imports of all live pigs and pig meat from Mexico into the EU will continue to be upheld . "
In another “ Freakonomics ” - style study that turns conventional wisdom about public - versus private - school education on its head , a team of University of Illinois education professors has found that public - school students outperform their private - school classmates on standardized math tests , thanks to two key factors : certified math teachers , and a modern , reform - oriented math curriculum .
Sarah Lubienski , a professor of curriculum and instruction in the U. of I. College of Education , says teacher certification and reform - oriented teaching practices correlated positively with higher achievement on the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) exam for public - school students .
“ According to our results , schools that hired more certified teachers and had a curriculum that de-emphasized learning by rote tended to do better on standardized math tests , ” Lubienski said .
“ And public schools had more of both . ”
To account for the difference in test scores , Lubienski and her co-authors , education professor Christopher Lubienski ( her husband ) and doctoral student Corinna Crane , looked at five critical factors : school size , class size , parental involvement , teacher certification and instructional practices .
In previous research , the Lubienskis discovered that after holding demographic factors constant , public school students performed just as well if not better than private schools students on standardized math tests .
“ There are so many reasons why you would think that the results should be reversed – that private schools would outscore public schools in standardized math test scores , ” she said .
“ This study looks at the underlying reasons why that ’s not necessarily the case . ”
Of the five factors , school size and parental involvement “ did n’t seem to matter all that much , ” Lubienski said , citing a weak correlation between the two factors as “ mixed or marginally significant predictors ” of student achievement .

They also discovered that smaller class sizes , which are more prevalent in private schools than in public schools , significantly correlate with achievement .
“ Smaller class size correlated with higher achievement and occurred more frequently in private schools , ” Lubienski said .
“ But that does n’t help explain why private schools were being outscored by public schools . ”
Lubienski said one reason private schools show poorly in this study could be their lack of accountability to a public body .
“ There ’s been this assumption that private schools are more effective because they ’re autonomous and do n’t have all the bureaucracy that public schools have , ” Lubienski said .
“ But one thing this study suggests is that autonomy is n’t necessarily a good thing for schools . ”
Another reason could be private schools ’ anachronistic approach to math .

“ Private schools are increasingly ignoring curricular trends in education , and it shows , ” Lubienski said .
“ They ’re not using up - to - date methods , and they ’re not hiring teachers who employ up - to - date lesson plans in the classroom .
When you do that , you are n’t really taking advantage of the expertise in math education that ’s out there . ”
Lubienski thinks one of the reasons that private schools do n’t adopt a more reform - minded math curriculum is because some parents are more attracted to a “ back - to - basics ” approach to math instruction .
The end result , however , is students who are “ prepared for the tests of 40 years ago , and not the tests of today , ” she said .
Tests like NAEP , Lubienski said , have realigned themselves with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics standards for math instruction , which have moved away from the brute - force memorization of numbers to an emphasis on “ geometry , measurement and algebra – things that private school teachers reported they spent less time teaching , ” Lubienski said .
“ The results do seem to suggest that private schools are doing their own thing , and that they ’re less likely to have paid attention to curricular trends and the fact that math instruction and math tests have changed , ” she said .
Lubienski cautioned that the relationships found between the two factors and public - school performance might not be directly causal .
“ The correlations might be a result , for example , of having the type of administrator who makes teacher credentials and academics the priority over other things , such as religious education , ” she said .
“ That 's often not the case for private religious schools , where parents are obviously committed to things beside academic achievement . ”
The schools with the smallest percentage of certified teachers – conservative Christian schools , where less than half of teachers were certified – were , not coincidentally , the schools with the lowest aggregate math test scores .
“ Those schools certainly have the prerogative to set different priorities when hiring , but it just does n’t help them on NAEP , ” Lubienski said .
Lubienski also noted that public schools tend to set aside money for teacher development and periodic curriculum improvements .
“ Private schools do n’t invest as much in the professional development of their teachers and do n’t do enough to keep their curriculum current , ” she said .
“ That appears to be less of a priority for them , and they do n’t have money designated for that kind of thing in the way public schools do . ”
Lubienski hopes that politicians who favor more privatization would realize that the invisible hand of the market does n’t necessarily apply to education .
“ You can give schools greater autonomy , but that does n’t mean they ’re going to use that autonomy to implement an innovative curriculum or improve the academics of the students , ” she said .
Instead , some private schools try to attract parents by offering a basic skills curriculum , or non-academic requirements , such as students wearing uniforms .
Privatization also assumes that parents can make judgments about what schools are the best for their children .
“ With schools , it ’s tough to see how much kids are actually learning , ” Lubienski said .
“ Market theory in education rests on the assumption that parents can see what they ’re buying , and that they ’re able to make an informed decision about their child ’s education .
Although parents might be able to compare schools ’
SAT scores , they are n’t able to determine whether those gains are actually larger in higher scoring schools unless they know where students start when they enter school .
People do n’t always pick the most effective schools . ”
The results were published in a paper titled “ Achievement Differences and School Type : The Role of School Climate , Teacher Certification , and Instruction ” in the November 2008 issue of the American Journal of Education .
The published findings were based on fourth - and eighth - grade test results from the 2003 NAEP test , including data from both student achievement and comprehensive background information drawn from a nationally representative sample of more than 270,000 students from more than 10,000 schools .

When Henry II bellowed " Who will rid me of this turbulent priest ? " and four of his knights journeyed to Kent to murder Thomas a Becket , he famously showed abject contrition by walking to Canterbury in sackcloth and ashes .
When Jacqui Smith 's petty tantrums at leaks from the Home office set in chain a series of events that ended in a posse of Counter Terrorism officers journeying to Kent to arrest Damian Green , we saw no such contrition .
Her responses went from " I did n't know , " to " It 's not my responsibility , " to " It would have been irresponsible not to have done it . "
That last claim was based on the assertion that national security was at risk .
Let us put to one side the Home Secretary 's inability to distinguish the nation 's security from her own political insecurity , and consider the facts from a man who is both independent and has all the facts , the Director of Public Prosecutions .
He said , " I have concluded that the information leaked was not secret information or information affecting national security .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" It did not relate to military , policing or intelligence matters .
It did not expose anyone to a risk of injury or death .
Nor , in many respects , was it highly confidential .
Much of it was known to others outside the civil service , for example , in the security industry or the Labour Party or Parliament .
Moreover , some of the information leaked undoubtedly touched on matters of legitimate public interest , which were reported in the press . "
Throughout this case Ministers have tried to imply that there was some hidden sinister aspect to this case .
Indeed , the letter to the police from the Cabinet Office said in terms that there was a threat to national security .
We now know that this was untrue , that it was either a lie or a piece of remarkable incompetence .
So how did it happen ?
What the combination of the Damian McBride affair and the Damian Green affair tells us is that a culture of vindictiveness has grown up , in Whitehall in general and the Cabinet Office in particular .
It is a culture that can only have originated from ministers and special advisers , since it is so at odds with the traditions of our Civil Service .
Indeed , the increasingly habitual use of the full power of the state to attack opponents of the government , be they whistleblowers or political rivals , is inimical to our entire liberal democratic tradition .
There are a number of questions left unresolved .
Firstly we have not established whether Ministers were knowledgeable about these decisions and actions ; and if they were not , why not ?
Police operational independence does not absolve Ministers from accountability .
Are we seriously to believe that in the six month gestation of this case , no minister was consulted at any time ?
Former Home Secretaries of both parties have said to me they are astonished that Jacqui Smith did n't know what was happening .
She should have done .
We also still have the unresolved question of Parliamentary privilege , which was undoubtedly breached in pursuit of this case .
It is the responsibility of Parliament and a free press to hold Government to account .
When Governments lie or conceal information , as this one has done systematically , it is necessary to publish information from whistleblowers .
They will not be possible if the police can seize parliamentary files whenever they feel like it .
Parliament also needs to consider the question of when criminal law can be used to protect confidential government information .
If an employee leaks confidential information when working for a private company or individual - a celebrity 's nanny , for example - they get the sack .
They do not get arrested .
Government is only different in very limited circumstances , essentially involving national security .
Those limited circumstances do not extend to protecting Labour politicians from embarrassment and exposure of their failures .
That is why the Damian Green affair is the second major case attempting to use " misconduct in public office " to gag whistleblowers to collapse in twelve months .
This law is antiquated , anachronistic , and has become a discretionary power for the Executive rather than a reliable protection for the people .
It is time it was revoked or rewritten .
After all , if we took the law literally , namely " misconduct in public office " , this week we might end up arresting the Home Secretary .

Touring his Birmingham - area district today , U.S. Rep. Spencer Bachus started the day in Trussville , where he treated a breakfast of municipal and county leaders to his thoughts on guns , socialists and the federal budget .
As for President Barack Obama , the Vestavia Hills Republican said he has " some hope . "
" He 's a better listener than George W. Bush , " Bachus said .
" He tries to get ideas from people . "
But he said he is worried that he is being steered too far by the Congress : " Some of the men and women I work with in Congress are socialists . "
Asked to clarify his comments after the breakfast speech at the Trussville Civic Center , Bachus said 17 members of the U.S. House are socialists .
Bachus did not support small city officials who asked if he would oppose all gun bans .
Instead , he said , it may be necessary to support some assault weapon bans in order to keep all guns from being outlawed .

ORLEANS , France ( Reuters ) - Workers at a French pharmaceutical factory took their manager hostage on Tuesday in a protest over planned job cuts , police said .
The employees are demanding improved layoff terms after the company said it wanted to make 110 of the 235 staff redundant at the 3 M site in Pithiviers , south of Paris , because of falling demand .
“ If they want to reorganise their business , let them pay for it , ” union representative Jean - Francois Caparros told reporters .
The move follows a similar incident at a Sony factory in southwest France earlier this month , when angry employees detained the chief executive and human resources director of the Japanese group ’s French arm overnight at its plant at Pontonx - sur - l ’ Adour to secure improved layoff terms .
France is the sixth biggest market for U.S. technology group 3 M with 2007 sales of more than a billion euros .
It employs 2,800 staff in the country with eight industrial sites , according to the group ’s website .
An estimated 5,500 employees at 120 school districts in the state were recently handed pink slips warning them they may not have jobs next school year , an Arizona Republic survey has found .
About 4,000 of those employees are teachers .
Most school districts have issued layoff notices because they still do not have a state budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 .
They also had to comply with a state law requiring them to tell teachers by April 15 whether their jobs might be cut .
A few districts , such as Mesa Public Schools , also note that they are coping with sharp declines in enrollment .
That means they 'll get less state funding .
Many district governing boards waited until the last two weeks , hoping that the Legislature and Gov. Jan Brewer would hand them a budget sooner than later .
School district officials and board members said they had to estimate future funding based on conversations with legislators and lobbyists .
Districts believe they will receive 10 to 15 percent less state money than the current school year because of a looming $ 3.3 billion state revenue shortfall .
They purposely overestimated the severity of the state cuts as a precaution .
Districts have promised they will try to rehire the laid - off instructors this summer , when they have an official budget .
Consequences
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne has said these preemptive layoffs have spread unnecessary fear .
" It 's very damaging to give notices , layoffs , to teachers who they 're going to hire back , " Horne said .
It 's ruining morale , he said , and chasing some qualified teachers out of education , or at least out of the state .
But education groups argue that districts had to take action or risk lawsuits for breaching contracts .
The state teachers union , the Arizona Education Association , said the full scope of layoffs is much more dire after conducting its own survey of 36 districts .
The teachers union believes up to 10,000 school employees will be out of jobs next year .
" There 's no exaggeration , " Arizona Education Association spokesman John Hartsell said .
The Legislature in late January " claimed it would cut education by $ 991 million , " Hartsell said .
Schools make up about 43 percent , or $ 4 billion , of the state budget .
Ways to save
Arizona has a vast spectrum of districts , from the small and rural to the large and urban .
Their measures to address the projected deficit vary , from pay cuts to shorter workweeks to furloughs .
Fowler Elementary District in Phoenix did n't issue any layoffs but cut 13 positions through attrition , said Superintendent Marvene Lobato .
Chino Valley Unified School District , north of Prescott and Payson , will have a four - day school week .
In Mayer Unified School District , officials said the superintendent has accepted a pay cut to keep teachers on board .
Union input
Some districts have talked with their local union to target cuts .
Several , including Paradise Valley Unified School District , decided against renewing agreements with teachers on one - year contracts brokered through phased retirement firms .
The Arizona Education Association argues that those employees , although many have 25 years - plus in education , are just on contract and are n't entitled to jobs that could be taken by younger teachers .
Paradise Valley Unified is not renewing contracts with 300 such retiring teachers .
Horne warned that districts should n't cut their most experienced staff .
" It 's a myth that they have to lay off by seniority , " he said .

Now one can take the position that Grayson is merely trying to score points , but I do n’t see it that way .
Instead , he is trying to make a response to a basic and unanswered question :
Who were these people who wrecked AIG and other companies ?
How did it come about ?
And was the nature of their actions such that they should be permanently barred from the securities and banking industries ?
Now I have said repeatedly the reason no one wants to pursue this line of action is that it is likely to reveal fraud , including at high levels ( remember , post Sarbox CEOs and CFOs are now required to certify financial statements ) and Team Obama does not want to do anything that would jeopardize confidence in the financial system .
But this is completely wrong - headed ; the reason there is no trust is the public at large sees considerable evidence of malfeasance .
So the confidence is already gone , and an organized process to root out at least the worst instances of rot would be salutary .
Ah , but we do n’t take down banksters in this country .
The only major case was Mike Milken , who did engage in less than above board behavior ( I know someone who joined the firm and resigned at the end of his first day based on what he saw ) , but Drexel was also shaking up the status quo , so the interests of enforcing the law happened to coincide with the interests of defending the Wall Street establishment .
Why , for instance , was n’t there an effort to keep the crowd at LTCM from ever setting up a hedge fund again ?
Given the unregulated nature of hedge funds , that might have been hard to do , but pretty diligent discovery ( the fact gathering that happens once a suit has been filed and the defendants are required to respond to prosecution demands for information ) would probably have uncovered enough dirt to make it very difficult for them to ever raise money in meaningful amounts again .
Consider Bankers Trust .
As far as I am concerned , Proctor & Gamble did not have a case , yet they prevailed ( in that they got a very favorable settlement ) and wound up bringing down BT .
Look at the fact set :
The root cause appears to have been that BT ’s clients felt that BT had unfairly exploited their comparative lack of sophistication in handling these sophisticated derivative products .
For example , Procter & Gamble ( P&G ) , the client whose case received the most publicity , had entered into complex interest - rate derivatives transactions with the bank .
These transactions represented a bet on P&G ’s part that U.S. interest rates would remain stable , or decline , over the transaction period .
If interest rates rose , however , P&G would lose a substantial amount of money .
In addition , P&G made its bets more aggressive by leveraging its positions twenty - to - one .
Levered twenty to one ?
P&G had a treasury that was punting , not hedging , lost out , and decided to go after BT .
Now knowing BT , the derivatives were overpriced ( they had a reputation for that sort of thing among dealers ) , but P&G ’s officers also have a duty of care , and buying something they did n’t understand and then gearing it up heavily would seem to run seriously afoul of that .
But P&G hit pay dirt , and unearthed hugely embarrassing tape recordings in fact discussing overpricing and other not so nice behavior towards customers .
That pretty much killed BT as a derivatives trader , which had become its core business , and it was acquired by Deutsche Bank .
A serious investigation of LTCM , whether criminal ( a creative prosecutor could come up with something that would have passed summary judgment ) or Congressional hearings would have been salutary .
It would have made it clear that taking undue risk with customer money could do permanent damage to one ’s career .
But no , making them take what they considered to be inadequate pay to wind down the operation ( there was much bitching and moaning on this point , ) was deemed sufficient punishment .
Now one can argue that LTCM did not have a corrupt culture like BT , but Roger Lowenstein , a mere journalist with no discovery powers , found that in the later days LTCM was punting , taking massive bets in markets where it had no historical data ( which is contrary to its sales pitch to investors ) .
Of course , it is n’t clear whether deterrence works against white collar criminals , but the flip side is William Bratton style zero tolerance policing was successful in seemingly ungovernable New York .
The theory was that allowing minor infractions , like window breaking , to go unpunished sent a very visible signal that misdeeds were tolerated .
Of course , zero tolerance was n’t the only technique used by Bratton ( he also was big on flexible deployment , shifting officers to neighborhoods that suffered an increase in crime ) , but it is considered to be an effective policing tool .
And Wall Street is so far from having any meaningful policing that it ’s a joke .
It seems anything short of regulatory or legal moves that limit career options ( read future earning power ) is an insufficient disincentive to risky trader and investor behavior .
A federal judge in Denver has declined to toss out a lawsuit against four U.S. Secret Service agents who arrested a man in Beaver Creek in 2006 after he approached then - Vice President Dick Cheney to criticize the Iraq war .
U.S. District Judge Christine Arguello issued her ruling from the bench this morning and said a jury is going to have to decide the case .
“ There are too many disputed issues of material fact to grant summary judgment in this case , ” Arguello said .
Steven Howards sued the four agents claiming they violated his civil rights after he was arrested for allegedly harassing Cheney in June 2006 .
Howards said he simply walked up to Cheney in the Beaver Creek shopping mall , touched him and said his policy in Iraq was “ disgusting . ”
The U.S. Attorney ’s Office and the Eagle County District Attorney declined to pursue a criminal case against Howards .
The Secret Service agents gave conflicting accounts of the incident in depositions taken by attorneys in the civil case .
But the agents said a number of factors led them to be suspicious of Howards , starting with a cellphone call he made as he spotted Cheney in the Beaver Creek shopping mall .
During the call , Howards said he was going to ask Cheney “ how many kids he killed today . ”
Howards then walked up to Cheney , touched him and made his opposition to the war known .
But the agents say Howards raised their suspicions because he lingered in the mall , was carrying a shopping bag with unknown contents and refused to cooperate when they tried to question him about whether he assaulted Cheney or not .
Howards said he walked away from Cheney , then came back toward the vice president because he was looking for his son , who had accompanied him to the mall .
Judge Arguello said she was concerned about the possibility that Howards ’ conversation on his cellphone — which is protected under the First Amendment — may have inspired the agents ’ actions .
“ It is very troubling to this court , ” she said .
“ ( The call ) was nothing threatening to the vice president , but it clearly demonstrates opposition to the war in Iraq . ”
A trial is expected to begin Sept. 28 .

Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Sets Off Publishing Mashup Frenzy
by L. Ron Creepweans
The forthcoming publication of Jane Austen and Seth Grahame - Smith 's Pride and Prejudice and Zombies has set off a frenzy of publishers snapping up the rights to other literary mashups .
" Previously we just considered ' classics ' as these moldy old things we could pawn off on schools and not pay royalties on , " said Metrocorp publisher Eduardo Porcine .
" However , this mashup thing lets us recycle old books for new readers and only pay half royalties .
It 's a win - win situation all around . "
Shortly after the Austen / Seth Grahame - Smith announcement , Spectral books announced the publication of Henry James and Laurell K. Hamilton 's The Portrait of a Lady and Vampires , which the publisher described as being " exactly like the original , but with several hundred additional pages of kinky sex . "
Due out shortly after that is Charles Dickens and Naomi Novik 's A Tale of Two Cities and Four Dragons .
And Mary Shelley and Bruce Sterling 's Frankenstein Weather features the original novel interspersed with Sterling 's long rants on how Victor Frankenstein 's mindset will inevitably lead to global warming , making it indistinguishable from Sterling 's other work .
Other novels scheduled includes Feodor Dostoevsky and Stephen King 's Crime and Punishment and Werewolves , George Eliot and Paul Di Filippo 's Silas Marner vs. The Lizard Men , Jerome K. Jerome and Connie Willis ' Three Men in a Boat and Sea Serpents , Joseph Conrad and John Shirley 's The Demons at the Heart of Darkness , and Herman Melville , H. P. Lovecraft , August Derleth and Brian Lumley 's Moby Dick vs. Cthulhu .
When asked if Moby Dick vs. Cthulhu actually contained any of Lovecraft 's prose , the publisher replied " Well , he did coin the word ' Cthulhu . '
Plus it 's got ' eldritch ' and ' ichorous ' and ' squamous , ' and those are all Lovecraft words . "
Publishers are also buying the rights to mashup media crossover novels , with Leo Tolstoy and Jeff VanderMeer 's War and Peace and Alien and Predator , which follows a fight between the two monsters in early 19th century Russia , slated for publication in 2010 , with James Joyce and Aaron Allston 's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Terminator to follow shortly thereafter .
Finally , Creationist Press announced they were getting into the act with The Bible , Now With Added Dinosaur Attacks .
" Since the earth is only 6,000 years old , it 's obvious that several biblical characters must have fought dinosaurs , " said publisher Hubert Dodd , who indicated Noah would fend off repeated plesiosaur attacks , and that Sampson would slay several Tyrannosaurus Rexes with the jawbone of an ass .
" For a long time , publishing overhead has been eaten up by the editorial expenses of preparing text for publication , " said Porcine .
" Now , thanks to these mashups , half of that expense is going away .
We 're getting closer to that happy , long - awaited day when the publishing industry can finally eliminate writers . "
Universal coverage could help " significantly " reduce health disparities , according to a Commonwealth Fund - supported study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine .
The study , by J. Michael McWilliams , MD , Ph.D. , and colleagues at Harvard University , found that Medicare coverage makes a difference in the health of racial , ethnic and challenged socio-economic populations for patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease .
Based on the study , the authors believe that universal coverage may reduce these types of health disparities in the general population .

The authors reviewed health data from more than 6,000 people aged 40 to 85 with at least one of the following conditions : diabetes , hypertension , coronary heart disease or stroke .
They found that while overall improvements have been made in controlling the diseases , racial , ethnic and socioeconomic differences have remained the same or in some cases worsened in the pre-Medicare population .
However , at age 65 , when people become eligible for healthcare coverage under the Medicare program , those differences were reduced significantly .
The study found that for blood sugar levels with diabetes , educational disparities decreased by 83 percent , while racial and ethnic disparities fell by 78 percent .
For total cholesterol levels , educational disparities disappeared altogether .
And , for systolic blood pressure , racial disparities decreased by 60 percent .
" The results of this study make it clear that guaranteeing access to affordable insurance for all Americans is the essential first step toward a high performing healthcare system and a healthier America , " said Commonwealth Fund President Karen Davis .
" As our leaders look toward health reform it is critical that they take into account the value of healthcare coverage for everyone and ensure that all Americans have the ability to obtain insurance . "
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is weighing whether to deploy 10,000 more troops to Afghanistan but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are questioning an increased commitment and seeking specific measures of progress against the deteriorating conditions in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
When President Obama took office , the U.S. had about 38,000 troops in Afghanistan .
The White House has announced plans to send 21,000 reinforcements in coming months , increasing the tally to almost 60,000 .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korea has moved to allow human stem cell research for the first time since about three years ago when its pre-eminent researcher was accused of fraud for his work in the subject , officials said Wednesday .
South Korea had once been considered a global leader in human embryonic stem cell research until review boards said the team lead by scientist Hwang Woo - suk had manipulated key data in its studies on cloning stem cells , sparking a fraud case that shook the global scientific community .
A presidential bioethics committee said it would allow a medical center to conduct research on producing human stem cells through cloning , while imposing strict oversight conditions on the team , health officials said .
“ We have never technically banned stem cell research but we have always called for strict guidelines , ” said a health official who asked not to be named .
Stem cells are the body ’s master cells , giving rise to all the tissues , organs and blood .
Embryonic stem cells are considered the most powerful kinds of stem cells , as they have the potential to give rise to any type of tissue .
Hwang ’s team was thought to have made two major breakthroughs in the field by cloning stem cells and tailoring them to a specific patient , which raised hopes of generating genetically specific tissue to repair damaged organs or treat diseases such as Alzheimer’s .
South Korea canceled Hwang ’s stem cell research license in March 2006 , a few months after a review panel at Seoul National University , where he had been doing research at the time , said it found fraudulent data in his team ’s reports .
It has not granted a license since then .
Hwang , once hailed as a national hero , has been on trial for the past three years on charges of fraud and violating the country ’s bioethics laws .
Thousands of young protesters ransacked the parliament building in Chisinau on Tuesday , in protest at the results of Sunday 's election .
International observers said the vote appeared to have been fair , but demonstrators accused the authorities of rigging the election , which gave the ruling Communists about 50 % of the vote .
Here , three Chisinau residents describe what happened at the protests and discuss whether they are good for their country .
ALINA MARTINIUC , STUDENT I went to see the protests yesterday .
I got a few messages from colleagues that there 'll be protests , but I did n't know how dangerous it was going to be .
There were scuffles between students and the police .
A colleague of mine was hit by a policeman .
Students were throwing stones at the building , breaking most windows .
Some of my colleagues went in and later said that they went to the 14th floor , smashed everything and put the president 's chair and portrait on fire .
I was afraid and I was just observing what was going on .
I think there were probably a few acts of vandalism , like the breaking of traffic lights , but apart from that , people had a genuine cause for protest .
I was there and I can tell you that the protesters were n't drunk .
How can tens of thousands of people be drunk at the same time ?
My colleagues knew what they were doing and whatever they did was for a good cause .
The students are discontented with the election result .
Most of the people who voted for communism are old people , but old people are dying and there are more young people voting now than before .
So the result is definitely not true .
It 's not logical .
We do n't want to be governed by the communists anymore .
I think the Communist Party should be outlawed , just like the Nazi Party is outlawed in Germany .

I went to the protest during my lunch break .
The protesters were mostly young people .
You could rarely see anyone older .
There are many government buildings in the area and government workers were warned not to attend protests , otherwise they may be fired .
When I arrived , they had just started to throw stones at the building .
Prior to that the police used water to disperse the crowds .
That created tension and that 's what started them going .
I agree with the protesters , but I do n't agree with what they did .
It 's not civilised .
Most of the people in Chisinau voted for the democratic parties .
I 've been asking friends , neighbours , people on the street .
Indeed in the villages , where there are only old people left , most people would vote for the Communist Party .
But the young people of our country want a better life , they can't be satisfied with $ 150 a month .
There is room for [ vote ] fraud .
I think 10 - 15 % is unaccounted for .
I 've visited villages as part of my work , where 200 new names have appeared on election lists with nobody knowing who those people are .
That 's just one example , but also , it is not clear what happens when you change address , or when you go abroad and some of that data can be used to manipulate results .
ANONYMOUS CHISINAU RESIDENT
Thousands of people gathered in Government Square .

I was there for a quick moment .
There were no water jets , [ just ] a few small hoses enough to put out a small fire .
The international media portrays this as a big protest : there could n't have been 20,000 people attending .
The space between the parliament and the presidency is so small , how can there be so many people ?
I 'd say , there were 2,000 people at the most .
I was distressed by the attacks on our president .
It is unacceptable to throw eggs at our national coat of arms .
It is unacceptable to throw rocks on our brothers , the 20 - year - old kids from the national guard .
And it is completely unacceptable to disrespect our national dignity .
Everybody has the right to express their thoughts and beliefs , but this should be done in a respectful way .
I was at the elections and I gave my vote .
It was a great event for us to elect our next parliament .
I have no idea how anyone can succeed in rigging the elections given the presence of a great number of international observers .
People are making these accusations because they are not happy but they have no proof whatsoever .
The Communist Party has invested a lot in the last four years .
They 've invested in people , infrastructure , education , they 've raised the pensions too .
We are a poor country but we are less poor now than four years ago .

Benny Raz is a formidable man , both in appearance and in attitude : an ex-Mossad security agent , his powerful frame is matched by the fire burning in his heart against the rulers of his homeland .
He is engaged in a battle that , in his eyes , is crucial that he win in order to safeguard the future of the state he " dearly loves " .
" If we do n't make peace , the Middle East will explode " , he warns .
" We can't live by the sword forever ; if we do n't deal with the Palestinians [ over a negotiating table ] , they 'll return to terror , and no army can beat terror ; only diplomacy can . "
Raz is , by definition , a settler – albeit an incredibly reluctant one .
He is desperate to relocate his family west of the Green Line , but economic conditions make such a move financially unviable , and he wants the government to enact legislation to help him .
He held rightwing political views for most of his life , " but Rabin 's assassination [ in 1995 ] changed everything " .
Despite his leftward lurch , he continued to live in the settlement of Karnei Shomron , where he had moved in 1992 .
However , three months before the disengagement of 2005 , he realised that the route of the separation wall was going to leave Karnei Shomron on the " wrong " side of the border , a prospect that filled him with dread .
" The state did n't ask me if I minded living to the east of the wall ; they did n't give me a choice in the matter .
There is no security [ for me and my family ] if we live behind the wall – I should n't have to be the shield of the country : that 's the job of the army . "
The developing situation , combined with his new - found belief that the West Bank had to be conceded to the Palestinians if there was ever to be a lasting peace , led Raz to begin a one - man campaign to spur the government into action .
He launched the " Bayit Echad " [ One Home ] movement to try to bring about legislation to compensate settlers who would voluntarily move back to Israel proper , behind the 1967 border .
He is convinced that up to 80 % of settlers in the West Bank would leave if given sufficient financial assistance to do so , " but most of them are too scared to [ stand up and be counted ] " .
Raz has reams of paper containing the names and numbers of scores of settlers who have contacted him via his website , but whose sense of intimidation prevents them publicly joining him in his crusade .
Raz himself has suffered serious abuse at the hands of ideological settlers , who are incandescent at his " traitorous " actions .
" They call me ' Arab ' , ' fascist ' , and worse " , he tells me .
" On one occasion a mob tried to tip over my car with my son and me inside , and on election day I even received a death threat from an opponent " .
Raz carries a pistol with him wherever he goes , " but not to protect me from Palestinians – it's the settlers I have to worry about " , he remarks flatly .
However , the threat of attack has not deterred him ; if anything , it 's made him even more determined to see his plans through to fruition .
" One man offered enough money to buy me out so that I could move out of the West Bank , but I turned him down , " he says .
" This is n't about just me any more – I 'm only one of thousands of settlers who deserve to be compensated .
This is meant to be a democratic country , so no one can just throw money at me to make me shut up . "
He drives me to the Bika region near the Jordan valley , where two policemen were shot dead earlier in the week , and where – according to Raz – dozens of locals are desperate to leave their settlements .
We meet a man who feels utterly betrayed by the state , which he says lured him to live in the area in the 1970s with promises to invest heavily in the region , but never came good , resulting in his sinking into financial dire straits as the local economy steadily collapsed .
He does n't share Raz 's political outlook , but none the less is happy to support the Bayit Echad movement as a means to an end – and it is this kind of cross-political backing that Raz feels can provide his campaign with the clout it requires to force the government 's hand .
" [ The settlement enterprise ] is a house of cards " , Raz says .
" If half the settlers leave , the rest of the project will fall – and that 's a good thing , as this country does not have the luxury of time on its side anymore .
The army is not as strong as it once was , and the pragmatic Arab leaders must be worked with [ rather than ignored ] . "
He is not hopeful of imminent success in the wake of the election results : " Netanyahu is the most dangerous leader Israel could have , and that racist Lieberman is his helper .
They will drag the country back 20 years , " he cautions .
" However , their government will fall within 18 months , since the coalition is too unstable , " he adds hopefully .
While he anticipates the downfall of Bibi 's regime in the next couple of years , he has problems of his own in the immediate term , with funds to continue his campaign running perilously low , and no one to offer assistance .
On top of Bayit Echad 's financial crisis , the two MKs previously putting his case to the Knesset did not get re-elected in February , leaving him even more on the outside .
However , Raz maintains that it will take far worse conditions for him to throw in the towel : " Even if I have to live on bread and water , I will keep fighting .
I live for this struggle – it is vital to my country 's future . "
He is so convinced of his cause that he would take funds from any source , whether friend or foe of Israel , " since the ends justify the means .
The goal is to kickstart the road map ; the goal is to bring peace .
There is no other way " .

BERLIN , March 16 ( UPI ) --
A brothel in Berlin says it is trying to lure recession - wary customers by offering a flat rate for prostitutes with unlimited food and drinks .
The brothel said $ 90 can now purchase time with any of the establishment 's women plus all the food and drinks a customer can consume , during off - peak times , between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekdays , and 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. weekends , Der Spiegel reported Monday .

" Seventy euros ( $ 90 ) , that includes everything -- ladies , drinks and food , " a brothel employee said .
The brothel 's bosses said that as a further measure to attract business , the establishment is now allowing men to bring along their wives to share in the paid - sex experience .
Basem Ibrahim Abu Rahme in a Ramallah hospital after he was killed on 17 April 2009 . ( activestills.org )
Suddenly a tear gas canister whizzes past the camera making an audible “ clunk ” as it hits something to the right .
He tries to let out a scream , but all he manages is a stifled yelp .
One can almost hear his breath being cut short as the projectile punctures his chest .
Another muted scream of pain .
He falls to the ground then jumps up quickly , running a few steps before collapsing again .
His body rolls a few times as he hits the ground , his limbs flapping loosely underneath him .
Two fellow demonstrators run to him , looking almost surprised and unsure of what has just happened .
They turn him over , lifting his shirt and calling his name .
But he is unresponsive .
His eyes are open but his body lies motionless .
His bright yellow shirt now quickly growing a wet red stain over his heart .
And so the occupied people of Palestine sacrifice yet another one of their young men .
Another one .
Again .
Just like that .
In an instant .
Caught live on camera for the world to see .
Twenty - nine - year - old Basem Ibrahim Abu Rahme was later pronounced dead at Ramallah hospital on Friday 17 April 2009 after being shot in the chest with a high - velocity tear gas canister by an Israeli soldier .
A faceless , nameless soldier who will likely never have to explain or account for taking the life of another human being .
Basem posed no threat to the security of Israel as he stood atop that hill .
He was not armed , nor was he throwing stones .
Ironically , he was calling out to the Israeli forces to hold their fire because children and internationals were present , when he was shot .
He was involved in a nonviolent demonstration when his own life was so violently taken .
Basem is the 18th Palestinian to be killed in nonviolent anti-wall protests in the West Bank since 2004 .
For four years now the residents of Bilin have nonviolently protested the annexation of their land by Israel ’s wall .
This barrier has effectively annexed roughly 60 percent of Bilin ’s farming land to the Israeli side .
As this village is almost exclusively sustained by agriculture , it ’s no exaggeration to say that at least 60 percent of its economy has disappeared , with dire consequences for the community ’s socio-economic welfare .
In 2005 the International Court of Justice ruled that the barrier in its entirety is illegal under international law , recommending that Israel halt its construction and demolish the parts that had already been completed .
In addition , the Israeli high court has ruled on three separate occasions that the route of the barrier in Bilin is illegal under Israeli law .
The Israeli army has been ordered more than once to reroute the barrier in order that it not usurp such large tracts of Bilin ’s land .
To date , not a single meter has been removed in Bilin , or anywhere else in the West Bank for that matter .
The Israeli army ’s claim that the wall is a security measure is simply preposterous .
One does n’t have to look far across the barrier in Bilin to see what the land is being stolen for — the extension of yet another illegal settlement .
In this case , the beneficiary of Bilin ’s land is the Matityahu East neighborhood of the Modi ’in Ilit settlement .
Bilin has become somewhat of an inspiration and example in the West Bank for its now famous weekly protests .
The small village has also gained international recognition for its steadfastness and commitment to nonviolent protest , as documented in the award - winning film , Bil ’in My Love .
The villagers , along with international and even Israeli demonstrators , have faithfully upheld their weekly protests every single Friday , without exception , for the last four years .
While these demonstrations are strictly nonviolent and consist mainly of chanting , waving the Palestinian flag and attempting to access the confiscated land , the response from Israeli forces is always harsh .
Every week demonstrators are showered with copious amounts of rubber coated steel bullets and tear gas .
Last year , Israeli soldiers killed four youths in separate incidents in the West Bank village of Nilin , who were also participating in nonviolent protests against the barrier in their village .
Lately , however , Israeli troops have employed a new and deadly tactic in an effort to quell protest .
This involves the use of a new , high - velocity tear gas canister that is being shot directly at protestors .
These canisters are relatively quiet when fired , emitting only a faint smoke trail , which makes them difficult to detect .
In addition , their 400 - meter range makes them lethal when fired directly at people .
This is the same type of tear gas canister that nearly killed 37 - year - old American activist Tristan Anderson in Nilin on 13 March when he was shot directly in the face from 60 meters away .
He remains in a coma in a Tel Aviv hospital .
Designed to be fired upwards in an arc - like projection , Israeli soldiers have realized the deadly potential of these canisters and are using them as bullets .
It is likely yet another attempt by the Israeli army to attempt disguise their intentions by not shooting ordinary ammunition .
While Tristan Anderson remains in a serious coma , he was lucky to escape with his life .
Basem , however , was not as fortunate .
And because he is Palestinian , the mainstream international media will not be interested in his case .
He is simply not important enough .
His story will be relegated to the bottom corner of a back page of a newspaper somewhere , probably in biased language that blames him for his own death — if even that .
As the haunting sound of his last painful screams play over in my head , I wonder just how much more the collective Palestinian spirit can take before another mass uprising .
For now , the resilience of Bilin lives on .
The next day , hundreds turned out for Basem ’s funeral .
His body , draped in the Palestinian flag , Basem was held aloft by mourners as they chanted , “ The martyr is beloved by God , ” eventually bringing him to the final resting place where so many have been taken before .
And while Palestine waits patiently for the international community to stand by its side , the fearless people of Bilin will be out again this Friday .
Ready to sacrifice their blood and their souls for something very simple — just to have returned what has , and always will rightfully be theirs .

Greenpeace wrote to me today .
They said :
Greenpeace Senior Forest Campaigner Rolf Skar was on Fox ’s America ’s Newsroom yesterday morning to talk about Greenpeace ’s new “ Recycled Tissue and Toilet Paper Guide . "
Megyn Kelly issued a challenge to her co-host Bill Hemmer : Could Bill , with his eyes closed , tell the difference between recycled toilet paper and Charmin brand toilet paper , made from 100 percent virgin fiber ( no recycled content ) ?
In the video below , see how Bill thought the recycled paper was actually the fluffy stuff made from ancient forests .
At the 1:19 second mark , after Megyn tells Bill that he thought the recycled toilet paper was actually toilet paper made from 100 percent virgin fiber , he sheepishly responds , “ Did I blow it ? ”
No , Bill , you did n’t blow it .
But brands like Charmin and Cottonelle are blowing it when they destroy ancient forests to make disposable tissue products that are used once and then thrown away .
Greenpeace ’s “ Recycled Tissue and Toilet Paper Guide ” is a credit card - sized shopping guide that helps consumers find the greenest household paper products .
In it , Greenpeace gives a thumbs up to brands Green Forest , Natural Value and Seventh Generation , while recommending that shoppers avoid products like Kleenex , Cottonelle , Viva , and Charmin .
The New York Times did a story on this issue last week in an article “ Mr. Whipple Left It Out : Soft Is Rough on Forests . ”
The reporter , Leslie Kaufman , writes :
But fluffiness comes at a price : millions of trees harvested in North America and in Latin American countries , including some percentage of trees from rare old - growth forests in Canada .
Although toilet tissue can be made at similar cost from recycled material , it is the fiber taken from standing trees that help give it that plush feel , and most large manufacturers rely on them .
Customers “ demand soft and comfortable , ” said James Malone , a spokesman for Georgia Pacific , the maker of Quilted Northern .
“ Recycled fiber cannot do it . ”
Fox ’s Bill Hemmer seems to disagree .
Overview
This majority of the text below was written in 1999 as part of a project for one of my undergraduate Philosophy seminars .
It was later submitted and reviewed by the American Philosophical Association , who considered publishing it in one of their journals — Philosophy of the Gay and Lesbian Experience , I believe it was called — but those plans eventually fell through due to length and other issues .
( In other words , there are no copyright issues with me posting it here . )
The paper is recreated below with its original title , but I have edited some of the content for relevance and to bring it a bit more up - to - date .
However , most of the issues I discussed in 1999 are still quite palpable today , especially in the South .
The crux of this essay is this :
For some time , the main argument against religious fundamentalists and in defense of gay rights has been , essentially " Hey , we 're born this way , so screw you . "
While this argument does raise a few interesting points ( e.g. if we do not accept that a loving God would create people who are hardwired to sin , then perhaps homosexuality is not a " sin " at all ) , it is no where near adequate for addressing the issue and , in my opinion , it does more harm than good .
There are several reasons why this argument is a bad one , the least of which not being that it provides little or no shelter for members of the bisexual and transgendered communities .
If , as the argument implies , it is okay to be gay because one is " born that way , " then the contrapositive must also be implied : if one is not " born gay , " then s/he has no moral basis for justifying a lifestyle other than plain old vanilla heterosexuality .
By ascribing the moral acceptability of certain sexual orientations to a gene ( or set of genes ) , we continue the perception that there is a " natural way " to have sex and , depending on one 's genome , deviance from that natural way is grounds for being branded immoral .
Furthermore , the Argument from Genetics ( as I will come to call it ) ignores the fact that many fundamentalist Christian organizations ( such as P - FOX ) already accept that sexuality is ingrained within our genes , making them immune to any persuasive powers this argument might have had .
In the end , the argument is divisive ( drawing lines between who has the " gay gene " and who does not ) and accomplishes little , which leads me in the end to suggest that it be abandoned altogether .
In an attempt to mold a competing argument , I reach back to one of my favorite philosophers , John Stuart Mill , and invoke his Harm Principle , which basically states , " It is ethical to do X if and only if X harms no one else .
Furthermore , it is unethical to stop a person from doing X if X is not harming anybody . "
I will later refer to this argument as the " Argument from the Lack of Harm " ( in retrospect , a fairly boring name , I must admit ) , suggesting that gay rights advocates cling more to the ethos of Mill 's Harm Principle than to the shaky foundation provided by the Argument from Genetics .
In the end , the point of this exercise is to determine ( 1 ) despite its early success in persuading individuals that homosexuality is not a sin , does the Argument from Genetics continue to serve a useful purpose ; and ( 2 ) does an alternate argument exist that can be used to both further the agenda of human rights activists and persuade individuals who have n't yet made up their minds to move toward tolerance , without unnecessarily dividing the gay / les / bi / trans communities ?
Palestinians inspect a destroyed poultry farm in Gaza . ( Sameh A. Habeeb )
Since the ceasefire was enacted , I have toured throughout Gaza to document some stories and accounts .
Although I wrote many articles , I decided to focus on the untold stories of the war : the brutal massacre of thousands of chickens .
On 5 January , many Israeli tanks , troops and bulldozers advanced into the al - Zeitoun neighborhood south east of Gaza City .
In this area , called al - Samouni , Israel killed 49 members of the Samouni family , after soldiers ordered them to gather into a single home , which was shelled several hours later .
A number of chicken farms are located only a few meters away from the Samouni house .
These farms came under fire by Israeli forces and were totally bulldozed .
Thousands of chickens were caught in their sheds , as the bulldozing destroyed their cages .
Some died immediately , others slowly without food or water for four days .
Abu Ahmed al - Sawafari , an owner of a chicken farms owners , was sitting amidst the rubble of his destroyed farm .
He explained that “ I have been working on that profession for long years .
I have been growing my business by all efforts .
Israelis came then left causing an earthquake in the area .
They have killed these chickens , they are equal to human souls .
They were suffocated and died due to hunger .
I wonder why the Israelis killed these chickens ?
Were they firing rockets into Israel ? ”
I continued touring farms in the area where the smell of death filled the air .
Surviving chickens roamed around surrounded by thousands of their dead kin .
It was an overwhelming scene leaving one to ask only : why ?
If this question was directed to the Israeli army their response would be swift and predictable .
They would likely contend that “ rockets ” were being fired from the farms , or that there were Palestinian resistance fighters in the area .
However , unless the Israeli army is prepared to claim that these chickens were resistance fighters or were firing rockets nothing can explain why the self - proclaimed “ world ’s most moral army ” would engage in the wholesale slaughter of civilians and chickens alike .

Advertisement Trapping and convicting such a devious and determined paedophile as David Bye took a long time and a lot of dedicated police work .
According to specialist officers who led the case against Bye he was , in effect , a " professional paedophile " who made it his life 's work to target , befriend and eventually abuse young children .
Det Insp Diane Davies works in the public protection unit at Dyfed - Powys Police .
As a specialist officer , she is used to dealing with some horrific cases of child abuse and has had to confront some particularly unsavoury and dangerous characters .
Police believe David Bye may have drugged his victims
But she said David Bye stands out above almost all others she 's investigated over many years .
" David Bye would n't do anything so crass or obvious as getting a job working with children , " said Det Insp Davies .
" This is a man who has probably had such tendencies for 20 or 30 years and takes a calculating , long - term approach to his pursuit and abuse of children . "
Bye 's modus operandi , over many years , was essentially the same - to ingratiate himself with young families , winning over the trust of parents who were unaware that he was really only ever interested in their children .
Most recently the 43 - year - old , who spent the week working as a chartered accountant , dedicated much of his spare time helping out with other single parents in a mid Wales community - for legal reasons , we can not say exactly where .
Bye cynically and deliberately used his own young daughter as a means of gaining access to other children .
" Devious and manipulative " is how Det Insp Davies describes the man who portrayed himself as a dedicated father figure , prepared to go the extra mile to help and spend time with vulnerable families and their young children .
All the while , of course , Bye was only after one thing .
There are almost certainly many more of David Bye 's victims out there
Det Insp Diane Davies
As has been the case with other similar crimes , Bye was eventually caught because of and thanks to modern technology .
Thousands of horrific images , showing the abuse of children were found on his computer .
Police had reason to believe that several of the pictures were taken by Bye himself .
The problem was , the detail on the pictures was such that it was impossible to initially tell who the victims were or who the abuser was .
Lengthy interrogation Securing a successful prosecution without a named victim was going to be hard , admitted Det Insp Davies .
Police knew from medical examinations that several young children to whom David Bye had access showed signs of sexual abuse - some had been raped .
None of them though could say for sure that Bye was the abuser .
Officers think he may have drugged them .
By a process of elimination and by closely analysing small details in the photos , Det Insp Davies and her team were able to prove the images could only have been taken in a caravan which Bye was renting , on a camera he owned and when Bye was the only adult present in the caravan .
Faced with such incontrovertible evidence , Bye pleaded guilty to a charge of child rape , yet still he repeatedly refused to tell police who his victims were .
Under lengthy interrogation as police pleaded with him to name his victims so they could be offered medical and psychological help , all David Bye could say was , " No comment " .
As the 44 - year - old appeared at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court for sentencing , Det Insp Davies described him as a " devious chameleon " - someone who over many years had changed his appearance , his job and where he lived in order to pursue and abuse young children .
" There are almost certainly many more of David Bye 's victims out there " , said Det Insp Davies .
" We hope the fact he 's now been put behind bars for a long time , may persuade those ( unknown ) victims and their families to come forward and get the help they need . "

What Are Online Payday Loans ?
One day , you ’re sailing along like normal , going to work every day , listening to music on your commute , and struggling to get the kids to eat their dinner .
The next day , your car has broken down , your oven ’s broken , and you ’re left with a pile of bills on your doorstep .
No matter how well prepared you consider yourself to be , it ’s impossible to ensure that you ’re fully prepared for everything .
That ’s why it ’s so important that you know what you can do if something unexpected comes along to throw your entire life off track .
While one option could be to rush to your bank and see what they can do to help you , like extending your credit card limit , or offering you a personal loan , these solutions are n’t available for everyone .
If you ’ve not got the best credit rating , or you need money faster than you can get it with a traditional bank loan , then you might need to consider a newer , more digital option .
How much would you like to borrow ?
$ 100 $ 200 $ 300 $ 400 $ 500 $ 600 $ 700 $ 800 $ 900 $ 1000 $ 1100 $ 1200 $ 1300 $ 1400 $ 1500 $ 1600 $ 1700 $ 1800 $ 1900 $ 2000 $ 2100 $ 2200 $ 2300 $ 2400 $ 2500 $ 2600 $ 2700 $ 2800 $ 2900 $ 3000 $ 3100 $ 3200 $ 3300 $ 3400 $ 3500 $ 3600 $ 3700 $ 3800 $ 3900 $ 4000 $ 4100 $ 4200 $ 4300 $ 4400 $ 4500 $ 4600 $ 4700 $ 4800 $ 4900 $ 5000 Get Started

That ’s where Payday loans online come in .
The rise of the internet has opened a wide selection of doors in the current landscape .
We ’re in a brand - new world where you can do virtually anything on the web , from hanging out with friends through video chat to posting pictures , and even checking your bank balance .
Some companies have even discovered that by running their business online they can create more convenient and cost - effective services for their clients .
Online payday lending was created to give people around the US a quick , convenient , and affordable way to access money in an emergency .
These loans are designed for emergency situations when you need to borrow money quickly – often within the next 24 hours .
With nothing but a quick and simple application form , you can request your loan from a reputable provider and get the cash in your bank by the next day .
What ’s more , because the payday loans are available online , there ’s no need to waste time phoning any bank branches or visiting people for discussions face to face .
While you might need to answer a few questions over email , or respond to queries from your loan provider , the process of borrowing money is quicker , easier , and more flexible with an online lender .
When Is Online Lending a Good Idea ?
Online lending offers a simple alternative to the complicated and time - consuming of speaking to a bank in branch , or meeting with an offline loan provider .
Most of us are already familiar with the web and all the things that it can do today .
Applying for a loan online is just another way to take advantage of the many benefits of the digital world .
Online lending with a payday provider is usually a good idea for anyone who needs to borrow money online .
Filling out a form and getting the information you need is usually much quicker online than it is in person .
What ’s more when you ’re looking for a loan provider online , you also have a chance to do your research too .
You can take the time to see what the rules and regulations around payday lending look like in your state .
Remember , payday loans are only legal in 27 states , and are available in some capacity within another 9 locations .
You can also check out whether there are a wide range of different loan providers in your area .
If you have more than one lender to choose from , you can compare options until you find the one that can give you the best deal .
The only thing you need to remember about online payday lending is that it ’s designed for people who need a very specific kind of loan .
Just like other payday loans , this lending solution is intended for emergencies when you need money fast .
Though there ’s no minimum on the amount of money you can borrow from most companies , there will be a limit on how much you can get , based on what you earn on a monthly basis .
Another thing to keep in mind is that payday lenders expect you to pay everything back at once .
That means that rather than spreading the cost out of your loan out over several months , you can get rid of all of your debt in one payment , when your next paycheck arrives .
How do You Get an Online Loan ?
One of the benefits of taking out an online payday loan , is that its ’ notoriously easy to find the lending options that you need .
A quick search on Google or your favorite search engine will bring up a list of reputable providers in your area .
Make sure that you take the time to read about the companies that you ’re thinking of lending with .
This will help you to learn a little more about how they work , and what they look for in a customer .
You can even check out some of the reviews and testimonials that have been left by other customers to see whether you can trust the provider or not .
Once you feel comfortable that you ’re getting a good deal from your loan provider , you can sign up for an account on their website and start filling out your application form .
Most application forms from payday loan companies will only ask for basic information on things like :
How much you want to borrow , and when you can pay it back ( your next payday )
How much you earn , and how long you ’ve been employed
Where you live and whether you ’re a US citizen
How old you are ( you need to be a legal adult )
Whether you have any existing bankruptcies or loans
Some loan providers can even help to protect your credit rating by doing a soft check on your credit before they send you an email .
With a soft check , your loan provider can determine whether you ’re likely to be approved for a loan before you complete your application .
Because soft checks do n’t leave any marks on your credit rating , they mean that you can go to another loan provider after trying with soft - check company if you do n’t think you ’re going to be approved .
If you are approved for your loan , then your online loan company will get in touch to iron out the details of your loan with you .
You ’ll often be asked to fill out some kind of form that outlines how you ’re going to make your repayment when your next payday arrives .
Using an automatic digital payment can really speed things up and ensure that you do n’t have to panic about remembering when your payments are due .
Payday Lending is Quick and Simple
Unlike other kinds of lending , $ 4000 loans are some of the most flexible options on the market .
You have the freedom to borrow as little as you like , for a very short period of time .
That means that there ’s no need to worry each month about whether you ’re going to have enough cash to make your repayments after you ’ve finished paying for all of your other bills .
Additionally , many payday loan providers are even willing to consider people who do n’t have the best credit too .
Although payday loan providers will still check your credit rating , they ’re more likely to lend to people with poor credit , because they know that they ’re only borrowing a small amount of cash .
As long as you have a good source of income , and a stable career , then your payday loan provider is likely to trust that you can pay back what you owe .
After all , there ’s less of a chance that something will change in your circumstances if you ’re only borrowing money for a month .
You can even get your loan payout a lot faster with a payday online loan provider than with other kinds of loan companies .
Because everything happens quickly online , most payday providers can get your cash to you within a matter of hours , rather than making you wait days .
If you ’re dealing with an emergency where time is an important factor , a payday loan could be the perfect way to get you back on your feet fast .
You can borrow your money , pay off your bills , and get rid of your debt , all within a matter of weeks .

Außenpolitik à la Bush : Obamas seltsame Rechtsauffassung
Es schien als wollte Obama mit einer weiteren Bush - Entgleisung aufräumen .
Doch verbannt er nur den Begriff " feindliche Kämpfer " , behält aber Bushs Umgang mit Terrorverdächtigen bei .
US - Präsident Barack Obama hat in zahlreichen Fragen bereits deutlich gezeigt , dass er es ernst meint mit dem Wandel , weg von der Ideologisierung der Ära Bush hin zu einer Politik der Vernunft .
Dennoch ist bereits nach 50 Tagen im Amt unübersehbar , dass die neue US - Regierung ausgerechnet bei den bürgerlichen Freiheiten , der präsidialen Machtausübung und der Garantie Verfassungsmäßiger Rechte erschreckend wenig Reformwillen demonstriert .
Zwar hatte Obama unter viel Beifall gleich am ersten Tag im Weißen Haus erklärt , das umstrittene Gefangenenlager auf Guantanamo binnen eines Jahres schließen zu wollen .
Doch was danach kam , gibt wenig Anlaß zum Jubeln .
Am vergangenen Freitag erklärte Obama , dass er den bewußt verwirrenden Terminus “ feindliche Kämpfer ” , den sein Amtsvorgänger George W. Bush nach dem 11 .
September 2001 gefangenen Terrorverdächtigen verpasste , abschaffen werde .
Das klang zunächst vielversprechend .
Bush hatte diesen Begriff geprägt , um mutmaßliche Terroristen entgegen internationalem Recht außerhalb des US - Territoriums zeitlich unbegrenzt und ohne Gerichtsverfahren inhaftieren zu lassen .
Obamas Vorgänger argumentierte , dass die außerhalb eines klassischen " Schlachtfeldes " aufgegriffenen " feindliche Kämpfer " seien , und daher nicht von herkömmlichen Zivilgerichten innerhalb der USA zu verurteilen seien .
Seine Juristen ließ Bush das Vorgehen auf Guantanamo mit der angeblichen Machtfülle eines US - Präsidenten in Kriegszeiten begründen .
Dieser Schritt gilt als eine der größten Entgleisungen der Bush - Jahre .
Einen Tag später , am Samstag , veröffentlichte das Washingtoner Justizministerium dann aber eine sogeannte " Gerichtsakte " , in der es bestätigte , dass der US - Präsident das Recht habe , Terrorverdächtige ohne Strafverfahren zu inhaftieren – genau wie es die Bush - Administration auslegte .
Die Definition der Gefangenen , welcher sich das Justizministerium unter Obamas Justizministerium Eric Holder bediente , unterscheidet sich kaum von der der Bush - Juristen .
Kurz gesagt : Obama lehnt das Konstrukt der " feindlichen Kämpfer " zwar ab , behält aber im Kern die gleiche wirre , menschenverachtende Logik im Umgang mit den Terrorverdächtigen bei .
Schon in den Wochen davor hatten die Verteidiger bürgerlicher Freiheiten und Menschenrechte schockiert , dass die Obama - Administration dekretierte , dass Gefangene im afghanischen US - Gefängnis von Bagram und in anderen geheimen CIA - Verliesen im Rest der Welt keinerlei Rechte haben , gegen ihre Gefangenschaft und den Umgang mit ihnen vor US - Gerichten zu klagen .
Zudem hatte Obamas Administration die britische Regierung unter massiven Druck gesetzt , jegliche Folterbeweise unter Verschluß zu halten .
Dem vorausgegangen war das bedenklich laue Abwinken Obamas , die Vergehen der Bush - Regierung zur Anklage zu bringen .
Sein deutliches Desinteresse bezieht sich dabei nicht nur auf mögliche Rechtsverstöße der Bush - Regierung bei Guantanamo , sondern auch auf die heftig kritisierte Tatsache , dass Bush im Zuge seines " Kriegs gegen den Terrors " die eigene Bevölkerung ausspionieren und abhören ließ .
Einige Demokraten wollen sich trotz der öffentlichen Ablenkung durch die Wirtschafts - und Finanzkrise jedoch nicht davon abbringen lassen , aufzudecken .
Zwei Senatoren , Dianne Feinstein und Patrick Leahy , Vorsitzender des Justizausschusses , wollen sich mit Obamas Schwamm - drüber - Politik nicht abfinden und haben die Etablierung eines Untersuchungsausschusses angekündigt , der die Bush - Vergehen , vom Einmarsch in den Irak über Abhörprogramme bis hin zu Guantanamo bleuchten soll – doch selbst zahlreiche demokratische Politiker wollen , wie Obama , " lieber nach vorne schauen " .
Konservative Kritiker wie Rich Lowry , Kolumnist der konservativen National Review , brandmarkte Obamas Vorgehen kürzlich als " Drei- Schritte - Manöver " , welches er so erklärte : " Barack Obama hat sein Drei-Schritt - Manöver so perfektioniert , dass kein Politiker ohne Obamas rhetorische Künste und kalten Zynismus es wagen könnte , dies nachzuahmen .
Erstens : Den präsidialen Vorgänger kritisieren , damit die eigene Parteibasis aufrütteln und aus der Unpopularität des Vorgängers Kapital schlagen .
Zweitens : Vorgeben , man habe die Politik des Vorgängers mit einem symbolischen Akt beendet .
Drittens : Eine Version der gleichen alten Politik annehmen , wissend , dass alles andere zu kompliziert und zu verantwortungslos wäre . "
Während Lowry mit seiner pointierten Zusammenfassung Obama indirekt eine " verantwortungsvolle Politik " unterstellt , werfen andere Republikaner ihm vor , mit seiner bislang eher symbolischen Lockerungspolitik bereits gefährlich weit gegangen zu sein .
Ex -Vizepräsident Dick Cheney , erklärtermaßen Mastermind der Bush - Politik , nutzte am Wochenende ein CNN - Interview , um allen Ernstes zu behaupten , Obama habe die USA damit " weniger sicher " gemacht .
Noch fällt es den Aktvisten schwer zu glauben , dass nach Jahren der massiven Rechtsverstöße und des Mißbrauchs der US - Verfassung ausgerechnet Obama , selbst Verfassungsrechtler , im Kern die Brandrodung bürgerlicher Freiheiten und die Geheimniskrämerei seines Vorgängers gut heißt , die Cheney sie ein weiteres Mal unverfroren verteidigte .
Kolumnisten verweisen darauf , dass es idiotisch wäre anzunehmen , Obama sei wie Bush .
Mit sich selbst ringende linke Kommentatoren wie Glenn Greenwald verweisen unterdessen in ihren Blogs entmutigt auf die lichten Seiten der neuen Administration .
So zum Beispiel darauf , dass Obama angeordnet habe , dass die CIA Gefangene nur noch nach den Richtlinien des “ Feldhandbuchs der Armee ” befragen darf , sprich Folter ausdrücklich verboten wurde und dass das Rote Kreuz nun Zutritt zu allen Gefangenen erhalten hat .
Auch , dass er die Geheimgefängnisse insgeheim schließen lassen will und die Verfahren der Militärkomissionen auf Guantanamo einstellen wird , damit die Gefangenen von Strafgerichten in den USA verurteilt werden können .
Doch 50 Tage Obama - Regierung und kein Schritt jenseits symbolischer Politik lassen zunehmend die Besorgnis wachsen , dass Washington sich mit kosmetischen Reparaturen begnügen will , die das Unrecht der Bush - Ära nicht wirklich beenden werden .
In last Friday 's presidential debate , John McCain went after Barack Obama on the surge in Iraq : " Senator Obama said the surge could not work , said it would increase sectarian violence , said it was doomed to failure .
Recently on a television program , he said it exceeded our wildest expectations "
The senator responded with a clever formulation : " John , you like to pretend like the war started in 2007 .
You talk about the surge .
The war started in 2003 , and at the time when the war started , you said it was going to be quick and easy .
You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were .
You were wrong .
You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators .
You were wrong .
You said that there was no history of violence between Shiite and Sunni .
And you were wrong .
And so if the question is who is best - equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military , how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict , then I think we can take a look at our judgment . "
It was a striking response because , if we 're thinking in terms of analogies , as New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd pointed out recently , McCain is essentially the arsonist who helps set a fire in someone 's house and then tries to take credit for keeping it under control , if not putting it out .
And yet the question remains :
Whose war , McCain 's or Obama's , will be the decisive one in American politics this year ?
TomDispatch regular , American historian , and professor of religious studies Ira Chernus is both a canny observer of campaign politics and deeply knowledgeable about why certain kinds of easy - to - manipulate symbols affect so many Americans .
It 's clear that Iraq has , for the time being , been pushed out of the main stream ( as well as the mainstream ) of American news and that this matters in the present election .
Here , Chernus considers just how it matters and how , even out of sight , the Iraq War will continue to play a crucial role in domestic politics .
And by the way , do n't assume that the war will remain buried news .
Iraq is a tinderbox .
It could explode at any moment .

Even before the present financial meltdown hit the news , the Iraq War had slipped out of the headlines and off the political stage .
Now , as investment houses totter and bailout plans fill the headlines , it will be even harder for Iraq to get major media attention .
Yet the war remains just beneath the surface of the presidential campaign , and so is sure to affect the outcome in ways too complicated to fully grasp .
In 1932 , in the midst of a disastrous economic meltdown , Franklin D. Roosevelt made " the forgotten man " the centerpiece of his presidential election campaign .
Far more than we suspect , this year 's election may turn not on a forgotten man , but on a forgotten war in a forgotten country .
In 1932 , in the midst of a disastrous economic meltdown , Franklin D. Roosevelt made " the forgotten man " the centerpiece of his presidential election campaign .
Far more than we suspect , this year 's election may turn not on a forgotten man , but on a forgotten war in a forgotten country .
Even before the present financial meltdown hit the news , the Iraq War had slipped out of the headlines and off the political stage .
Now , as investment houses totter and bailout plans fill the headlines , it will be even harder for Iraq to get major media attention .
Yet the war remains just beneath the surface of the presidential campaign , and so is sure to affect the outcome in ways too complicated to fully grasp .
Think of that war not as one , but two currents , affecting the coming election all the more powerfully because they are out of sight , out of mind , and -- interacting in unpredictable ways -- out of anyone 's control .
Obama 's War : The Realistic Disaster
The first current is that of realistic perception .
Polls continue to show that at least 60 % of prospective voters see the war for what it is : a disastrous mistake .
Among Democrats , the percentage is far higher than among Republicans , which may be the main reason that Barack Obama is now the Party 's candidate for president .
As the only major candidate in the Democratic primaries who opposed the war from the beginning , his stance proved decisive .
It remains a powerful factor in his favor as undecided voters make up their minds , even if they do n't fully realize it .
Remember , most people 's electoral decision - making processes -- like the war in American consciousness at this point -- run largely below the surface .
Widespread opposition to and unhappiness with the war ( and its expense ) has long fueled a broader feeling that the U.S. is " on the wrong track " and needs change of some kind .
About 80 % of voters were voicing that feeling even before the recent financial collapse began .
Much of it came from frustration over a major Vietnam - like military effort that , somehow , once again went terribly awry .
Once again , we tried to save a nation by destroying it .
Once again , American treasure was poured into a hopeless , hapless venture abroad .
From this , there remains a powerful feeling of disillusionment and mistrust across the political spectrum , largely directed at the party in power .
Until recently , it was the war more than anything else that made George W. Bush such an albatross around the McCain campaign 's neck .
It was the war ( and McCain 's ongoing support of it ) that let the Obama campaign score so many points with the simple slogan : McCain = Bush 's Third Term .
There will never be any way to measure just how many votes that anti-Bush feeling will cost McCain , but it will surely be felt on Election Day .
In fact , it 's already being felt in the halls of Congress as negotiations over an instantaneous emergency fix of the financial system drag on .
If it were not for the web of deceit the administration wove around Iraq , the public might have rolled over and accepted the proposed " bailout " with little question .
But having been fooled by one rush to power -- supposedly to save us from Saddam 's dreaded WMDs -- the people are sending a message to a president who has a job approval rating in the mid-20 % range and , in a recent CBS poll , a 16 % approval rating on the economy .
That 's bound to help the Democrats .
" The forgotten man , " now joined by an equally empowered " forgotten woman , " is back in American politics .
Terrified by a financial system they are assured is beyond anyone 's control , they are shouting from Main Street loud enough for Wall Street and K Street to hear .
Americans know enough about finance to understand one simple fact :
When you 're wasting jaw - dropping amounts of public money every day on a disastrous war , you can't be cavalier about spending hundreds of billions more on another self - proclaimed emergency , especially when there 's no reason in the world to believe the administration has the answer to either of them .
Come Election Day , many may simply say :
Let the other guy run the show for a while .
The sense that the other guy -- Obama -- has a better approach to the war is borne out by one powerful fact that most Americans have probably not taken in .
The position the senator has espoused all along is now essentially the official Bush administration position : U.S. combat troops must be withdrawn from Iraq by a date certain .
In case anyone in Washington misses the point , top Iraqi government officials seem eager to remind them at every opportunity that it 's Obama 's position which makes sense to them .
Much as they may have given up on the President 's war long ago , most voters have n't heard about this because , in one of its few triumphs of the last year , the administration has managed to preside over the tamping down of violence in Iraq just enough to push the whole ongoing story of the war out of the media spotlight .
That 's why few voters know that Bush has now , however reluctantly and quietly , embraced the basic principle of Obama 's withdrawal plan .
Nor do many Americans realize just how little the surge had to do with diminishing the violence in Iraq , or how unstable the post - surge situation actually remains .
On that we have the witness of none other than the strategy 's main architect , General David Petraeus , who recently doubted that the U.S. could ever claim victory in Iraq and warned that American gains were " not irreversible Many storm clouds on the horizon could develop into real problems . "
Yet his warning , like most of the news from and about Iraq , has quietly slipped beneath the surface of our political waters .
The eclipse of the war -- which was supposed to be Obama 's winning issue -- is one big reason that he has , until recently , remained stuck in a statistical tie with McCain in the opinion polls .
McCain's War : The Symbolic Victory
Why has the war generally been consigned to the dustbin of news and so largely forgotten ?
Here 's one reason :
The realistic American perception of disaster is continually blocked by a powerful countercurrent that runs deep in our political culture in which war is perceived not as a bloody fact but as a web of symbolism and a test of " traditional American values . "
This countercurrent triggers powerful nationalistic feelings .
On that level , there seems to be no need to dwell on Iraq any more because " the surge worked . "
In other words -- the war is over we won ( sorta ) !
Even Sarah Palin says so .
Of course the administration and the media designers of war symbolism do n't put it that bluntly .
They know that they do n't need to .
The simple disappearance of scenes of Iraqi carnage from front pages and the TV news does the trick just as well .
The public , getting no news and assuming that means good news , hears what it wants to hear .
The idea that we 're on a path to " victory " -- or at least " success " -- is seductive exactly because it seems to prove that we are still the good guys wearing the white hats .
Do n't they always win ?
It 's easy to submerge frustration and disillusionment beneath a reassuring feeling that America is still the world 's shining beacon of moral hope .
For some voters , that remains crucial .
Another military defeat , whether in Iraq or Afghanistan , could raise deeply disturbing questions about moral order , not merely in international affairs but in the cosmos .
So when a white - haired " hero " shows up , crying " country first " and proclaiming America " the only nation I know that really is deeply concerned about adhering to the principle that all of us are created equal , " some may follow him , regardless of his policies -- especially if what made him a war hero was five years of Christ - like suffering at the hands of America 's enemies .
Who better to lead the forces of virtue in their endless battle against the " me-first crowd " ?
And where better to do it than on a battlefield far away , where evil seems to hold sway and " victory " remains on the American banner ?
Yes , such symbolism is a riptide running against the current of reality .
It has an often unassailable logic all its own , which can be very compelling .
For how many voters ?
No one can say -- especially when these currents of realism and symbolism are colliding largely out of sight in the murky waters of the presidential race , as equally murky poll results have been indicating .
For many months , clear majorities of voters have supported the policy that Obama touts as his own :
Get the combat troops ( or even all U.S. troops ) out of Iraq by a date certain .
Yet a majority , even if a slimmer one , has consistently claimed to trust McCain , who wants to stay until we " win , " more than Obama when it comes to the handling of the war ( as well as other national security issues ) .
Typically , in the most recent Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll , McCain topped Obama as " best at achieving success in Iraq " by a margin of 50 % to 34 % .
Yet when the same voters were read the positions of the two and asked , " Which do you agree with more ? " the outcome was a virtual tie .
In other words , fully 14 % of those who sided with Obama 's Iraq position failed to name him best at handling the issue .
That 's puzzling to those who think that voters simply listen to candidate positions and then choose the one closest to their own views .
If only it were so .
In that same poll , for instance , just about a quarter of the voters said they would base their decision in the polling booth mainly on issues -- and that 's typical of other polls that ask the same question .
Among that quarter , tellingly , Obama was favored by a whopping margin of 70 % to 24 % .
Among the other three - quarters , the choice went decidedly for McCain .
McCain has stayed competitive , in part , because a significant number of voters remain ready to choose him not for what he would actually do in Iraq , but for what he seems to symbolize in the hall of mirrors that is American politics .
On the other hand , at least one poll earlier this year found that a third of those who trusted McCain more on Iraq did not plan to vote for him anyway .
Amid all the confusing crosscurrents , one thing is clear :
No wave of symbolism can stop the flow of empirical realities in Iraq .
No matter who moves into the Oval Office on January 20 , those harsh realities and their fallout around the world will be waiting on his desk , piled high and deep .
They may , unfortunately , still be there when that president ends his first ( or only ) term in office four years later .
That fallout is strongest and most ominous in the Muslim lands to the east of Iraq .
Let 's just hope the next president is wise enough and open - minded enough to hear us when we point out :
One presidency was wrecked in the jungles of Vietnam , another in the sands of Iraq .
Do n't let a third presidency be destroyed in the mountains of Afghanistan or Pakistan , or over Iran .
That danger alone should be more than enough reason to keep the Iraq War in the forefront of our minds as we decide on , and then usher in , a new presidency .

Watson , IBM ’s latest silicon creation has been tasked with taking on humans in a slightly different setting than it ’s used to .
Playing chess against grandmasters is all in a days work for the computer that would be human ( or is that destroy them ? ) but IBM ’s next goal is to go head to head against human contestants in an attempt to “ .. get Watson to think and interact in human terms , ” IBM ’s Dr David Ferrucci is quoted as saying .
“ It will try to understand a user ’s question and intent and understand it at a rudimentary level and provide and accurate and confident answer . ”
Of course buzzing in with a wrong answer in Jeopardy is costly and so Watson must be absolutely sure before answering .
This kind of open ended question answering is something that has n’t been tackled successfully in the past .
Playing chess means calculating millions of chess moves to find the best solution to a fixed problem .
Answering questions on a game show like Jeopary requires a very different skill set , something computers are not naturally good at requiring broad general knowledge , quick prompt analysis of meaning , irony , riddles and other natural language subtleties that are at a pinch out of the remit of a computer .
Matching words to words is something a computer excels at but matching meaning to meaning is still something that although we take it for granted in our own lives , computationally is exceptionally hard .
Hit the read link for more on what could become your computer overlords in the near future .
Watson will be given the questions as electronic text while the human contestants will both see the text and hear it spoken by the show ’s host Alex Trebek .
Watson will also be disconnected from the internet allowing only the use of previously parsed information stored in it ’s memory .
Watson will answer the questions in a synthesised voice and be able to choose follow - up questions .
IBM and the show ’s producers aim to involve Ken Jennings , the legendary grand master of Jeopardy with 74 consecutive wins and collected a prise fund of $ 2.52 m in 2004 .

IBM does have a constructive business plan behind this high - profile stunt .
The aim is to provide accurate and fast answers by having the computer look at all the information associated with a search regardless of how remote that might impinge on an answer that you might be building towards .
Traditional search returns lots of information , but unless you have an infinite amount of time to search through every resource for even the smallest pieces of information you ’re at risk of missing something and creating an ill informed decision .
Dr. Ferrucci aims to have Watson “ … able to be applied to all sorts of applications in the world and essentially cut the time to find answers to very difficult problems … [ by ] … getting the computer to work in human terms ” .
Once Watson has taken on and beaten Ken Jennings ( it ’s not a case of if but when one supposes ) what ’s next for the mightly computing machine ?
Building better humans ?
Understanding the meaning of emotions and finding the hatred that drives the human race ?
How about taking on humans in the ultimate battle , Quake Live ?
Yeah ok , the computer already kicks my ass at that one too .
What would you , our dear readers , have Watson do for you ?
The answer is 42 remember .

TAL , as has been apparent for years , is really the opposite of documentary reportage .
It ’s more like sociology , wherein the paradigm is set and specific circumstances are nipped , tucked , torqued , and squeezed until they fit the theme .
Radio listeners can’t really fight through Glass ’s scrim , so they have to take his word that the story is what he says it is .
In the harsh light of television , however , the affectations of the radio show become glaringly clear .
You can see how determined Glass is to bestow small breakthrough moments on his protagonists , whether they ’re aware of them or not .
We ’re told , for instance , that the religious father of a lapsed - Mormon woman has come to a tentative understanding with his daughter after seeing her boyfriend play Jesus in a photo shoot .
But mostly , she still just seems pissed off , and he remains a doctrinaire bore .
Then there ’s the rancher who loves his one - of - a- kind , tourist - attracting bull ( “ Chance ” ) so much that he clones him ( creating “ Second Chance ” ) .
The man is said to have learned a gentle lesson about unintended consequences after the clone gores him in the testicles .
But actually he does n’t seem to have learned much of anything .
He still believes Second Chance will be bankable , once the bull gets the testicle - goring out of his system .
Mostly , the rancher seems either economically needy or a bit touched .
In a short introductory piece , an elderly guy who visits his wife ’s grave three times a week , but also brings along a TV set for company , is seen as just another piece of this magically odd tapestry we call America .
There almost certainly are some depths here — the loneliness of losing a spouse , the poignancy of aging , perhaps a touch of senile - onset dementia — but we ’re directed to see him as simply quirky , a guy doing his thing , man .
“ Well , ” Glass says , “ it ’s This American Life . ”
TAL lives at a kind of permanent 70 degrees , moderate humidity .
Everyone says his or her piece , is shown to have a flaw , then is revealed as a pretty all right person in the end .
The TV show comes alive , as TV always does , when there ’s real anger and passion .
The filmmaker and actor G. J. Echternkamp goes home to come to terms with his stepfather .
The guy is Frank Garcia , most awesomely the bassist in a band called OXO , which had a hit back in the ’ 80s called “ Whirly Girl . ”
Now he ’s fat , hairy , drunk , and completely disengaged .
Frank and G.J. ’s mom scream at each other in spasms of mutual distrust and miscomprehension , and she tries , within her limited emotional range , to explain why she was such a bad parent .
G.J. starts from a position of radical empathy for Mom , but makes a classic Glassian turn , realizing that Mom is feeding the dysfunction :
She ’s as crazy and narcissistic as Frank is .
He , still fat and hairy , but maybe not so much of a drunk as G.J. thought , turns out to be a decent guy after all , if flawed in the way we all are : “ I want the best for you , ” Frank tells G.J. at the end of the segment .
This narrative turn might have worked on radio , but on TV , these sloppy , damaged ( and completely riveting ) characters do n’t settle nicely into the Jell - O mold that Glass - as - producer has poured them into .
From the start , G.J. ’s mom is quite clearly unhinged , and only the most compliant viewer will accept the easy closure Glass imposes on the action .

We then get on to discussing the support for PHP and many PHP applications in Microsoft ’s Web Platform .
This leads naturally to a discussion of the the App Gallery where Microsoft is hosting community projects , many of them open source , that can be added to the Web Platform .
Getting into cloud computing and Azure , we next talk about the different deployment options ( or runtime environments ) that divide up Steven ’s world : the local host , in a data center , to a hoster , or cloud , here , Azure .
This last runtime environment gets us into a discussion of why you ’d use cloud computing and , implicitly , a discussion of what Microsoft ’s understanding of “ cloud computing ” is .

WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The top cop tracking the government 's $ 700 billion bailout program said Tuesday that he has opened 20 criminal investigations and six audits into whether tax dollars are being pilfered or wasted .
Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program , released a 250 - page report detailing a long list of concerns about government efforts to prop up hundreds of banks , Wall Street firms and auto companies .
Barofsky , whose investigations could lead to criminal charges , told CNNMoney.com in an interview that he wants taxpayers to understand where their money is going .
At the same time , he wants to alert officials to weaknesses in TARP that could invite corruption or fraud .
" Our recommendations are forward looking and there are no vulnerabilities that can't be addressed , " Barofsky said .
" The balance of what we 're trying to do is to inform , bring transparency and make appropriate recommendations . "
The report reveals that Barofsky is looking into whether bailout decisions were influenced by those who stood to benefit from them and whether companies receiving bailout dollars are adhering to caps on executive pay .
( Read the full report . )
Barofsky 's report also makes several recommendations to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and other officials charged with implementing the bailout .
Among them : Require all TARP recipients to detail how they use bailout dollars and safeguard a new mortgage rescue effort against scams .
The backdrop : Bailout rage
The report comes as public outcry over government bailouts is mounting .
The Treasury Department is under increasing pressure to protect tax dollars even as it attempts to repair the financial markets - agendas that are often at odds with each other .
Geithner appeared Tuesday before a separate congressional watchdog group , the five - member Congressional Oversight Panel , which released its own oversight report two weeks ago .
The overall bailout scrutiny is wearing on the financial sector and , one expert said , has caused confusion over the government 's unprecedented entanglement with the private sector .
" It 's become chic to demand more oversight of how the government is spending money to stabilize the financial system , yet we already have so many oversight entities in place , that it 's hard to say who 's responsible for ensuring how the money is spent , " said Jaret Seiberg , policy analyst at Concept Capital 's Washington Research Group .
Barofsky , in the interview , insisted his goal is to inform the public that someone is minding the store and that bailout programs are not a " black hole . "
" It 's not trillions of dollars going out the door without anyone keeping tabs on it , " said Barofsky , who will testify before Congress on Thursday about his findings .
As an inspector general , Barofsky has legal firepower .
He can use subpoenas to compel disclosure and is tasked by federal law to track the details of how banks are spending taxpayer dollars .
Barofsky , appointed by then - President Bush last November , has so far hired 35 members of a staff he expects to grow to 150 .
Currently working out of the main Treasury compound next to the White House , Barofsky and his staff are securing their own offices in the same building in downtown Washington that houses the Treasury staffers that administer TARP .
Barofsky , 38 , is a former federal prosecutor from New York who spent years chasing after white - collar criminals , organized crime figures and drug traffickers .
In one recent high - profile case , he prosecuted a trading firm that filed for bankruptcy a few months after raising millions in its initial public offering .
The chief financial officer of that company , Refco , pled guilty to fraud and money laundering last year .
Red flags and recommendations
Barofsky told CNNMoney.com that he believes one of his report 's most urgent recommendations is that Treasury develop a system to better figure out the value of the different types of shares it now owns in financial institutions .
The Treasury has invested hundreds of billions in companies in exchange for shares of preferred stock .
He said the need to better understand the value of the government shares is even more important now that the administration is considering a plan to convert preferred shares into common shares , which is the kind of stock that consumers usually hold .
" There needs to be asset valuation strategy so the Treasury can make the most informed decisions , " Barofsky said .
" I do n't think anything bad has happened , but it 's time for them to do that . "
The report also warns federal officials , in great detail , against expanding a Federal Reserve - run program to allow investors to use cheap government financing to purchase questionable mortgage - backed securities .
The program poses " significant fraud risks , " according to the report .
In addition , Barofsky also warns federal officials to create safeguards barring conflicts of interest among banks and investors participating in the new Public - Private Investment Program to prevent " collusion between participants , and vulnerabilities to money laundering . "
Finally , he said he is concerned about the Obama administration 's nascent mortgage rescue program , which aims to help millions of homeowners get affordable loans .
He 's worried that the program could spur a wave of real estate fraud and suggests officials take steps to confirm the identities of participants and make sure homeowners know that they are n't required to pay fees to take part .
Barofsky 's report did not detail the 20 criminal investigations , which it said " vary widely " and include securities fraud , tax , insider trading and public corruption matters .
He has previously reported working with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to investigate how bonuses were given to high - ranking employees of American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) .
The report also says that the $ 182 billion AIG bailout is the subject of two separate audits .
One is looking at federal oversight of the bonuses .
The other is probing bailout disbursements to AIG counterparties who had purchased insurance - like products from AIG .
Most gamers do a bit of optimizing their characters when building for a campaign .
After all , you want to be good at whatever you do .
Of course , this leads to discussion on gaming message boards about how to make the best possible characters .
Usually , optimizers discount blatant cheese like Pun -Pun , the Omniscifier , and 9th level spells for 6th level clerics .
But some still feel the need to push that edge as far as possible .
In attempting to push this edge , most communities discussing D&D seem to have come to the consensus that the full spellcasting classes are far and away the most powerful characters in core Dungeons & Dragons , with the Artificer being the only non-core class that holds a candle to the Wizard , Cleric , and Druid .
Sorcerers are usually given props for having the same spell list as a wizard , but are usually considered second - class due to the lack of spells known .
And if you do n’t have spells at all , or have something like the paladin and ranger list , the consensus seems to be you ’re toast in a game with optimized characters .
There ’s a big problem with this attitude though .
As much as I love spellcasting classes , when you get to actual play , the classes actually hold up pretty well with each other , and all get to do something useful .
You see , when discussing optimization , everyone talks about how a spellcaster can handle any situation when properly prepared .
The thing is , spellcasters simply are n’t always properly prepared .
Yes , divining spells can do a lot to help prepare properly , but they are n’t perfect , and most players are n’t perfect anyway .
And spellcasters caught blind are generally more vulnerable than other classes caught blind .
This is less true for the sorcerer , but then , sorcerers ca n’t prepare for any contingency the way prepared spellcasters can when aware of it ahead of time .
I ’ve never played a game in which spellcasters dominated the other classes in terms of making a contribution to the game , and I ’ve played a lot of D&D … from levels 1 to 20 .
Usually , the spellcasters end up providing support , a few big booms , some disabling spells , and everyone else cleans up … and defends the spellcasters when they run out of spells , since it ’s not always possible to retreat and rest up as soon as the spells start running dry .
I ’m not saying this game with spellcasters dominating over the other players has never happened , but it ’s never been the case in any game I ’ve been involved with .
Now , spellcasters certainly reshape campaigns more than other classes do at high levels .
Travel from one part of the world to another happens in an instant , invading a military base is a snap with the ability to teleport in , reshape the earth beneath , or slide in unseen .
This makes it of paramount importance that the GM know how to keep things challenging and interesting for everyone .
When it comes to fights , everyone talks about how casters should target the weak save .
While this is certainly a valid strategy , and will work much of the time , some enemies are smart enough to protect themselves where they are weakest .
They do have a stake in surviving , and are n’t likely to just let a caster take them down without trying to find appropriate magical protections .
This makes a caster ’s preparations less certain , and makes it harder for them to be perfectly prepared everytime .
This leads to everyone else still needing to participate .
What this all boils down to is that while casters have a lot of versatility , they can only do so much in a day .
In addition , even the smartest caster leaves some area exposed , and finds himself in an unpleasant situation in which he needs help from others .
Furthermore , even when a caster does n’t need help , it sure can be nice to have it .
Just as non-casters like having help to overcome their challenges even when it is n’t necessary , so too do many casters .
Sometimes , it really is about how well you can get it done as a group , rather than whether or not one person can do it alone .
DESPITE the numerous warnings about extreme weather , rising sea levels and mass extinctions , one message seems to have got lost in the debate about the impact of climate change .
A warmer world wo n’t just be inconvenient .
Huge swathes of it , including most of Europe , the US and Australia as well as all of Africa and China will actually be uninhabitable – too hot , dry or stormy to sustain a human population .
This is no mirage .
It could materialise if the world warms by an average of just 4 °C , which some scientists fear could happen as soon as 2050 .
This is …
WASHINGTON  A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that a lawsuit brought by five men who say they were tortured as part of the Central Intelligence Agency ’s “ extraordinary rendition ” program could proceed , dealing a blow to efforts by both the Bush and Obama administrations to claim sweeping executive secrecy powers .
In a 26 - page ruling , the court declared that Binyam Mohamed , a British resident of Ethiopian nationality , and four other former detainees could go forward with a civil lawsuit against Jeppesen Dataplan , a Boeing subsidiary .
The former detainees said Jeppesen provided flight support when the C.I.A. transferred them to secret overseas prisons  some run by the agency and others by foreign intelligence services  where , they said , interrogators tortured them .
The Bush administration intervened , asking a judge to throw out the case because its subject matter was a state secret .
The judge dismissed the case , and the men appealed .
In a February appeals court hearing , the Obama administration pressed forward with the Bush administration ’s stance .
But a three - judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said Tuesday that the executive branch ’s position went too far .
A recent Department of Homeland Security Report titled “ Right - wing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment , ” dated April 7 , has some people incensed about it .
Though the Report was never classified as secret , it is obvious that it was not intended for public consumption .
The Report [ you may download a .pdf copy ] warns members of the DHS against the possibility of violence by unnamed “ right - wing extremists , ” which are identified as people concerned about illegal immigration , abortion rights , increasing federal power , restrictions on firearms , abortion and the loss of U.S. sovereignty .
Moreover , it singles out returning war veterans , that is , people who have risked their lives under the belief that they are defending the security their homeland , as particular threats to their homeland .
According to the Report , worsening economic woes , potential new legislative restrictions on firearms and “ the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks . ”
Adding an unmistakable racist tone , the Report also suggests that the election of an African - American president [ Not true .
Obama is neither black nor African American . ] and the prospect of his policy changes [ Not true .
Obama is just following Bush 's policies ] “ are proving to be a driving force for right - wing extremist recruitment and radicalization . ”
The recent Homeland Security Report is actually a sort of follow up on a previous Report by the Missouri Information Analysis Center that linked conservative groups , like followers of presidential candidates Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , Bob Barr , the so - called patriot movement , and people who oppose the North American Union and the New World Order , to domestic terrorism .
It is not a coincidence that the Missouri IAC Report was compiled with the assistance of the DHS .
There are strong reasons for Americans of all political persuasions to be concerned about the gravity and dangerous implications of these reports .
They are a harbinger of hard times to come for freedom - loving Americans who truly care for their country .
They are also an unmistakable sign that this country is heading towards a totalitarian dictatorship .
[ In a forthcoming article I will analyze what type of totalitarianism we are heading to , Communism or Fascism . ]
There are , though , some considerations to be made about these reports .
But , before examining them , I would like to express my concerns about some of the complainers .
Frankly , I do n't understand the outrage of some people , particularly some who call themselves conservatives , who applauded , or at least did n't complain , when George W. Bush created the Department of Homeland Security .
In the first place , because the DHS had nothing to do with avoiding events like 9/11 — actually we do n't fully know what really happened on 9/11 — or capturing Muslim terrorists trying to enter the U.S. territory — just a few hours after the attack , when all planes in the country had been landed , Bush authorized two planes full of members of the Bin Laden family to leave the country ) .
Bush backers should remember that , when , after the 9/11 events , airline pilots asked to carry guns in their cockpits , Bush refused to authorize them — a proof that he fears more the American people than foreign terrorists .
Moreover , Bush kept the southern border open to anyone who wished to sneak into the U.S. , and made a clear point , through the Ramos and Compean case , that he wanted it to remain open .
Secondly , because the DHS was created to do exactly what is mentioned in the above Reports : keeping an eye on the restless natives to have them under control .
It has nothing to do with international terrorism , but with national terrorism of the U.S. government against the American people .
It is a government agency for the repression of dissidents .
Therefore , we should not criticize a U.S. government agency for doing the job it is intended to do .
Actually , there is evidence that the ignominious DHS Report ( document named DHS - RWE.pdf ) on “ right - wing extremism ” was actually created on January 23 , 2007 , that is , during the Bush regime .
The Report , however , is also proof that every dark cloud has a silver lining .
The fact that it was not supposed to be known by the American people , gives us a sure index to identify some true American patriots , which are none other than the ones mentioned in the Report .
But the most important thing about the Report is not the people it mentions , but the ones it does n't .
Like in the case of Sherlock Holmes ' famous novel , the dog that did n't bark is an important clue to decipher the mystery .
In this case , it is also a useful tool to identify some prominent traitors .
For example , it is an important clue that , that Rush Limbaugh is not mentioned in these Reports .
Allegedly Limbaugh is a right wing conservative , and apparently he has turned into the Obama Administration 's Public Enemy number one , to the point that Obama himself has openly criticized him several times .
Limbaugh even reached the cover of Newsweek magazine , who depicted him as a right - wing extremist .
But , despite all of this , he is not mentioned in the DHS Report .
Nor is mentioned Limbaugh 's alter ego , Sean Hannity , also the target of Obama 's criticisms .
Why this important omission ?
Very simple : because , despite their claims on the contrary , neither Limbaugh , or Hannity , or most of the “ conservative Republican ” critics of the Obama administration , represent a threat to the globalist conspirators ' plans .
The conspirators only fear true American patriots like Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , Bob Barr and returning military veterans .
Actually Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity on the “ conservative ” side of the Repucratic coin , as well as Amy Goodman and Daniel Schorr on the “ liberal ” one , just to mention a few of the most notorious disinformers , play an important role in this ongoing psychological warfare operation currently being waged by the globalist conspirators against the American people .
What is the main role of both Limbaugh and Hannity in this psyop against the American people ?
Brainwashing their listeners on the wrong belief that everything going on today in America is just politics as usual , and that just by changing the puppets in Washington D.C. everything will change .
Constant repetition is one of the main features of brainwashing .
It was exemplarily used by Hitler through radio and by Castro through television .
And constant repetition is one of the main characteristics of both Limbaugh 's and Hannity 's radio shows .
Just listen to any of them for half an hour and you will hear the words “ conservatives , ” “ Republicans , ” “ liberals , ” and “ Democrats , ” repeated dozens of times .
To them , everything is just a matter of partisan politics , and the only parties they mention in their programs are the two factions of the Repucratic Party .
What you never hear in any of their programs , however , is the words “ New World Order , ” “ North American Union . ” or “ Council on Foreign Relations . ”
And when a caller begins questioning Bush 's actions during 9/11 , he is cut short and called a leftist loony .
It is interesting to notice that , though Limbaugh , Hannity and other disinformers call themselves conservatives , their philosophy closely resembles one of the most obnoxious characteristics of the liberal 's ideology : situational ethics , which is just a fancy name for moral relativism .
True conservatives are not supposed to believe in moral relativism .
To them , some actions are right or wrong disregarding who is the perpetrator .
To faux conservatives like Limbaugh and Hannity , however , an action is right or wrong depending of the political affiliation of the person who carries it out .
Both Limbaugh and Hannity practically ignored the existence of Ron Paul during the past presidential campaign , and only mentioned Dr. Paul to criticize him .
Candidate Chuck Baldwin was nonexistent to them .
On the other hand , they gave lots of coverage to John McCain , who played the same treasonous role that Gore and Kerry played on previous campaigns .
By the way , it is not a coincidence that all of them Gore , Kerry , and McCain , are proud members of the treasonous Council on Foreign relations .
A measure of the importance of the role these professional disinformers play in this psyop the conspirators are waging against the American people , was revealed a few months ago when Obama himself had to come to the rescue of none other than Rush Limbaugh .
Even though most of Limbaugh listeners apparently have lost their capacity for thinking by themselves — a fact they have recognized by proudly calling themselves “ ditto - heads ” — during the final months of the Bush ignominious time in power , more and more true conservative listeners were given Limbaugh a hard time by questioning Bush 's treasonous behavior .
As the saying goes , you can only fool most of the people most of the time .
Some of Limbaugh 's listeners apparently began smelling a rat .
They began to realize that both Bush and the Republican party had betrayed them .
The fact may have shown on Limbaugh 's diminishing ratings , something that worried the disinformers .
So , the conspirators sent their puppet Obama to rescue their puppet Limbaugh by openly criticizing him and elevating him to leader of the opposition
Immediately , perhaps based on the belief that the enemy of my enemy by force has to be my friend ( but ignoring the fact that the alleged enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend ) , the anti-Obama listeners came back to the Limbaugh 's program to get their daily doses of disinformation .
The conspirators ' strategy worked : after Obama criticized him , Limbaugh 's ratings surged .
Last February , an important exhibition was developed at the United States Holocaust Museum in Washington , D.C.
Its title is extremely revealing : “ State of Deception : The Power of Nazi Propaganda . ” ( Edward Rohstein , “ Nazis ' Terrible Weapon Aimed at Minds and Hearts , ” The New York Times , February 24 , 2009 , p.C1 )
The exhibition shows in graphic detail how the Nazis used propaganda to advance their hideous agenda .
And it was very effective .
On one of the walls , an enormous photo of Hitler speaking in a 1934 rally appears superimposed , as the author of the article puts it , “ on a crowd of ecstatic Germans raising hands in salute as red gothic letters shout Ja ! ' ”
Though apparently nobody seems to have made the connection , this exhibition comes at the right time in America , because , since the days of Nazi Germany , no people has been under such a concerted psychological warfare attack in the form of a barrage of scientifically designed propaganda as the American people .
This perhaps explains the irrationality of the behavior of some well - intentioned , conservative Americans now faced with the actions of the Obama administration .
Apparently they are so blinded by the propaganda pouring from the disinformers of their own party that they cannot see that , contrary to his claims , Obama has not changed and will not change anything .
Actually , Obama is just the continuation of the treacherous policies of the Bush regime , because both of them , Bush and Obama , are mere puppets in the hands of the Wall Street bankers and oil magnates .
It is time for Americans to begin thinking for themselves .
The Republican / conservative Democrat / liberal dichotomy is a false one .
The two parties are a myth .
They are fully under the control of the globalist conspirators whose goal is the destruction of America as we know it .
When , following the conspirators ' orders , George W. Bush created the Department of Homeland Security , allegedly to protect the U.S. against terrorism , and began curtailing individual liberties , most of his Republican followers backed him .
They approved the creation of the DHS , they claimed , because they were not terrorists and had nothing to hide .
Very soon some of them are going to learn the hard way what everybody who has lived under a totalitarian dictatorship knows very well : a terrorist is anybody the government accuses of being a terrorist , and anything you have in your home , from gardening books to dog food , not to mention a copy of the Constitution , can be construed as a proof that you are a right - wing extremist conspiring against the government .
Moreover , like in totalitarian Cuba under Castro , after a few sessions of waterboarding , or any other type of “ non-torture , ” all suspects , without an exception , confess their horrendous crimes against the state .
Actually , Castro's Departamento de Seguridad del Estado ( the Cuban DHS ) is proud of its 100 percent confession rate .
If there is still a political solution to the present problems Americans face , it must begin by throwing all the incumbents , particularly the ones belonging to the two factions of the Repucratic party , into the trash can of history .
With a few exceptions , America is suffering the most corrupt , traitorous group of politicians in power in the history of this country .
When , at the end of WWII , following orders from the CFR conspirators , General William Donovan pushed to turn the Offiice of Special Services into a central intelligence agency , the people 's outcry stopped him short .
Some critics rightly pointed out that America did not need a Gestapo .
Eventually , the conspirators pushed the creation of the CIA , but some patriots managed to include a provision that the new intelligence agency could not operate inside the U.S. territory .
Despite that provision , however , the CIA participated in some operations inside the U.S. territory .
But it was against the law , and later they were highly criticized for it .
But the conspirators are patient , and eventually have made their cherished dream a reality : they have created a government agency whose only purpose is to legally harass the American patriots who oppose the destruction of their country .
This agency is none other than the Department of Homeland Security , a true American Gestapo .
The creation , under the pretense of fighting terrorism , of a government agency to repress dissidence is wrong , whoever , liberal or conservative , created it .
Therefore , instead of just asking for the resignation of the Secretary of Homeland Security , who was just doing her job by the book , we the people of the United States should demand the immediate elimination of this repressive organization that has no place whatsoever in a free , democratic society .

Yesterday , Rep. Ron Paul voted against a resolution praising the 30th anniversary of the Israel - Egypt Camp David treaty .
He rose to explain why :
Mr. Speaker : I rise in reluctant opposition to this resolution .
I do so not because I oppose our recognizing peace as preferable to , and more productive than , war .
On the contrary , too seldom do we celebrate and encourage the end of violence and warfare on this Floor so I welcome any such endorsement of peace in international relations .
However , I cannot agree with the final â€œresolvedâ€ clause of this resolution , which states that :
â€œâ€¦ the House of Representatives calls for recognition of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel as a model mechanism upon which partner nations may build to overcome longstanding barriers to peace and effective mutual cooperation.â€ 
What the resolution fails to mention , and the reason we should not endorse the treaty as a model , is that at the time the peace was being negotiated at Camp David the United States committed itself to an enormous financial aid package to both Egypt and Israel in exchange for their accession to the treaty .
Over the past thirty years , the United States taxpayer has transferred to â€ “ some might say â€œbribedâ€  â€ “ Israel and Egypt well over 100 billion dollars as a payoff for their leadersâ€™ signature on the treaty .
Particularly in this time of economic hardship , where so many Americans are out of work and facing great financial challenges , I hardly believe we should be celebrating that which increases the strain on taxpayers .
I believe we should cease all foreign aid to all countries , as it is a counterproductive and unconstitutional transfer of wealth from US taxpayers to governments overseas .
I do believe we should , where possible and without meddling , encourage nations and regions at war or in conflict to work toward peace .
But I also believe we should lead by example : that we should demonstrate by our actions the benefits of friendly relations and trade with all nations which seek the same .
I strongly oppose the idea that we should bribe the rest of the world to do what we demand .
Therefore , while I celebrate the achievement of peace between Egypt and Israel , I do not believe this â€œmodelâ€ to be productive or in the best interests of the United States .
I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution .

During the holidays , as many parents know , kids expect you to entertain them from morning till dawn .
Unless the day is action packed , it ’s a “ boring ” day and “ I do n’t have anything to do ” day .
On one of those days , we made a batch of homemade playdough ( play dough ) .
In summer , we tend to spend more time outside and kids did n’t play with it for a while .
Not only did the playdough keep them occupied for hours – to mum and dad ’s delight , but also there is an educational element to it : development of fine motor skills , blending colours , exploring senses like touch and feel , to name a few .
Instructions on how to make playdough :
This is a simple no cook playdough recipe which you can make within minutes .
Ingredients :
1 cup flour
½ cup salt
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 tablespoon oil
1 cup boiling water
natural or food colouring ( eg. beetroot , turmeric powder ) , optional
Note : Increase the above amounts two or three times for more playdough which can be divided and coloured differently .
In a bowl mix all dry ingredients .
Add oil , liquid colouring and boiling water ( warn kids if they are helping ! ) and stir until it all comes together .
This is a proper way .
As you can see above , I usually put dry and wet ingredients all at once and then stir .
Here I added a bit of beetroot juice , but , oops , forgot to add oil .
Still it came good .

What is bankruptcy ?
Bankruptcy is a financial state that occurs when a person or business can no longer repay its debts .
In the legal sense , bankruptcy begins when a court recognizes that the financial state of bankruptcy exists .
The bankruptcy court takes charge of the bankrupt entity and disposes of its assets or reorganizes it to pay off as much of the debts as possible .
A bankruptcy proceeding recovers money for the creditor , but both parties benefit .
The purpose of a bankruptcy proceeding is to facilitate the maximum recovery of the money owed to the creditor .
But it also benefits the debtor .
After the debtor pays off what he can , his remaining debt is extinguished .
This is not a “ get of jail free ” card ; the debtor , whether a person or business , must face the damage to its reputation and a greater difficulty in obtaining credit for a long time into the future .
Rather , it is an acknowledgement that the debtor simply cannot repay his debt .
For both parties , bankruptcy offers timely resolution to an otherwise unsolvable dilemma .
The creditor regains a portion of the money owed , and the debtor , relieved from the burden of a debt he cannot pay , can move on with his life .
Bankruptcy is economically valuable .
In economic terms , a speedy and fair process of bankruptcy allows both assets and people to resume being productive as quickly as possible .
The creditor regains cash that it can redeploy as it sees fit .
If it is a bank , it has regained funds that it can loan out again to more productive businesses or creditworthy individuals .
The creditor can also redeploy the assets of the bankrupt entity into the hands of a more capable manager .
Take the financial malaise of General Motors as an example .
Although effectively bankrupt , there has been no legal recognition of this fact ( as of this writing in March 2009 ) .
As a result , its factories and workers continue to be tied up inefficiently making mediocre cars .
General Motors is a drag on the American economy .
Bankruptcy would free General Motors ’ factories and employees to be more productive .
Once a court legally acknowledges General Motors ’ bankruptcy , it could allow General Motors ’ new owners , its creditors , to appoint a more competent manager .
Or the creditors could sell the plants to a superior car manufacturer , such as Toyota .
Either way , after reorganization under bankruptcy , the plants would be used to make cheaper , more attractive cars that customers want to buy .
The creditors may also choose to shut down some or all of the plants and sell them for scrap .
But recycling the old plants into new steel that becomes the girders of modern , efficient factories is a better use for those plants if they are obsolete .
No party is in a better position to make these judgments than General Motors ’ creditors , who have their financial self - interest at stake .
While General Motors is just a single , albeit enormous , example , speedy and fair bankruptcies end the bleeding of money - losing operations across the economy , and re-direct inefficiently utilized assets and capital to more productive activities .
In sum , bankruptcy facilitates economic recovery .
A failure to permit bankruptcy prolongs stagnation .
Some fallacies about bankruptcy
Bankruptcy always means shutting down a business .
This is not true .
Creditors , in consultation with the bankruptcy court , decide whether to shut down and liquidate , or to operate under new management .
Creditors have every incentive to make the decision that maximizes their pay - out over time , not just the amount of cash that can be had right now .
Bankruptcy is bad for employees .
Considered in full context , bankruptcy is good for employees .
An economy with speedy and fair bankruptcy procedures is one where healthy , growing companies predominate .
Healthy companies can pay employees more because their labor is worth more to them .
Therefore , employees benefit from bankruptcy , even if someone occasionally faces dislocation or the uncertainty of working for new management .
But , even if employees dislike such occasional dislocation , there is no alternative to bankruptcy if their employer is not financially viable .
Bankruptcy allows deadbeats to avoid meeting honest obligations .
When bankruptcy laws are properly drafted and applied , this is the exception rather than the rule .
Bankruptcy laws are designed to protect the rights of all parties , not to unfairly favor debtor or creditor .
Bankruptcy acknowledges a fact , that the debtor cannot repay all his debts , and it facilitates the repayment of all debts that can be repaid .
Government should stop bankruptcies .
During financial panics , governments sometimes try to prevent bankruptcies by putting moratoriums on them , subsidizing bankrupt entities , or changing the laws governing bankruptcy to favor debtors .
Such interventions are both unjust and impractical .
They are unjust because they deny the legitimate right of the creditors to collect what they are owed .
The money they are owed is their property , and they have the right to collect it , to the extent it is reasonably possible .
Such interventions are unjust and impractical because they attempt to deny reality .
“ Stiffing ” the creditors or forcing innocent third parties to bail out the bankrupt entity through subsidies does not change the fact that the bankrupt entity cannot repay its debts .
Bankruptcy is moral .
Bankruptcy is just , if resolved through a fair and speedy judicial process .
A bankruptcy proceeding acknowledges the actual state of affairs that exists , that the bankrupt entity cannot repay its debts .
It resolves this dilemma for the maximum benefit of the creditor , but in so doing allows both parties – debtors and creditors – to resolve this matter with finality , and move on with their lives .
Bankruptcy only involves the parties to the debt obligation .
It does not require that innocent , third parties be forced to subsidize or bail out creditors or debtors .
In doing so , it respects the rights of all concerned .
A just process of bankruptcy is also economically practical .
Bankruptcy removes assets from those who have mismanaged them , and puts them into the hands of those who are most capable of putting them to productive and financially responsible use .
The institution of bankruptcy is an essential part of a prosperous and just capitalist society .

Or you can drop $ 670 on a Volcano Vaporizer , the king of all paraphernalia .
We took one for a test run .

So what makes the Volcano so great that people spend close to $ 700 on one ?
Well , first of all , it looks pretty awesome .
If you did n't know what it was , you 'd think it was some sort of German - designed kitchen equipment , which is n't too far off .
Each Volcano is built by hand by a small German company using top - notch parts .
It 's got a classic design to it that will make you want to leave it out rather than hide it in a desk drawer .
But that 's not why you buy it .
You buy it because it gets you high really well .

You simply pack some vaporizables into the heating chamber and pop that into your Volcano , which has a handy digital readout to let you decide exactly how hot you want it running ( it still stays cool to the touch on the exterior ) .
You then attach a vapor balloon to the top of the heating chamber .
Over the course of about 30 seconds , it fills up with vapor ( not smoke , mind you ) .
You then snap on a mouthpiece and pass the balloon around .
It all sounds more complicated than it is .
So why is that so great ?
Well , it 's all about the vapor .
The Volcano heats your vaporizables up , but not hot enough for combustion .
That means all the nasty tar and toxins in your herbs do n't get released , just the active ingredients and flavors you 're looking for .
What results is a healthier and cleaner - feeling experience .
It also gets you high as shit .
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
So is it worth the cash ?
Well , not really .
But if you 're a serious smoker and you have cash to burn , you will almost definitely absolutely love this thing and want to use it every day , not just because of the great experience but because of how good it looks .
But if spending $ 700 on something to smoke with seems like a ludicrous and insane thing to do on your budget , it most definitely is .
But hey , not everyone can afford a Porsche , either .

Video shows London police assaulting man just before his death at G20 protest Jeremy Gantz
Published : Tuesday April 7 , 2009
Print This Email
This A new video shot during last week 's G20 protests in London shows a man being attacked from behind and thrown to the ground by a police officer in riot gear  all just moments before he would suffer a heart attack and die .
The video is available here .
The man , 47 - year - old Ian Tomlinson , is shown walking with his hands in his pockets and not resisting or speaking to police before a baton - wielding officer appears to strike him in the leg from behind , and then pushes him onto his back and the ground .
The video was shot by a New Yorker in London on business who decided to attend the April 1st protest " out of curiosity , " according to the UK newspaper The Guardian , to which the American gave his footage .
" The primary reason for me coming forward is that it was clear the [ Tomlinson ] family were not ­getting any answers , " the New Yorker is quoted by newspaper as saying .
The Guardian will soon hand over the footage along with a collection of testimonies from witnesses at the scene of Tomlinson 's death to the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) , England 's police watchdog .
One witness named Anna Branthwaite said she saw police assault Tomlinson , a newspaper seller who was on his way home from work .
" A riot police officer had already grabbed him and was pushing him , " Branthwaite said .
" It was n't just pushing him  he'd rushed him .
He went to the floor and he did actually roll .
That was quite noticeable . "
Several people were injured the day Tomlinson died , when anti-capitalist protesters held in a police cordon surged against barriers following violent clashes and an attack on a bank that led to 63 arrests .
Thousands of protesters rallied outside the Bank of England headquarters that Wednesday ahead of the G20 summit , where world leaders met to respond to the global financial crisis .
Police said about 4,000 protesters , including anti-globalization , anti-war and environmental activists , converged on the financial district to demand more help for the poor and the punishment of bankers they blame for the crisis .
Witnesses to Tomlinson 's death said that , prior to the moment captured on video , the man had already been hit with batons by police , reported .
These eyewitness accounts contradict the official version of events given by London police .
" In an official statement on the night of Tomlinson 's death , the Metropolitan police made no reference to any ­contact with officers and described attempts by police medics and an ambulance crew to save his life after he collapsed  efforts which they said were marred by ­protesters throwing missiles as first aid was ­administered , " according to the The Guardian .
In a statement made before reviewing the Guardian materials , Tomlinson 's family said : " People are putting pictures on the internet , writing on blogs and talking to journalists .
But we really need them to talk to the people who are investigating what happened . "
The IPCC began managing the investigation by London police into Tomlinson ' death yesterday , after The Guardian published witness statements saying he had been assaulted police officers .

Some 600 so - called enemy combatants are said to be held at Bagram Air Base Detainees being held at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan cannot use US courts to challenge their detention , the US says .
The justice department ruled that some 600 so - called enemy combatants at Bagram have no constitutional rights .
Most have been arrested in Afghanistan on suspicion of waging a terrorist war against the US .
The move has disappointed human rights lawyers who had hoped the Obama administration would take a different line to that of George W Bush .
Prof Barbara
Olshansky , the lead counsel in a legal challenge on behalf of four Bagram detainees , told the BBC the justice department 's decision not to reform the rules was both surprising and " enormously disappointing " .
The BBC's Kevin Connolly in Washington says the move has angered human rights lawyers , with one saying the new White House was endorsing the view of the old one , that prisons could be created and run outside the law .
It is certainly evidence that having set the tone for his administration by announcing plans to close Guantanamo Bay , Mr Obama intends to adopt a much more cautious approach to the problem of detainees held elsewhere by the US military , our correspondent says .
' Homicides admitted '
Last year , the US Supreme Court gave suspects held at the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , the right to challenge their detention .
Following that ruling , petitions were filed at a Washington district court on behalf of four detainees at Bagram .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
The judge then gave the new administration an opportunity to refine the rules on appeals .
In a two - sentence filing , justice department lawyers said the new administration had decided not to change the government 's position .
" Having considered the matter , the government adheres to its previously articulated position , " said acting assistant Attorney General Michael Hertz in papers filed at the court .
The US justice department argues that Bagram differs from Guantanamo Bay because it is in an overseas war zone and prisoners there are being held as part of ongoing military action .
Prof Olshansky said the conditions at the Bagram facility , which is near the Afghan capital , Kabul , were worse than those at Guantanamo Bay , adding that there was a lack of due process available to detainees .
" The situation in Bagram is so far from anything like meeting the laws of war or the human rights treaties that we 're bound to , " she told the BBC .
" There are no military hearings where the detainees can present evidence , " she added .
" Torture has led to homicides there that have been admitted by the US . "
" It 's quite a severe situation , and yet the US is planning a $ 60 m new prison to hold 1,100 more people there . "
The US military considers Bagram detainees unlawful combatants who can be detained for as long as they are deemed a threat to Afghan national security .

NASA Nanosatellite to Study Antifungal Drug Effectiveness in Space
MOFFETT FIELD , Calif . -- NASA is preparing to fly a small satellite about the size of a loaf of bread that could help scientists better understand how effectively drugs work in space .
The nanosatellite , known as PharmaSat , is a secondary payload aboard a U.S. Air Force four - stage Minotaur 1 rocket planned for launch the evening of May 5 .
PharmaSat weighs approximately 10 pounds .
It contains a controlled environment micro-laboratory packed with sensors and optical systems that can detect the growth , density and health of yeast cells and transmit that data to scientists for analysis on Earth .
PharmaSat also will monitor the levels of pressure , temperature and acceleration the yeast and the satellite experience while circling Earth at 17,000 miles per hour .
Scientists will study how the yeast responds during and after an antifungal treatment is administered at three distinct dosage levels to learn more about drug action in space , the satellite 's primary goal .
The Minotaur 1 rocket is on the launch pad at NASA 's Wallops Flight Facility and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport located at Wallops Island , Va .
The Wallops range is conducting final checkouts .
The U.S. Air Force has announced that the rocket could launch at any time during a three - hour launch window beginning at 8 p.m. EDT May 5 .
" Secondary payload nanosatellites expand the number of opportunities available to conduct research in microgravity by providing an alternative to the International Space Station or space shuttle conducted investigations , " said Elwood Agasid , PharmaSat project manager at NASA 's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field , Calif .
" The PharmaSat spacecraft builds upon the GeneSat - 1 legacy with enhanced monitoring and measurement capabilities , which will enable more extensive scientific investigation .
" After PharmaSat separates from the Minotaur 1 rocket and successfully enters low Earth orbit at approximately 285 miles above Earth , it will activate and begin transmitting radio signals to two ground control stations .
The primary ground station at SRI International in Menlo Park , Calif. , will transmit mission data from the satellite to the spacecraft operators in the mission control center at NASA 's Ames Research Center .
A secondary station is located at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara , Calif .
When NASA spaceflight engineers make contact with PharmaSat , which could happen as soon as one hour after launch , the satellite will receive a command to initiate its experiment , which will last 96 hours .
Once the experiment begins , PharmaSat will relay data in near real - time to mission managers , engineers and project scientists for further analysis .
The nanosatellite could transmit data for as long as six months .
" PharmaSat is an important experiment that will yield new information about the susceptibility of microbes to antibiotics in the space environment , " said David Niesel , PharmaSat 's co-investigator from the University of Texas Medical Branch Department of Pathology and Microbiology and Immunology in Galveston .
" It also will prove that biological experiments can be conducted on sophisticated autonomous nanosatellites .
" As with NASA 's previous small satellite missions , such as the GeneSat - 1 , which launched in 2006 and continues to transmit a beacon to Earth , Santa Clara University invites amateur radio operators around the world to tune in to the satellite 's broadcast .

This piece caused a flap on Civil Eats a couple weeks back and it got people talking , which is what is supposed to happen here .
Responsible and passionate meat wholesalers and processors like Marissa Guggiana , who believe animals should be raised humanely in ways that are healthy for eaters , the soil , the water , and ecosystems weighed in , as did many readers .
As many commenters pointed out , the study I cited did n’t compare grass - finished animals raised the way Dave Evans at Marin Sun Farms or Joel Salatin raise theirs .
It ’s true that beef raised on pasture and fertilized by the animals can sequester carbon , but the problem is with the animals themselves .
Ruminant animals emit methane gas , no matter what you feed them or how they are raised and the producers who use integrated pasture management techniques instead of chemicals are a minority .
Methane gas is said to be 21 - 23 times more effective at warming the planet than CO2 .
For a long time I thought grass - finished beef was much better for the environment because of how it ’s raised .
But strictly from a global warming perspective , I no longer believe that is true .
The piece I wrote was about my own struggle with the ethics of eating meat ( as it relates to the animals themselves and the environment — especially global warming ) and the progression of ideas from the people who have influenced me and many others .
Coming to terms with ruminant animal ’s contribution to climate change is the next phase in the progression of my personal meat - eating ethics .
There are several producers local to my area who do it right .
I will gladly eat the meat they provide ( once in awhile ) .
I am not now and have never been a vegetarian .
I know that many Civil Eats readers feel the same and are members of meat CSAs and farmers ’ market shoppers , friends of ranchers , or ranchers themselves .
And I commend them .
Get the latest articles in your inbox .
It ’s the other people I worry about .
In the face of a very real globalized , industrial food system , what choices will they make at the meat counter ?
Case in point : my local grocery store in Berkeley carries 3 different brands of grass - finished beef .
One is from Uruguay , and the other two from the US , at least one is from California .
Consumers who have a vague knowledge that grass - finished beef is more sustainable and healthier for them , will likely choose based on cost or where the beef is from .
Not only will they not know how this beef was raised , but it wo n’t really matter from a methane emissions standpoint .
We do n’t even have to get into the environmental issues around buying beef from Uruguay .
It ’s a complex issue promising to get even more muddled as demand for sustainably raised meat grows and grocery and super stores get into the game .
There will be a race to produce grass - fed beef as cheaply as possible through the same market forces that make organic milk at Wal - Mart affordable and organic only to the letter of the law .
The latest news on global warming has me convinced that we cannot afford to simply replace grain fed animals with grass - fed ones .
We need to eat a lot less meat .
Or figure out how to deal with the methane .
Not everyone who wants to join a meat CSA can , due to supply constraints , and then there are plenty of people who would n’t care to .
It ’s about the methane as well as the transportation issues and the inefficiency inherent in eating animals instead of plants .
I do n’t advocate slaughtering all farm animals and requiring that everyone live on plants , but I think that we need to talk about this , and bring it out in the open so we can step up our already considerable efforts to develop a food system that is more sustainable and does not contribute more than its fair share ( whatever that means ) to global warming .
Since livestock activities are said to be responsible for 18 % of all greenhouse gas emissions , cows seem like a good place to start .

Corn : Rove should call his book ' To Kill a Presidency ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday March 18 , 2009
Print This Email This MSNBC's David Shuster revealed on Tuesday that he recently received a Twitter message from former White House adviser Karl Rove , saying , " Wait until the book - you 're in there ! "
" So Karl Rove is writing a book ! "
Shuster exclaimed .
" It sounds like Rove may try and settle some scores ! "
He then turned to David Corn , who , like Schuster , did significant reporting on the leak of CIA officer Valerie Plame 's identity , and asked " Do we have anything to fear ? "
" I do n't think you and I do , " Corn replied .
" Maybe the president , or the former Vice President , Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Condi Rice . "
Corn then leaned forward conspiratorially and added , " That 's only if he -- tells the truth .
So they have nothing to fear either . "
Asked for ideas about what Rove might call his book , Corn came up with such possibilities as " To Kill a Presidency , " " Low Expectations :
Why the Bush Administration was Really , Really , Really Much Better Than Everyone Says , " and " The Guilt - Free White House Diet : Telling Fibs to Lose Weight and to Protect Your -- Abs . "
Shuster then invited liberal commentator Ed Schultz and former McCain spokesperson Tucker Bounds to join the discussion .
Bounds suggested that the real interest in a Rove book would center around his continuing influence on US politics and that it might be titled , " The Cloning of Karl Rove : The David Axelrod Story . "
" There 's a big difference between [ Obama political adviser ] David Axelrod and Karl Rove ! " Schultz objected .
" Here 's what Karl Rove is going to be remembered for by the American people , " Schultz went on , singling out Rove 's alleged involvement in the politicization of the Justice Department and the firing of US Attorneys .
" The American people are used to dirty politics and underhanded tricks and such stuff , " Schultz explained .
" The Judiciary is sacred territory to all Americans ... and I can guarantee you the American people do want to see prosecutions . "

A campaign promoting atheism on London buses this year ultimately “ served God ’s cause ” by reminding people of the importance of faith , especially to those who suffer , a papal preacher said Friday .
The campaign involved paying to have the slogan “ There ’s probably no God .
Now enjoy your life ! ” placed on buses .
“ We should almost thank the people who promoted that advertising campaign .
It has served God ’s cause more than so many of our apologetic arguments , ” said the Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa , whose title is preacher of the papal household .
He added : “ It has demonstrated the poverty of their reasons and has helped stir so many sleeping consciences . ”
He was preaching in St. Peter ’s Basilica in the presence of Pope Benedict XVI on Good Friday .
Peter Callesen is an artist who cuts up paper into beautiful little things .
Sort of like Papercraft , but he always uses the actual sheet from which the design was cut as part of the piece .
They 're all absolutely beautiful .
I posted a few of my favorites , along with a link to the whole gallery after the jump , which is a must see .
I really admire the time and patience this takes .
I know , because I 've tried to make Papercraft objects before and I sliced off a finger and glued my hand to my privates .
Several more pieces and a link to the gallery after the cut .

Thanks to Mike , who has had better luck with paper art than I have , for the tip
“ HEROES ” star Greg Grunberg , who plays mind - reading cop Matt Parkman on the sci - fi suspense series , is suggesting the show may be finished .
On a twitter to fans yesterday , Grunberg wrote : “ Winding down shooting Season 3 Heroes .
Tough to say goodbye to crew not knowing if any or all of us will return next year .
Hope all . ”
The posting was an immediate sensation , the first clue to the fate of “ Heroes ” – one of TV ’s most passionately followed series but one that has been suffering in the ratings of late .
NBC has yet to say if it will renew the show next year and the Grunberg message seemed to indicate that people in the cast were pessimistic about its future .
A short while later , the actor posted a second message that tried to deal with the fan frenzy .
“ Do n’t get me wrong , ‘ Heroes ’ IS coming back next year , but some crew take other jobs , so it ’s tough , ” he wrote .
The show hit its all - time lowest ratings last Monday , dropping below 7 million viewers for the first time .
Because the show has a big cast and films in a number of locations , it is among the most expensive dramas on TV to produce and its rating spiral makes it difficult to justify the high cost of making “ Heroes . ”
After Sci Fi Channel screened the
" Battlestar Galactica "
series finale for the press on Monday evening , there was a brief press conference featuring producers
Ronald D. Moore
and
David Eick
, and stars Mary McDonnell and Edward James Olmos .
Later in the evening , I asked Moore some additional questions about the finale .
After the jump , some highlights from the press conference ( really only from Moore and Eick ) , and then a transcript of the solo interview with Moore .
To read my review of the finale ,
click here
.
Post - finale press conference
( All questions will be paraphrased , since I only asked the first one )
( On what the second Kara actually was , and whether we all went down a rabbit hole when we assumed that Kara was the daughter of Daniel the missing eighth Cylon )
Moore :
Daniel was definitely a rabbit hole , and it was an unintentional rabbit hole , to be honest ... ( Daniel ) was always intended to be an interesting bit of backstory about Cavil , as a Cain and Abel allegory .
And people started seizing on it as some major part of the mythology ... and it was never intended to take that kind of load - bearing weight .
Eick :
It 's kind of like Boxey in that way .
Moore :
It 's exactly like Boxy .
Kara , I think , is whatever you want her to be .
It 's easy to put that label on her : Angel , or Messenger of God , or whatever .
Kara
Thrace died and was resurrected and came back and took the people to their final end .
That was her role , her destiny on the show ...
We debated back and forth in the writers ' room for a while on giving it more definition , and saying , definitively , " This is what she is , " and we decided that the more you try to outline it and give voice to it and put a name on it , the less interesting it became .
We just decided this was the most interesting way to go out , with her disappearing without trying to name what she was .
( On whether any of the Cavils , Simons or Dorals survived the attack on the Colony )
Moore :
The final ( edit ) came out a little less clear on that level than I sort of intended ...
The idea was that when Racetrack hits the nukes , they smack into the Colony and it takes it out of the stream swirling around the singularity , and it fell in ( to the singularity ) and was torn apart .
But as we were cutting the show for time , and taking out frames , one of the things that became less apparent was that the Colony was doomed .
The intention was that everyone aboard the Colony perished .
( On when and why he decided to have the fleet wind up discovering our Earth in the distant past )
Moore :
We decided that a couple of years ago ...
I do n't think we ever had a version of the show where they wound up in the future , or the present .
Those did n't seem as interesting .
In the early going , we started talking about the fact that we would see a lot of contemporary things in the show , from language to wardrobe to all kinds of production design .
That only made sense to us if a lot of the things we see in the show you feel are taken from our contemporary world were actually from their world and spread through the eons and came to us through the collective unconscious , or from ( what Lee said about )
" We will give them the best part of ourselves . "
Eick :
There was a time we were talking about , " They land and there are pterodactyls and tyrannosaurus rex . "
But it was the idea that they were part of the genis of humankind , and this seemed the more affordable way to do it than going " Jurassic Park . "
Moore :
The image of Six walking through Times Square , we came up with a long time ago .
( On what happened to destroy the original Earth )
Moore :
The backstory of the original Earth was supposed to be that the 13th tribe of Cylons came to that world , started over , and essentially destroyed themselves .
There was some internecine warfare among the Cylons themselves that was supposed to be another repetition in the cycle of " All this has happened before and all will happen again . "
Even they , who were the rebels and split off , left to their own devices , there was enough of humanity left in them that they destroyed themselves .
( On why Cavil killed himself )
Moore :
Cavil killing himself came from Dean Stockwell , to be honest .
As scripted , in that climactic battle in CIC , Tigh was going to grab Cavil and fling him over the edge of the upper level , and he was going to fall to his death .
Dean called me himself and said , " I just really think that in that moment , Cavil would realize the jig is up and it's all hopeless and just put a gun in his mouth and shoot himself . "
And I just said , " Okay . "
( On the history of " All Along the Watchtower " in the " Galactica " universe )
Moore :
The notion is that the music , the lyrics , the composition is something divine , it 's eternal .
It 's something that lives in the collective unconscious of the show , it 's a musical theme that repeats itself .
It crops up in unexpected places , and people hear it , or pluck it out of the ether .
It 's sort of a connection of the divine and the mortal -- music is something that people literally catch out of the air ...
Here is a song that transcends many different aeons and cultures across the star , and was reinvented by one Mr. Bob Dylan .
Eick :
It was a simple way to communicate the idea clearly that this is not the future .
This is the story of a culture that gave birth to ours .
There was an episode in season one in which Helo and Sharon are running for their lives and they hole up in a diner , and there 's a Cylon centurion cornering them , and for the longest time we planned to have an old jukebox in the diner that would play , " Yesterday , " or whatever we could afford .
Moore :
Probably not " Yesterday . "
Eick :
Okay , something from The Guess Who .
I think we felt it was too soon , and would confuse things .
It would be so non-specific that people would just be thrown by it .
But we were thinking about it that far back , that music would be a great way to tell the audience about the cyclical theme ...
All the colloquialisms and slang that you hear , and how people interrelate ... we get that from them , not the other way around .
( On whether Head Six and Head Baltar are angels or demons )
Moore :
I think they 're both .
We never tried to name exactly what the head characters were , we never looked at them as angels or demons .
They seemed to periodically say good things or evil things , to save people or to damn people .
There was a sense that they worked in the service of something else ... that was guiding and helping , sometimes obstructing , sometimes tempting .
The idea at the end was that whatever they 're in service of is eternal and continues , and whatever they are , they too are still around , with all of us who are the children of Hera .
They continue to walk among us and watch .
Ron Moore interview
When I talked to you at summer TCA , I ran through that checklist of unanswered questions .
Oh , yeah !
What do you think ?
You nailed pretty much every one .
I think people are going to debate about Kara .
I accept that .
I knew , when I decided this was as much as we were going to say about Kara , I said , " People are going to be pissed . "
I do n't want to spend too much time on Daniel , but did you realize that you were giving Kara 's father this name that was so similar to Daniel ?
That I had no idea .
I only found that out online .
I went , " Is that true ?
I guess it is . "
It 's one of those things where you 're inside the show and doing it , you do n't realize that people are going to seize on this detail and it gets a life of its own .
When I saw that stuff spreading online , I was really astonished .
" Really ?
Daniel ?
They 're obsessed with Daniel . "
So I started telling every interviewer , " Please tell people not to focus on Daniel , because they 're really going to be disappointed . "
This was a very dark , very bleak show , that had , for the most part , a happy ending .
Were you ever tempted to go the dark way ?
Why did you decide to end it the way you did tonally ?
I guess I always assumed it was going to end on some sort of note of salvation -- that they would find a home and be okay , at least some of them .
I did n't want to end the series like " Beneath the Planet of the Apes , " with the destruction of everybody .
Although that 's what Eddie wanted to do .
Eddie kept pitching me that they come to Earth in contemporary times , and everyone 's cheering and happy , and cut to the White House and the President goes , " Nuke 'em ! "
And they destroy Galactica -- cut to credits .
And people say I 'm dark !
I was literally never tempted to go that way .
I always felt that however brutal the show was , and how bleak it felt in moments , it was never nihilistic .
It was never about saying that people are irredeemable .
It was about trying to be honest about people , saying , " Look at us .
We are capable of all these things .
Really good people do horrible things and horrible people do good things . "
Given how often you used the show to comment on current events or , at least , draw current events in the show , do you feel that the finale in any way speaks to what 's happening now ?
Only in the sense of where it finally ends up in the very end : the robotics and where we are about to be technologically .
I just saw something the other day with a scientist saying we 're going to have a true ( artificial intelligence ) within five years or something crazy .
Or these Japanese robots that look like the woman in the finale , they 're getting more currency .
It 's been an old saw in science fiction for a long time , since Frankenstein , that we 're going to create life that 's going to turn on us .
Well , we 're right there , and we should probably really think about these things and understand the door we 're about to go through .
I 'm curious about a few characters ' final fates .
You very easily could have gotten away with Helo sacrificing his life so Athena could go after Hera , but they got the happy ending in the end .
There were two things .
One , originally when we were breaking the story , Athena and Helo were both going to die to save Hera .
And then I felt sort of unsatisfied about that .
I really wanted that family unit to survive to the end .
So in the script , when Helo gets shot in the corridor and he 's left , I did n't intend it to be a cliffhanger of " is he going to die ? "
I just kept writing it , and there was n't a moment to establish he was okay .
And when Tahmoh read the script , he got that point and said , " Oh , ( bleep ) , I 'm dead . "
And when he got to the end ,
he
was surprised .
And then it becomes this tearjerking moment when you see the three of them off in the distance ( on Africa ) and you realize he survived and they 're intact .
And when Tahmoh had that reaction , I decided , " Well , now I definitely do n't want to establish that he 's okay , " because I wanted people to have that same reaction .
Well , did anyone else almost die and then you gave them a reprieve in the end ?
We did talk , for a long time , that Adama and Laura were going to get in a Raptor together and fly off into the stars , and Adama was going to show her the universe , and that would be the last we see of them .
And before I ever even wrote it , Mary got wind of that and called me and said , " You know what ?
In our very first conversation about the show , we agreed Laura would die .
I feel it 's important to actually show it , " and I said she was absolutely right , so she died on camera and Adama lived on camera .
Because when he said goodbye to Lee like that , I assumed he was going to wait for Laura to die and then crash the Raptor or something .
I knew people would have that reaction .
So he 's going to be like Tyrol , just live off by himself ?
He 's going to build that little cabin , and who knows what .
Aaron Douglas keeps saying , " Well , you know what ?
They 're going to get a message .
Someone 's going to trudge up the hill to Adama and hand him a note , saying , ' Tyrol needs you in Scotland ! '
And Adama will put on his pack and go off to Scotland ! "
Given how much of the show was made up on the fly by you and the other writers , looking back , how well do you think everything hangs together with the finale factored into it ?
I think it hangs together better than it has any right to .
I do feel good that the process I always believed in and really defended -- about feeling the story instinctively as you go through it , and not being tied to , " Oh , we know exactly how it 's going to end up " -- that that was true .
We were able to get there and could say , " We 've been making this mosaic , and now we just need to put the final touches on it and we 'll have a complete picture . "
There 's loose threads and things that do n't quite work , but I think that 's in the nature of almost any show .
By and large , I think we did a pretty good job of it .
The thing I wonder about is the head characters and how ( important they were ) .
There 's that moment at the end where Caprica Six says something like , " That 's it ?
You just needed us to carry Hera into that room and protect her ? "
Well , if you look over the life of the show , they certainly did more than that .
But ultimately , that was the key moment that makes everything else possible .
Some of what Head Six is doing is keeping Baltar alive and free , but when she 's encouraging him to start the cult , and get the cult armed and all that , is that just her screwing around for her own amusement ?
No , I think that she 's moving him towards an acceptance of the divine .
Baltar could not make that speech in CIC unless he had gone through a religious conversion .
If he did n't have a belief in something greater than himself , he could n't have made that argument to Cavil in that moment .

REUTERS / Rick Wilking
SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp announced plans Thursday to open its own chain of branded stores as it looks to catch up with rival Apple Inc ’s successful move into retailing .
The world ’s largest software company , which also makes the Xbox video game console and the Zune digital music player , did not say how many stores it was looking to open , or when , or which of its products would be on sale .
That is to be decided by David Porter , a former DreamWorks Animation executive , which Microsoft named as its new vice president of retail stores .
Turner , a former Wal - Mart Stores Inc manager , will report to Microsoft chief operating officer Kevin Turner .
The long - rumored move to open stores comes as consumer spending is under severe pressure due to the recession , which has already pushed electronics chain Circuit City into bankruptcy .
A similar attempt by computer maker Gateway to open its own stores some years ago was not successful .
Microsoft , bruised by the poor reception of its latest Vista operating system , is facing increased competition from Apple , which is eating into the personal computer market and dominates the personal digital music player market with its iPod line .
Apple ’s stylish stores , now numbering more than 200 worldwide , have been crucial in attracting customers in recent years .
Iranian sniper or Wookiee ?
How to tell them apart
Over the weekend Iranian snipers marched in the annual Army Day parade in Tehran in full camouflage , looking less like crack combatants and more like Wookiee extras from a forgotten Star Wars spin - off .
So how do you tell the difference ?
Iranian army sniper
When and where : now , Iran .
Planet of origin : Earth .
Language : Persian , officially .
Average height : approximately 5ft 8in , without haystack suit .
Weapon of choice : the sniper rifle , presumably , although pictured holding the rather less precise AK - 47 assault rifle for some reason .
Strategic advantages : concealment .
Would be virtually invisible , for example , at a Star Wars convention , or in a vat of angel hair pasta .
Also sometimes confused with : Cruella De Vil after dry cleaning mishap ; a compost heap .
Wookiee
When and where : a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away .
Planet of origin : Kashyyyk .
Language : Shyriiwook , a system of barks , groans and gargling .
Average height : 6ft 11in ( the actor who played Chewbacca , Peter Mayhew , stood at 7ft 3in ) .
Weapon of choice : the bowcaster , a crossbow firing magnetically accelerated projectiles , according to online resource Wookieepedia .
Strategic advantages : strong , readily lends itself to merchandising .
Also sometimes confused with : the cowardly lion from The Wizard of Oz ; Brian Blessed .
Kim Young - bae spends his days with his nose inches from the pavement .
The only things lower are the cigarette butts and the sewer grates .
Lying on his stomach , he uses his knuckles and elbows to drag himself along , his torso resting atop a padded cart .
He wraps his useless legs , long ago withered by polio , in a swath of black rubber inner-tubing that gives him the appearance of being half - seal and half - man .
Clinging precariously to the lowest rung of the country ’s economic ladder , Kim is one of the seal men of Seoul .
As the crowds surge along the city ’s Gangnam business district , Kim is there , purposefully in the way .
He parts the pedestrian flow ; people nearly trip over his shriveled body .
Advertisement
Women in high heels step past without looking .
A few foreign tourists turn to gawk , but they too keep moving .
Kim , 55 , keeps his head low , refusing to look up or make eye contact .
On a small cart ahead of him , he pushes the tinny sound system he uses to broadcast his music .
Kim prefers classical .
There is also his red plastic dish for donations , which on this Friday afternoon contains four 100 - won coins -- worth about 30 cents .
Kim and half a dozen other seal men claim turf throughout Seoul ’s busiest pedestrian walkways .
Given a meager monthly allotment by the country ’s social welfare system , they take their chances on the street .
Advertisement
In a nation that prides itself on its wide social safety net , the seal men are a reminder of the harshest effects of the global financial crisis .
Although they have been on the streets for years , they are suffering like never before .
“ In South Korea , the middle - aged housewives keep control of the family money , ” Kim says .
“ They ’re the ones who used to donate most , but I do n’t see many of them these days .
Maybe they do n’t have cash to shop for clothes and nice things .
But things are bad for me . ”
Kim does n’t crawl in his “ off ” hours .
He can walk fitfully with crutches .
He lives in a first - floor apartment on the outskirts of Seoul .
At 7 a.m. each day , before the morning rush , a disabled friend who can drive drops Kim off at his chosen spot .
He spends the next 10 hours in a rough - hewn horizontal world .
Advertisement
“ I know I look pathetic , ” he says .
“ But if I used my crutches , nobody would give me money . ”
Kim grew up on a farm in Gangwon province , the oldest of three children .
He contracted polio before he learned to walk , so he does n’t miss what he ’s never been able to do , he says .
His father died shortly thereafter , and Kim left farm life when he was 23 , feeling like a burden to his mother .
In 1988 , during the Seoul Olympics , he arrived in the capital to fail at a series of menial jobs .
Advertisement
Then he spotted his first seal man .
“ I thought , ‘ Why is he doing that , crawling along the ground like an animal ?
It ’s so demeaning . ’ ”
But he needed the money .
So Kim asked a disabled man to set him up with the seal man essentials : the padded cart , the gloves , old clothes and elbow pads .
He learned how to attract attention and fight boredom by hooking a music system up to a car battery .
He cut up truck tire inner tubes to fit his tiny frame and protect his legs from blisters .
In 20 years , he has met a cadre of other seal men .
They have a special camaraderie , rarely fighting over turf .
He ’s seen the old - timers , their knuckles bruised and bleeding underneath their impossibly soiled gloves .
Advertisement
He ’s seen kindness and cruelty .
People who look little better off than him reach deep into their pockets for a few coins .
Mean - spirited teens kick him and steal his money .
Good days once brought about $ 20 .
But last fall , the coins slowed .
Now he can spend an entire day on his cart and get less than $ 5 .
“ I see people who want to give me money but can ’t , ” he says .
Often , he swears he ’ll quit .
Waking up , he ca n’t bear the thought of another day on the ground :
Push the cart ahead , pull yourself forward .
Repeat a thousand times .
Advertisement
“ But I have no choice , ” he says .
“ There is nothing else I can do . ”
The South Korean Ministry for Health , Welfare and Family Affairs offers free healthcare and monthly payments of $ 360 to people such as Kim who were disabled by polio and live on their own .
Officials acknowledge that struggling consumers are less likely to offer handouts to the seal men , many of whom stubbornly forsake job programs to remain on the dole .
There are job programs .
“ However , there might be some of them who think that begging makes more money than working , ” an agency official , who asked not to be named , says of the disabled .
Advertisement
But the seal men ’s work is hard .
The Internet is full of rumors that they are run by organized crime .
Some people call the men scam artists , pretending to be disabled to prey on public sympathy .
“ The fake guys victimize the real disabled , ” says Choi Jun- young , one of the principals behind a new magazine on South Korean homelessness .
“ These men on the ground , it ’s almost impossible for them to survive just by begging .
They have to find a way to get attention . ”
Kang Nan-won , a trading company manager , says people who ignore the disabled should be ashamed .
“ I feel sorry for him , ” he says of Kim .
“ What ’s 1,000 won ?
It ’s less than a dollar .
Not much . ”
Advertisement
Yet he walks away without dropping anything into Kim ’s basket .
Kim seems a man of contradictions :
He smiles easily , but his dark eyes are etched with sadness .
On this day , he wears a black - and - gray hat with a skull - and - crossbones design , its brim turned jauntily upward .
He moves along snail - like , a few feet an hour , peeking up now and then to avoid head - on collisions .
Eventually , an old woman drops a few coins into the plastic tray .
Then a man adds a 1,000 - won note , worth about 75 cents .
Advertisement
Kim waits until they ’re gone , and then scoops out the money .
He needs all the handouts he can get .
Unable to cook , he buys his meals ready - made .
He lives alone .
Though he has fallen in love a few times , he never married .
“ Who would have me ? ” he says , quickly adding that it ’s not so much his deformity as his independence that chases women away :
He likes to be left alone with his music and books on the economy .

Covered with grime , he does n’t get philosophical about how he makes his living .
He ’s not ashamed -- he may not have much , but he has his pride .
“ Look at politicians -- many are dishonest , yet they make good money , ” he says .
“ Why should I be ashamed ?
I do n’t harm anyone . ”
Hours later , the salary workers have gone home and the streets are crowded with young people launching into the night .
The light is shadowy , but the seal man is still there , on the street , more invisible than ever .

I guess Mr. Coale could be described as a " PUMA . "
According to Newsweek , he was a Hillary supporter who switched to McCain after the Democratic primary .
John Coale , a prominent Washington lawyer , husband of Fox TV host Greta Van Susteren and a supporter of Sen. Hillary Clinton , announced today that he was supporting John McCain for president .
Coale , who traveled with Sen. Clinton , President Clinton and her family through out the primary season , complained of sexism , and said the Democratic Party is " being taken over by the moveon.org types " in an exclusive interview with Newsweek.com 's Tammy Haddad .
This really puts Van Susteren 's fluffy Sarah Palin interviews into perspective .
The interviews , some of which appeared timed during the election to try to rescue Palin 's reputation at key moments , included Greta hanging out in the kitchen with Sarah , asking tough questions like " Are you proud of your son for serving in Iraq ? "
Other questions appeared specifically designed to defuse controversies , such as when it was that Palin first met McCain .
Later , Greta went for a snowmobile ride with Todd Palin , after repeatedly referring to him as " the First Dude . "
http://www.youtube.com/...
It gets better ( and weirder ) ... did you know that both Greta and John belong to the same church as Tom Cruise and John Travolta ?
Coale 's " personal life " is also " unconventional " ; he and his wife are both prominent in the Church of Scientology , which the public generally considers a cult .
As Scientologists , Coale and his wife are very active in a " religion " that believes - as described by the Dec. 13 , 1998 St. Petersburg Times : " And what about the fact they belong to a religion that teaches of Xenu , evil head of the Galactic Confederation ?
Who flew people to Teegeeack ( Earth ) 75 - million years ago in space ships , chained them to volcanos and blew them up with hydrogen bombs , releasing exploded " thetans " that are now the source of most human suffering ? "
As the St. Petersburg Times quoted Coale in that article : " I did a lot of drugs back in college , " he explained .
" Into the '80s , I did n't do a lot of them , but I felt that I wanted to handle this problem , and Scientology handled it . "
( Coale is now 52 ; he would have been in his mid-thirties at the start of the 80s - not a kid in college . )
Coale and his wife are major donors to the Church of Scientology and employ the mother of the current Scientology leader at their law firm .
Both Coale and his wife have attained the uppermost ranks possible for Scientologists - and are hardly casual members .
I wo n't prejudge Coale 's religion , but I wonder what Sarah 's evangelical base would think ?
Beyond that , however , there 's something downright disturbing and disgusting about Van Susteren playing such a major role in Palin 's media presence on cable TV while her husband is working behind the scenes to get her elected .
Another reminder that the days of objectivity in journalism are long gone .
“ This is a step to extend a hand to the Cuban people , in support of their desire to determine their own future , ” Dan Restrepo , the senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs at the National Security Council , said in announcing the move .
“ It ’s very important to help open up space , so the Cuban people can work on the kind of grass - roots democracy that is necessary to move Cuba to a better future . ”

In a sense , the policy shift is an admission that a half - century of American policy aimed at trying to push the Castros out of power has not worked  as the Cuban American National Foundation , the most powerful lobbying group for Cuban exiles in Miami , conceded last week .
Cuba policy experts characterized Mr. Obama ’s moves as important humanitarian steps but said they still left open the broader question of how the United States and Cuba plan to engage in the future .
The State Department has said it was reviewing American policy toward Cuba , and Mr. Restrepo said the policy was not “ frozen in time today ”  a suggestion , some Cuba experts said , that the White House is laying a foundation for more far - reaching change .
“ We really do n’t know yet what he ’s got in mind for the long term , ” said Sarah Stephens of the Center for Democracy in the Americas , which advocates a further loosening of the restrictions .
She said the administration may be trying to take “ baby steps toward building confidence ” by letting the Cuban exile community in Miami , which has traditionally opposed any softening of American policy , get used to the idea .
Mr. Obama is also facing pressure from Capitol Hill .
The House and the Senate are considering legislation that would lift travel restrictions to Cuba for all Americans , not just those with family in Cuba .
And some experts , like Philip Peters , a Cuba specialist and vice president at the Lexington Institute , a policy research center , argue that a president who is willing to engage Iran and Syria ought to be willing to engage Cuba .
“ This is a narrow set of measures , ” Mr. Peters said .
“ It does n’t at all get at the issue of broader contact between American society and Cuban society , and it leaves us in kind of an odd situation where one ethnic group has an unlimited right to travel to Cuba and the rest of us are under these cold war regulations . ”
Those who still support the Bush hard line denounced the decision .
The Cuban government charges hefty fees on remittances , and critics like Representatives Mario and Lincoln Diaz - Balart , Florida Republicans and brothers who are Cuban - Americans , said Mr. Obama was making a “ serious mistake ” that would effectively put millions of dollars into the hands of the Castro regime .
Next week 's long - demanded hand - count in Phoenix may confirm long - standing allegations of the electronic manipulation , on Diebold tabulators , of the 2006 Pima County RTA special election
And , then again , it may not ...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/3/2009 , 3:23 pm PT
- Special Report by Brad Friedman , The BRAD BLOG
The 400 previously rejected absentee ballots in the Coleman / Franken U.S. Senate race in Minnesota wo n't be the only ballots being carefully counted next week .
Neither will the more than 5,000 being counted in the NY - 20 U.S.
House special election where ( fewer than ) 25 votes , out of 150,000 cast , currently separate the winner from the loser .
A hand count of thousands of paper ballots that could trump all of the above , at least in regards to national importance , will quietly occur next week in a highly - secured Maricopa County , AZ , facility , as part of a years - long criminal investigation .
Ironically , coming as late as it does , three years after the election , the results of the count , no matter what they may be , will not affect the actual outcome of that election --- even if it is found that the results were originally rigged by elections officials .
After almost three years ; hundreds of legal documents ; scores of hours in courtrooms ; precedent - setting legal findings forcing the public release of Diebold computer databases supposedly recording how citizens voted in their own elections ; allegations of potential hacking and fraud believed to have been possibly carried out by election official insiders ; indications of tampering described as the result of " human error " by a report commissioned by the state AG , as part of a criminal investigation subsequently described by critics as a " whitewash " ; arrests of local election integrity advocates ; and lord knows how many articles documenting it at all here at The BRAD BLOG over those years , the paper ballots from the curious 2006 Regional Transit Authority ( RTA ) election in Pima County ( Tucson ) , AZ , will finally be counted , beginning next Monday , as part of a criminal investigation being carried out by the state 's Attorney General .
The hand - count of all 120,821 ballots from that special election will be carried out not in Pima , but under the supervision of " certified professionals who work for the Maricopa County ( Phoenix ) Elections Department , " according to a 2 - page letter [ PDF ] sent by the AG 's office to the chairman of the Democratic Party of Pima County .
The " strictly - monitored " count will either settle , once and for all , the matter of whether that election was conducted fraudulently by election insiders manipulating the vulnerable electronic Diebold tabulation system --- or it wo n't ...
' This is a criminal investigation , not an elections process ' ...
As described in the AG office 's March 23 , 2009 , letter to the Democratic chair , the hand - count count will be conducted " in a secured facility under the supervision of police officers employed by this office " along with one representative each from the Republican , Democratic , Green , and Libertarian parties under strict rules which disallow , for some reason , even the taking of notes by those party representatives .
" If you desire to send a representative to the ballot examination , please identify three candidates , " the AG 's letter instructs , " from whom we will select one person per party to be a witness to the ballot examination . "
The letter from Donald E. Conrad , Chief Counsel for the Criminal Division in the office of AG Terry Goddard to Pima 's Democratic Pary chair Jeff Rogers , explains that background checks will be conducted on the party 's choice as a representative who " will be subject to ... both a physical search and by a metal detector . "
Any such observers will need to be available to go to Phoenix , 120 miles away from Tucson , for five days next week , on their own dime .
Similar letters were sent to the other three local political party heads .
" I must emphasize that this is a criminal investigation , not an elections process controlled by applicable Arizona election laws , " Conrad wrote .
" Attendance and the procedures undertaken at this examination will be strictly monitored and overseen by the Office of the Attorney General . "
" Their choice of our observer is nothing but an attempt to keep [ local election integrity activist bulldogs ]
John Brakey or Jim March from observing , " wrote the attorney for the plaintiff , Pima County Democrats , Bill Risner , in a recent email .
" Why should they select our observer ? "
Brakey , a Democrat , and March , a Libertarian , have become local heroes for their years - long dogged pursuit of transparency and accountability in Pima County 's elections and , in particular , the '06 RTA election which allowed for the county to issue two billion dollars in transportation bonds over the next 10 years .
Brakey has long been a thorn in Pima election officials ' sides , as seen in just one instance in the video at right --- which we 've come to describe as " Election Official Gone Wild " --- featuring Pima 's Republican Election Director Brad Nelson freaking out after a simple question asked by Brakey at a public meeting in 2006 .
After we 'd posted the video here originally , it caused enough of a local stir that Nelson would be forced to grudgingly apologize for the embarrassing outburst , when a local television news outlet covered the ensuing brouhaha .
But the hot - tempered Nelson managed to hold enough of a grudge about that , and the continuing allegations concerning his office 's handling of the RTA election , that he managed to order Brakey arrested in 2008 during a post-election hand - count of ballots , when the election watchdog noticed that security seals were missing and / or broken on a number of ballot bags selected for counting .
For his part , the mild - mannered Libertarian March , a founding board member of BlackBoxVoting.org , went about helping to create a fraud - busting software tool to analyze Diebold databases for red flags that may suggest possible tampering , after the Democrats had won their case against the county , seeking the release of databases from the RTA election .
Their victory in court led to the largest such collection of Diebold databases ever released to the public .
March now says , in his usual understated way , that he's " kinda pissed " after having been been cut out of the possibility of observing next week 's hand - count on behalf of the Libertarian Party all together by the dubious restrictions set out by Goddard 's man Conrad as to who is allowed to observe inside the examination room .
" This guy Conrad set up the requirements to try and exclude any critics of his department : parties were told to submit three names , and the AZ AG 's office would pick one out of those three .
The Pima LP [ Libertarian Party ] had only one person both qualified and able to spend a week in Maricopa 120 miles away : me .
So when Pima LP would n't play their sick game , they found a different way to exclude me , " March told us in email today .
A 2 - page letter [ PDF ] sent yesterday ( 4/2/09 ) from Conrad to the Pima LP chair David Nolan , says March , the only candidate submitted by the Libertarians , " is not an acceptable nominee " due to his having been " previously arrested for disobeying restrictions on access to areas of a voting facility in California . "
The arrest of March referenced by Conrad was during an election count in San Diego in the summer of 2005 .
March was arrested on one felony count , after county officials claimed he was violating observation rules .
All charges against March , however , were dropped one week later .
Subsequent to the arrest , the CA Secretary of State mandated that election monitors be given the access that March , correctly , believed he 'd already had the right to under the law .
" The county was violating the law as to observation of the counting , " March says .
Not only did he win " big time " in the case , " but the reforms that came from that , directly sprang from my actions , " he told us today .
" There 's a reason San Diego dropped all charges --- they were at at fault . "
Nonetheless , Conrad 's letter yesterday to the Libertarian Party chair incorrectly characterized the incident , and used it to his assert a veto of March as an observer .
" My decision is based on his demonstrated willingness to violate the laws that govern behavior at a voting facility , " writes Conrad , despite the fact that March was never found to have violated any such laws .
The chair of the Pima Republican Party , Bob Westerman , was similarly dubious of the AG 's requirement , complaining to the Tucson Weekly late last month after receiving Conrad 's letter : " I find it a little odd that we have to submit three names , and that they pick the one out of three .
I do n't see how it would matter who it is ?
It is an extra step I do n't understand .
And for me as a chairman it makes it tough to find three people qualified , but can also spend five days in Phoenix .
I have basically a week now to find these people and they in turn have less than two weeks to make plans to be there . "
Now You See ' Em , Now Ya Don't ...
In late February , while we happened to be in Phoenix for a local fundraising event , we 'd received the surprise news that " the AG hauled the boxes [ of RTA ballots ] away " on February 24th .
They had been securely stored for much of the duration of the contentious court case by the Pima County Treasurer in the local Iron Mountain secure storage facility .
The Treasurer , Beth Ford , had recently been seeking court direction on whether the ballots should finally be destroyed all together .
At the time , there was no public explanation for Goddard 's actions , which was taken without either notice to , or the supervision of , the Pima plaintiffs in the long - running court case .
Though it was suspected the ballots were secretly transferred from Tucson up to Phoenix , nobody knew for certain .
Phoenix activists picked up the ball a few days later , and demanded information from Goddard .
They were able to learn that , indeed , the ballots had been transferred to Phoenix .
There were still no details about the chain of custody during that transfer , and the ensuing storage in Maricopa .
( You can watch Brakey and March trying to chase down the whereabouts of the ballots in Phoenix , after they were seized by Goddard , in this video . )
Though the Attorney General is also a Democrat , he has long refused entreaties from members of almost all of the local parties , until now , to count the actual paper ballots as part of a criminal investigation .
( A video of several local election integrity advocates confronting AG Goddard in 2006 , asking him to count the ballots , can be seen at right . )
While the Democrats had originally supported the RTA initiative in 2006 , which passed despite pre-election polls suggesting that it likely would not , they joined with a number of local Republicans , Libertarians and Greens during the process of the lawsuit , seeking to determine if the election may have been defrauded .
While the Pima plaintiffs are generally happy to see that Goddard is finally moving the ball forward to count the RTA ballots , their concerns remain , as it's fair to say that the plaintiffs in Pima still do n't much trust Goddard --- or his motives .
Since former Democratic Governor Janet Napalitano was tapped by President Obama to head the Dept. of Homeland Security , the state 's former Republican Secretary of State Jan Brewer has become the Governor .
Goddard plans to run for the Democratic Party nomination to unseat her in the state 's upcoming election .
March --- seen in the photo above , outside of Goddard 's Phoenix office , holding a sign that says " DUDE , GOOD LUCK WITH THAT WHOLE ' GOVERNOR ' THING " --- contends that there has been plenty of opportunity over the years to game the RTA election 's paper ballots , when they were out of the secure chain of custody at various times , including during the more - than - month - long interim following Goddard 's secret removal and transfer of the ballots from Tucson to Phoenix .
" The paper ballots were originally stored at the Pima elections office , then were transported to the Iron Mountain private document storage facility , back to Pima elections as part of litigation over access to other documents in the same boxes , then back to Iron Mountain , then were grabbed by the AZ AG 's office and taken to points unknown with no oversight , and then under some circumstance we do n't have details on , will go to the Maricopa elections office for counting , " wrote March in a document he shared with The BRAD BLOG , adding " There are ( or have been ) opportunities for tampering at several points along the line . "
The attorney Risner is similarly suspect of Goddard and company .
" The AG 's office seized the ballot boxes in response to my letter on behalf of the Pima County Democratic Party that we would soon be obtaining copies of the poll tapes from the ballot boxes and we wanted them to participate to the extent that potential evidence was not contaminated , " he recently said .
Risner had made a public records request for the poll tapes from the election , which would have been printed on election night , at the polling place , describing the results of optically - scanned ballots before those numbers were sent to the central Diebold tabulator .
But before the records request could be performed , Goddard swept up the tapes which had been stored along with the ballots themselves .
" The AG 's [ office ] accepted our suggestion and secretly seized the ballot boxes and has not communicated with me further , " Risner said .
" The examination of the ballots is really no different than the examination of evidence in any case .
Security is important , " Risner explained , though he 's highly critical of the way Goddard 's handled the entire process .
" Keeping the process secret is not important , " he said .
He went on to note the " very important " history of the AG 's prior investigation into the allegations , some years earlier .
" It is a fact that the AG 's office teamed up with the ' Suspects ' [ the Pima County election officials ] in an early part of this investigation , " he said , pointing out that he'd never seen similar collusion between a prosecutor and an alleged perpetrator before .
In addition to relying on instructions from the Pima County election officials --- the " suspects " --- themselves , as to how to evaluate the Diebold databases and audit logs during the earlier investigation , rather than relying on the Democratic Party plaintiff 's suggestions , Risner says the AG 's office has been less than cooperative for years .
" The AG 's office refused to provide public records ... to the Pima County Democratic Party and ordered the county ( the suspects ) not to provide us with a copy ... That conduct was outrageous and clearly in violation of the law , " contends Risner .
What It All May Mean ...
An editorial in the Tucson Citizen this week avers that next week 's hand - count will " either put to rest allegations of ballot tampering - or it will breathe new life into those allegations , casting an irrefutable pall over operations of the Pima County Division of Elections . "
While questions remain as to whether the long - overdue count will , indeed , " put to rest " such allegations , if fraud is , in fact , found , it could well rock the nation --- trumping both the MN Senate battle and the more recent NY - 20 U.S.
House battle , both facing hand - counts as well next week --- as to the way that the U.S. currently tabulates , in secret , the vast majority of its votes .
A finding that fraud was committed in the 2006 RTA election would be the first officially confirmed case of an election being electronically tampered with , at the tabulator level , in the modern e-voting age .
In the face of the lack of hard confirmation of such tampering ( due , in no small part , to the fact that the e-voting industry has spent millions keeping any such evidence out of the hands of independent investigators ) the e-voting industry and their fellow - denialists have desperately contended that there is no hard evidence that any election has ever been electronically manipulated in such a way .
The Tucson Weekly editorial goes on to optimistically opine that while it's " unfortunate the hand count is being done in Phoenix ... Pima County voters soon will have the satisfaction of knowing - without a doubt - whether their votes were accurately counted . "
Whether such a " doubt " still remains after next week is anybody 's guess .
Given Goddard 's more - than - month - long disappearance of ballots from the secure , transparent chain of custody , he'd better hope that his office finds the election was defrauded .
Any other finding will likely continue speculation by critics of both Goddard and the Pima County Department of Elections .
AG Goddard 's sudden , surprise interest , along with his strange behavior in the entire affair , was summed up in one simple , if perhaps understandably cynical , turn of phrase from the Democrats ' attorney Bill Risner in an email today : " It 's quite the interesting show from someone who is running for Governor in the Democratic Party primary . "
* * *
There may be no observers permitted into the counting room at all from the Libertarian Party , and none of the observers will be allowed to video tape , or even take notes , as per the instructions from AG Goddard 's office , but Conrad said in his initial letter to the party chairs that " Maricopa Elections also has arranged to have live streaming video of the examination available to the public on the internet . "
Following complaints from the election integrity advocates that previous video feeds of ballot counting had disallowed the viewing of anything but the people doing the counting , rather than what they were counting , Conrad noted in his letter yesterday to the Libertarians that " Eight cameras will stream live video of the examination proceedings to the internet " .
Beginning on Monday , that live video feed will be available here .
UPDATE 4/6/09 :
The counting is now underway , and the eight camera live feed , promised by the AG , is utterly useless .
Only two of the eight cameras actually show any counting at all , and both of them are too far away to see anything useful .

A pig is seen inside its enclosure at a farm in Spain 's central town of Burgos April 28 , 2009 .
Spanish authorities have confirmed a second case of swine flu , this time in a patient in the region of Valencia , the Health Ministry said on Tuesday .
The United Nations ' food agency said on Tuesday its was mobilising its animal health experts to check if the new strain of flu virus widely described as swine flu is really directly linked to pigs .
REUTERS / Felix Ordonez
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
What ’s in a name ?
U.S. pork producers are finding that the name of the virus spreading from Mexico is having an impact on their business , prompting U.S. officials to argue for changing the name from swine flu .
At a press briefing , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack took pains to repeatedly refer to the flu as the “ H1N1 virus . ”
Israel has rejected the name swine flu , and opted to call it “ Mexico flu . ”
Jewish dietary laws forbid eating pork .
The Paris - based World Organization for Animal Health also objected to the name , saying the virus contains avian and human components and no pig so far has been found ill with the disease .
And there is growing sentiment in the farm sector to call it the North American virus .
For U.S. pork producers the swine flu name has hurt , forcing government officials into the position of stressing that American pork is safe to eat and that other countries should not ban imports .
Pork , soybean and corn prices have fallen in the last two days , “ and if this continues , obviously you have significant potential , which is why it ’s important to get this right , ” Vilsack said .
“ This is not a food - borne illness , virus .
It is not correct to refer to it as swine flu because really that ’s not what this is about , ” he said .
Remember when we thought the web would reinvent the way we talked about videogames ?
We , the fans and enthusiasts , could finally ignore BS - heavy magazines packed full of giddy previews of Christmas toys .
In their place would rise a new era of thoughtful dialogue about the artistic strides , cultural issues and personalities involved in our favorite hobby .
Years later , social news websites like Digg and Reddit have offered us a decent approximation of what the public really wants from its videogame coverage : lists .
Lots and lots of lists .
The top " adult " issues PokÃ©mon does n't address ?
The top five most influential SNES games , as chosen by a single person ?
The top ten anything ?
Is it too late to trade this stuff in for glowing previews of Assassin 's Creed again ?
Whether IGN is counting down the Most Wanted Games of 2009 or a random blogger is trolling about the Hardest Games of 1988 , the top ten list has become the new standard of internet gaming articles .
And apparently we 're OK with that .
No matter how infuriating , typo ridden , incorrect or sloppy they are , we can't stop reading them , commenting on them and voting them to the top of Reddit and Digg .
Not content to fall by the wayside , we at The Escapist have gone to great lengths to understand and explain the proliferation of the top ten list .
We put together a comprehensive survey of gamers ' reading habits , cross-analyzed the data with EGM and PC Gamer reader surveys from the early '90s and invited leading taste - makers from mainstream magazines to weigh in on the trend .
Then we threw that stuff in the trash and farted out a top ten list of our own .
Enjoy !
10 ) It 's karma , stupid .
Reddit Gaming Channel Co-Moderator Jon " Masta " Disnard personally knows at least one reason for the trend : karma points .
" The persistence [ of top ten lists ] might be attributed to the popularity contest that goes on with sites like Reddit , Digg or Slashdot , " he says .
Because up - votes on these sites ' links also count on their submitters ' profiles , those with a nose for popular content quickly rise in the ranks .
But it 's not always easy to be the first to post a big news story or the latest SecuROM complaint .
For an easier shot at karmic gold , you 're better off posting a top ten list .
If gamers love anything more than top ten lists , it 's an arbitrary , valueless points system .
Consider Reddit and Digg 's karma systems the ultimate Gamerscore for flamewar freaks .
9 ) The author is always right .
So what if a top ten list from a gaming fanboy is full of retread reviews and missing a few obvious choices ?
That 's not the point .
Take this Game Boy Advance top ten as an example .
The reviews are short , even flippant , and each item alone can be shrugged off .
But as a collection , the author has picked a revealing series of games - mostly side - scrolling action / adventure games , with hat - tips to Mario Kart and Zelda .
It 's a reflection on the GBA 's catalog , but it's also an authentic depiction of the author 's gaming preferences , and chances are you can relate .
It 's the perfect " recommended if you like " scenario :
Whether we 're curious about his foreign perspective or nodding in agreement , there 's a chance we 'll discover something new .
Maybe he 'll hip us to a side - scroller that passed us by ; we may even take comfort in the guy 's Nintendo crush .
Here , his shamelessness is an asset .
Sales are booming for lo -jack style devices designed to remotely kill cars when their owners fall behind on payments .
These cars are sold to people whose credit has been downchecked to " B , " on lots where cars cost more , loan terms are worse , and they contain GPS units that make the car 's location continuously available to the dealer , credit - company ( and others ) so that they can more easily repossess the cars .
Companies such as OnStar are beginning to make use of their remote controls for purposes other than theft prevention : for example , the company promises to throttle the engine of any car that they 're told is involved in a police chase .
Presumably these remote - kill devices are no better or worse secured than , say , the tax - records of every British parent ( repeatedly lost by the tax authority ) , or the computer systems of giant credit - reporting bureaus , or the networks of the 100 + embassies and foreign service offices penetrated by the GhostNet espionage ring .
Designing devices that are intended to be remotely disabled , against the owner 's wishes , is like designing one of those science - fiction - movie spaceships with the inconveniently placed " self - destruct " button .
I always wondered about those : would n't starship engineers turn out a better product if they designed it from the ground up never to explode ?
And would n't these cars be more secure if they were designed never to be remotely controlled against the owner 's wishes ?
The devices , which are required by a growing number of subprime loan contracts , are the product of a revolution in telematics — the blending of telecommunications and wireless technology .
The devices are usually controlled remotely by the dealer or lender and are linked to the vehicle 's powertrain .
They usually cut out the power several days after the payment is due .
Before the deadline , the driver is treated to a concert of tones and flashing indicators signaling that the deadline is approaching .
There are also warnings after the deadline has passed .
Their proponents call the devices a win-win for consumers and finance companies .
They make it possible for dealers to sell cars to people who would have a hard time getting a loan otherwise .
The buyers end up paying a somewhat lower interest rate because the risk to the lender is less .
The products also include global positioning , or GPS , to speed up the repossession of the vehicle , if necessary .

There was more bleak housing news as U.S. home prices continued to fall in February , according to a widely followed index released Tuesday .
Spotting good news these days requires viewing the market not as a glass three - quarters empty but as a vessel one - quarter full .
Thus the producers of the Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller home price index reported Tuesday that “ for the first time in 16 months , the annual decline did not set a new record . ”
In the 20 metropolitan areas covered by the index , prices were down 18.6 % in February from the same month a year earlier .
The 20 - city index is now at a level last seen in 2002 .
In the Los Angeles area , which includes Orange County , the February index showed a 24 % drop from a year earlier .
The Los Angeles / Orange County index was down 40 % from its 2006 peak .

The sharpest February declines from the same month last year were in Phoenix ( 35.2 % ) , Las Vegas ( 31.7 % ) and San Francisco ( 31 % ) .
The Case - Shiller index compares the sale prices of homes against their previous sales and corrects for factors that would alter a home ’s value , such as remodeling .
Rather than state the value with a dollar figure , an index number is used , with 100 representing prices in January 2000 .
The February Los Angeles / Orange County index number was 163 .

16/02/2009 Submission in advance 20 years after the fatwa was issued against Salman Rushdie , Islamism has the West more firmly in its grip than ever before .
By Thierry Chervel
The Koran tells the truth – says the Koran .
The Koran is just a story say " The Satanic Verses " .
They blurt out the truth .
They place the myth within a picaresque novel where revelation is constantly rearranging itself to conform to the vagaries of everyday politics .
The " Verses " write themselves into historical conditionality , they tell how the myth was fabricated .
The novel was written at the apex of the postmodern corrosion of the concept of truth .
And that is recognisable in its tangled wilderness of miracles , versions and visions .
But its goal is quite clearly blasphemy – at least , according to the administrators of that particular truth .
Ayatollah Khomeini never read the novel , but he was quite clear about the challenge it contained and he acted accordingly – like the thunder god he is caricatured as in the novel .
Postmodern culture had not reckoned with the fury of the Ayatollah 's reaction .
After all , was there ever a more peaceful time than the 1980s ?
Yes , in 1968 left - wing intellectuals were still taking the run-up to a world - historical salto mortale , only to find themselves landing with bums in university chairs – pension entitlements included .
But it was a cheerful awakening .
The postmodern movement was an airy island of refuge for all those who no longer wished to believe in the " grand narratives . "
In 1966 it had still been somewhat painful when Michel Foucault wrote off the dispute between Hegelians and Marxists as a tempest in a teapot .
But now intellectuals were comfortably settling into a hammock of relative truths , reflexive constructions , ironic allusions .
The theorists of world revolution , who had recently been so agitated , now divided the variegated world neatly into the pigeon - holes of systems theory , post - structuralism and gender studies .
The situation seemed stable .
Nothing was serious .
Life was post - historical long before Francis Fukuyama 's " End of History . "
Simulation theorists were having the time of their lives .
But today they are still nursing their bloody noses .
Three reality shocks – the AIDS epidemic , the fatwa , and finally the collapse of the Wall – hauled them abruptly back down to earth .
Or might they still be dreaming ?
There is , incidentally , a connection between the fatwa and the collapse of the Wall .
With both Communism and Islam , it turned out that posmodernism was somewhat less amusing when it directed its subversive power against solidly entrenched claims to truth .
Understandably enough , the dissidents of Eastern Europe were very interested in the idea that all they faced was a " grand narrative . "
And in their case it was true .
They were sawing away at the legend of " real socialism " while the Westerners of 1968 , who considered themselves the avant - garde , still believed that heaven on earth could be achieved through violence .
But change was fleeting .
Just as one brand of totalitarianism was collapsing with a gentle belch , another was already raising its bearded head .
Now , in 2009 , to commemorate only the collapse of the Wall is to tell only half the story .
By threatening to kill Salman Rushdie , Islamism – which many people had previously thought of some sinister folklore in a far off land– aimed its thunderbolt directly at the West , so as keep hold of the reins of power .
The Western took genuine fright .
Writers announced their solidarity with Rushdie .
" Ms. Torture , " as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was termed in the " Satanic Verses , " gave the British author safe haven with the aid of her secret service .
As if by some magic trick , Rushdie disappeared from the scene for years .
Had organisations such as Article 19 and engaged individuals in many countries not exerted constant pressure both on Western governments and Iran , he would still be in hiding today .
When forces of reform were in power Iran issued the necessary security guaranties .
These days , however , it is best not to ask .
It was not long , though , before Western solidarity showed its limits .
The media , for example , which should in principle have stood as guardians of these threatened values , reacted in panic .
In Germany , Arno Widmann of the taz newspaper proposed that national papers join forces to print the first chapter of the " Verses " on their front pages on the same day , thus distributing the pressure across as wide an area as possible .
Frank Schirrmacher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung was initially enthusiastic about the proposal , while other arts and culture editors hemmed and hawed , hiding behind the coattails of their bosses , who invoked concern for their personnel .
Ultimately , the taz found itself alone , and even came under attack by Ulrich Greiner in Die Zeit for allegedly violating Rushdie 's copyright .
He also referred to the " hackneyed rhetoric of courage spreading through the land . "
But the Akademie der Künste was not even bold enough to organise a public reading of the novel .
It was like in the school playground , when a big kid beats up a little one .
Bystanders try to justify their own passivity by picking fault with the victim .
The same happened to Rushdie , with some people saying that the demonstrations in India , Pakistan and Britain which had preceded the fatwa were a deliberate campaign to put the novel in the spotlight .
Many people were envious of Rushdie : he was good , he was non-white , he had received an unprecedented advance for " The Satanic Verses . "
So the question arose as to whether he should pay for his own security .
The cultural pages of Europe 's newspapers continue to avoid the subject even now .
But the confrontation with Islam and Islamism – one of today 's central political issues – is essentially a cultural matter .
The fatwa functions as an act of censorship and has left a deep imprint on the West .
Communism also used to manipulate public opinion this side of the Iron Curtain , with the aid of its secret services and corruption .
But Islamism , although a far more informal system , exerts a much more effective influence over the minds of Western cultural and media leaders .
The fear is rationalised with the word " respect . "
Playing with the symbols , discourse and constraints of Christianity has long been taken for granted in Western culture .
But playing with the symbols of Islam has been out of bounds since the fatwa , ostensibly out of " respect . "
A gigantic taboo zone has been created , repeatedly reiterated and expanded with the well - intentioned collaboration of Western intellectuals .
Tariq Ramadan , for example , the moderate Islamist from Geneva , won his first spurs by preventing a production of Voltaire 's " Mahomet . "
Sweetly smiling women in head scarves distributed leaflets in Geneva in protest against the play .
The city withdrew its support from the production .
" They call it censorship , but I see it as tact , " said Ramadan in gratitude .
There have been countless cases of submission in advance since the fatwa .
Two happened in Berlin : Kirsten Harms , general manager of the Deutsche Oper in Berlin , cancelled a production of Mozart 's " Idomeneo " because stage director Hans Neuenfels had played a tad provocatively with the symbols of several religions – not just Islam !
There had not been even a spark of protest , but Harms was " advised " to cancel the work .
Second example : Without even giving reasons , Peter - Klaus Schuster , general director of the state museums in Berlin and head of the Nationalgalerie , prevented Gregor Schneider 's Kaaba - like black cube from being erected in front of Berlin 's Hamburger Bahnhof museum – and this after the Venice Biennale had already bowed to pressure .
The public was silent , by and large .
Eventually Schneider was able to put his cube elsewhere in Hamburg – and the heavens did not fall !
Things can also turn out otherwise , precisely because of the fear that they might .
This was illustrated by British - Indian author Kenan Malik in an essay linking the fatwa to Sherry Jones 's novel " The Jewel of Medina " .
After an evaluation by Islam scholar Denise Spellberg , America 's Random House publishers withdrew the work about Aisha , supposedly Mohammed 's favourite wife .
Martin Rynja , head of the small British publishing house Gibson Square , brought out the novel – and his offices were duly set alight .
Before Random
House buckled , however , there had been no fuss about the novel .
As Malik writes , this kind of " respect " engenders the very monsters it hopes to appease .
Western media failed miserably in the dispute over the notorious Danish Mohammed cartoons .
CNN and BBC pixelated the caricatures , as if they were child pornography or Islamist snuff .
With the exception of Die Welt , German newspapers also avoided printing the cartoon clearly .
In Der Spiegel the relevant page from Denmark 's Jyllands - Posten was printed about the size of a passport photo .
You had to search the Internet if to see the cartoons full - size .
And yet that the drawings were not even insulting to Islam .
Editors and publishers pursed their lips to defend the right of cartoonists to express their opinions – hastily adding that the drawings were poor anyway and not worth all the fuss .
But this is n't true .
The cartoons are self - ironic reflections on the cartoonist 's fear of precisely the reactions that followed .
They are , in fact , marginally better than the average daily cartoon fare on the opinion pages .
The media betrayed their own cartoonists .
And , by the way , the drawings are far more harmless than Rushdie 's " Satanic Verses " , which never hesitates to blaspheme .
All of which illustrates that the boundaries of the zone of taboo have expanded since the fatwa .
At the high point of the dispute over the cartoons , the Dutch politicican Ayaan Hirsi Ali came to Berlin , of all places , to give a speech defending the rights of the cartoonists .
She herself pointed out the connection between the two totalitarianisms .
As a dissident Muslim , she used the example of Eastern European dissidence which was rewarded with the collapse of the Wall .
But her gesture was not understood .
Essentially , what happened to her was worse than what had happened to Rushdie , who was at least defended and protected .
In 2004 a young extremist named Bouyeri assassinated the filmmaker Theo van Gogh who , together with Hirsi Ali , had made the film " Submission " .
Bouyeri thrust a dagger into van Gogh 's chest , to which was attached a note : " I know , oh Ayaan Hirsi Ali , that you shall go under / I know , oh fundamentalists of unbelief , that you shall go down . "
These words got around .
Writers like Ian Buruma and Timothy Garton
Ash took them up and amplified them , half - consciously , half - unconsciously , equating the " fundamentalists of the Enlightenment " with Islamic fundamentalists .
Garton
Ash later recanted .
What remained was the insistence by Hirsi Ali's opponents that her activities were useless , that her intransigence was itself driving Muslims into a corner , that her denial of the faith meant she represented nothing and thus was unable to contribute to the integration of Muslims into Western society .
Tariq Ramadan was the man to listen to , they said .
Hirsi Ali was threatened with losing her Dutch citizenship .
She left for the United States whereupon the Dutch government stopped paying for her security .
Cassandra does n't live here anymore .
God is great .
The European Left cried no tears for her .
She had long been decried as a useful idiot of reactionary forces .
In a striking parallel to the fate of many ex-Communist dissidents , Hirsi Ali found no home on the Left .
Rushdie , too , had to admit that he had been mistaken .
In his " Satanic Verses " he had declared that the war on racism in Britain , on Hindu nationalism in India , on Islamism , was part of the Left 's greater purpose .
But he was doubly mistaken : Islamism has a universalist thrust which makes it more dangerous than mere xenophobia .
Yet the Left prefers battling Islamic dissidents to fighting Islamism .
Is this a reassessment of all our values , or a distortion beyond all recognition ?
In the confrontation with Islamism , the Left has abandoned its principles .
In the past it stood for cutting the ties to convention and tradition , but in the case of Islam it reinstates them in the name of multiculturalism .
It is proud to have fought for women 's rights , but in Islam it tolerates head scarves , arranged marriages , and wife - beating .
It once stood for equal rights , now it preaches a right to difference – and thus different rights .
It proclaims freedom of speech , but when it comes to Islam it coughs in embarrassment .
It once supported gay rights , but now keeps silent about Islam 's taboo on homosexuality .
The West 's long - due process of self - relativisation at the end of the colonial era , which was promoted by postmodernist and structuralist ideas , has led to cultural relativism and the loss of criteria .
Rushdie 's " Satanic Verses " show that enlightenment is not a path to bone - dry reason .
The novel is packed with riddles and wonders , top - heavy with symbols and postmodern brouhaha , colourful as a Pakistani bus .
It is a swift , inspired , extremely ambitious act of liberation .
It is Gibreel 's ham sandwich .
Today one trembles at its impudence .
The Prophet is called Mahound .
Mohammed 's twelve wives are reflected in the twelve prostitutes in a brothel .
Not just enlightenment , it tells us , but blasphemy , too , leads humankind out of its self - imposed immaturity , an act of liberation which makes our hearts beat wildly , in euphoria and panic .
The novel insists that we can ride our bicycles without stabilisers .
It is beyond this act that the here and now awaits .
This novel , written by an immigrant , challenges Europe not to lose sight of its selfhood .
But Europe prefers not to listen .

YOU already have everything inside of YOU to be successful .
A proposed U.S. law would require Internet service providers to store information about every user of their services and keep that data for at least two years , in a bid to crack down on Internet - based predators and child pornographers .
The language of the law may even apply to owners of home Wi-Fi routers , according to a digital rights attorney .
U.S. Senator John Cornyn and Representative Lamar Smith , both Republicans from Texas , held a press conference Thursday to announce separate bills in the Senate and House of Representatives , both called the Internet Safety Act .
Along with sections stipulating stiffer penalties for activities related to accessing child pornography on the Internet , the law would require Internet and e-mail service providers to retain “ all records or other information ” about anyone using a network address temporarily assigned by the service .
The provision about retention would apply to any provider of “ an electronic communication service or remote computing service , ” as well as someone who receives the content and recipient list of e-mail messages that it “ transmits , receives , or stores , ” according to the text of the Senate bill .
“ While the Internet has generated many positive changes in the way we communicate and do business , its limitless nature offers anonymity that has opened the door to criminals looking to harm innocent children , ” Cornyn said in a press release .
Cornyn and Smith said the law would require ISPs to hold on to subscriber records similar to those retained by telecommunications carriers .
But civil liberties advocates pointed out that those phone records are not retained for use in investigations .
“ There absolutely is no data retention requirement for phone companies for the purposes of law enforcement , ” said Kevin Bankston , senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
Both carriers and ISPs already are required to preserve any information related to specific communications on their networks that are involved in a criminal investigation , he said .
Preservation requests last just 90 days but can be renewed , giving prosecutors as much as six months to obtain a court order to seize the information as evidence , Bankston said .
The Internet Safety Act would amount to service providers storing personal information about their customers just in case they are later accused of a crime , said Leslie Harris , president of the Center for Democracy and Technology .
The law might impose a heavy burden on private citizens and enterprises with wireless networks , even ones that are password - protected , EFF ’s Bankston said .
It could mean Wi-Fi routers would need hard drives to store data on every user who gets on the network .
“ It ’s incredibly overbroad , and it does n’t just reach the AT&Ts and Comcasts of the world ; it reaches your corner coffee shop , and even you at home , ” he said .
“ The current definition of electronic communication providers certainly reaches people who run wireless routers . ”
Because the bills are being pushed by Republicans , without any cosponsors from the Democratic Party , which controls the House and Senate as well as the White House , they are unlikely to make it very far .
But Bankston said the Internet Safety
Act wo n’t be the last proposal of its kind .
“ Data retention proposals are sort of like zombies , in that they ’re kind of easy to knock down , but they tend to come back , ” Bankston said .

Caring for abandoned dogs has proved successful in rehabilitating criminals
The prison yard is filled with loud grunts and heavy clunks - the unmistakable sound of men pumping iron .
Tattooed inmates bathed in sweat are working out in the outdoor gym behind the razor wire of the Lansing Correctional Facility in Kansas .
Suddenly there is a very different sound - a high - pitched whimper .
On the other side of the yard where another group of tough guys have found something else to occupy them - a puppy .
" Hold still , little fellow , " laughs a man in a blue shirt as the tiny puppy scampers over his feet and across the grass .
Finally the man , inmate Danny Johnson , succeeds in catching the terrier and cradles him in his arms .
" This is Reno and he is quite a character , " he says proudly .
" He and his sisters were abandoned so we 're looking after them now . "
Danny is near the end of a 10 - year sentence for aggravated kidnapping and burglary .
Inmate Danny Johnson has found his work caring for dogs therapeutic
He tells me that he was arrested after he broke up with his girlfriend and stormed into her house armed with a rifle .
He no longer talks to her or to his children who stopped visiting years ago .
But despite all that , he says he feels positive about the future .
He is hoping to set up his own animal shelter after his release .
" Working with the dogs , it helps me to help them .
Big time .
You know it is such a joy to do that .
" Some of them come in here with serious injuries , they have suffered terrible cruelty .
I try to make sure that they recover and I get them to trust people again - it 's amazing to see how they change . "
The Safe Harbour programme , which gets the inmates to rehabilitate abandoned dogs is well - established and popular with people on both sides of the prison fence .
It has not been without controversy .
In 2006 , one of the local volunteers helped a convicted killer to escape by hiding him in a dog crate and driving him through the gates .
But Warden David McKune says that after that episode he received several letters and cards in support of the scheme .
" We believe that the benefits outweigh the risks , " he says .
Security has been tightened up however and dogs now must be walked into and out of the prison .
Wild horses
In another part of Kansas two hours ' drive away , prisoners are breaking in wild horses on a mustang ranch .
The horses come from states such as Wyoming where federal protection and a lack of natural predators have led to overpopulated herds .
The mustang ranch at Hutchinson Prison where inmates tame wild horses Since vegetation and water could become dangerously scarce if there are too many animals , the US Bureau of Land Management rounds up the excess numbers .
Some of the horses wind up in prisons where they are tamed by inmates .
Later they are offered for sale or adoption by the general public .
Sam Cline , the warden of Hutchinson Prison , is keen to show me what a good job his men are doing .
" Animals are unconditional in their affections and they really do give an individual an outlet for his tensions , " he says .
LISTEN TO THE PROGRAMME Fresh Start on the BBC World Service Listen on the BBC iPlayer or download the podcast " Sometimes we find men who can't relate to authority figures relate much better to the horses . "
Don Austin , who says he got into trouble because of drugs and alcohol , is clearly attached to the horses .
He strokes one on the nose and pats its glossy neck .
" It is therapeutic for me to take care of something and right now since I can't be with my kids ; it helps me out a bunch to have a creature that needs me .
" A creature that is looking forward to me being there for meal times , grooming or whatever . "
Patience Fellow inmate Jimmie Barnes agrees and tells me he much prefers working on the ranch than sitting in a prison cell indoors .
Inmate Jimmie Barnes does not see his work on the ranch as a soft option
But what would they say to people who feel that convicted prisoners should n't be having fun riding horses ?
Jimmie scoffs at the idea that breaking in wild horses is a soft option .
" If you have ever tried to do the ground work in one of these round pens with a wild mustang it is not always as much fun as it is cracked up to be .
" I have seen guys coming out there just dripping with sweat , you know . "
I watch as a stallion which has never been touched by a human before is gently coaxed into the pen and made to walk in different directions .
His ears are flattened and he looks furious as he bucks and whinnies but Jimmie never raises his voice and moves with quiet confidence .
Warden Cline says being tough with these animals simply does not work .
" Some guys have a lifetime history of abusing people but if you play that game in the animal kingdom , you are going to pay the price pretty quick .
" We want our men to learn to do things with a patient , controlled , self - disciplined approach that does n't allow for violence or outbursts of their own emotions .
" Hopefully when they leave prison , these are tools they 'll use with other people . "
My impressions are that these horses really do help to change these men .
But as night falls the ranchers become convicts again when they return to their cells .
With their fluorescent lighting , metallic surfaces and constant noise , prisons seem to amplify , even encourage the occupants ' aggression .
Without walls A prison in Norway has disposed of those buildings altogether and created the world 's first eco-jail on an island in a fjord just south of Oslo .
The men at Bastoey are not petty criminals .
Most have committed serious offences including murder and rape and they began their sentences in traditional closed prisons from where they applied to live on the island .
Those who are accepted must be willing to embrace the underlying philosophy here - that respecting nature helps you to respect yourself and other people .
Arne Kvernik Nilsen , the governor of Bastoey , says some prisons make bad people worse and criminals are often more dangerous to the community when they are released from traditional prisons .
Bastoy prison in Norway operates a working farm run by inmates " I see this as a place of healing " , he tells me .
" We are trying to repair the damage we have caused by lock people up in old fashioned , high security prisons . "
Proper research has yet to be done but the governor says according to certain tests , reoffending figures are much lower than in ordinary Norwegian prisons .
Of course the population here is carefully selected .
But another indication that the prison does work is that in five years there has only been one escape even though the prisoners are the ones who run the ferry service to the mainland .
I meet Jergen , who 's serving a sentence for drug trafficking , sitting in the sunshine over a cup of coffee in the port of Horten - 20 minutes across the water from the prison .
He says he enjoys working on the ferry but above all he loves to work on the prison farm with the animals .
With a broad smile he talks about learning to deliver calves .
" We 've had some complicated births - once I had to put arm inside and turn the calf around .
Another time a mother died so I had to bottle feed the calves .
Every time I see them walking around I feel as if they are my children ! "
Lucy Ash presents Fresh Start on the BBC World Service , visiting prisons around the world to explore the imaginative methods they are using to stop re-offending .

Lewis Hamilton and McLaren have been stripped of their podium finish and all points at the Australian Grand Prix .
The sport 's world governing body , the FIA , said they were excluded " for providing evidence deliberately misleading to the stewards " .
A post -race hearing promoted Hamilton from fourth to third after Jarno Trulli was penalised for passing Hamilton while the safety car was out .
Trulli and Toyota have been reinstated to third , and McLaren will not appeal .
Hamilton was summoned by stewards on Thursday , ahead of this weekend 's Malaysian GP , to discuss what the FIA described as " a new element " of evidence .
That " new element " included radio exchanges between Hamilton and his team as well as a post - race interview given by the world champion .
" The stewards , having learned about the radio exchanges and the media interview , felt strongly that they had been misled by the driver and his team manager , " said an FIA statement .
An FIA spokesman said it " could not rule out at this stage " further action against McLaren .
Hamilton left the Sepang International Circuit without commenting on the decision .
Trulli was initially handed a 25 - second penalty for the incident , which saw him demoted to 12th .

" We are disappointed by what has happened but in the circumstances we are not going to appeal , " said McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh , before the FIA 's summary of considerations was released .
He added : " There is no implication that Lewis lied to the stewards .
" As I understand there is a belief that the team was not explicit enough in the content of the radio communications to the stewards .
" What they believe is that the omission of the information about the radio communication between the team was withheld and that is misleading .
" I believe it was a harsh decision .
Lewis made a legitimate pass and then was repassed - at the time the team asked race control several times about the repass but they were too busy to answer that question so we felt the decision in the immediate aftermath was fair .
" I think it 's a regrettable day .
It certainly was n't a deliberate attempt ( to mislead the stewards ) . "
F1 MOLE
Whitmarsh , the vein in his temple throbbing , held the world 's media captive in front of the McLaren garage as he faced an intense interrogation into Hamilton 's disqualification
McLaren have had little leeway in terms of receiving the benefit of the doubt from the FIA since the 2007 ' spygate ' row .
That saw the team stripped of their constructors ' points and fined £ 50 m after being caught in possession of sensitive Ferrari technical data .
In Melbourne on Sunday , the safety car came out after a late collision between Red Bull 's Sebastian Vettel and Robert Kubica in his BMW Sauber .
Trulli slid off the track and was passed by Hamilton but the Toyota driver , who has welcomed the decision , said he had little choice but to overtake the Briton again .
" I am happy because I wanted some justice and I got it , " said Trulli .
" I am happy for myself and the team and I have to thank the FIA because it does not happen very often they reconsider something .
" It must have been really hard for them , but they had common sense to really try and understand what was going on .
I have always been honest and it has paid off .
" It was a controversial end of the race and it was hard for anyone to understand , but I never lied .
I was honest in my statement and I never changed it . "
BBC commentator and former F1 driver Martin Brundle said : " This does not look good for Hamilton or McLaren .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Hamilton passed Trulli as he was off the road .
Hamilton clearly wondered then , to give him the benefit of the doubt , if he had passed under the safety car conditions and was trying to let Trulli back through .
" There was a point when he was doing just 15 mph in his McLaren and Trulli had no option but to repass him .
" I think Lewis then saw half a chance of a third place instead of a fourth , went up to the stewards and did n't give them the full story .
" Now they 've matched up his comments ( to them ) to radio content between him and the team , and other information they 've gathered , and they 've decided that effectively he was telling fibs .
" I think it 's a big issue and it's not going to go away .
If they were asked a direct question they should have given the right answer , and they clearly did n't . "

During a surprise visit last month , state investigators witnessed a worker in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center nursery sloppily cleaning a board that had been used during a minor surgery , contaminating a nearby counter .
They also discovered during the inspection that nurses treating the tiniest of babies had received no special training in how to transfuse blood into their delicate veins .
And they watched as a doctor used medical instruments to examine the eyes and ears of one infant - and , then , a half - hour later , used the same ones on a second baby without disinfecting them .
These and other safety lapses , made public yesterday , turned up during an investigation prompted by a cluster of hard - to - treat bacterial infections among mothers and their new borns who had been at the Harvard - affiliated hospital since late last year .
The state investigation did n't establish a direct link between the deficiencies and the infections , but its findings open a window into the inner workings of an institution that has undertaken an unusually public campaign to eliminate hospital - acquired infections and other preventable errors .
And it reveals that , despite the best of intentions , reducing mistakes is a formidable challenge .
" The hospital has to fix this , " said Paul Dreyer , director of the state 's Bureau of Health Care Safety and Quality , whose staff conducted the investigation .
" There are systemic problems , there are breaks in practice , there is an ongoing cluster of cases that 's not been resolved . "
At the same time the state provided the Globe its thick report late yesterday afternoon , Beth Israel Deaconess released an even bulkier response , detailing how it intends to better protect patients from harm .
In a lengthy interview , a top hospital administrator conceded that the investigators from the state Department of Public Health had revealed significant shortcomings in safety procedures on the obstetrics and newborn wards .
Dr. Kenneth Sands , senior vice president of health care quality at the sprawling Longwood area hospital , said it has moved swiftly to correct problems identified in the inspection and will require all doctors , nurses , and other healthcare workers to complete compulsory lessons on infection control by May 1 .
" We 've always known that it 's extraordinarily difficult to set ourselves on a path to have no preventable harm " to patients , Sands said .
The lapses cited by the state , he said , " are unacceptable , and we fully agree that . . . they need to be corrected . "
He pointed out that the hospital had succeeded in reducing some of the most worrisome hospital infections .
( CNN ) --
The swine flu outbreak is spawning debate about how people get information during health emergencies -- especially at a time when news sources are becoming less centralized .
Buzz about swine flu on Twitter is stirring conversations about how people get health news .
Some observers say Twitter -- a micro-blogging site where users post 140 - character messages -- has become a hotbed of unnecessary hype and misinformation about the outbreak , which is thought to have claimed more than 100 lives in Mexico .
" This is a good example of why [ Twitter is ] headed in that wrong direction , because it 's just propagating fear amongst people as opposed to seeking actual solutions or key information , " said Brennon Slattery , a contributing writer for PC World .
" The swine flu thing came really at the crux of a media revolution . "
Twitter 's popularity has exploded in recent months , and Slattery said it 's a new development that a wide number of people would turn to the site in search of information during an emergency .
A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , however , said that the online buzz about swine flu is a good sign .
It means people are talking about the issue , and that 's the first step toward learning how to reasonably protect yourself .
" I think it 's generally a useful development , but I would encourage people to look to other sources , especially established , recognized medical authorities , " said Glen Nowak , chief of media relations at the CDC .
" It shows that people are engaged and they care and that it 's caught their attention -- and those all are good things . "
Several dozen cases of swine flu worldwide have been confirmed by the World Health Organization and hundreds more are feared .
Read more about the situation
That information needs to be put in context by journalists , especially given the fact that so many deaths from the common flu occur each year and go underreported by the news media , said Al Tompkins , who teaches broadcast and online news at the Poynter Institute , a school for journalists .
Follow CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta on Twitter
About 36,000 people die from flu - related symptoms each year in the United States , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The fast pace of new swine flu cases and their relevance to global public health policy makes the situation newsworthy , Tompkins said .
Tompkins said there is a tendency for television stations to hype health emergencies to boost their ratings , but so far coverage of the swine flu outbreak has been responsible .
Coverage of the story is just ramping up , though , he said .
Of the swine flu news on Twitter , Tompkins said , " Bad news always travels faster than good news .
I 'm sure that was true in smoke signal days . "
Unofficial swine flu information on Twitter may lead people to unwise decisions , said Evgeny Morozov , a fellow at the Open Society Institute and a blogger on ForeignPolicy.com .
For example , some Twitter users told their followers to stop eating pork , he said .
Health officials have not advised that precaution .
Read about how the virus is transmitted
Morozov said there 's incentive for Twitter users to post whatever is on their mind because it helps them grow their online audiences .
But in an emergency , that tendency means people write about their own fears of symptoms and widespread deaths , which can create an uninformed hysteria , he said .
The debate about swine flu on Twitter is not one - sided , however .
And the site is not the only place online where people are talking about the outbreak .
Some Twitter users have expressed concern that the swine flu story is being hyped .
Several media outlets , including the BBC and CNN's iReport.com , give readers and viewers a chance to express their own views about the outbreak .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also maintains its own Twitter account where official government information is given straight to the public .
And on Monday , President Obama seemed to try to calm national fears by saying the outbreak is " cause for concern and requires a heightened state of alert " but is not a " cause for alarm , " CNN reported .
Twitter traffic about swine flu has been strong .
According to Nielsen Online , swine flu has worked its way into about 2 percent of all notes posted on the site on Monday .
You can follow that Twitter conversation here .
Chatter about swine flu is also loud elsewhere online .
About 10 times more people are writing online about swine flu than wrote about the salmonella and peanut butter scares from this winter , Nielsen says .
An interactive map created using the free Google Maps service lets Internet users see where outbreak deaths have been confirmed and where they are suspected .
See a CNN map
Slattery , the PC World contributor , also criticized television news stations like CNN and Fox News for hyping the story and adding to public fear .
He said he generally was excited about Twitter until recently .
Now , it 's changing , and he finds the site to be " an incredibly unreliable source of information . "

He said some headlines , however , have been a bit sensational .

That 's the " online equivalent of washing your hands , " he said .

The Chelsea striker Didier Drogba has spoken of his sadness after at least 19 supporters died during the Ivory Coast 's 5 - 0 win over Malawi on Sunday .
The incident took place before the World Cup qualifier at the Felix Houphouet - Boigny stadium when a wall collapsed , causing panic among fans .
The situation was said to have been worsened by the fact that 50,000 fans were in and around the 45,000 capacity ground in Abidjan .
Drogba , who scored twice in the match , said the incident , in which at least 135 people were injured , put football into perspective .
" I am disappointed by what happened , it is hard to take , " he said .
" Football is nothing , you are talking about the death of 19 people – it is hard to take .
When things like that happen , it makes you realise how much people care about their country , their team .
Peace to them , it is sad . "
The 31 - year - old 's team - mate for both club and country , Salomon Kalou , who also scored in the match , said : " I am disappointed .
My thoughts are with their families , peace to them . "
The Barcelona midfielder Yaya Touré , who missed Sunday 's match through injury , wants to honour the fans who died .
" After the game I spoke with the captain , Didier Drogba , my brother [ Kolo Touré ] and the coach .
Behind this victory was a tragedy and it's difficult because they are Ivory Coast supporters and we know them well , " Touré said .
" We have to go as far as we can in this competition for all the people who died .
" Many people come out to the national team games in my country because they are very happy to see the footballers that play in Europe .
It 's a very important tragedy .
We 're all conscious that this is something that is very difficult and I want to send a message of solidarity . "
Witnesses said a wall at the Felix Houphouet - Boigny stadium collapsed under the weight of fans , who set off the stampede by rushing toward the field .
Fifa has asked for a full report into what caused the tragedy .
Commentators react to Obama 's plan to reduce itemized deductions , including the charitable deduction , for high income tax payers .
Indiana Center on Philanthropy estimates that giving could drop $ 3.9 billion .
My understanding , though , is that the capping or reducing of deductions for the wealthy is not a new battleground .
Under earlier law there had been a reduction of itemized deductions for high income earners .
That reduction in turn was being phased out .
Now , back something like it comes .
I seriously doubt that most donors are motivated by these tax machinations at the margins .
Professionals get deeply into them .
Fundraisers and journalists may express concerns , but what donors want to talk about in my experience , candidly , is the donor and the donor 's family , and the life the donor wants to lead , and the values he or she wants to stand for , and the impact he or she wants to have , during these very difficult times .
Put it this way , in a financial or estate plan , the bulk of a wealth person 's money may be misaligned with his or her ideals .
The tax driven planning process gets so caught up in details , taking tax as its focus , it fails to confront the big issues :
What kind of person do you want to be , in what kind of world ?
95 % of clients who do not finish an estate plan say it is because the plan was out of whack with their goals .
That is not a fine point .
To get more money moving to better purpose , open a conversation about the donor 's life history , the crossroads they confront , the life determing choices they face , the person they want to be , the example they want to set .
Then , convene the bean counters to find the most tax effective and tax efficient way to acheive those ends in view , but do not let the the conversation sidetrack the purpose conversation .
How much donors gives depends in part on how well counseled they are .
As advisors is our responsibility to help clients and donors keep things in persptive and aligned with their aspirations and ideals .
This might invalidate CNBC 's theory that the swine flu issue will blow away by this time tomorrow .

Technology.am ( Apr. 21 , 2009 ) — Once again computer spies hit the U.S. , targeting sensitive data involving the $ 300 billion Joint Strike Fighter project .
This project is the most expensive Pentagon weapons system ever developed ; the program involves 7.5 million lines of code and hackers made off with several terabytes of it .
The Joint Strike Fighter project is also known as the F - 35 Lightening II , and it is being developed by Lockheed Martin for the US Air Force , Navy and Marine Corps and the British Royal Navy .
It was said that the attacks originated from China , although Pentagon officials said it is very easy to mask such attacks and no actual proof exists of Chinese involvement .
The Chinese Embassy in Washington denied the allegations .
The hackers infiltrated the system through network vulnerabilities of several contractors working on the project .
In addition to Lockheed Martin , other contractors working on the fighter plane include Northrup Grumman and BAE Systems .
The spies encrypted the data as it was being stolen , leaving Pentagon officials unable to account for all of the data that may have been stolen .

Michelle Malkin 's latest wheeze is take on Matt Taibbi in a battle of the talking heads .
The problem is , Michelle Malkin has the prosaic flair of a retarded chimpanzee , while Taibbi is almost universally recognized as the sharpest satirist around .
Taibbi acutely captured Malkin in his recent post on the ' Tea Baggers ' , referring to her as ' A mean little dunce who ’s wedged herself into a nicely paying career as
a GOP spokesclown . '
Malkin shot back as best she could , calling Taibbi a ' Vulgarian ' , then attempting to pay him a back handed compliment when comparing him to Anderson Cooper ( who has got in on the Tea Bag jokes himself ) :

Taibbi at least had the courage of his sexual predelictions not to hide coyly behind innuendo .
Anderson Cooper does n’t have the ba …
Never mind .
I suspect Malkin's use of three moderately sophisticated words ( predilictions , coyly , and innuendo ) and thinly veiled homophobia is an attempt to prove herself a worthy wordsmith .
Deep down , Taibbi's assessment of her writing ( quote : " Michelle Malkin ’s writing was on the edge of unreadable ; she ’s sort of
like Ann Coulter , only without that tiny fraction of P.T. Barnum / Mick
Jagger - esque self - promotional flair that makes Coulter at least vaguely
interesting " ) has made her feel slightly insecure .
Malkin directs her viciousness mostly at Anderson Cooper because she knows getting in to a slanging match with Taibbi would be suicidal .

Malkin undersatnds full well why she is successful - she appeals to stupid white people who love to see minorities bash other minorities .
Once she ventures outside of this safe haven of anti intellectualism , her vulnerabilities as a third rate journalist become all too apparent .
While sickly sweet CNN liberals wo n't say much , serious journalists with real talent will .
So Michelle , a word of advice .
Stick to the shallow end of the pool , and do n't dive into the deep end .
You 'll drown pretty quick .
Performance is a key factor for any successful website .
And since WordPress is becoming more popular than ever , it will only be at its best when raised in the proper conditions .
Here are a few things to try if you find that your WordPress site is not performing as well as it could be due to high traffic or hidden issues you do n’t know about .
Some Basic & Simple Steps
1. Upgrade to latest WordPress release
WordPress 2.7 have manny performance improvements over previous versions .
So you better upgrade to latest release to make use of this .
2. Remove unnecessary Plugins & upgrade current ones
Remove any plugins that you are n’t using .
Deactivate them and physically delete them from your web server .
Deactivated plugins will affect the speed of a site because the WordPress checks to see if they are activated or not .
Also you must stay up to date with the latest versions of the plugins you are currently using .
Developers release new versions because they ’ve modified the code in some way to make the plugin work better .
3. Minimize PHP and database queries
I read about this great tip on Wpcandy ’s simple ways to speed up WordPress post .
It makes a lot of sense , cutting down on PHP and database queries .
Each time a page on your site loads , if your browser has to execute any PHP queries , it adds to the load time .
If you replace the PHP queries with static HTML , every time a page loads , your browser just reads the HTML .
4. Optimize and Repair your Database from myPhpAdmin
Every week or so you should login to your myPhpAdmin and optimize your db .
Locate your WordPress DatabaseTables , check all the tables in the Check Boxes , select the Optimise Tables Option and repair .
You would be surprised how well this trick might work , it saved more than 10 % of my current database size .
Take a good care of your Images
5. Use Reliable image hosting service
Try moving the common web images , CSS , JavaScript and other static files to Amazon S3 Storage service and you will notice the average CPU load / memory requirement of the web server will be reduced a lot .
Read this step by step guide .
You can also try this WordPress plugin , WP - Offload will boost the performance of your blog by seamlessly offloading static content like images , documents and movies .
This will greatly reduce bandwidth consumption and the number of HTTP requests issued to your web server .
Additional features such as remote image manipulation and thumbnail generation are provided .
Shrink O’Matic is an AIR application to easily ( batch ) resize ( shrink ) images .
It handles JPGs , GIFs and PNGs .
Simply drag and drop images and they ’ll be resized as you wish !
Options allow you to choose the output sizes , names and formats .
Great Advices for better performance
I guess many of you know why we always insist on using this plugin .
This plugin generates static html files from your dynamic WordPress blog .
After an html file is generated your webserver will serve that file instead of processing the comparatively heavier and more expensive WordPress PHP scripts and will not actually load any content from the database at all therefore the post will load faster with less stress on your server .
PHP Speedy WP can quickly and easily speed up your WordPress site and improve your blog ’s response time without too much effort on your side by allowing us to automatically combine all JS and CSS files into only two files – which in turn helps greatly with page loading times .
CSS Background Images are automatically converted to data URIs .
This is useful in reducing the amount of HTTP requests even further .
And , importantly , it ’s compatible with Internet Explorer , even though it does n’t support data URIs .
Unfortunately , PHP speedy comes with few flaws out of box that need fixing : Combined JavaScript is placed at the top of the page instead at the bottom , it does not work with WP Super Cache .
In order to get this two working like we want them , you have to check this great article by Prelovac to make few adjustments to both plugins .
This plugin GZIP and strip whitespace from your CSS files .
It allows you to confidently use @import inside a CSS file and not worry about what happens on the user ’s end .
It will look through your style.css file and put any @import files into it .
A cache expiry time can also be set .
You can also add CSS files to a specific page or post and putting all of them into one file .
This plugin caches every database query with given lifetime .
It is very fast and uses small disk space for caching .
I did n’t try this plugin yet but I ’ve read many reviews recommending it .
Let me know what do you guys think about it so we can update this post with correct information about its performance .
The AJAX Libraries API is an attempt to make Web applications faster for developers in simple ways by becoming a content distribution network and loading architecture for popular javascript libraries including :
You can either link to the source code directly :
< script type =" text / javascript " src= "
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/prototype/1.6.0.2/prototype.js "></script>
Or you can use Google ’s API :
< script type =" text / javascript " src= "
http://www.google.com/jsapi "></script> < script type =" text / javascript " >google.load ( " prototype " , " 1.6.0.2 " ) ;</ script >
By using the google .load ( ) method , your application has high speed , globally available access to a growing list of the most popular , open source and up to date JavaScript libraries .
Here is a simple code to insert on your template to know how long it took for your page to load , or how many sql queries were executed .
This tip is very good for knowing how well is your WordPress blog is optimized .
<?php echo get_num_queries ( ) ; ?> queries in <?php timer_stop ( 1 ) ; ?> seconds .
MySQL is a great database , but it does n’t clean itself up the way it should sometimes .
This plugin runs an optimize table command on your WordPress tables , effectively defragmenting it .
This is very useful for tables that are frequently updated .
The interface is very simple at the moment : just one button : Optimize Now , and some info on how much space will be saved .
It looks like this :
Must Read Resources & References
That should do it for now .
Hopefully , a few of these will help to make your WordPress perform in a much faster way .

GE has announced a breakthrough in holographic storage , which the company believes will bring it much closer to the day when it can store up to 500 GB on a single optical disc .
Like other efforts that we 've covered here on Ars over the years , GE has been working for some time on an optical storage medium that uses holograms to store data in three dimensions ; this is in contrast to conventional optical discs , which use layers of pitted metal to encode 2D data patterns that can be read by bouncing a laser off of them .
GE 's scientists had reached a point where they were able to use the same types of low - wattage lasers found in conventional DVD and Blu-ray players to read and write holographic data patterns in clear plastic discs , but these holograms did n't reflect enough light to be easily read .
The most recent breakthrough came with the use of a new material that 's reflective enough to make the holograms readable .
Because these holograms reflect laser light much better , the patterns can be scaled down in size to enable storage densities on the order of 500GB .
GE is working toward commercializing the technology , and a New York Times article on the breakthrough suggests that they may be able to bring it to market in the 2011 - 2012 timeframe .
A 500GB optical disc in two years sounds impressive , but I 'm actually having a hard time imagining a volume market for a 500 GB disc , either now or in the future .
Blu -ray currently offers enough storage to support 1080 p playback , which will probably last us at least a decade , if not two .
And by the time there 's a demand for even higher - quality media , one would hope that our broadband infrastructure will be sufficiently improved that we could digitally distribute data - intensive content ( movies , games , music , etc. ) with very large file sizes .
So the prospects for a 500GB , mass - market physical medium in 2011 do n't seem so hot .
Seriously , what would we put on it ?
If its real - world lifespan is anything like that of the current generation of optical media ( i.e. , well under ten years ) , then those who need long - term archiving will stick with magnetic tape .
Obviously , there are very important niche applications for this in the academic and medical imaging communities .
But I have no idea if those niches are large enough to support the economies of scale needed to make both the media and the players / burners cheap enough to be worthwhile .
It 's also the case that many niches that currently need a 500 GB medium for data exchange will be connecting to higher - bandwidth networks like Internet2 in the next few years .
But maybe I 'm missing something here .
If anyone can make the case for a 500 GB optical disc in 2011 , I 'd love to hear it .
Incidentally , my least favorite part of the GE promo materials was the YouTube video that , at one point , declared that 500GB is " 4,000 times more data than the human brain retains in a lifetime . "
So you 're telling me that over the course of my entire life , my brain retains 125 MB of data ?
What with the human brain being analog and all , any statistic that purports to say how many bytes of " data " the brain " stores " is bogus ; but even if you 're going to take some dramatic license and make up a number , it should at least be a very large one .
Ultimately , I think we should stick to " libraries of congress " as the standard hyperbolic unit of data storage capacity .
ROME ( AP ) 
The Italian Olympic Committee confirmed Wednesday that Olympic cycling silver medalist Davide Rebellin tested positive for doping at the Beijing Games .
CONI said in a statement that it has suspended the athlete , and anti-doping prosecutor Ettore Torri has opened an investigation following the retesting of samples taken at the Olympics .
Torri also called Rebellin to a hearing on Monday .
Rebellin's team , Diquigiovanni - Androni , also said it has temporarily suspended the rider , pending analysis of the " B " sample .
It also noted that Rebellin rode for the Gerolsteiner team last season
In an interview with La Stampa daily , Rebellin rejected the doping accusations , saying the result was " certainly a mistake . "
" I do n't see why I should take a path that would ruin me or my image , " Rebellin told Italy 's state TV on Wednesday .
" I do n't know if I 'll still be able to race , but I will always ride because cycling is my life . "
The International Olympic Committee said Tuesday that a total of seven positive tests involving six athletes came back positive for CERA , an advanced version of the blood - boosting drug EPO .
The IOC has not named the athletes or the sports involved .
The 37 - year - old Rebellin won silver in the Olympic road race in Beijing .
Last week , he won the Walloon Arrow cycling classic in Belgium for the third time .
A specialist at long single - day races , Rebellin won the Amstel Gold Race , Walloon Arrow and Liege - Bastogne - Liege in 2004 .
The German cycling federation said Stefan Schumacher also tested positive , and the Bahrain Olympic Committee said 1,500 - meter gold medalist Rashid Ramzi was another .

Programs like his may someday be used by law enforcement , said Marcus K. Rogers , head of the graduate Cyber Forensics Program at Purdue University in West Lafayette , Ind .
“ We do a lot of operational support for law enforcement in our lab here , ” said Dr. Rogers , who often searches for images that have been scattered in pieces throughout the hard drive .
“ Quite often that ’s just where the smoking guns are found . ”
Dr. Rogers said that sophisticated data - carving programs are unnecessary in simple cases of digital photo restoration , when all the data that represent the photograph are stored in one chunk .
‘ Then standard forensic software can generally recover it , ” he said .
But if the data are scattered , the problem is much trickier .
“ This program is a big step forward , ” he said .
“ Before this , it was a fairly manual process of going through the entire drive , looking through for picture fragments and trying to piece them together . ”
Such a painstaking process could take days .
Even with the best tools , it was usually not possible to restore a photograph completely once the file was fragmented , said Yalkin Demirkaya , president of Cyber Diligence Inc. in Syosset , N.Y. Mr. Demirkaya is the former commanding officer of the computer crimes investigation unit of the Internal Affairs Bureau of the New York Police Department .
“ Typically , ” he said , “ we can carve out part of the photographic image , so that we see a little strip of the image on top , for example , but the remainder is blank . ”
A version of Dr. Memon ’s program will be incorporated into Forensic Toolkit , a software program for digital investigators from the AccessData Corporation in Lindon , Utah , said Brian Karney , the chief operating officer .
Dr. Memon and two of his students , Pasha Pal and Kulesh Shanmugasundaram , have founded Digital Assembly , which sells a consumer version of the software , Adroit Photo Recovery , to restore deleted images ( $ 39.99 at digital - assembly.com ) .
The software cannot recover partial images , where parts of the original image have been overwritten by new data .
“ But it will recover photos if all of the parts are still present on the storage medium , however scattered , ” Dr. Memon said .

I ’m writing extemporaneously here , so bear with me .
On the topic of Wal - mart .
What I know about Wal - mart is that it was started in some small town in the middle of America , founded by some small guy named Sam Walton .
I know that Sam Walton is dead , he died without buying a new pickup truck .
Yes , that ’s right , he had a red and white Ford F150 pickup that he owned both before and after the tremendous success of his two retail giants , Wal - mart and Sam ’s Club .
I did n’t know Sam Walton when he was alive , and I have n’t read anything related to Sam Walton since he died .
He is , at least for me , a fictional character that knew exactly how to make consumers happy with his stores , and it was this knowledge that made him rich .
Not prosperous or successful or well - off or wealthy , but rich , filthy rich .
Today I visited one of his legacies , one of his gifts to humanity , Wal - mart , where the registered slogan on the facade is quite simply , Always .
I do n’t know what is supposed to be meant by this Always .
It could be anything : I ’m Always here for you ;
Always come here for your consumer needs ;
You can count on me not once or twice , but Always .
All ways lead to me Always .
Whatever the corporate giant intended to communicate with their Always , I ’d like to think that it had nothing to do with me walking into their establishment today with the intention of stocking up on staple foods .
I am above subliminal advertising .
Yes , I really am , but that ’s besides the point .
Although it ’s true that the ghost of Sam Walton did everything he could to guarantee my happiness within his store – he gave me free parking , he stocked the shelves with an inventory the likes of which no store will ever compare , he kept prices low ; he promised me satisfaction with whatever I bought ; his hours of operation went into the wee hours of the night – although every employee dignified enough to don the Wal - mart shirt and chant the Wal - mart jingle was at my service , a depression swept over me at the sight of other Wal - mart customers .
You see , Sam Walton had perfect control over the operation and appearance of his store , but he had no control over the demeanor and behavior of his customers .
His store thronged with people who did n’t respond to , “ Excuse me ” .
The toilet paper aisle was a hazard .
A handful of babies wore nothing but dirty diapers .
The shelves were littered like the free parking lot .
A half - eaten plum oxidized next to the rice ; a popped cylinder of Pillsbury Oven Baked Dinner Rolls hardened next to the banana fingers ; empty bottles of assorted drinks rolled around on the floor until they were swept under the shelves by moving carts .
Then came the checkout lanes .
After waiting for ten minutes or so in checkout lane 8 , a new cashier put a key into her till , turned on the light for 7 , and looked at me .
“ You can come over here , ” she said , “ I ’m open . ”
I looked at the customers both in front and behind me to make sure that they did n’t feel cheated at me accepting the cashier ’s offer .
Then I switched over to her lane .
But in the process , my gray plastic cart bumped into someone else ’s who had spotted the cashier from afar at the same time and heedlessly rushed to take advantage of the clear aisle .
“ She told me I could come over here , ” I said by way of explanation .
“ Well , she told me the same thing , ” said the intruder , obviously lying .
I looked at the cashier for a solution , and when she settled matters with a smile and a wave through , the intruder huffed and reluctantly submitted to the judge ’s decision :
“ Go ahead then . ”
As I went to take my place in lane 7 , the surly intruder eyed me with infernal scorn and said , “ Fuck you , too . ”
An attack that was n’t cloaked in hushed tones , but bold for anyone to hear .
I backpedalled into my previous position in the other lane , and she quickly began stacking her items onto the conveyor belt , victorious .
The cashier , trained by the ghost of Sam Walton , gave me a puzzled look , as if to say , Why did n’t you take your place , and all I could do was shrug my shoulders and wait in checkout lane 8 for my turn .
Sam Walton had perfect control over every facet of his establishments , but he had no control over his customers , and that ’s why Wal - mart is Always hell .

The Sun lived on the other side of the sky vault , but her daughter lived in the middle of the sky , directly above the earth , and every day as the Sun was climbing along the sky arch to the west she used to stop at her daughter 's house for dinner .
Now , the Sun hated the people on the earth , because they could never look straight at her without screwing up their faces .
She said to her brother , the Moon , " My grandchildren are ugly ; they grin all over their faces when they look at me . "
But the Moon said , " I like my younger brothers ; I think they are very handsome " because they always smiled pleasantly when they saw him in the sky at night , for his rays were milder .
The Sun was jealous and planned to kill all the people , so every day when she got near her daughter 's house she sent down such sultry rays that there was a great fever and the people died by hundreds , until everyone had lost some friend and there was fear that no one would be left .
They went for help to the Little Men , who said the only way to save them was to kill the Sun .
The Little Men made medicine and changed two men to snakes , the Spreading - adder and the Copperhead , and sent them to watch near the door of the daughter of the Sun to bite the old Sun when she came next day .
They went together and bid near the house until the Sun came , but when the Spreading - adder was about to spring , the bright light blinded him and he could only spit out yellow slime , as he does to this day when he tries to bite .
She called him a nasty thing and went by into the house , and the Copperhead crawled off without trying to do anything .
So the people still died from the heat , and they went to the Little Men a second time for help .
The Little Men made medicine again and changed one man into the great Uktena and another into the Rattlesnake and sent them to watch near the house and kill the old Sun when she came for dinner .
They made the Uktena very large , with horns on his head , and everyone thought he would be sure to do the work , but the Rattlesnake was so quick and eager that he got ahead and coiled up just outside the house , and when the Sun 's daughter opened the door to look out for her mother , he sprang up and bit her and she fell dead in the doorway .
He forgot to wait for the old Sun , but went back to the people , and the Uktena was so very angry that he went back , too .
Since then we pray to the rattlesnake and do not kill him , because he is kind and never tries to bite if we do not disturb him .
The Uktena grew angrier all the time and very dangerous , so that if he even looked at a man , that man 's family would die .
After a long time the people held a council and decided that he was too dangerous to be with them , so they sent him up to Gälû ñ 'lätï , and he is there now .
The Spreading - adder , the Copperhead , the Rattlesnake , and the Uktena were all men .
When the Sun found her daughter dead , she went into the house and grieved , and the people did not die any more , but now the world was dark all the time , because the Sun would not come out .
They went again to the Little Men , and these told them that if they wanted the Sun to come out again they must bring back her daughter from Tsûsginâ 'ï , the Ghost country , in Us 'û ñhi'yï , the Darkening land in the west .
They chose seven men to go , and gave each a sourwood rod a handbreadth long .
The Little Men told them they must take a box with them , and when they got to Tsûsginâ 'ï they would find all the ghosts at a dance .
They must stand outside the circle , and when the young woman passed in the dance they must strike her with the rods and she would fall to the ground .
Then they must put her into the box and bring her back to her mother , but they must be very sure not to open the box , even a little way , until they were home again .
They took the rods and a box and traveled seven days to the west until they came to the Darkening land .
There were a great many people there , and they were having a dance just as if they were at home in the settlements .
The young woman was in the outside circle , and as she swung around to where the seven men were standing , one struck her with his rod and she turned her head and saw him .
As she came around the second time another touched her with his rod , and then another and another , until at the seventh round she fell out of the ring , and they put her into the box and closed the lid fast .
The other ghosts seemed never to notice what had happened .
They took up the box and started home toward the east .
In a little while the girl came to life again and begged to be let out of the box , but they made no answer and went on .
Soon she called again and said she was hungry , but still they made no answer and went on .
After another while she spoke again and called for a drink and pleaded so that it was very hard to listen to her , but the men who carried the box said nothing and still went on .
When at last they were very near home , she called again and begged them to raise the lid just a little , because she was smothering .
They were afraid she was really dying now , so they lifted the lid a little to give her air , but as they did so there was a fluttering sound inside and something flew past them into the thicket and they heard a Red Bird cry , " kwish ! Kwish !
Kwish ! " in the bushes .
They shut down the lid and went on again to the settlements , but when they got there and opened the box it was empty .
So we know the Red Bird is the daughter of the Sun , and if the men had kept the box closed , as the Little Men told them to do , they would have brought her home safely , and we could bring back our other friends also from the Ghost country , but now when they die we can never bring them back .
The Sun had been glad when they started to the Ghost country , but when they came back without her daughter she grieved and cried , " My daughter , my daughter , " and wept until her tears made a flood upon the earth , and the people were afraid the world would be drowned .
They held another council , and sent their handsomest young men and women to amuse her so that she would stop crying .
They danced before the Sun and sang their best songs , but for a long time she kept her face covered and paid no attention , until at last the drummer suddenly changed the song , when she lifted up her face , and was so pleased at the sight that she forgot her grief and smiled ( Mooney 1900 ) .

CALGARY , Alberta ( Reuters ) -
The rapid - fire development of Canada ’s oil sands region has garnered a new critic -- the Catholic bishop whose diocese extends over the world ’s second - largest oil reserves .
Luc Bouchard , bishop of the diocese of St. Paul , which covers nearly 156,000 square km ( 60,000 square miles ) of northeastern Alberta and includes the massive oil sands developments near Fort McMurray , said this week that “ the integrity of creation in the Athabasca oil sands is clearly being sacrificed for economic gain ” .
In a pastoral letter to the region ’s 55,000 Catholics , the bishop wrote that the exploitation of the huge resource is environmentally unsound , challenging the “ moral legitimacy of oil sands production ” .
More than a million barrels of oil a day are produced from Alberta ’s oil sands , where reserves of 173 billion barrels are second only to Saudi Arabia’s .
Production was expected to more than double by 2015 , but falling oil prices and tightened credit have forced most of the region ’s operators to set aside ambitious expansion plans until the economy recovers .
The bishop joins a growing chorus of environmentalists worldwide who have become increasingly wary of the environmental costs of oil sands production .
Bouchard ’s letter said development has damaged the region ’s boreal forest and reduced the habitat of wildlife and birds , while the toxic tailings ponds from oil sands mining projects are a threat to aquifers and the water quality of the Athabasca River , which flows through the region .
He also condemned the projects ’ greenhouse gas emissions and their consumption of large quantities of natural gas to extract the tar - like bitumen from the sand .
“ Any one of the above destructive effects provokes moral concern , but it is when the damaging effects are all added together that the moral legitimacy of oil sands production is challenged , ” the bishop wrote .
Bouchard called for the oil industry and government to halt further development until there are adequate environmental protection measures .
The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers , the lobby group that represents Canada ’s large oil firms , said producers are already committed to lowering the environmental impacts of their projects .
“ We strongly believe oil sands development is sustainable , regulated and the cornerstone of Canada ’s resource supply , ” CAPP said in a statement .
“ We look forward to talking with the bishop and others about environmental impacts , progress that has already been made , as well industry ’s future vision for balancing energy supply , environment and economy in the region . ”

Disease prevention suddenly turns partisan thanks to America 's most out of control congresswoman ...
Michele Bachmann is either taking us all for a ride or she has suffered a very messy divorce from reality over the last year .
After calling for a McCarthy style investigation into “ un-American activities ” of her colleagues , publicly venting her fears that the government is getting ready to brainwash kids and teens , giving a bizarre , cringe - inducing speech during CPAC and failing seventh grade science class in front of Congress , she still has more tricks up her sleeve .
This time , she ’s been trying to show us a sinister correlation between having a Democratic president and flu outbreaks .
Michele , if you ’re not trying to blame anything on the Democrats , why do you bring this up out of the blue ?
What possesses you to say such things ?
Usually , I try to hold myself back from polemics and rants on this blog .
In this case , I ’m aghast that there ’s a lawmaker so incredibly paranoid , uninformed and desperate to sling mud on the other party , it does n’t seem to enter her mind to think about what ’s coming out of her mouth before she tries to defer to them during an influenza outbreak researchers have been expecting for decades .
Oh , and as Talking Points Memo kindly points out , in her rush to say something negative , Bachmann gets her facts wrong .
The last flu outbreak was in 1976 during the reign of Republican Gerald Ford and if she wanted to really impress us , she would ’ve mentioned that Woodrow Wilson was president during the 1918 pandemic .
Could someone remind me how exactly did she get into office , even when we consider party loyalty ?
RADAR ALERT :
NOW vs. Rush Limbaugh on DV - Who 's Right ?
Last week , NOW responded to comments made by Rush Limbaugh on domestic violence .
Limbaugh stated : " Remember when the NOW gang and all these other social interest groups started asking women if they 'd ever been a victim of domestic violence ?
They did n't like the numbers they got initially .
The numbers were n't high enough for the NOW gang .
So they expanded the definition to include a man shouting at them .
A man shouting at them equaled domestic violence .
It did n't matter if the women shouted first . "
Melody Drnach , Action Vice President of NOW , responded : " It shows that NOW and other advocacy groups are on the right track spreading the message of domestic violence when even Rush Limbaugh agreed that domestic violence comes in all forms -- physical abuse , mental abuse and verbal abuse ...
When Rush Limbaugh understands that shouting is a form of domestic violence , then we are on the right track .
Then we did something right . "
While Ms. Drnach is right that DV " comes in all forms , " her disingenuous comment about Limbaugh 's understanding of DV ignores the truth .
RADAR Service 's special report , " Expanding Definitions of Domestic Violence , Vanishing Rule of Law , " http://www.mediaradar.org/docs/RADARreport-Vanishing-Rule-of-Law.pdf which analyzes the civil domestic violence laws in all 50 states and the District of Columbia , concludes that statutory definitions have been widened over the past decade to the point that in most states , almost any action can be viewed as " violent . "
As Washington attorney Lisa Scott put it in 2006 , " Domestic violence has become whatever the man does that the woman does n't like .
Finding out she is having an affair and demanding she stop is seen as ' abuse . '
This often triggers the woman to file for a restraining order , where no real evidence is required .
In my 18 years of family law practice , I have seen this pattern occur over and over . "
RADAR spokesman Ron Grignol would be a great guest for the Rush Limbaugh show .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin raised the stakes in his gas conflict with Ukraine by slashing supplies to Europe , a measure that has left some EU states struggling to heat homes in sub-zero temperatures .

Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom GAZP .MM said it was forced to take that step because Ukraine -- locked in a dispute with Moscow over gas pricing -- was stealing gas being pumped across its territory for customers in Europe .
What was Putin seeking to achieve by reacting in this way ?
There is so far no consensus among diplomats and analysts about what Russia ’s end - game is .
The following are the main theories :
RUSSIA HAS NO END - GAME
The Kremlin started out with the modest aim of persuading Ukraine to pay closer to market prices for its gas , but has now been out - manoeuvred by Kiev .
“ Russia and Gazprom have walked into a trap , ” said Fyodr Lukyanov , editor of the journal Russia in Global Affairs .
He said Ukraine -- desperate not to pay more for its gas because of the fragile state of its economy -- seized the initiative from Moscow by endangering exports to Europe .
“ They are calculating , and I think not without basis , that the longer this drags on the more the blame will be laid at Moscow ’s door , ” said Lukyanov .
He said Gazprom , under pressure from a Europe angry its supplies are being disrupted and fearful for its reputation as an energy supplier , will now be forced to cut the price it is demanding Ukraine pay for its gas .
“ Ukraine wants to go back to the negotiations from a position of strength ...
And it is working , ” he said .
KREMLIN PUSHING NEW PIPELINE PROJECTS
The disruption of gas flows to Europe has highlighted the fragility of transit routes -- playing into the Kremlin ’s hands as it tries to persuade Europe to back alternative pipelines .
Russia has been struggling to win European approval for the Nord Stream pipeline , which will ship gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany , bypassing potential troublesome transit states .
Nord Stream , a joint venture between Gazprom , Germany 's BASF BASF.DE and E.ON EONGn .DE and Dutch firm Gasunie , has encountered resistance , on political and environmental grounds , from several European Union states .
Moscow is also pushing the South Stream pipeline , which will ship Russian gas under the Black Sea and direct to the EU .
Russia is seeking to sign up more European states to the project .
In that context , the gas row with Ukraine is “ all opportune , from the Russian side , ” said a European diplomat in Moscow .
“ Russia might find an interest in promoting Nord Stream and it will be clear to many Europeans there should be an alternative route . ”
Asked if the dispute would bolster the Nordstream and South Stream projects , Julian Lee of the Centre for Global Energy Studies said : “ That ’s certainly what Gazprom is hoping for . ”
DRIVING UP THE OIL PRICE
A shortage of gas in Europe could help Russia by boosting prices for its other big export , oil .
Traditionally , any problems with gas supply drive up demand for crude as energy firms and industries switch to oil products for power and heating .
The fall in world oil prices , from a high of $ 147 in July , to about $ 48 now , has been painful for Moscow .
The world ’s second biggest exporter of crude after Saudi Arabia , Russia receives about half of its budget revenues from oil exports .
Russia ’s budget needs oil to be at least $ 70 to keep out of deficit , so the fall in price threatens the lavish spending on public sector wages and pensions that have helped Putin underpin his grip on power for nearly a decade .
POLITICAL GAMES
Russia is using its energy muscle to send a message to Ukraine ’s pro-Western leaders to stop seeking membership of NATO .
Moscow believes the alliance ’s expansion eastwards is creating a new Iron Curtain .
“ They ( the Russians ) are keen , perhaps , to demonstrate that it ’s in Ukraine ’s own interests to be on friendly grounds with Russia , while at the same time wanting a switch to market prices ” said a second European diplomat .
Opinion polls indicate most Ukrainians oppose NATO membership , and a fresh show of Russia ’s power could further undermine what little public support there is for the membership bid .
PERSONAL ANIMOSITY
Russia ’s uncompromising action in the gas row is driven by personal animosity between Kremlin leaders and their counterparts in Kiev .
“ The relations between the political and business leaders are not that great .
I think this is more personal than political , ” said a third diplomat .
Ukraine ’s President Viktor Yushchenko angered Moscow by giving public support for Georgia in its war with Russia last year .
Russian officials have singled him out for criticism over the gas row too , accusing him of sabotaging attempts by his officials to reach a deal over gas prices .
“ This campaign is directly aimed against Yushchenko whose behaviour has become more provocative , ” said Alexei Malashenko of the Carnegie Moscow Center , a think tank .
Another theory is that Putin is nursing a personal grudge against Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko .
Russian officials believe she went back on a preliminary deal on gas prices that was thrashed out when she had talks with Putin in October , something which Kiev has denied .
Russian officials have said Putin was angered by what he saw as Tymoshenko ’s betrayal of their deal .
Asked by the judge why the prosecution case had not involved tests of the Lotus in Germany , she added : " The defendant has asserted that the car could not have done that speed .
Inquiries have been made as far as they can be and we can't go further than that .

Who is this combover shithead poking his head nervously around the corner ?
Why , it ’s none other than Joseph Cassano , who should be high up on everyone ’s list for a little game hunting this weekend .
Joseph Cassano , the thief who created AIG ’s Financial Products division – that ’s the division that racked up $ 500 billion in losses .
Yep , that ’s half a trillion dollars–enough to provide health care for tens of millions of Americans , all gone–poof !
All because of this fuckhead named Joseph Cassano .
He ’s doing fine though , thanks for asking –he ’s got all the health care he needs and then some , thanks to the fact that while he bequeathed to us a half trillion dollar bill , he pocked for himself about $ 315 million .
Plus after he was forced out of AIG last year , he awarded himself a $ 1 million monthly pension .
That ’s $ 1 million per month .
Meanwhile , we ’ve dropped $ 170 billion into AIG and that ’s just so far , to clean up his mess … and we had to cough up another $ 450 million the other day to pay big fat bonuses to Cassano ’s former colleagues in his Financial Products division .
They must love Joe there !
But as awful as this sounds , at least there ’s a silver lining to this story .
A silver lining smeared with blood and cum , that is : yes , Joseph Cassano may soon be gagging on a heapin ’ helpin ’ o’ prison cock .
That ’s right , according to the good folks at TPM , both the Justice Department and Britain ’s Serious Fraud Office are pursuing criminal investigations into the way Cassano hid losses , lied to investors and the public , and forced one AIG accountant to resign , and forced Price Waterhouse to lay off the prying eyes , when they were on his trail of fraud .
Latest news is that Cassano has hired himself a famous white - collar crime lawyer , F. Joseph Warin .
M’mmm , that ’s a mighty perty mouth you ’ve got there , Joe !
Maybe he’d be better off hiring himself a dentist to remove his teeth ?
Because we hear that the first thing they do to a guy like Cassano in prison is bash out all his teeth to make fucking his mouth a little easier .
Joe , you might want to read this site , Men Can Stop Rape , just to get acquainted .
Because you know , prison rape is no laughing matter .
Unless it happens to you .
Then it ’s a screamer !
UPDATE : Ah , the good news just keeps a’- pourin ’ in , folks .
The New York Post published the names of three scared - shitless AIG pigs who gave themselves bonuses from taxpayer money .
Their names are : James “ Jackpot Jimmy ” Haas , Douglas Poling and Jonathan Liebergall .
Haas and Poling both live in Fairfield , Connecticut , while Liebergall lives in New Canaan , Connecticut .
Here ’s a photo of Haas outside his multi-gazillion - dollar Fairfield home , just in case you want to ID your target :
And here is “ Jackpot Jimmy ” Haas ’s house in Fairfield :
James “ Jackpot Jimmy ” Hass ’s mansion .
Address : Sasco Hill Road , Fairfield , CT .
Google It !
David Poling , who pocketed a $ 6.4 million bonus , relaxes in this mansion located up the street from his pal Jimmy ’s , at Golden Pond Lane , Fairfield , CT .
Google It !
So while Andrew Cuomo goes over the plusses and minuses of releasing the list of AIG bonus thieves ( plusses : they suffer horribly ; minuses : still thinking … ) , meanwhile , AIG ’s employees are shitting in their pants and expecting the worst .
Supposedly so scared that they ’re actually doing what we want them to : both Haas and Poling are giving their money back , or so they say .
That ’s no reason not to ding - dong ditch them , but it does prove once again that violence works .
Here ’s a memo that AIG sent out to its employees showing how scared shitless they are .
Kinda looks like a memo that Americans visiting Iraq might receive–which means Americans are finally doing something right in the class war .
Here ’s the memo , this is pure Jiffy Pop popcorn fun to read :
Ah , it ’s a joyous day in Mudville when the pigs who ’ve been raking in billions at our expense are so scared that they have to hide who they are , whom they work for , and what they do !
And according to today ’s New York Times , it ’s not just AIG ’s employees who are scared shitless .
So are Bank of America’s :
An executive at Merrill Lynch , where bonuses have also come under fire , said that some employees had asked whether the firm would cover the cost of private security for them .
It gets better .
With all these thieving shitheads on the run , the good people at Connecticut Working Families are arranging a Saturday bus tour of AIG executives ’ homes .
If you want to sign up for the bus tour , click here .
No seriously , this thing is really happening .
So you can see exactly where the pigs live .
You know , in case you ’d wanna go back and visit them , sing them Christmas Carols , borrow some butter , whatever .
But no funny stuff .
Oh no , perish the thought , as the bus tour leader himself insists :
“ We ’re going to be peaceful and lawful in everything we do , ” said Jon Green , the director of Connecticut Working Families .
“ I know there ’s a lot of anger and a lot of rage about what ’s happened .
We ’re not looking to foment that unnecessarily , but what we want to do is give folks in Bridgeport and Hartford and other parts of Connecticut who are struggling and losing their homes and their jobs and their health insurance an opportunity to see what kinds of lifestyle billions of dollars in credit - default swaps can buy . ”
Yup .
What you do after you see their billionaire lifestyles is really none of our business .
Ultimately , only the executives are responsible for their own personal safety .
We at eXiled Online have already proposed a similar bus , but a much better bus , for AIG ’s executives .
A bus that could take care of this problem cleanly , efficiently , and in an environmentally - friendly manner .
They ’re Chinese - made buses , and they come equipped with lethal injection tables .
We ’re pretty hopeful that tomorrow ’s bus ride is just a warm - up , and that the next time around , it ’ll be a fleet of Chinese - made “ Banker Recycling Vehicles ” cruising Connecticut ’s billionaire - rows , pruning the population to save us a lot of tax dollars that would otherwise go to their future bonuses and pensions , and also give the beleaguered kangaroo mouse , or whatever it is that ’s endangered there , a little more room to scurry around in .
It ’s been a great week for us in the Great Class War .
Let ’s hope we have more like them , only better .

( CNN ) -- Normally , " hot spot " is n't the first phrase that comes to mind when talking about Saskatchewan , Canada .
A relocation service company president said he is moving more people to Saskatchewan than ever before .
But with most of Canada suffering from devastating job losses , this cold province is becoming exactly that .
It 's an asterisk to the entire country when it comes to the economic climate , and Premier Brad Wall is shouting it as loud as he can .
" It 's a great time to come to Saskatchewan , " said Wall , who even called the Toronto Star newspaper to tout his province 's economic success and let Ontarians know there were jobs for the taking .
" For those who are losing their jobs , we need them to know we have thousands of jobs open right now in both the private and public sector , " Wall said .
" We have a powerful story to tell , a story of success and that 's something we want to share with those who are struggling . "
Wall 's province is one of the exceptions to the unemployment increases battering provinces across Canada .
Saskatchewan 's unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent in January from 4.2 percent in December , making it the only province recording a decline .
In Ontario and the city of Toronto , unemployment rates rose to 7.2 percent and 8.5 percent respectively .
To the west , British Columbia shed 68,000 full - time jobs in January .
More Saskatchewan jobs should be on the way .
To stave off any possible recession , Wall announced a $ 500 million infrastructure " booster shot " to help keep the economy strong .

" All across the country , industries are getting quite ill , " Wall said .
" We are n't immune to it .
We see some impacts in terms of layoffs and new vehicle purchases slowing off , and so we want to be proactive in staying ahead of the curve . "
On Tuesday , the Conference Board of Canada released a report that said Saskatchewan will likely continue to lead the nation in economic growth in 2009 because of the infrastructure investment and tax reductions .
Saskatoon temperatures Average January temperature :
- 16.4 C ( 2.5 F )
High : - 11.1 C ( 12 F )
Low : - 21.6 C ( - 7 F )
Average July temperature :
18.3 C ( 65 F )
High : 25 C ( 77 F )
Low : 11.5 C ( 52.7 F )

The province has also been reaping the benefits of an influx from nearby Alberta .
When the government in Alberta decided to raise the oil royalty rates , oil exploration and expedition companies decided to move their operations to Saskatchewan in hopes of making more money .
With the province 's growing opportunities , David Montgomery , president of Calgary 's Qwest Haven Relocation Services , said he is moving more people to Saskatchewan each day .
" Alberta has always been the gravy train of oil , " said Montgomery , who is also a former resident of Regina , the capitol and second - largest city in Saskatchewan .
" But with the new royalties , oil companies are saying ' Why stay here and make less when the opportunities right next door are even better ? '
Many other companies may start to follow suit . "
Montgomery said people looking to move have said that cheaper land and insurance prices are among the other reasons they are headed to Saskatchewan .
" There , government insurance is cheaper than anywhere else in the country and it comes with your license plates , " he said .
" With the amount of jobs , cheaper opportunities and great way of life , the government there has made it very attractive to move there . "
That means more business for Wall 's province and more jobs coming to the area .
Not that there 's a shortage of jobs .
On Tuesday night there were nearly 6,000 private - and public - sector jobs on the Web site Saskjobs.ca .
A constant stream of revenue from oil production and exports also buoys the economy in the province .
Saskatchewan falls just behind Alberta , as the largest oil exporter in Canada , and Wall 's province sends more oil to the United States than Kuwait .
Wall said the province is the leader in uranium production and produces a third of the world 's potash .
The province continues to keep ahead of the curve , Wall said , finding ways to diversify its resources and embark on ambitious green projects and new oil projects .
The province is working with Montana on a $ 212 million climate change initiative that would create the first major greenhouse gas storage project in North America .
The carbon dioxide from coal - fueled power plants would be stored in the ground in Montana and later be withdrawn for use in oil production .
Wall also said what may be the largest discovery of sweet , light crude oil in the southeast part of the province means it could have even more oil to work with .
The Bakken Formation could potentially have 413 billion barrels of oil , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
That would be another huge untapped revenue gold mine .
Despite the growth of nearly all sectors across the board , Wall cautioned that it is possible his province may see economic stress , just later in the game than other places .
" We need to be circumspect and prudent about promoting our province , " he said .
" We are not immune ; we do see the impacts .
It is n't some sort of panacea or answer to economic questions that do n't exist elsewhere .
We are a bit of an asterisk that says there is some stress , but it 's relatively calm here . "
Wall encouraged people not to count out a move to the province based on stereotypes that it is " only winter here , " and " all of the land is just rolling hills . "
" ' It 's a beautiful , big place where life is great and right now there 's also opportunity , " he said .
" I 'm very , very biased , but I can't imagine a place I 'd rather be , especially with what 's going on economically around the world . "

Is gardening the new cooking ?
Suddenly everyone is digging in , from Michelle Obama to Britney Spears and no chef worth their Maldon is without their own , fully stocked kitchen garden , whether it 's Michael Caines , Jamie Oliver or Nigel Slater .
For some , though , gardening and cooking are one and the same , as cooking with flowers becomes increasingly fashionable in foodie circles .
At the forefront of this new vogue is Skye Gygnell , head chef at the appropriate setting of Petersham Nurseries in Richmond .
In this sunny , riverside Eden , the somewhat bohemian restaurant evolves symbiotically with the plants in the public nursery and the private walled kitchen garden that feeds the diners .
Voluptuous peonies have burst into flower , exotic parrot tulips and blowsy ranunculus nod in the warm breeze as fat bees , drunk on nectar , wobble from one flower head to the next .
Against the walls , cherry blossom soaks up the heat while plucky , hardy salad leaves , leeks and chives have recently surfaced from the ground and are romping on thanks to an unusually mild April .

Here , flowers are grown both for the tables in the restaurant and , less typically , for the dishes that are served up , too .
" Just look at the colours of these tulips , " enthuses Gyngell as she shows me around , naming each variety .
" Is n't nature amazing – you could n't create these colours and patterns , it 's just incredible .
It would be impossible not to be inspired by this environment and so incorporating flowers into my cooking comes very naturally .
I just have to look around for ideas . "
In the neighbouring glasshouse , Gyngell shows me peaches unfurling from their winter slumber and explains that , as members of the almond family , even the leaves will infuse a dish with an almond scent .
She also uses rose petals to create a fragrant syrup that makes melon sing of summer , and crystalises violet petals for an intense burst of flavour that you 're probably familiar with from the childhood sweets Parma Violets .
" Roses just arrest your senses so that you do n't know whether you are tasting or smelling them and they just epitomise an old - fashioned English summer day – it's such an evocative way to cook because it's more than just tasting the food , it becomes a sensory experience . "
But Gyngell is at pains to point out that she only cooks with flowers when they add something to the dish : " I love the way flowers look and the colours that they add to a dish but I never use them purely as a garnish , they have to enhance the food , otherwise it just looks twee and feels pointless to me . "
She 's not alone in this culinary reinterpretation of flower - arranging .
At the Star Inn in Harome , chef Andrew Pern uses home - grown lavender to make ice cream and at the Icelandic restaurant Texture in London Agnar Sverrisson has made flowers an integral part of his cooking .
" We use all kinds of flowers but one of my favourites is rose water chocolate mousse , with rose petals , dried and fresh , " explains Sverrisson .
Meanwhile , to celebrate the upcoming Chelsea Flower Show , Tom Aikens has created a five - course flower menu .
Richard Vine , a culinary flower grower who supplies top restaurants and chefs ( including Aitkens ) , says cooking with flowers is catching on fast .
" We 've never been so busy growing and supplying flowers to restaurants , we 're working flat - out right now .
But we 're also noticing increasing enquiries from members of the public who want to replicate meals they 've had in top restaurants using flowers – things like borage , pansies , violas , honeysuckle , garlic chives , nasturtiums , beans and peas .
I can remember foraging for hawthorn flowers and leaves to put in salads as a boy – but it 's something that the public had forgotten that we used to do . "
What is most surprising is the number of flowers that can be eaten and the amount of flavour they contain .
All roses are edible and have a slightly fruity flavour that can be used to make syrups or jellies ; honeysuckle , as the name implies , has a sweet honey taste , while the highly scented jasmine flower is used to flavour rice and tea .
Hibiscus tastes citrussy , while lilac flowers have a slightly bitter lemon -y flavour that gives a zing to salads .
Orange flowers have been infused for years and used in cakes and desserts .
Flowers are n't just for desserts , though .
Many have a savoury taste and can enhance salads , stews , meat and fish .
Some flowers taste more mild than others – basil and rosemary flowers , for instance , are a more subtle version of their leaves , while chives , rocket and garlic flowers are stronger , as the flowers grow after the plant has bolted – the leaves become increasingly strong with age , so by the time the plant flowers , the flavours are intense .
Wild garlic is in season now and the white , round allium - like heads can be found under hedgerows and in woodland throughout May .
While the individual , bell - shaped flowers look beautiful , they are strongly flavoured so are best used sparingly , says Sverisson .
At Texture , he is using them with lamb and beef , while at the ethical eatery Acorn House they are making a wild garlic flower and pistachio pesto .
The natural sugars in fresh peas and broad beans extend to their pretty black - and - white flowers , too , making them a favourite for dressing starters and salads .
Tom Aikens has broad - bean flowers and shoots on his menu , served with a broad bean mousse and cabecou goat 's cheese .
" Because the flower of the plant becomes the vegetable , when it comes to peas , broad beans and tomatoes , you can get a very intense flavour from the flower , " says Aikens .
Dill flowers work with fish just as the leaves would , and Aikens has combined scallops with peppery nasturtium flowers and salmon with radish and whole Viola flowers for his floral menu .
Agnar Sverrisson is a fan of little baby violet flowers with fish , " They 're great with salads and raw fish , such as sushi or sashimi .
We also like to use them with crab , which works really well . "
If you want to cook with flowers at home , remember to use flowers that you know have n't been sprayed with chemicals – supermarket roses are almost certainly a no - no – and remove the central pistil ( the stamen , anthers and stigma ) .
Some of the easiest to use are herb flowers , which you can use in the same way as you would the herbs – just let the plants run to flower and then pick them off .
But perhaps the simplest floral recipe to try is borage – the star - shaped blue blooms grow wild in many gardens and have a delicate cucumber taste .
Throw a few flowers into an ice - cube tray to make floral cube that can be added to a glass of Pimms for an instant touch of style .

Use the sweet , delicate flowers in a refreshing sorbet or cordial , or ferment them to make Elderflower champagne : dissolve 400g of sugar in 800 ml of hot water , then top up with 1.2 litres of cold water .
Add the juice and zest of one lemon , a teaspoon of white wine vinegar and five elderflower heads and stir gently .
Cover with muslin and leave to ferment for two days .
If it has n't become foamy by this point add the tiniest pinch of yeast .
Leave for another four days , strain the liquid and decant into bottles and leave for another week before serving chilled .
Nasturtium
A fast - growing , pretty , trailing flower that thrives in most soils as long as it gets plenty of sun – all parts of it are edible .
Add the bright orange peppery flowers to salads or as a garnish to pasta dishes for a colourful kick .
The seeds can also be pickled as a substitute for capers .
Basil
Add a handful of the antioxidant - rich flowers to a jam jar and fill it with cheap olive oil .
Leave to infuse for a couple of weeks for a delicately flavoured oil that you can use as a salad dressing or for dipping bread into .
Marigolds
Marigolds have a tangy , peppery taste that makes them great for salads or soups , or added to cream cheese for sandwiches .
It also gives a beautiful saffron colour to your cooking .
Rose
The stronger the fragrance of the flower , the more sweet and aromatic the flavour will be .
Rose petals are a good source of vitamin C and other anti-oxidants .
Try making a syrup with a handful of petals ( remove the white inner tips of petals to avoid bitterness ) , water and sugar and then drizzling it over ice - cream , melon or adding it to champagne .
Sea Kale
Jamie Oliver recommends serving the small white flowers with strawberries – while the delicate , " nutty " stems are eaten in winter , the smoky grey leaves and clouds of white blooms look lovely in the summer .
It 's a native coastal plant but loves any sunny , well - drained spot .
Plants can be bought from Jekka's Herb Farm ( www.jekkasherbfarm.com).
Borage
Growing in many people 's back gardens , the blue , star - like flowers taste of cucumber and go well with apples and pears – try a borage Waldorf salad .
Or why not drop them in an ice - cube tray and add to your Pimms .
KUNAR ( RFE / RL ) -- Farmers in Afghanistan 's Kunar Province planted thousands of tea plants on April 10 , with the local authorities ' hope that the crop might gradually replace poppy production , Radio Free Afghanistan reports .
Officials in the eastern province , which used to be known as a tea- producing region , told Radio Free Afghanistan that the plants were imported from Pakistan and China .
Local officials say they are hopeful that tea farming will regain its roots in the region and spread around the country .
Tea is very popular in Afghanistan and the surrounding region .
Male Victims of Domestic Abuse
Distortion of issue
Although recognised for many centuries , the problem of domestic violence first became a real political issue in western societies in the early 1970s .
In the UK , Erin Pizzey founded in Chiswick in 1971 the first refuge for abused women and their children in Britain .
She was later to write that of the first 100 women who came to the refuge , 61 were as violent or as violent prone as the men they had left .
Since then , the issue has been polarised and distorted , largely by sexual politics , into female victims and male perpetrators .
Government and public policies and funding in the UK are still largely based on this perception .
This , despite the wealth of academic studies published worldwide in the past three decades , coupled with successive government studies in the past twenty years , all showing a significant level of female aggression or abuse in intimate relationships .
Such studies suggest that , in intimate couple relationships affected by abusive behaviour , women initiate this against male partners in about a quarter of cases , men in another quarter , and the rest is mutual .
Although women tend to be more harmed or frightened by violent abuse , and are more likely to be injured or victims of repeated assaults , significant proportions of male victims are also severely assaulted and about one third of those injured are men .
Male victims
The prescription of domestic violence as a womans problem , and not a social problem affecting both sexes and their children , is now strongly entrenched in societal attitudes in most western democracies including the UK .
It extends particularly to Government , local authorities and other public bodies , including police forces , social agencies , childrens charities , and even the judiciary .
The result has been to largely ignore or subordinate the plight of male victims , and consequently support services for them are hugely inferior to those in place for female victims and geographically totally inadequate .
This public indifference to them , not only deters many male victims from reporting intimate abuse against them , even when they have suffered severe violence , but also reinforces stereotypical attitudes towards them by police forces and social agencies , so that if they do report , they are often disbelieved or ridiculed .
Indeed , surveys of male victims have reported that about one in five male victims are themselves arrested and not the female assailant .

" If animals behave differently in captivity ( where all previous comparative studies were performed ) than they do in the wild , measuring their brain activity in captivity can lead to the wrong conclusions . "
FACT : You use most of your body when you are sitting at a computer typing on a keyboard – not just your eyes and fingers .
Your muscles allow you to sit in an upright position and all of your organs are working ( sometimes , even your brain ) .
Sadly , despite this amazing fact , surfing the Internet does not qualify as a workout .
Is your surfing position an Igor - style hunch rather than a hang ten ?
Do you have the wild , crazy Igor eyes to match ?
Then you need to read this list !
Eligibility :
To get on the list , the condition must be directly related to Internet use ( I ’m defining condition as an illness , disorder , or injury ) .
Rank : Ranked by the seriousness of the condition and number of people affected , as interpreted by me ( it ’s my list ) .
As always I will personally reply to any recommendations or complaints in the comments below , so go nuts ( but not nuts like # 3 below , please … )
10 . Eyestrain
When you use your eyes a lot , they get strained - so when you stare at a computer screen intensely for hours it is n’t a surprise when your eyes get sore .
According to mayoclinic.com : “ Although eyestrain can be annoying , it usually is n’t serious and goes away once you rest your eyes ” , placing it firmly in tenth place on this list .
9. Health Anxiety / Pain Catastrophization
Some people have a tendency to misinterpret or over - interpret pain signals .
According to Wikipedia , “ psychologists refer to this as pain catastrophizing ( the tendency to think the worst when one feels pain ) . ”
According to the same source , health anxiety is a “ sense that something is seriously wrong that does not lessen with normal test results and reassurance from health professionals . ”
Thanks to all of the scary medical information available on the Internet ( some of it ’s even true ) , people who never experienced health anxiety or pain catastrophization before are now freaking out .
Speaking from experience , the Internet can make a borderline hypochondriac cross over into crazy town .
Thanks a search on the Internet , a sudden case of the late - night sniffles could be nasal polyps or even diphtheria .
We ’re not saying it is for sure , but there ’s a chance … pleasant dreams !
8. Headaches
There are three different types of headaches associated with Internet use :
Tension Headaches –
The term ‘ tension headache ’ is misleading .
These headaches are not caused by stress but often due to strain to your neck or eyes .
According to mayoclinic.com , they “ can last from 30 minutes to an entire week ” .
Chronic Daily Headaches –
You suffer from these if you have a headache for more than half of the days in a month .
Stress Headaches – Apparently it ’s not the big stress that causes your head to hurt .
It ’s the small annoyances all day long .
So , if you spend a lot of time on the Internet it may be time to switch to a faster connection or upgrade to a new computer if you spend a lot of time staring hopelessly at your computer screen while it downloads information or crashes on you .
7. Back Pain
Poor posture results in back pain , particularly when it is accompanied by obesity , smoking , or lack of exercise .
Now I ’m sure there are many people out there who sit on a Pilates ball and crunch carrot sticks while they spend hours each day Digging , Stumbling , or Tweeting – but , if you ’re the Internet equivalent of a couch potato you might want to cut back on the corn chips and do some sit ups or something …
We interrupt this list while the writer goes to take a Tylenol or two – her back is killing her !
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT )
If you ’ve been on an airplane in the last few years you ’ve probably seen the warning information about Deep Vein Thrombosis : it ’s “ the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein ” ( Wikipedia ) .
Also known as “ economy class syndrome ” , air travelers who do n’t move around and are dehydrated are particularly vulnerable to this kind of blood clot .
The key points here are immobility and dehydration :
If you are so immersed in your “ Second Life ” that you do n’t remember the last time you went outside or drank a glass of water in this life , you are at risk .
I could n’t find any Internet related DVT cases documented , but I still think it deserves 6th place because a DVT blood clot can dislodge itself , travel to your lungs , and kill you .
Zoiks !
So , move those legs around or try to type standing up for a change … oh no wait , that would be bad for your back …
5. Munchausen Syndrome
The Internet provides endless chatrooms , online support groups , and social networking sites where people can share their problems , seek advice , and get sympathy .
I was shocked to learn that some people actually fake illnesses or tragedies just to get attention .
They pretend to be victims of rape , assault , abuse , and serious illness in order to get attention : a symptom of Munchhausen Syndrome .
And , according to an article at the BBC News website , the “ internet may be encouraging people to pretend they are ill in order to get attention , according to US research . ”
In the same news article quoted above , a Dr. Feldman from Alabama explains that persons with this syndrome can be treated with “ a chance to get … attention from medical professionals in a psychiatric setting .
However , most patients do not want this .
They want to have a serious medical ailment and not a psychiatric illness ” ( news.bbc.co.uk ) .
4. Facebook Depression
According to the Daily Mail , Facebook and other social networking sites make teenage girls “ prone to anxiety and depression ” .
Along with texting and emailing , these sites allow teens to coruminate ( a fancy word for talking about things over and over and over again ) .
According to the same article , “ repeated conversations among adolescent girls , particularly about romantic disappointments , worsen their mood and create negative emotions ” ( www.dailymail.co.uk).
Prior to this teenage girls apparently did not dwell on topics such as ‘ do my bangs look funny ’ or ‘ why did n’t he call ? ’ for hours and hours and then sulk in their rooms .
These are the results of a study conducted on 83 teenage girls at Stony Brook University ( NY ) .
One of the doctors , Dr. Davila , offers this antidote for teenagers who continuously talk about the same problem : “ They could change the subject ” .
Parents of teenage girls everywhere now plan to send their daughters to Stony Brook University so that they too can learn to deduce blatantly obvious solutions to things that everyone already knows .
3. Internet Rage
While it might be argued that Internet Rage itself is not really harmful to your health , it can lead to Internet stalking and perhaps even violence – so if you are the one inciting the rage then you should beware .
According to Tim McDonald of www.newsfactor.com, one of the sources of Internet rage is “ information overload ” .
He explains , “ the sheer volume of information available on the Web — and the slowness in accessing it — causes a great deal of stress , according to the independent survey commissioned by WebTop , a British Web indexing company . ”
He also reports that a study “ found that 68 percent of the 200 people surveyed found computer glitches more stressful than spending a weekend with a partner ’s parents , and 38 percent found them more stressful than being stuck on public transportation . ”
Internet Rage manifests itself all over the place , from the comment section of a blog post to the headlines on your local news station .
Browse the comments under a Youtube video , a website ’s forum , or on someone ’s blog and it does n’t take long to find some very nasty words .
Perhaps the anonymous nature of the Internet encourages people to say what they really think .
The worst part of this is that it ’s contagious - your angry comment angers others , and the downward spiral continues .
Please let me point out that when your therapist suggested that you ‘ write your feelings down ’ , she did n’t mean in the comments section of a blog .
If you ca n’t restrain yourself , then try to limit yourself to sites that actually want your harsh words , like justrage.com or mybiggestcomplaint.com .
Some people say , ‘ get over it ’ , but I think we have a right to be appalled and upset by fellow human behavior .
It brings us all down , so stop passing your bad vibes onto other people , already !
And , by the way , you ’re not as anonymous as you think so you might want to stop before you enrage someone who is even more of a nut job than you are .
A Mr. John Jones experienced this in 2005 , after getting into an argument with another man in a Yahoo chatroom , who then used “ details obtained online … traveled 70 miles to Mr Jones ’ home … and beat him up with a pickaxe handle ” ( new.bbc.co.uk ) .
Yikes !
Okay , so enough Internet Rage – there ’s only two more spots left on my list and then next one is a real pain in the neck :
2. Upper Limb Disorders ( ULD )
Upper Limb Disorders include : neck tension syndrome , carpal tunnel syndrome , cubital tunnel syndrome , tendinitis ( mainly hands / wrists ) , tenosynovitis , bursitis , repetitive strain injury ( RSI ) , and Thoracic Outlet Syndrome .
All of these ailments can be linked to Internet use .
RSI Repetitive Strain Injury – the modern version of writer ’s cramp , you experience pain and strain when you overuse one of your upper limbs ( i.e. arms ) .
“ The basis for this illness concept is the idea that one can overuse a tool , such as a computer keyboard … in a way that causes tissue damage leading to pain ” ( Wikipedia ) .
Thoracic Outlet Syndrome – “ The two groups of people most likely to develop TOS are those suffering neck injuries in motor vehicle accidents and those who use computers in non-ergonomic postures for extended periods of time ” ( Wikipedia ) .
Upper Limb Disorders earn second place on this list due to the overwhelming list of disorders they encompass and the fact that I could n’t come up with anything funny for them ( so they must be quite serious ) .
1. Internet Addiction
This is Number
One for two big reasons : it actually has the word Internet in the title of the affliction and also because it has been fatal in some cases .
The nature of the addiction is also pervasive : when it comes to the Internet , someone can “ be addicted to nearly everything , starting with pure act of typing , visiting chat rooms , shopping on - line and ending up with multiplayer games , which users characterize as “ heroinware . ” ( www.infoniac.com).
Also , it ’s so real that there are rehabilitation centres for treatment .
In a NY Times article , Martin Fackler describes Internet Addiction rehab in South Korea : “ Drill instructors drive young men through military - style obstacle courses , counselors lead group sessions , and there are even therapeutic workshops on pottery and drumming . ”
He goes on to explain the seriousness of Internet Addiction in South Korea , “ It has become a national issue here in recent years , as users started dropping dead from exhaustion after playing online games for days on end … ”
Are you addicted ?
Are you unable to limit your use of the Internet ?
Does it take up most of your free time ?
Do you lose your sense of time when you ’re online ?
Do you take steps to allow yourself to stay online longer ?
( Do you stock up your desk with several meals ?
Wear a diaper ?
Drink energy drinks ?
Are you always improving your computers or your software ? )
Do you experience withdrawal symptoms when you are prevented from getting online ?
( Anger , craving , restlessness , moodiness , irritable , depression )
Do you use your computer to escape reality ?
Do you lie to others about your computer use ?
Are you social isolated in the real world ?
Have you traded your real life experiences for emotions that you now experience on the Internet through social networking , games , and porn ?
Have you risked a real life relationship or your job over your Internet use ?
If you were able to answer yes to several of these questions , please seek professional counsel for your Internet Addiction .

DeMint thinks there will be a lot of backlash from the American people .
DeMint : 60 Dems ' best thing ' for GOP
Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) insisted Tuesday that Pennsylvania Sen .
Arlen Specter ’s decision to switch parties and give the Democrats their likely 60th seat could be the “ best thing ” for Republicans .
“ If [ Democrats ] begin to expand spending and government programs because they have a couple more votes , I think there 's going to be a lot of backlash from the American people , ” DeMint explained during an interview on CNN .

“ That may be the best thing that could happen to the Republican Party right now , ” he added , “ because people know those checks and balances are very important and they 've seen the Democrat Party overreach already . ”
DeMint disagreed with Specter ’s statement that the GOP has moved too far to the right , adding that best thing Republicans can do is “ stand up for what they say they do . ”
“ I do n't think many Americans are going to agree that the Republican Party has become too conservative , ” DeMint said .
“ We 're seeing across the country right now that the biggest tent of all is the tent of freedom . ”
“ What the hell does that mean ? ” asked CNN host Rick Sanchez .
“ I mean , the biggest tent is freedom ?
Freedom ? ” he asked .
“ I mean , you gotta do better than that . ”
“ What it means is what has worked in America are free people , free markets for years , ” DeMint responded .
“ I think what we 've seen is both parties have pushed the envelope too far and now America is pushing back .
I think you 'll see this next election to be totally different . ”
( CNN ) -- Mac computers are known for their near - immunity to malicious computer programs that plague PCs .
Some security experts say viruses are moving toward Mac as those computers become more popular .
But that may be changing somewhat , according to computer security researchers .
It seems that as sleek Mac computers become more popular , they 're also more sought - after targets for the authors of harmful programs .
" The bad guys generally go toward the biggest target , what will get them the biggest bang for their buck , " said Kevin Haley , a director of security response at Symantec .
Until recently , the big target always was Microsoft Windows , and Apple computers were protected by " relative obscurity , " he said .
But blogs are buzzing this week about what two Symantec researchers have called the first harmful computer program to strike specifically at Mac .
This Trojan horse program , dubbed the " iBotnet , " has infected only a few thousand Mac machines , but it represents a step in the evolution of malicious computer software , Haley said .
The iBotnet is a sign that harmful programs are moving toward Mac , said Paul Henry , a forensics and security analyst at Lumension Security in Arizona .
" We all knew it was going to happen , " he said .
" It was just a matter of time , and , personally , I think we 're going to see a lot more of it . "
The malicious software was first reported in January .
It did n't gain widespread attention until recently , when Mario Ballano Barcena and Alfredo Pesoli of Symantec , maker of the popular Norton antivirus products , detailed the software in a publication called " Virus Bulletin . "
Mac users at large , however , should not be alarmed by the incident , experts said .
The program infects only computers whose users downloaded pirated versions of the Mac software iWork .
The harmful software is a Trojan horse , meaning it tries to sneak into the computer with some sort of permission from the user .
Computer worms travel differently .
They wiggle their way into computers and replicate without the owner 's approval or knowledge .
The Mac program is called a botnet because infected computers become part of a network that is controlled by the program 's author .
The Mac botnet is significantly less threatening than computer worms like the much - publicized Conficker.c , said Jose Nazario , a senior security researcher with Arbor Networks .
Conficker was thought to have infected up to 10 million computers , compared with thousands for the iBotnet , researchers said .
There 's also some question as to whether it is the first botnet to target Mac .
Others have targeted both PCs and Apple computers .
" This is n't the first botnet that 's been built using Mac computers , " Nazario said .
" This is an interesting one in that it 's a little more flexible and includes some new features .
...
It 's getting a lot of press mostly because it 's Mac and people are talking about how Macs are immune to malware -- and , sure enough , they 're not . "
The potential damage that could be caused by the Mac botnet is also less severe than other attacks , said Darrell Etherington , a contributor to the AppleBlog , which is not affiliated with the computer company .
" It 's a very low - level attack , " he said .
" Some people wo n't even notice the effect of it . "
It is in the interest of software companies like Symantec , who spread the news , and McAfee , which has downplayed the presence of the Trojan , to raise concerns so they can promote their antivirus software packages , he said .
" Yes , it is going to become a bigger problem and , yes , people have to become more aware , but I think that what McAfee and Symantec would like is for the panic to start and for people to start rushing to antivirus software , " which is n't necessary yet , Etherington said .
In a statement , Apple said it is working to prevent security problems .
" Apple takes security very seriously and has a great track record of addressing potential vulnerabilities before they can affect users , " the statement says .
Only about 7.4 percent of computer users work on Macs , according to Gartner , a technology research firm .
That user base is proportionally more affluent than PC users , Etherington said , which may make Mac a bigger target .
But overall , Macs are still far less vulnerable to attack than PCs , he said .
Haley said news of the Apple botnet is significant in part because it 's something other authors of malicious code can build from .
" I do n't think it 's a tipping point ; I think it 's an evolutionary step .
We see virus authors often use what somebody else has done , " he said .
" There 's a model .
There 's something out there to follow . "

It is useful , at times , to question our assumptions .
Arguably , the most universally accepted assumption about influenza is that it is a highly infectious virus spread by the sick .
Edgar Hope - Simpson not only questioned that assumption , he went much further .
Realizing that solar radiation has profound effects on influenza , he added an unidentified " seasonal stimulus " to the heart of his radical epidemiological model [ 1 ] .
Unfortunately , the mechanism of action of the " seasonal stimulus " eluded him in life and his theory languished .
Nevertheless , he parsimoniously used latent asymptomatic infectors and an unidentified " season stimulus " to fully or partially explain seven epidemiological conundrums [ 2 ] .
1 . Why is influenza both seasonal and ubiquitous and where is the virus between epidemics ?
2 . Why are the epidemics so explosive ?
3 . Why do epidemics end so abruptly ?
4 . What explains the frequent coincidental timing of epidemics in countries of similar latitudes ?
5 . Why is the serial interval obscure ?
6 . Why is the secondary attack rate so low ?
7 . Why did epidemics in previous ages spread so rapidly , despite the lack of modern transport ?
An eighth conundrum – one not addressed by Hope - Simpson – is the surprising percentage of seronegative volunteers who either escape infection or develop only minor illness after being experimentally inoculated with a novel influenza virus .
The percentage of subjects sickened by iatrogenic aerosol inoculation of influenza virus is less than 50 % [ 3 ] , although such experiments depend on the dose of virus used .
Only three of eight subjects without pre-existing antibodies developed illness after aerosol inhalation of A 2 / Bethesda /10/63 [ 4 ] .
Intranasal administration of various wild viruses to sero- negative volunteers only resulted in constitutional symptoms 60 % of the time ; inoculation with Fort Dix Swine virus ( H 1 N 1 ) – a virus thought to be similar to the 1918 virus – in six sero - negative volunteers failed to produce any serious illness , with one volunteer suffering moderate illness , three mild , one very mild , and one no illness at all [ 5 ] .
Similar studies by Beare et al on other H 1 N 1 viruses found 46 of 55 directly inoculated volunteers failed to develop constitutional symptoms [ 6 ] .
If influenza is highly infectious , why does n't direct inoculation of a novel virus cause universal illness in seronegative volunteers ?
A ninth conundrum evident only recently is that epidemiological studies question vaccine effectiveness , contrary to randomized controlled trials , which show vaccines to be effective .
For example , influenza mortality and hospitalization rates for older Americans significantly increased in the 80's and 90's , during the same time that influenza vaccination rates for elderly Americans dramatically increased [ 7 , 8 ] .
Even when aging of the population is accounted for , death rates of the most immunized age group did not decline [ 9 ] .
Rizzo et al studying Italian elderly , concluded , " We found no evidence of reduction in influenza - related mortality in the last 15 years , despite the concomitant increase of influenza vaccination coverage from ~ 10 % to ~60 % " [ 10 ] .
Given that influenza vaccinations increase adaptive immunity , why do n't epidemiological studies show increasing vaccination rates are translating into decreasing illness ?
After confronting influenza 's conundrums , Hope - Simpson concluded that the epidemiology of influenza was not consistent with a highly infectious disease sustained by an endless chain of sick - to - well transmissions [ 2 ] .
Two of the three most recent reviews about the epidemiology of influenza state it is " generally accepted " that influenza is highly infectious and repeatedly transmitted from the sick to the well , but none give references documenting such transmission [ 11 – 13 ] .
Gregg , in an earlier review , also reiterated this " generally accepted " theory but warned :
" Some fundamental aspects of the epidemiology of influenza remain obscure and controversial .
Such broad questions as what specific forces direct the appearance and disappearance of epidemics still challenge virologists and epidemiologists alike .
Moreover , at the most basic community , school , or family levels of observation , even the simple dynamics of virus introduction , appearance , dissemination , and particularly transmission vary from epidemic to epidemic , locale to locale , seemingly unmindful of traditional infectious disease behavioral patterns . " [ 14 ] ( p. 46 )
Questioning a generally accepted assumption means asking anew , " What does the evidence actually show ?
Thus , we asked , are there any controlled human studies that attempted sick - to - well influenza transmission ?
Do naturalistic studies of outbreaks in confined spaces prove sick - to - well transmission or are they compatible with another mode of dissemination ?
Is there an easily measurable serial interval ( the median time between the index case and the secondary cases ) , so crucial to establishing sick - to - well transmission ?
Are measured secondary attack rates in families ( the percentage of family members sickened after a primary case ) suggestive of a highly infectious virus ?
What do animal models of influenza tell us ?
Do current theories explain the explosive onset and then abrupt disappearance of epidemics , epidemics that cease despite a wealth of potential victims lacking adaptive immunity [ 15 ] ?
Why have epidemic patterns in Great Britain not altered in four centuries , centuries that have seen great increases in the speed of human transport [ 16 ] ?
If each successive epidemic increases herd immunity and children born since the last epidemic are non-immune , why does n't the average age of persons infected in successive epidemics become progressively lower [ 17 ] ?
Why did the peak of 25 consecutive epidemics in France and the USA occur within a mean of four days of each other [ 18 ] ?
Review of Jordan 's sobering monograph of the 1918 pandemic leaves little room to doubt that close human interaction propagates influenza [ 19 ] .
Furthermore , laboratory evidence leaves no doubt that droplets or aerosols can transmit influenza ; droplets containing a high dose of virus , or aerosols containing a much lower dose , both can result in iatrogenic human infection [ 20 ] .
Subjects that sicken do so two to four days after being iatrogenically infected ; that is , the incubation period is about three days .
However , it is crucial to remember that the incubation period only tells us what the serial interval should be , not what it is .
Furthermore , induction of human infection in the laboratory only tells us such infection is possible ; it does not tell us who is infecting the well in nature .
The obvious candidate is the sick .
However , Edgar Hope - Simpson contended that the extant literature on serial interval , secondary attack rates , and other epidemiological aspects of influenza are not compatible with sick - to - well transmission as the usual mode of contagion .
In his 1992 book , after considering all known epidemiological factors , he presented a comprehensive , parsimonious – and radically different – model for the transmission of influenza , one heavily dependent on a profound , even controlling , effect of solar radiation .
Furthermore , while agreeing the sick could infect the well , Hope - Simpson 's principal hypothesis was that epidemic influenza often propagates itself by a series of transmissions from a small number of highly infectious – but generally symptomless – latent carriers , briefly called into contagiousness by the " seasonal stimulus . "
In contrast , Kilbourne 's 1987 text – without mentioning serial interval or secondary attack rates in his chapter on epidemiology – concluded , " Any doubt about the communicability of influenza from those ill with the disease is dispelled by studies in crowded , confined , or isolated populations " [ 21 ] .
( p. 269 ) As discussed below , the naturalistic studies Kilbourne refers to certainly indicate human interaction facilitates transmission of influenza .
However , these naturalistic studies simply assume that the first person with identified illness is the index case .
Obviously , A preceding B does not prove A causes B .
A leatherback turtle .
They survived the extinction of the dinosaurs .
They 're descendants of one of the oldest family trees in history , spanning 100 million years .
But today leatherback turtles , the most widely distributed reptiles on Earth , are threatened with extinction themselves , in large part due to the carelessness of humans .
We 've seen reference to the dangers plastic poses to marine life , garbage that we humans directly and indirectly deposit in the oceans , but how clearly have we received the message ?
Not well enough according to a recent article in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin entitled “ Leatherback turtles :
The menace of plastic , ” co-authored by Dalhousie University 's Mike James .
“ We wanted to see if plastics ingestion in leatherbacks was hype or reality , ” says Dr. James , senior species at risk biologist for Fisheries and Oceans Canada and adjunct professor with Dalhousie ’s Department of Biology .
“ It was a monumental effort that looked back at necropsies over the last century from all over the world , ” he explains .
( Necropsies are post - mortem examinations performed on animals . )
“ After reviewing the results of 371 necropsies since 1968 , we discovered over one third of the turtles had ingested plastic . ”
Since leatherbacks prefer eating jellyfish , it 's widely believed they mistake bags or other plastics for their meals .
Since jellyfish and marine debris concentrate where ocean water masses meet , leatherbacks feeding in these areas are vulnerable to ingesting plastic .
Once leatherbacks ingest plastic , thousands of spines lining the throat and esophagus make it nearly impossible to regurgitate .
The plastic can lead to partial or even complete obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract , resulting in decreased digestive efficiency , energetic and reproductive costs and , for some , starvation .
“ Plastics ingestion does n’t always cause death , but there are clearly health risks to the turtles , ” says Dr.James .
Fascinated by reptiles as a child , Dr. James developed a lifelong interest in turtles , from raising them as a kid , to his PhD research and now as a biologist and conservationist .
He says there are simple ways to stop these ongoing threats .
“ The frustrating , yet hopeful aspect is that humans can easily begin addressing the solution , without major lifestyle changes , ” says Dr. James .
“ It 's as simple as reducing packaging and moving towards alternative , biodegradable materials and recycling . ”
Leatherback turtles are classified as critically endangered world - wide .
The true population size is not precisely known , as only adult females come ashore for nesting in remote tropical locations .
During the summer and fall , Canadian waters support the highest density of foraging leatherbacks in the North Atlantic .

Wights do n’t scare us anymore …
We recently had a commenter in our discussions section lamenting that the removal of level draining abilities has taken the dread out of the undead .
I find myself forced to agree with him to an extent , I remember when players were terrified of battling a level draining monster or even better , one they could n’t quite remember if it had the power to level drain .
These days an undead opponent might be a menace or a tough fight but there is no longer the fear there once was .
However this problem is not limited to the undead or even limited to fourth edition .
Where We Have Gone
Taken as a whole the entire history of Dungeons & Dragons has been one of moving towards the heroic .
As each edition passed the player got more control over his character .
The character himself grew more potent and the peak of power he could reach became higher .
Lastly , the world around them became more merciful .
What We Have Lost
Monsters , Monsters Everywhere : Cloakers , mimics , earseekers , do you remember these monsters ?
They are just a few of the monsters that populated a classic dungeon crawl .
Together with many other fearsome cousins they ensured that no adventurer would feel safe during any activity .
A chest , door , floor or any other item could potentially be a deadly monster .
Not all of them would be , just enough that they would crop up when you finally started feeling safe again .
Necklace of Strangulation : Before you could figure out an item with a just few moments peace , there was a lot of expense , time and hassle associated with a magical item .
Of course , if you were feeling bold you could simply put it on .
However , you might find that your shiny new hat eats your brains , your weapon stabs your allies instead or your boots put a song in your heart and in your feet .
Good luck getting rid of a cursed item before it gets rid of you !
Search Every Inch :
The click under his feet may well be the last thing your character hears .
Whirling blades , spiked pits and blasts of fire are just the beginning of the traps that sprang from the minds of devious DMs .
Unlike the traps of this edition , which will mostly just wear a group down , old school traps dished out massive damage if not outright death to the slow or clumsy .
Cling to it all :
These days the assumption among players is that once they earn something it will be theirs forever .
A single encounter with a level draining undead or a rust monster would shatter this delusion very quickly .
What Does It All Mean ?
To sum it up , we have lost paranoia .
PCs were once trying to hold on long enough to make it through each dungeon and spend their rewards .
Now they feel they can take on the world , nothing will be thrown at them that they are n’t equipped to handle .
I do n’t mean this as a condemnation .
It is not a failure of the new editions , simply a slow transition to a new feel .
I enjoy a good epic tale as much as anyone else but I also enjoy being afraid , having to rely solely on my wits to defeat monsters that can cripple me in one blow .
For my purposes I use different editions and different systems all together .
However , some people just want the old days of great fear but greater reward .
If that ’s the feeling you crave I understand why you feel betrayed with each new edition , D&D has left you behind .

Clearly , opposition to doing something about climate change has fallen back to a new position : claims that attempting to limit greenhouse gas emissions would be incredibly costly .
Yet the most careful studies , like the big MIT study of Congressional proposals , find only modest costs .
Pay no attention , say the critics .
Via Pete Davis , I found Robert Samuelson ’s latest , which Davis thinks was wonderful ; all I can say is , huh ?
Here ’s the key graf in which Samuelson tries to deny the results of the studies :
The trouble is that these models embody wildly unrealistic assumptions :
There are no business cycles ; the economy is always at “ full employment ” ; strong growth is assumed , based on past growth rates ; the economy automatically accommodates major changes — if fossil fuel prices rise ( as they would under anti-global - warming laws ) , consumers quickly use less and new supplies of “ clean energy ” magically materialize .
I do n’t think there ’s a single thing there that ’s right .
What on earth do business cycles have to do with it ?
The models may assume growth based on past trends , but they DO ask whether emissions policy would greatly slow growth — and the answer is no .
Consumers are n’t assumed to “ quickly ” use less — the time frame in these models is decades long .
And new supplies do n’t “ magically ” appear — they respond to price incentives , which is what economics usually says .
I do n’t especially mean to pick on Samuelson , but this column exemplifies a strange thing about the climate change debate .
Opponents of a policy change generally believe that market economies are wonderful things , able to adapt to just about anything — anything , that is , except a government policy that puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions .
Limits on the world supply of oil , land , water — no problem .
Limits on the amount of CO2 we can emit — total disaster .
Funny how that is .

Last week ’s jailing for six years of veteran dissident Wang Rongqing for “ subversion of state power ” was more than just another unpleasant instance of official vindictiveness , supporters and human rights groups say .
China is facing a turbulent year of deepening economic hardship , social unrest , and tense anniversaries .
The authorities are running scared .
And so they made an example of Wang .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The diagnosis seems to apply to other prominent dissidents , also feeling the heat as economic boom times fade and political jitters increase .
Liu Xiaobo , a noted literary scholar , has been held without charge since 8 December .
His apparent offence was supporting a new campaign for political and legal reform known as Charter 08 .
According to Amnesty International , Liu ’s family does not know where he is , he has no access to a lawyer , and he has yet to be charged or brought before a court .
“ The use of such detention … is arbitrary and in violation of international human rights standards , including the rights to liberty , security of person , and fair trial , ” said Amnesty ’s Roseann Rife .
Charter 08 was signed by 303 Chinese scholars , lawyers and officials , many of whom have reportedly since been harassed or placed under surveillance .
China expert James
Pringle says the campaign , modelled on Vaclav Havel ’s Charter 77 in cold war Czechoslovakia , “ is the first real opposition to the Communist leadership since Tiananmen Square ” and is widely seen as “ a threat to the party ’s monopoly on power ” .

In Shooting Yourself in the Foot with Customer Branches , I described a colleague 's current work project -- specifically , how they multiplied the amount of code they had to maintain for every new customer profile .
That 's not their only problem .
His current frustration stemmed from inadequate testing ( and very poor QA management ) due to poor handling of code freezes .
A popular ( but wrong ) theory of software development argues that development progresses in linear and predictable cycles .
You gather the specifications .
You design the subsystems .
You code features .
You stabilize a release branch and close it to all but bugfixes ( this is the feature freeze ) .
Then you perform detailed QA to try to find and diagnose all of the bugs possible before the release .
That 's a very popular theory -- it 's almost as popular as it is completely and unarguably wrong .
Management has realized that eventually they have to ship software .
There are always features to add and bugs to fix and subsystems to refactor , but the only way to release software is to draw a line on the calendar and say " We 're shipping whatever 's ready then . "
So far , so good .
Of course , you can't ship without this cool feature .
You can't ship when the long - promised feature is n't ready .
You can't ship with this many bugs .
You can't ship because there 's always something someone wants , and if they have to wait another 18 months for the next version , they 'll take their money and find someone else to pay for the software .
There 's always a rush and a crunch at the end of a release cycle when everyone suddenly realizes that this time , they 're not kidding about the release date .
Try being in QA when this happens .
All of a sudden , the day before the code freeze , a dozen feature branches that were n't ready land on trunk .
QA has n't seen them .
QA did n't even know they built .
( Some of them do n't . )
Now QA has the unenviable task of working around the damage of features that may not even meet the basic needs of customers but absolutely can't slip because the next release is months or years away .
QA gets in arguments about features , because they do n't work .
Developers do n't want to hear that .
Management does n't want to hear that .
Change is bad during a freeze .
Bugs in design or implementation or requirements take too long to fix , and the relentless drums of " But we promised to release this month ! " keep counting down the days .
Eventually , a release candidate escapes , as an admission that no one knows for sure if the software works , and would n't it be swell if someone might try to test it , because everyone thinks it probably works , because the project manager has spent the last several weeknights in the bug tracker , reclassifying bug severities and reassigning them to later milestones because one of the criteria for a release candidate is " Zero blocking bugs " and another is " Zero critical severity bugs " and if the difference between getting a bonus this year or making the quarterly numbers means that customers will file bugs in a few months that everyone argued about fixing this week , well , there 's a chance customers wo n't notice .
All software has bugs anyway .
Bugs linger in the bug tracker .
Their priorities and severities mysteriously change .
Duplicate bugs pile up .
The software gets released and everyone takes a long weekend ....
... and on Tuesday morning , they 're back at the grind , preparing for the next patch release cycle to fix all of the problems they knew about before but could n't fix , because you can't make changes during a code freeze , because no one knows if the code works , because you can't create a release candidate with that bug count , because releasing software is a very big deal , because it 's just too darn hard to prepare a release with all of this ceremony .
At least they have daily status meetings , though .
Meanwhile , another company down the street knows what " done " means .
They keep their bug count low .
They can release a new version of their software stable enough for customers to use every day , if they want .
Releases are n't a big deal .
They 're boring and common place .
( How do they do it ?
See The Rapid Release Tautology . )
If you 're the first company , the second company has already eaten your lunch , and they 'll continue to do so every week , until you fail or until you figure out how to release software .
In the latest installment of Apple 's iPhone security - related patent filings , the Cupertino - based company describes the implementation of loss prevention software that would notify a security agency in the event the handset is lost or stolen , which could in turn lead to a police officer being dispatched to the current location of the device based on GPS coordinates .
More specifically , the 12 - page filing notes that an electronic device can be configured to enter a prevention mode in response to detecting a force that exceeds a predetermined threshold , thereby providing security .
Upon entering a prevention mode , Apple says the device may transmit a security transmission , in the form of a telephone call or an e-mail .
This security transmission , when received by a security entity , could lead to the security entity dispatching an officer to the device 's location , or to the security entity placing a telephone call to the device 's owner , thereby providing additional security .
" To provide greater security , an electronic device in a security mode can be configured to enter a ' lock - down ' mode when the device is exposed to vibration or acceleration above a predetermined lock - down threshold , thereby preventing unauthorized use of the device , " the company adds .
" The vibration / acceleration lock - down threshold for a lock - down mode may be set to be the same as a security threshold for sending a security transmission or may be set to a different level of vibration / acceleration . "
Users would be able to set preferences that determine various states or circumstances in which an iPhone would switch into its security mode , such as when the device has been idle , without user input and / or certain vibration / acceleration events , for a predetermined period of time .

This is the full text of the speech Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave at the Durban Review Conference , a UN conference on racism , in Geneva , Switzerland , on Tuesday , 20th April 2009 .
Protesters interrupted the conference before Mr Ahmadinejad could start his speech .
He refers to the incident in his opening sentence .
I would like to ask all honourable participants to forgive them .
They are ignorant .
In the name of God , the Merciful , the Compassionate .
Thanks to God , the Lord of the worlds , and peace and praise be upon our master and prophet , Muhammad and his immaculate progeny and true followers .
O God , hasten the reappearance of the Hidden Imam and grant him health and victory and make us his true companions and believers and those who testify to His rightfulness .
Praise belongs to the just , merciful , and compassionate God.
May God 's blessing be upon the prophets , Adam , Noah , Abraham , Moses , Jesus , and the last prophet His Holiness Muhammad Mustafa , who called for monotheism , fraternity , kindness , human dignity , and justice .
Mr Chairman , Honourable Secretary - General of the UN , Honourable High Commissariat for Human Rights , Ladies and Gentlemen , following the Durban anti-racism and discrimination conference , we have gathered here to examine the current situation and to find practical solutions for this humane and sacred campaign .
In the past centuries , great injustice was inflicted on mankind .
In the Middle Ages scholars and scientists were sentenced to death .
And later on slavery and the hunting down of innocent people , separating them from their families and taking them in millions to Europe and America in the worst conditions , was popular .
These were dark ages where lands were occupied and their sources were looted , and innocent people were killed and made homeless .
Years passed until people rose .
They paid a high price in order to drive occupiers out and establish independent and national governments ; millions of people were killed .
Those in power imposed two major wars in short periods of time on Europe and parts of Africa and Asia .
These were wars which took about 100 million lives and resulted in destruction of a lot of countries and regions .
Those who won these wars considered themselves conquerors of the world and considered other nations defeated .
And by the imposition of oppressive laws and arrangements they ignored and violated other nations rights .
Ladies and gentlemen , look at the Security Council which is the legacy of World War I and II .
Based on what logic have they been given the right to veto ?
With which human and divine value is this logic compatible ?
Justice , equality in the eye of law and human dignity or discrimination , injustice , violation of human rights and belittling the majority of nations and countries ?
This Council is the most supreme decision - making centre for maintaining peace and security in the world .
When there is legal discrimination and the law - making centre is a source of bullying and force instead of justice and fairness , how can one expect to achieve justice and peace ?
Seeking power and selfishness is the source of racism , discrimination , aggression and tyranny .
Today many racists condemn racism in their slogans and speeches but when some powerful countries give themselves the right to make decisions for other countries , using their discretion , and based on their own interests , they can easily trample on all rules and human values .
As they have already proven .
After the Second World War , by exploiting the holocaust and under the pretext of protecting the Jews they made a nation homeless with military expeditions and invasion .
They transferred various groups of people from America , Europe and other countries to this land .
They established a completely racist government in the occupied Palestinian territories .
And in fact , under the pretext of making up for damages resulting from racism in Europe , they established the most aggressive , racist country in another territory , i.e. Palestine .
The Security Council endorsed this usurper regime and for 60 years constantly defended it and let it commit any kind of crime .
Worse than this is that some Western governments and America are committed to support genocidal racists while others condemn the bombardment of innocent human beings , the occupation of their land and the disasters that took place in Gaza .
Even before they kept silent , not responding to all the crimes of that regime , and supported it .
Dear friends , ladies and gentlemen , what has been the source of recent wars such as the Americans ' attack on Iraq or the wide military expedition in Afghanistan ?
Has it been anything else than the selfishness of the American government of the time and the pressures by those in possession of wealth and power to expand influence and hegemony , support weapon manufacturers , destroy a great culture that is thousands of years old , destroying possible and potentials risks by the countries of the region against the occupying Quds regime , and looting the energy resources of the Iraqi people ?
In fact why were one million people dead and injured and a few million people forced to leave their homeland ?
Why were hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damage inflicted on the Iraqi people and hundreds of billions of dollars of costs for the military invasion imposed on the American people and America 's allies ?
Was attacking Iraq not orchestrated by the Zionists and their allies in the previous ruling government of America which was on the one hand in power and on the other the owner of arms manufacturing companies ?
Did peace , security and prosperity return to Afghanistan by military intervention ?
America and its allies were not even able to stop the production of narcotics and during their presence it increased several fold .
The main question is this :
What was the role of the previous ruling system in America and its allies ?
Were they the representatives of the world nations ?
Were they elected by the world nations ?
Do they have representation by the world nations to interfere in the affairs of all parts of the world and especially our region ?
Do n't these actions , the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan , count as examples of selfishness , racism , discrimination and violating the dignity and independence of other nations ?
Ladies and gentlemen , who are the people in charge of the crisis - hit economy of the world ?
Where did the crisis start ?
Did it start in Africa and Asia or American and then Europe and their allies ?
For a long time , using their political influence , they [ West ] imposed unfair economic laws on international economic transactions .
They set up financial and monetary systems without provisions of international supervision and imposed those systems on countries that did not have the smallest role to play in the processes and policies adopted .
They do not even allow their own nations to supervise .
By taking away morality from their actions , they have established laws in a way that they serve the interests of certain powerful people and capitalists .
By giving a specific definition of free market and competition , they took away many opportunities from others and imposed their problems on others .
Today , with dozens of thousands of billions of dollars of debt and thousands of billions of dollars of budget deficit , those waves of crisis have come back to them .
Even today in order to improve the situation , they have started injecting hundred billions of dollars of unsupported money from the pockets of their citizens and other nations into banks and companies and financial markets which were close to bankruptcy and they have made their people even more indebted and they have made the problem more complicated .
They are thinking of maintaining their power and wealth .
And the people of the world and even their own people are of no value to them .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the true root of racism is the lack of human understanding as God 's chosen creatures and deviation from the true path of human life and human missions in creation .
Due to negligence in worshipping
God with awareness and pondering on the philosophy of life and the path towards human perfection - which leads to the natural outcome of being committed to divine values and mankind - the horizon of human insight has declined .
And limited and temporary interests became the criteria of evaluation and actions by human beings .
Therefore , the seeds of evil power took their shape and by neglecting fair chances for others ' growth , it added to the boundaries of its development .
In such a way that it changed to an ugly and uncontrollable racism that today it is threatening the global peace as the most dangerous factor .
And it is an obstacle on the way of achieving peaceful life in the world .
Undoubtedly , racism should be recognised as the symbol of ignorance of the depth of history and a sign of dogmatism against mankind 's general growth .
Therefore , we should look for the signs of racism under conditions and situations in a society where poverty of knowledge and lack of understanding would be spread .
Therefore , the main means of fighting such symptoms is to promote general awareness and deepening public understanding towards the philosophy of mankind 's existence and the truth about the human - oriented world .
Its requirement or outcome is a return to spiritual and ethical values and human virtues and finally the belief in God .
The global society should start a united cultural movement for enlightening certain suffering and undeveloped societies as much as possible and uproot this hideous and evil phenomenon .
But dear friends , today the human society is facing a kind of racism which has an ugliness that has completely distorted the honour of mankind at the verge of the third millennium and it has made the global society shameful .
The global Zionism is the complete symbol of racism , which with unreal reliance on religion has tried to misuse the religious beliefs of some unaware people and hide its ugly face .
But what should be seriously considered are the goals of certain superpowers and those in possession of major interests in the world ; those who try their best through economic power and political influence and wide media means , to lessen the crimes and ugliness of the nature of the Zionist regime .
Here , the main issue is not ignorance and therefore , cultural movements on their own , are not sufficient to fight this evil phenomenon .
But we should try to put an end to the misuse of international means by the Zionists and their supporters .
And by respecting nations ' demands , we should motivate the united governments to eliminate this clear racism and step on the path of reforming international relations 0 and mechanisms with courage .
Undoubtedly , you are all aware of the extensive efforts by the institutes of global power towards creating a deviation on the path of the real mission of this important conference .
Unfortunately in the literature supporting the Zionists , a clear participation and cooperation in their crimes can be noticed .
And this adds to the responsibilities of the respectful representatives of nations in revealing this antihuman issue and improving relations and behaviours .
We should be aware that to keep a huge global capacity , such as this conference , away from its real intentions , means helping to continue the most hideous sense of racism .
Today the necessity of defending human rights is firstly , to defend the rights of a nation to be free to make decisions regarding important global affairs without the influence of certain powers ; secondly , to take action to improve international structures and relations .
Therefore , this conference is the arena of a major test and we will be judged by the world 's public opinion today and tomorrow .
Mr Chairman , ladies and gentlemen , the world 's general condition is rapidly moving towards basic changes .
Power based equations have become very weak .
The sound of the pillars of global tyranny breaking can be heard .
Political and macro economic structures are falling .
Political and security crisis are growing .
And the growing global economic crisis , for the resolution of which there is no bright horizon , makes all sorts of quantitative and quality aspects of change on the way very impressive .
I have emphasised the necessity of getting back from the wrong path that today 's absolute global management is following and I have warned about the critical outcomes of delaying to do so .
Also now , in this valued conference , addressing you managers , thinkers and all the world nations who are thirsty for peace , freedom , progress and prosperity , I would like to say that the unjust ruling of the world is reaching its end .
This deadlock was inevitable since the logic behind this imposed management is tyrannical .
This is because the logic of the mass movement of the world is divine , purposeful , humane and God-centred .
It is a movement which opposes any policy or plan which is not in line with the interests of nations .
Victory of truth over vice and the bright future of humanity and the establishment of a just global system is the promise of God and all prophets , and a common hope of all communities and generations .
Achieving such a future justifies the reason behind creation , is the belief of all those faithful to God and the very high status of the human beings .
Formation of a global community , the practical possibility of a common global system materialising and finally involving thinkers , managers and people of the world to actively and justly participate in the macro and principle decision makings is the main path to this great destination .
At the moment , scientific and technical capabilities as well as information and communication technology have created a mutual and comprehensive understanding of the global community and have created the necessary ground for a common system to materialise . .
Now , this is a grave responsibility that the world 's scientists , elites and officials across the world should shoulder by playing a historic role through faith in this definite path .
Now I want to stress on this fact that western capitalism like communism has reached the end of its path because it does not see the world and humanity as they are .
It has tried to impose a self - constructed path and destination and instead of paying attention to human and divine values , justice , freedom , compassion and brotherhood it has set fierce competition for gaining individual and collective materialistic interests as a basis for life .
Now we should collectively try to learn lessons from the past and understand the necessity for correcting this path by considering today 's conditions .
And on the same note and as the final word I would like to draw your attention to two important points .
First point :
The improvement of the current international condition is hundred per cent possible .
But we should know that this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of all the governments and nations .
Therefore , we should benefit from the capacities of international cooperation to the maximum .
My presence in this conference indicates my respect for this important issue , and the essential issue of human rights and support for nations ' rights against the evil phenomenon of racism and cooperation with you , the thinkers .
Second : Considering the lack of efficiency of systems and international political , economic , security and cultural relations is necessary .
In view of divine and humanitarian values and the true and real definition of human beings and based on justice and respect for the rights of all human beings across the world , confessing to the wrong management in the past and changing the views and performances , measures should be taken to reform the current structures .
Therefore , a speedy change in the structure of the United Nations and the elimination of the discriminatory right to veto and a change in the financial and monetary system of the world must be on the agenda .
Obviously , the lack of understanding for the urgency of this change will result in heavier costs due to any delay .
My dear friends , you should know that moving in line with justice and human dignity is like moving quickly on a stream of water .
Let 's not forget the valuable elixir of love and compassion .
The guarantee for a clear future for human beings is a great asset that can keep us more aware and more hopeful than ever before .
It can enable us to create a world full of love and blessing and can be free from poverty and hatred .
We will also be able to profit from the blessings of God and have the advantage of having a decent management of a complete human being .
Let us all have a share in this important issue , and hope for that bright and beautiful day .
I would like to sincerely thank the President and the UN Secretary - General and all of you for your patience , wishing you dignity and success .

The enduringly popular theory that the Chicxulub crater holds the clue to the demise of the dinosaurs , along with some 65 percent of all species 65 million years ago , is challenged in a paper to be published in the Journal of the Geological Society on April 27 , 2009 .
The crater , discovered in 1978 in northern Yucutan and measuring about 180 kilometers ( 112 miles ) in diameter , records a massive extra-terrestrial impact .
When spherules from the impact were found just below the Cretaceous - Tertiary ( K - T ) boundary , it was quickly identified as the " smoking gun " responsible for the mass extinction event that took place 65 million years ago .
It was this event which saw the demise of dinosaurs , along with countless other plant and animal species .
However , a number of scientists have since disagreed with this interpretation .
The newest research , led by Gerta Keller of Princeton University in New Jersey , and Thierry Adatte of the University of Lausanne , Switzerland , uses evidence from Mexico to suggest that the Chicxulub impact predates the K - T boundary by as much as 300,000 years .
" Keller and colleagues continue to amass detailed stratigraphic information supporting new thinking about the Chicxulub impact , and the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous , " says H. Richard Lane , program director in the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) 's Division of Earth Sciences , which funded the research .
" The two may not be linked after all . "
From El Penon and other localities in Mexico , says Keller , " we know that between four and nine meters of sediments were deposited at about two to three centimeters per thousand years after the impact .
The mass extinction level can be seen in the sediments above this interval . "
Advocates of the Chicxulub impact theory suggest that the impact crater and the mass extinction event only appear far apart in the sedimentary record because of earthquake or tsunami disturbance that resulted from the impact of the asteroid .
" The problem with the tsunami interpretation , " says Keller , " is that this sandstone complex was not deposited over hours or days by a tsunami .
Deposition occurred over a very long time period . "
The study found that the sediments separating the two events were characteristic of normal sedimentation , with burrows formed by creatures colonizing the ocean floor , erosion and transportation of sediments , and no evidence of structural disturbance .
The scientists also found evidence that the Chicxulub impact did n't have the dramatic impact on species diversity that has been suggested .
At one site at El Penon , the researchers found 52 species present in sediments below the impact spherule layer , and counted all 52 still present in layers above the spherules .
" We found that not a single species went extinct as a result of the Chicxulub impact , " says Keller .
This conclusion should not come as too great a surprise , she says .
None of the other great mass extinctions are associated with an impact , and no other large craters are known to have caused a significant extinction event .
Keller suggests that the massive volcanic eruptions at the Deccan Traps in India may be responsible for the extinction , releasing huge amounts of dust and gases that could have blocked out sunlight and brought about a significant greenhouse effect .

I wrote a few weeks ago about changes Microsoft has made to Windows 7 's User Account Control ( UAC ) that make the component less secure than it was in Vista .
Though the company has responded by saying it will change some of the problem behaviors , yet more problems have emerged that indicate that a real fix will be harder than first expected .
But more than that , the flaws call into question the entire purpose of the Windows UAC feature , at least in its commonplace " Admin Approval " mode .
The decisions Microsoft has made not only make Windows 7 's Admin Approval mode less secure than Vista's , they also undermine the entire purpose of the UAC system .
Redmond maintains that UAC 's foremost objective is to ensure programmers update their programs to behave properly when users have limited access rights .
But the way that the Windows 7 UAC " improvements " have been made completely exempts Microsoft 's developers from having to do that work themselves .
With Windows 7 , it 's one rule for Redmond , another one for everyone else .
The combination of significant security flaws and the inconsistent , " Do as I say , not as I do " attitude towards UAC should give Microsoft pause for thought .
There 's no point in retaining Admin Approval mode as it currently stands , and it should be scrapped completely .
The new exploit , discovered and demonstrated here , depends on a third mechanism for elevation that was previously overlooked .
The first mechanism for elevation is the traditional prompt — the user is notified that a particular program wants to elevate , and can permit or deny the request .
The second is the auto - elevating executables described in my previous article , in which certain system executables automatically elevate without any notification .
Chief among these is a program rundll32 , which can load and run almost any DLL , and will do so fully elevated .
Microsoft may or may not fix the rundll 32 problem ; as it stands , it blows a big hole in UAC since it allows any software to trivially bypass the prompts , but since the change was made with the objective of removing prompts from " legitimate " uses of rundll32 , the company has something of a dilemma : stop rundll32 auto - elevating and reinstate the prompts ( thereby improving security ) , or keep the auto - elevation and ignore the security impact .
It may not matter much what Microsoft does with rundll32 , however , as the newly demonstrated attack shows .
The new attack allows an attacker to trick pretty much any auto - elevating program into running code of the attacker 's choosing — even auto - elevating programs that are n't meant to run arbitrary code .
It does this by exploiting other parts of Microsoft 's auto - elevation system .
Overview of the new attack
Although a few programs in Windows 7 are always elevated , most are not .
For example , the Explorer shell runs without elevation , unless the user explicitly opts to elevate it and verifies the UAC prompt .
Nonetheless , there are Explorer tasks that require elevation that are common enough that Microsoft felt they should auto - elevate .
The most common one of these is probably creating a folder in a protected location ( in Program Files , for example ) .
In the original Vista release , this activity would cause an annoying back - to - back double elevation : once to create the folder , and again to rename it to its intended name .
Service Pack 1 streamlined this a little , reducing it to only a single elevation , but Microsoft clearly wanted to get this down to zero .
The technique that all versions of Vista and Windows 7 use to perform individual tasks with elevation ( rather than running an entire program elevated ) is to put the elevated action into its own component and to call that component from the main program .
This is in fact the main way in which UAC support should be added to applications , because it generally requires less elevation than elevating entire programs .
If the operation in question is n't even attempted , no attempt to elevate occurs either , which is obviously the best possible outcome .
This component - based technique is used for Explorer 's file management operations in Vista and Windows 7 .
Creating , copying , moving , renaming , and deleting files all occur within a particular component that gets elevated when necessary , leaving Explorer itself unelevated .
In Windows 7 , however , Microsoft has made this component auto - elevating .
So although Explorer itself cannot elevate automatically , it can create a component which can .
This component is quite limited — it can do a handful of file manipulation operations , but wo n't run arbitrary code — and even the auto - elevation is restricted .
Auto - elevating components will only elevate when called from Microsoft - signed applications ; if third - party code tries to use them , a UAC prompt will appear .
On the face of it , this would n't be enough to compromise a system ; third party code can't use the component to elevate , and even if the component is running , it can't be used to trivially run arbitrary code in the way that the rundll 32 flaw can ( although it could certainly overwrite or remove key system files , which might break the system ) .
Unfortunately , the " Microsoft - signed application " restriction is easily bypassed using a standard Windows trick that allows one process to insert code into a second process , as long as both processes are being run by the same user .
The limitations of the file management component are probably unavoidable ( it can only do the things it has been programmed to do , after all ) , but it turns out it does n't really matter .
The file management component can place files into various locations on the system that an unelevated user cannot ; an auto - elevate program can then be tricked into loading those files and executing code from them .
The result is , just as with the rundll 32 problem , silent and automatic elevation , able to do anything .
The implications
So , does any of this matter ?
Well , I think it does .
Microsoft and its supporters have argued throughout that UAC in Admin Approval mode is n't a security boundary , and as such , escalation of this kind is not a security problem .
Although Windows does have plenty of security boundaries — two users logged on at the same time should not be able to kill each other 's processes or read each other 's data , for example , because each session has a boundary around it — UAC is not one of them .
What this means is that it does n't really matter , in Microsoft 's view , if people figure out a way to bypass UAC .
And indeed , in Vista there are ways for malicious programs to piggy - back off UAC elevations to get elevated themselves , and these have n't been fixed .
There is , however , a big difference between how this plays out in Vista vs. Windows 7 .
In Vista , these workarounds still depend on the user at some point permitting a program to elevate , and the elevated program has to be the one that the malware has booby - trapped .
In Windows 7 , all the guesswork is gone ; the exploitation is consistent and systematic .
Microsoft has n't been entirely consistent in its stance on this matter .
The company has bowed to public pressure over some of the Windows 7 UAC changes already , and reinstated more secure behavior even though this has meant reintroducing some UAC prompts .
This move is inconsistent with the stated policy ; after all , if UAC is truly not a security barrier , why bother making fixes whose only justification is the security they provide ?
However , the latest exploits appear to be essentially unfixable without wholesale reintroduction of the UAC prompts .
Since the entire motivation behind the changes in the first place was to avoid these prompts , any solution that reinstates them is unlikely to fly .
Sony 's Peter Dille says the way Nintendo 's driven wider - audience gaming means consumers ready to move up to " next - generation high definition gaming " will end up on the PlayStation 3 .
" Our view on the Wii : number one , our hat 's off to them , " Dille told Gamasutra as part of an in - depth feature interview .
" They 've created this huge phenomenon that 's captivated people 's imagination -- and captivated a lot of dollars . "
" No one around here is in the camp of ' Oh , it 's this fad ' sort of spin .
Again , hats off to them .
We think it 's good for the business , to be honest .
" And good for Sony , too , according to Dille .
" There 's a perspective here that , if we all believe that the Wii and Nintendo are doing something that has n't been done -- i.e. , bringing more people into gaming -- that 's a good thing .
Now , if those people get hooked on gaming and they want to continue with their gaming habit , then many of them will figure out ' Okay , what else can I do ? ' and ' would n't a high - definition gaming experience be of interest to me ?
'" Based on the profile of the Wii consumer , says Dille , the PS3 is " the perfect place for them to end up . "
" It 's always been a platform that 's inclusive ; it 's got something for everyone .
We believe that the family that 's been involved in Wii gaming -- having a PS3 as the centerpiece of their living room is a great thing that the whole family can enjoy much the same way that you can enjoy Wii but perhaps on steroids ; it does so much more .
" So from Dille 's perspective , it 's just a matter of time before consumers reintroduced to gaming via the Wii make their return to the PlayStation brand with which they were familiar in the previous generation .
" The Wii is not positioned as the digital entertainment hub in the way that the PlayStation 3 [ is ] , " he says .
" So we think that over time all those folks will migrate back to the PlayStation 3 -- when I say " back , " that takes the view that they were PS2 gamers , went to the Wii , and then would come back .
" And as for Wii users entirely new to the space ?
" As I said earlier , if they did n't come from anywhere , if they 're just new gamers , then that 's good for all of us .
We believe that we 'll have a fair shot as selling them a lot of our products down the road .

The west 's leading economic thinktank expects " very negative " growth this year , its head warned today .
However , Angel Gurría , secretary - general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , said in Beijing that China 's gross domestic product would expand by 6 - 7 % – below last November 's forecast of 8 % .
The World Bank cut its growth forecast for China to 6.5 % this week .
Gurría added : " Even positive growth in big emerging economies like India and China is not going to be able to offset the negative growth [ elsewhere ] . "
According to a provisional OECD forecast disclosed yesterday by a Slovenian minister , the Paris - based group expects the eurozone 's economy to contract by 4.1 % this year .
The International Monetary Fund has projected a 3.5 % fall .
Gurría said China 's " cruising speed " to keep unemployment acceptably low was about 7 % , adding that growth had fallen from 13 % in 2007 .
The OECD will release a formal forecast on 31 March .
A new OECD report says the global crisis is hitting China 's already impoverished countryside , with migrant workers returning home and household incomes dropping because they are no longer sending wages back .
It argues judicial independence and proper defence of farmers ' land rights – a sensitive issue – is needed to improve conditions for rural inhabitants .
It also calls for increased investment in education , social security and basic services such as a clean water supply , and greater support for non-agricultural jobs .
" The current recession has put into harsh relief the low level of the social safety nets and the livelihood of migrant workers , " warned Gurría .
He told the press conference that protectionism was " rearing its ugly head " because of the economic crisis and would only make matters worse .
But he played down China 's rejection of Coca - Cola 's bid for the country 's top juice maker , Huiyuan , this week , saying it acted from concern that the deal would have hurt competition .
He also backed China 's appeal for more say in global finance bodies , which it will press at next month 's G20 summit in London .
" The fact that China has less votes than Belgium tells you [ it 's needed ] , " he told reporters .
The 30 - member OECD , composed of wealthier nations , is forming closer ties with the emerging economies of China , India , South Africa , Brazil and Indonesia .

From Kirkus Reviews :
Lively as - told - to autobiography of a scientist who studied flotsam — floating trash — and revolutionized the study of the world ’s oceans .
Ebbesmeyer graduated college as a mechanical engineer in the mid-1960s and went to work for Mobil / Standard Oil , which financed the doctorate studies that made him the company ’s first oceanographer .
Years of traveling the world gave him an intimate knowledge of how ocean movements affect oil rigs , but he grew increasingly fascinated by sea currents and eddies and began to focus on beaches , more specifically on debris deposited there .
An epiphany came in May 1990 when a Pacific storm knocked five containers filled with thousands of athletic shoes off a cargo vessel .
Nearly a year later , the shoes began washing up along the West coast of North America .
With the help of a surprisingly large and cooperative fraternity of beachcombers , Ebbesmeyer tracked the progress of the shoes up and down the coast and as far as Hawaii , producing a groundbreaking study of ocean currents .
With the help of maritime and environmental journalist Scigliano ( Michelangelo ’s Mountain : The Quest for Perfection in the Marble Quarries of Carrara , 2005 , etc. ) , Ebbesmeyer spins a fascinating tale .
Even readers with little interest in ocean science will be riveted by the author ’s chronicle of the epic travels of oceanic trash ; the entertaining explanations of how floating debris guided Christopher Columbus and the Vikings to safe harbors ; the horrific stories of men adrift at sea ; how flotsam may have triggered the origin of life ; and frighteningly , the warnings of the threat that an increasing avalanche of plastic waste poses to the oceans .
A captivating account of the man who turned beachcombing into a science .

I visited to check the story in Opensecrets.org , but found the side not responding .
While The Examiner writes that this was a big bonus , one of the commentators there says that this was a political campaign contribution .
During the elections many companies contributed to this or that candidate .
Examiner Writes :
" Senator Barack Obama received a $ 101,332 bonus from American International Group in the form of political contributions according to Opensecrets.org .
The two biggest Congressional recipients of bonuses from the A.I.G. are - Senators Chris Dodd and Senator Barack Obama .
" The A.I.G. Financial Products affiliate of A.I.G. gave out $ 136,928 , the most of any AIG affiliate , in the 2008 cycle .
I would note that A.I.G. ’s financial products division is the unit that wrote trillions of dollars ’ worth of credit - default swaps and " misjudged " the risk . "
Rick commented on the same places writing " This was n't a " bonus " , it was a political contribution .
Also , the contribution likely came earlier in the election cycle , before the bailout .
Republicans take contributions from corporations too , at least they did when they were in power , now they can't really help anyone . "
Sincere the Examiner already reports this news , it would be very good if someone from the Obama administration responded to that and explained what was the payment that his campaign allegedly received from AIG .
We emailed Obama 's campaign manager David Plouffe asking for a clarification on Examiner 's report , but have not heard from him yet .
Growing Your Garden This Spring
Springtime already ?
Whether you are a city dweller or country farmer , now is the time to start growing the garden of your dreams .
If you want dahlias come summertime , or a row of organic vegetables to feed the family , begin planting now .
Before you know it , you will have a beautiful spring garden that is exploding with color , fragrance and natural bounty .
A little bit of upfront planning will give you plenty of opportunity to turn your garden dreams into reality .
Healthy soil for healthy plants
Healthy soil is the foundation of every beautiful garden , so a little bit of hands - on soil therapy should be on your agenda during any season of the year .
To encourage plenty of healthy soil insects and microbes , dig in some organic matter once or twice a year and avoid toxic soil chemicals .
Spring is a great time to do this , as most of your plants have not begun to grow full throttle just yet .
Apply compost to improve the quality of your soil .
If you live in a city that offers compost bins , then this becomes a very easy exercise .
Otherwise , you can compost yard waste in a compost bin .
Draw your garden plan
A good garden plan can help you save time , money and resources .
You do n’t have to be an artist , and all you really need is a basic sketch diagram to help you decide what to plant where , how to disperse color , and how to plan edible plants into the mix .
So take out your sketchpad and ask yourself these questions :
Which part of the garden gets sun vs. shade ?
Where would you like to have trees or shrubs ?
Can you add a raised bed , a rock garden , a waterfall or a pond ?
Can you add a piece of topiary or a bench ?
Can you add a fruit tree or a hedge , an herb garden or a meandering path ?
If you find yourself at a complete loss , do n’t worry , since many garden centers also offer design services that you can take advantage of .
Mix it up
As with many other things in life , variety is the spice when it comes to your garden .
Mixing things up helps retain the health of your soil , andalso makes things more interesting visually and aromatically .
Consider flowering bulbs , daffodils that were potted last fall , and micro greens like Swiss or rainbow chard .
Try a splash of color
Designing your garden ’s color palette can be one of the most fun things about gardening .
Your local bookshop or library is filled with magazines that you can glance through for inspiration .
Choose flowers ad colorful plants to match just about anything … your favorite garden umbrella fabric , or the table linen that you plan to use in your outdoor dining area .
Create an outdoor room
Think of your garden as an outdoor room where you can relax into the spring season with family and friends .
Chances are that the more you put into planning and creating your garden , the more time you are going to want to spend there .
Spring garden tasks
If you want your garden to bloom into a natural wonderland , there is plenty of work to be done .
Here is a set of tasks to get you started :
Prepare beds for planting by layering with compost , manure and organic ingredients like bone and kelp meals .
Check the pH of the soil with a testing kit or meter from your local garden center .
A pH of 6.5 is ideal for most plants .
Consult a nursery professional if your soil pH is too high or too low for your plants .
Start vegetable seeds indoors .
Set larger seedlings outside towards early April .
Begin planting annuals and perennials now .
Prune early bloomers like azaleas , camellias and rhododendrons after they have finished flowering .
Check seedlings and trees for signs of damage and aphids .
Wash aphids from trees and shrubs using a strong water spray with a hose .
Use a soap spray for aphids on smaller vegetables and flowers
Hunt for snails and earwigs late at night ( with a flashlight ) if you see signs of damage from these pests .
Fertilize plants and lawns with a slow release organic fertilizer .
There are plenty of online links and resources that can help you grow your garden this spring .
Here are some of our favorites :
How to Plan a Spring Flower Garden will give you plenty of ideas for a garden filled with color .
The National Gardening Association will help you identify which plants are best suited for your geographic zone .
So consider unleashing your inner gardener this Spring .
You might be surprised what you discover !

( CNN ) --
By the time the police officer kicked the door in , it was too late .
Kerby Revelus was holding his 5 - year - old sister , Bianca , and while the officer watched , he dragged a kitchen knife across her throat with such fury that he decapitated her .
Samantha Revelus , 17 , had called 911 for help after her brother attacked his sisters with a knife .
" It 's hard to imagine that kind of horror , " said Milton , Massachusetts , Police Chief Richard G. Wells Jr .
Mere seconds passed before other officers arrived and rushed into the home in the tony Boston suburb of 25,000 .
Police had received a 911 call from another Revelus sibling , 17 - year - old Samantha .
Suffering from several deep cuts in her upper body , she was losing strength .
" It was clear that she knew she was mortally wounded , " Wells said .
Watch police chief discuss decapitation »
Samantha managed to explain that her 23 - year - old brother had attacked his sisters with a knife , police said .
When she was no longer able to keep talking , the injured teen handed her 9 - year - old sister , Sarafina Revelus , the phone .
All the while , the kids ' grandmother was doing laundry in the basement , apparently unaware of the savagery upstairs , police said .
Mother Regina Revelus was at work , and father Vronze Revelus was not at home .
As officers surrounded the home and rushed into every room , Kerby ran into a bedroom where Samantha was on the floor , dead .
Sarafina was on the floor near her sister 's body , according to Wells .
Kerby Revelus then began attacking Sarafina with the knife , Wells said , prompting police to open fire and kill him .
On Tuesday , the two slain siblings and their attacker were buried together .
Sarafina Revelus returned home Tuesday after undergoing surgery Monday morning for wounds .
It was not the first time police have visited the home answering a domestic violence call , Wells said .
In September 2004 , Kerby Revelus was arrested for punching one of his sisters in the face as they fought about money , the chief said .
The Boston Herald identified the sibling as Jessica Revelus , who was not in the home during Saturday 's attack .

Jessica Revelus told officers at the time that " she was not in fear of her brother , " according to a police report from the incident , the Boston Herald reported .
A charge of domestic assault and battery was dismissed because she refused to cooperate , Wells said .
Kerby was then in his last year at Milton High School .
But Kerby was in trouble a year later , in 2005 , when he was charged with carrying a firearm without a license after he attempted to purchase alcohol at a Randolph , Massachusetts , liquor store .
He was given a six - month sentence and was released in September 2008 .
CNN reached Jessica Revelus by phone Tuesday .
She seemed distraught and said she had not been able to sleep .
Her brother 's rampage came , she said , " out of the blue . "
When asked whether he had a temper or had given any indication that he might want to hurt his sisters , she said , " I do n't know .
I am not good right now .
I am not good . "
On Monday , Jessica Revelus told the Boston Herald that " I was never afraid of him .
I called the police because he thought he was so big and bad . "
Jessica Revelus told the newspaper that her sister Samantha " would get into arguments " with Kerby over " little stuff " and that Kerby and her father were not speaking .
Police are unclear about what set the brother off Saturday , and Wells said he 's being careful not to speculate .
Vronze and Regina Revelus said through a family spokesman that they had " no explanation " for their son's savagery , according to the Boston Herald .
" How much can you put on the shoulders of one family ? "
Wells asked .
Wells praised the first officer on the scene Saturday .
" I do n't have words to articulate how this officer maintained his ability to do his job , " he said .
" To go in and witness that first thing , just as he opens the door and stay on his radio through the whole thing ... "
He added that the horror of the day rippled through the force .
" You can bet that our officers went home after this , and they hugged their wives and their children that much tighter .
I hope that for this family and for my officers , that there can be a way to get through .
" We are going to try to make them whole as soon as possible , even though the events of this past weekend will stay with them forever . "

Spock Sackboy Crochet Doll in time for the New Star Trek Film
Sackboy crochet dolls come and go , but this has to be the geekiest one of them all and would make Star Trek fans drool … especially Spock fans .
People who have wondered about the Martian lineage Spock from Star Trek might find it funny to see a Sackboy version of him .
We found some cool Mr. Spock Sackboy dolls ( Thank you to Maggie Wang for the images ) that seem to have a conversation with the kitty in the picture .
If you could ruminate for a while , you would see the satanic link between Mr. Spock Sackboy and the grim striped cat sprawled on the couch .
It is said that gray striped cats are more evil than the black ones , which are usually and unfortunately blamed for the entire evil in the world .
The kitty here certainly seems like it knows much more than the Sackboy next to him .
Perhaps these dolls are created just in time for the new Star Trek movie which is being touted as one of the best till date .
It would be interesting to see if Spock would be just as cool this time again !
Sackboy certainly is able to carry the role of Spock in a way that is strangely cute .
However , I would have liked the ears to be pointier and the skin to be redder , for that would have made the dolls look more authentic .
In this case however , the striped kitty looks like he is almost bored of Mr. Spock Sackboy ’s excitement and smile , which are not characteristic to Star Trek ’s Spock .

The Benefits Of Marijuana
It 's 4/20 Today , And The DEA 's Stance On Marijuana Still Makes No Sense
Page 1 of 2
It 's 4/20 today , and advocates of marijuana consumption have a lot to celebrate .
With states like Washington and Colorado having led the charge of legalization , and D.C. and Oregon following suit , it 's likely that other states will follow .
It 's still a contentious issue for some people though ( like Nancy Grace ) , who maintain that marijuana has no place in civilized society and the last thing we should be doing is making it legal and more accessible .
Few things illustrate the controversy better than a comparison of the web pages that purport to separate myth from fact published by the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) and the Drug Policy Alliance ( DPA ) .
They are almost mirror images of one another , addressing the very same points , but drawing on different studies to reach their preferred conclusions .
It 's stunning to see how differently these agencies can interpret the same information .
There is a single salvation from this cherry - picking point - counterpoint : the seminal report " Marijuana and Medicine : Assessing the Science Base . "
This comprehensive summary of marijuana was written in 1999 by the most highly regarded nongovernmental medical organization in the country , the Institute of Medicine , and it serves as the primary source for the information in this article concerning the risks and benefits of marijuana .
Health Risk Myths & Realities
The essential questions are whether the active ingredient in marijuana , a cannabinoid ( chemical compound ) known as THC , has any medicinal value ; whether the risks associated with its use outweigh the benefits ; and whether THC answers a need not currently met by any other medications on the market .
In the course of that debate , several health risks are often cited :
Marijuana overdose
There is no existing evidence of anyone dying of a marijuana overdose , but this does n't preclude the possibility of experiencing adverse or unpleasant effects when it is consumed in large amounts .
For comparison 's sake , alcohol overdoses claim approximately 5,000 casualties per year .
This is often cited as a reason that marijuana is safer than other drugs , like alcohol .
Memory
Marijuana does impair short - term memory , but only during intoxication .
THC has been shown to have a negative effect on memory , and chronic abuse of marijuana will cause permanent impairment .
Addiction
The DEA 's general opposition to marijuana is comprised of 1 ) that whatever medical value it has is already fulfilled by other , equally effective drugs on the market , and 2 ) that marijuana is highly addictive .
Both points can be turned upside down :
There is already an abundance of drugs that do the same job as products already on the market , and they receive approval anyway .
This seems to run contrary to the DEA 's first argument .
And even a cursory look at many of the Schedule II opiates and amphetamines shows that high addiction potential is not a basis for legal classification of drugs .
The point is that marijuana is not physically addictive , and even if it was , the DEA would appear to be quite hypocritical arguing this point .
The immune system
If smoked marijuana were to inhibit the activity of T - lymphocytes in the blood , it would compromise the body 's ability to fight infection .
This would put some people at the mercy of opportunistic infections and diseases , notably those who have immunosuppressive conditions like HIV or lymphoma .
However , the data does not support this .
What it does support — barely — is the compromised immunity of the lungs due to the smoke from marijuana .
What are some of the other health effects of smoking marijuana ?
That 's next ...
In common with anyone who has ever served with the Gurkhas , I think they are marvellous , the very best and most loyal of fighting men .
Some years ago , I became involved in a campaign to help the Gurkhas and some people , – quite wrongly and over - generously – credited me with having done a lot to save them .
In any event , I would like to think I could always see myself as a loyal supporter of theirs .
I am sure , too , that Joanna Lumley admires them every bit as much as I do , and I admire the conviction she has brought to bear in defending their interests .
But I have to sound a note of caution .
The deal the Gurkhas have had from the government is nothing like as bad as some of the newspaper headlines ( " Gurkhas betrayed " etc ) will have you believe .
Apart from their outstanding abilities in the field , for a long time the Gurkhas , to put it at its baldest , offered the British govermnment another advantage : they cost less than their British counterparts .
They were recruited on the understanding that they would remain Nepalese citizens .
They signed up in Nepal , agreed to take their release in Nepal and were paid their pension in Nepal .
And a very good pension it was , index - linked and paid after 15 years ' service ( rather than 21 for a British soldier ) .
This made them well - off in their home country .
They had still further support from the Gurkha welfare Trust , to assist in the event of landslides or other misfortunes .
It was an arrangement that suited both sides admirably .
The complication comes when we consider the claims of some Gurkhas to live in the UK .
In September they won the legal right to retire in the UK .
This went against all previous assumptions .
They have never had any claim to live here , and that was never the deal under which they signed up .
In 1997 , most of them chose to switch over to new , UK army rates of pay , a decision the British government honoured .
But the result is that those who want to live here cost the Treasury a good deal more than in the past .
Surely , this week of all weeks , we need to recognise that such expenditure must have its limits .
The Government 's decision last week to insist that Gurkhas should have served in the army for 20 years is an attempt to keep sight of reality .
It is only recently , when some have seen how comfortably off some retired Gurkhas can be living in the UK , that others have asked to come .
Yet this was never the deal at all .

It has been said that we are only talking about a handful of people – a hundred or so .
But the government , which has to live in the real world and try to make the books balance , says the cost could be as much as £ 1.5 bn .
That sum , let me remind you , would have to come out of the defence budget .
As I say , I have a greater regard for the Gurkhas than anyone .
It is not for no reason that they hold a special place in the nation 's feelings .
I would be mortified by the thought that we might have let them down .
Yet I am confident that , rather , we have treated them with fairness and generosity .
And I am also confident that a great many serving Gurkhas regard this recent activism as " trade unionism " that discredits their soldiers and is in any event counterproductive .
I suspect that if I did n't know the facts , I would feel as strongly as some of the celebrities who have spoken so vehemently about the Gurkhas .
But the facts , not sentiment , are what needs to be considered here .
Lord Bramall was Chief of the Defence Staff from 1982 - 85 , and a colonel with the 2nd King Edward VII 's Own Gurkha Rifles from 1976 - 86
Rihanna 's Father Ronald Fenty Speaks Out
Rihanna and her father Ronald Fenty
's father , , a salesman and freelance clothing designer , says that Rihanna is spending time with her girlfriends in Barbados while she heals .
Speaking about Rihanna 's current condition after she was allegedly attacked by boyfriend Chris Brown , Fenty said , " There is some bruising .
She will be all right .
I think so . "
In an interview with People magazine , Fenty said Rihanna will speak out at some point , and he hopes she will stand up for women all over the world .
On her relationship with Brown , Fenty said " If it were me , I 'd move on . "
I concur .
I realize there are two sides to every story , and we do n't know what happened that night , however , the fact remains that she was beaten ... severely .
Move on babe .

This giant blob of hydrogen gas may hide a distant galaxy , one of the earliest yet found ( Image : M Ouichi et al )
Astronomers have spotted the most distant blob of gas ever seen and are puzzling over what it is .
It dates from the very early universe , and its large size may pose a challenge to prevailing models , which state that massive objects tend to grow up slowly over time via mergers .
The gas cloud – which may conceal a galaxy – is known as a Lyman - alpha blob , named for a particular wavelength of light released when an electron loses energy in a hydrogen atom .
It spans some 55,000 light years , about half the width of the Milky Way , and it sits some 12.9 billion light years from Earth .
That means we are seeing it as it was 12.9 billion years ago , when the universe was just 800 million years old .
It is the most distant Lyman - alpha blob ever seen and the fourth most distant object yet spotted .

Masami Ouchi of the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution in Pasadena , California , and colleagues first spotted the gas in images of the deep sky taken with the Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii .
The exact nature of the object is not known .
It could be a galaxy lit either by a ravenous supermassive black hole at its centre or by the heat of an intense burst of star formation .
But it could also be two merging galaxies , or a developing galaxy that is gobbling up a large amount of gas .
Massive find
What is clear is its massive size .
The object weighs an estimated 40 billion times the mass of the sun , making it some 10 times more massive than other galaxies that have been found at that time , Ouchi told New Scientist .
Finding such a large galaxy early on – when the universe ’s first stars and galaxies were forming – could challenge the prevailing model of galaxy formation , in which massive galaxies grow slowly from successive mergers with smaller galaxies .
The discovery may hint that “ standard galaxy formation models may be wrong or may need some corrections ” , Ouchi says .
But Avi Loeb of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics says one mammoth galaxy is not an immediate problem , since models allow for a few to form soon after the big bang , in relatively large cradles of dark matter .
“ The standard model predicts the existence of such systems early on at the appropriate abundance , ” Loeb told New Scientist .
The team hopes future X - ray images will reveal whether the object is lit by a supermassive black hole that is devouring its surroundings , a process that emits X - rays .
Higher - resolution pictures could also discern whether the object is actually a pair of merging galaxies .
This might be accomplished with the Hubble Space Telescope ’s new Wide Field Camera 3 , which is set to be installed in May ( see Pimp my scope : Revamping Hubble ) .

The 10 previous movies have made almost $ 1.1 bn ( £ 743 m ) at the box office over the past 30 years .
The six television series have run to 726 episodes , broadcast in more than 100 countries and spawned a billion - dollar industry in merchandise , not to mention more than 100 award nominations .
Despite its huge success and cultural impact , the franchise has recently been in the sick bay .
The most recent TV series , Enterprise , was judged a failure , and the last film , Nemesis , was the worst performer at the box office , taking just $ 67 m worldwide in 2002 compared with the $ 150 m
First Contact – the best - performing film – took six years earlier .
Now a much - anticipated prequel to the original groundbreaking 1960s series will premiere at a gala performance in Australia on Tuesday .
It will introduce a young Captain James T Kirk , Spock and the entire crew which is brought together for the first time at Starfleet Academy .
They are mostly played by non-A-list actors , including Christopher Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock .
Simon Pegg appears as Scotty and Leonard Nimoy plays the older version of the pointy - eared logical Vulcan .

Until Tuesday , the plot of the film , called simply Star Trek , is a closely guarded secret .
British fans ' first chance to see the film – released globally in May – comes later this month when it premieres at a gala in aid of the Prince 's Trust charity .
Fans have had only two trailers to whet their appetites , showing modern computer - generated graphic techniques applied to the building of the Enterprise and the early years of the fictional world that has permeated popular culture since the starship first tackled the " final frontier " in 1966 .
Its success , according to Dr Simon Topping , who teaches American studies at the University of Plymouth , is down to its optimistic vision of the future .
" It comes out of the spirit of the 1960s , " he said .
" James T Kirk was based on JFK .
Star Trek was quite groundbreaking in terms of its racial mix and idealistic vision of humanity 's future . "
Paul Simpson , the editor of Star Trek magazine , added : " The core of it is Gene Roddenberry 's optimism .
It was created at a time when America was at war in Vietnam and there was a lot of civil unrest .
On the Enterprise you have a black woman in a position of authority , a mixed - race person in the form of Spock , an Asian , and none of this was mentioned or referred to .
That was very inspirational . "
Captains
Captain Christopher Pike
( Jeffrey Hunter )
The original pilot , rejected by the network as " too cerebral " , featured Jeffrey Hunter as captain of the Enterprise .
Pike was a more introspective captain than Kirk , having more in common with future Captain , Jean Luc Picard .
Alas , Hunter chose not to reprise the role .
Captain James T Kirk ( William Shatner )
Commanded the Starship Enterprise between 1966 and 1969 .
William Shatner 's cocky yet charismatic performance made Kirk a sci- fi icon .
Often dismissed as a ladies ' man , he was deeply caring , and often found himself isolated by the burden of command .
After decades of heroics , he was thrust into the future , where he died under a bridge ( rather than on one ) .
Captain Jean - Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart )
Took over the Enterprise for The Next Generation in 1987 .
Patrick Stewart 's years of experience with the RSC gave Picard a distinctive gravitas that continues to set him apart from his fellow captains .
Captain Benjamin Sisko ( Avery Brooks )
Commanded the space station Deep Space Nine from 1993 .
Arguably the most " real world " of Star Trek 's captains .
Avery Brooks 's distinctive voice and style gave Sisko a harder edge than the usual captain .
Captain Kathryn Janeway ( Kate Mulgrew )
The first female captain took over the USS Voyager in 1995 .
Probably best known for getting her ship lost for seven years and putting the Borg firmly in its place .
Captain Jonathan Archer ( Scott Bakula )
Captained the very first Enterprise in a prequel from 2001 .
Archer proved himself an able captain and a worthy predecessor to Kirk .
Nick Cook , producer and writer of the fan film Starship Intrepid
The Women
Lieutenant Uhura
( Nichelle Nichols )
An inspiration to a generation of black women .
Back in the 1960s , the Enterprise communications officer was a hugely popular character , but that was n't quite enough for Nichelle Nichols , who seriously considered leaving the show .
It took a pep talk from Martin Luther King to convince her not to walk out .
Number One / Nurse Chapel / Lwaxana Troi / Ship's Computer
( Majel Barrett - Roddenberry )
Mrs Gene Roddenberry has popped up ever since the first series .
Known in fan circles as the " First Lady of Trek " , Majel Barrett - Roddenberry brought sassiness and individuality to all of those roles .
Indeed , she was so well - regarded that the director J J Abrams asked her to reprise her role as the Enterprise computer for the new movie .
Sadly , she died shortly after recording her lines .
Seven of Nine
( Jeri Ryan )
Served on the USS Voyager .
Despite rumours that she was cast as the ex-Borg liberated from the Collective purely to attract a young male demographic , Jeri Ryan quickly proved popular .
Deanna Troi
( Marina Sirtis )
Counsellor on the Enterprise in The Next Generation .
Played by the dry , witty and British Marina Sirtis , Deanna Troi , the USS Enterprise 's half - alien therapist , is often blamed for crashing the ship in Generations , despite the fact that Data was actually flying it at the time .
Dr Beverly Crusher
( Gates McFadden )
Provided medical services in The Next Generation .
A trained choreographer , Gates McFadden brought an almost aristocratic grace to Jean - Luc Picard 's Enterprise .
Jadzia Dax
( Terry Farrell )
Lieutenant Commander on Deep Space Nine .
When Terry Farrell was cast as the science officer , the producers replaced the original latex forehead they 'd planned with a trail of leopard - like spots .
Nick Cook
Enemies
The Romulans
Devious to the core , they fought a war with the Federation without ever being seen .
Even when allies against the shape - changers that led the Dominion , they still kept a few tricks up their sleeve .
The Borg
Deadliest of threats to the Federation , these aliens do n't kill , they assimilate , making you part of their Collective .
Armed with nanotechnology and defences that adapt – quickly – to every threat , they look every bit as scary as they sound .
The Klingons
A warrior race to the core with a code of honour that includes no surrender and taking no prisoners , the Klingons are a powerful race , ruled by their emotions , who speak as they find .
If you can make friends with one , they 'll never disown you .
The Founders
Imagine a race that can look like anything , hampered only by the need to regenerate occasionally , and you have the ultimate foe – shape - changing creatures that do n't need to fight , they just pit friend against friend by pretending to be someone else .
The ultimate fifth column , backed by vicious Jem Hadar warriors and obsequious Vorta henchmen , they ruled an entire quadrant – and sought the Federation as part of their empire .
The Tholians
Seen only in a few episodes , these non-humanoid hermaphrodite creatures are fiercely protective of their empire and its secrets , whose look is so alien it 's almost painful .
With weaponry like energy cages that can capture and destroy spaceships , they 're a force to be reckoned with .
John Freeman
The Sidekicks
Mr Spock
The most famous one of all , the half - Vulcan half - human played by Leonard Nimoy has been a mainstay of the saga since 1966 .
Loyal to friends and the needs of the many over the one , Mr Spock 's logical mind helped to get Captain Kirk out of a sticky situation on many occasions .
Data
A sophisticated machine played by Brent Spiner in The Next Generation .
While Spock fought to be more logical , the android Data tried to be more human , with little success until he was fitted with an emotion chip he could turn on and off at will .
Before that , his child - like naivety caused the crew many problems .
T'Pol
Full Vulcan , played by Jolene Blalock in Enterprise .
The Vulcan aide of Captain Archer , an early commander of the Earth starship Enterprise .
Although totally Vulcan , even she succumbed to emotional turmoil after mixing with humans .
Riker
Picard 's human first officer in Next Generation , played by Jonathan Frakes .
This jazz - loving , amiable officer often tried , without success , to prevent his leader from stepping into danger , which perhaps explains why it took him so long to get his own starship , the USS Titan .
Chakotay
Second - in - command on the USS Voyager , played by Robert Beltran .
A rebel of native American extraction , Chakotay was often at odds with Captain Janeway in the Gamma Quadrant .

The 11th film
The plot is top secret , but this prequel takes a look at a young Kirk , played by Christopher Pine , and the original crew , who all come together for the first time at the Starfleet Academy .
Exporters of oil are saving more of their recent windfall than in previous price booms .
It 's hard to spot where the money is going
MANY American politicians and pundits explain their country 's enormous current - account deficit by pointing at the surpluses of Asian economies , especially China .
Undervalued currencies and unfairly cheap labour , they complain , have undermined America 's competitiveness .
In fact , looking at the world as a whole , the group of countries with the biggest current - account surpluses is no longer Asia but oil exporters , on which high prices have bestowed a gigantic windfall .
This year , oil exporters could haul in $ 700 billion from selling oil to foreigners .
This includes not only the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) but also Russia and Norway , the world 's second - and third - biggest earners ( see chart 1 below ) .
The International Monetary Fund estimates that oil exporters ' current - account surplus could reach $ 400 billion , more than four times as much as in 2002 .
In real terms , this is almost double their dollar surpluses in 1974 and 1980 , after the twin oil - price shocks of the 1970s — when Russia 's hard - currency exports were tiny .
The combined current - account surplus of China and other Asian emerging economies is put at only $ 188 billion this year ( see chart 2 below ) .
Relative to their economies , the oil producers ' current - account surpluses are far bigger than China's .
Whereas the IMF forecasts China 's surplus to be about 6 % of GDP this year , it predicts Saudi Arabia 's — not much different in money terms , at just over $ 100 billion this year — to be a whopping 32 % .
On average , Middle East oil exporters are expected to have an average surplus of 25 % of GDP .
Russia might record 13 % and Norway 18 % .
The rise in oil prices represents a big redistribution of income from those who buy oil to those who produce it .
Past periods of high prices have not lasted long , but this time oil producers ' extra revenues might prove to be more durable .
The futures market expects oil to stay expensive , even though the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate , an industry benchmark , recently slipped back to around $ 60 .
An enviable choice
What will happen to all these petrodollars ?
In essence , they can be either spent or saved .
Either way , a lot of the money can be recycled to oil - consuming economies and thus soften the impact on them of higher oil prices .
If oil exporters spend their bonanza , they import more from other countries and thus help to maintain global demand .
They are unlikely to spend the lot , however , because they tend to have higher saving rates than oil consumers : saving is around 40 % of GDP in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) and Kuwait , for instance .
A transfer of income from oil consumers to oil producers will therefore lead to a slowdown in global demand .
If they save their windfall , but invest it in global capital markets , they can finance oil importers ' bigger current - account deficits — in effect , lending the increase in fuel bills back to consumers .
And by increasing the demand for foreign financial assets , they can boost asset prices and push down bond yields in oil - importing countries .
This in turn can help to support economic activity in these economies .
Experience shows that oil booms can be a blessing or a curse for producing economies , depending on how wisely the extra revenue is spent or saved .
Too often , past windfalls have been celebrated with budgetary blow - outs , while the abundance of money has encouraged the postponement of economic reforms .
This time , however , oil exporters seem to be spending less , instead running larger external surpluses , repaying debts and building up assets .
In 1973 - 76 , 60 % of the increase in OPEC 's export revenues was spent on imports of goods and services .
In 1978 - 81 , the proportion rose to 75 % .
But the IMF estimates that only 40 % of the windfall in the three years to 2005 will have been spent .
In Russia , the government has taken the sensible step of setting up an oil stabilisation fund , which will be used to reduce its large foreign debt .
That said , the country has been more eager than members of OPEC to spend its extra money .
Around two - thirds of the increase in Russia 's export revenues since 2002 has gone on imports .
Some analysts also suspect that the government may yet raid the stabilisation fund for a spending spree .
The main concern , however , is that while the economy is flush with cash important structural reforms will be postponed .
In most of the Middle East , governments are being more cautious than usual with their extra revenue .
Mohsin Khan , the director of the IMF 's Middle East and Central Asia department , reckons that most governments in the region are budgeting on an oil price of only $ 30 - 40 a barrel for next year .
He estimates that governments have on average spent only 30 % of their extra oil revenue since 2002 , compared with 75 % in the 1970s and early 1980s , after previous steep climbs in the oil price .
Their average budget surplus has increased from 2 % of GDP in 2002 to nearly 15 % this year .
Lessons learned , perhaps too well
Oil - exporting governments seem to have taken to heart the lessons of the 1970s and 1980s .
First : do n't assume that oil prices will stay high for ever : in real terms , OPEC 's annual average oil revenue in 1981 - 2000 was only one - third of that in 1980 .
Second , do n't waste your windfall .
In previous booms , oil - producing countries gaily spent their petrodollars on lavish construction projects that required imported equipment and skilled foreign workers , but did little to create local jobs or to diversify economies .
In its recently published Regional Economic Outlook for the Middle East and Central Asia , the IMF advises governments to give priority to spending that will have a more lasting impact on growth and living standards .
In fact , believes Mr Khan , Middle East oil exporters have greater capacity to spend petrodollars at home than in the 1970s and 1980s , because their populations have been rising rapidly and because their infrastructure needs upgrading after many years of dwindling government revenues .
High unemployment means that there is social pressure for more spending on education and health , and for schemes to encourage private - sector employment .
Saudi Arabia , with one of the world 's fastest growing populations , has an unemployment rate of perhaps 20 % .
After nearly two decades of large budget deficits , the government 's debt was 100 % of GDP by 2000 .
Even this year , Saudi Arabia 's oil revenues per head will be about 70 % less in real terms than in 1980 , owing in part to a near tripling of its population .
It is using some of its extra money to repay debt , and the government has recently raised civil servants ' pay by 15 % — the first across - the - board increase in more than 20 years .
As well as spending more on health , education and infrastructure , the Middle East also needs to invest in oil production and refining capacity , to ease future supply shortages and so stabilise prices .
The International Energy Agency gave warning this week that oil prices will keep rising over the next two decades unless the region 's producers invest substantially more than they currently intend .
The IMF is also — unusually — encouraging these economies to be less thrifty .
Increased spending will not only , through diversification , allow Middle East countries to support their future economic development , but by boosting imports from the rest of the world it will also allow a more orderly narrowing of global imbalances .
This should help to cushion the world economy against the negative impact of rising oil prices .
So far most of the extra money is being saved , not spent , so where is it going ?
In the 1970s and early 1980s surplus petrodollars were largely deposited in banks in America or Europe .
These banks then lent too many of them to oil - importing developing countries , sowing the seeds of Latin America 's debt crisis .
This time it is proving much harder to track the money , but much more seems to be going into foreign shares and bonds rather than into western banks .
This may reflect a greater reluctance to hold deposits in foreign banks , because of the increase in official scrutiny after the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 .
Figures from the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) show that in 2002 and 2003 OPEC deposits with banks in the BIS reporting area actually fell .
Since last year , they have increased , but only modestly .
In contrast , Russian bank deposits abroad have risen much more sharply , as have the central bank 's official reserves , from $ 73 billion at the end of 2003 to $ 161 billion this October .
Russian investment , whether in bank deposits , London property or football clubs , is relatively conspicuous .
But even the experts at the IMF and the BIS are finding it hard to track Middle Eastern money , because a large chunk of the surplus is held not as official reserves , but as foreign investment by government oil stabilisation and investment funds and by national oil companies .
Official reserves of Middle East oil exporters ( including the total net foreign assets of the Saudi Arabia Monetary Agency ) have risen by around $ 70 billion this year , accounting for less than 30 % of their current - account surplus .
Follow the money
One puzzle is that , according to data published by America 's Treasury Department , OPEC members ' holdings of American government securities fell from $ 67 billion in January this year to $ 54 billion in August .
But Middle East purchases of American securities are probably being channelled through London .
Mr Khan reckons that although the bulk of OPEC 's surplus revenues has so far gone into dollar - denominated assets , those assets are increasingly held outside the United States .
A big chunk is also going into hedge funds and offshore financial institutions , which are unregulated and so impossible to track .
There has also been a flood of petrodollars into private equity abroad .
In January , Dubai International Capital took a $ 1 billion stake in DaimlerChrysler .
In March , it bought the Tussauds Group , a theme - park firm .
This month , DP World , Dubai 's state - owned ports operator , made a £ 3 billion ( $ 5.2 billion ) bid for P&O , Britain 's biggest ports and ferries group .
Many smaller private investors in the Middle East are keeping their money closer to home .
In the 1970s and early 1980s equity markets barely existed in the Gulf .
This time money has flooded into them .
Share prices in Saudi Arabia have increased fourfold since 2003 , and its bourse now has the largest capitalisation of any emerging stockmarket .
The average price / earnings ratio in the region is over 40 and recent share offerings have been oversubscribed several hundred times .
A spectacular property boom is under way in many places , notably Dubai , which has become a regional financial centre and leisure playground .
The world 's biggest shopping mall is being built there and Emirates , the state 's airline , has virtually underwritten the launch of the Airbus A380 , ordering no fewer than 45 of the super - jumbos , a third of the total ( see article ) .
Despite the lack of hard data , many economists are sure that a big dollop of petrodollars is going into American Treasury securities .
If so , the recycling of money via bond markets could have very different effects on the world economy from the bank - mediated recycling of previous oil booms .
If petrodollars not spent flow into global bond markets , they reduce bond yields and thus support consumer spending in oil - importing countries .
Buy from Europe , lend to America
Indeed , this leads Stephen Jen , an economist at Morgan Stanley , to challenge the popular notion that Europe is being hurt less by higher oil prices than America .
It is certainly true that Europe 's exports to oil producers have risen faster than America 's in recent years .
Europe 's share of OPEC 's imports has climbed to 32 % , compared with America 's 8 % .
A recent report by ABN Amrofinds that while America 's trade deficit with OPEC has grown markedly since 1999 , the European Union 's balance has barely changed ( see chart 3 ) .
On the other hand , around two - thirds of petrodollars are thought to have gone into dollar assets , pushing down American bond yields .
In addition , America 's economy is more sensitive to interest rates than that of the euro zone .
Mr Jen therefore suggests that America may have gained more from lower interest rates than the euro area has from higher exports , especially because OPEC still buys less than 5 % of the currency zone 's exports .
Although higher oil prices have increased America 's current - account deficit , Mr Jen reckons that it probably runs a balance - of - payments surplus in oil , with capital inflows from exporting countries exceeding its net oil import bill .
How might the flow of oil money affect the dollar ?
Because oil is traded in dollars , rising prices initially increase the demand for greenbacks .
But what happens next depends on whether oil producers buy dollar assets or swap their dollars for euros .
Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , the UAE and most other Gulf states peg their currencies to the dollar , which might suggest that , like Asian central banks , they will continue to favour dollars .
But unlike China 's export surpluses , petrodollars are mostly not managed within official reserves , but by oil stabilisation funds and so forth .
These are not subject to the same constraints as central banks to hold liquid assets and their aim is to maximise returns .
This means , says Mr Jen , that oil exporters ' assets are more footloose than those of Asian central banks .
So far , the bulk of petrodollars may have gone into relatively liquid dollar assets , helping to support the greenback this year .
But this money could flit if the dollar starts to slide again .
And there is lots of it : for example , the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority , with assets of maybe $ 250 billion , is one of the wealthiest players in global financial markets .
Russia 's central bank has reduced the share of dollars in its foreign reserves over the past couple of years , but it is still around 65 % .
The central bank has said that it wishes to hold more euros .
The correct solution to global imbalances is for America to save more and for surplus countries , including both the oil exporters and the Asians , to spend more
That leaves the dollar dangerously vulnerable .
But what about the exchange - rate policies of the oil exporters themselves ?
Most oil exporters peg their currencies to the dollar or resist appreciation through heavy intervention , in much the same way as China and other Asian countries have done .
So should America and others demand that oil exporters revalue their currencies , as they have called on the Asians to do ?
In fact , revaluation of oil exporters ' currencies would do little by itself to reduce America 's deficit ( nor , for that matter , would a dearer Chinese yuan ) .
The correct solution to global imbalances is for America to save more and for surplus countries , including both the oil exporters and the Asians , to spend more .
Nevertheless , Brad Setser of Roubini Global Economics , a research firm , argues that oil economies should not peg their currencies to the dollar in any case .
The currencies of commodity producers , he says , should follow commodity prices .
Instead , Middle East oil exporters ' currencies have tracked the dollar — mainly downwards — since 2002 , even as oil revenues have soared .
By raising the relative price of foreign goods , this has discouraged imports .
Equally perversely , economies were hurt in the late 1990s when the dollar rose at the same time as oil prices sank .
By pegging their currencies to the dollar , these economies have in effect had to adopt America 's monetary policy .
With interest rates too low , excess domestic liquidity has stoked inflation and asset prices .
The broad money supply of the Middle East oil exporters has grown by almost 24 % in each of the past two years and the average inflation rate has risen to almost 9 % this year .
To curb inflation , Gulf economies need more flexible exchange rates and monetary policies .
Russia officially operates a “ managed float ” for its exchange rate .
But the rouble 's rate against the dollar has been held relatively steady over the past couple of years by heavy intervention .
Consequent excess liquidity and a boom in domestic consumption have pushed inflation to 12 % .
It does not make sense for a country with a large current - account surplus to tie its currency to that of a country with a large deficit — such as America .
A fully floating exchange rate may not be desirable , because it may be too volatile , but more flexibility could help oil exporters to adjust better to fluctuations in commodity prices .
If oil prices remain high , so will oil exporters ' surpluses .
The IMF forecasts an average annual current - account surplus of $ 470 billion over the next five years ( assuming an average oil price of $ 59 a barrel ) .
The oil exporters will have to play a role in helping to reduce global imbalances .
Importing more and letting their currencies rise , as well as increasing government spending and liberalising their economies , would be steps in the right direction .
