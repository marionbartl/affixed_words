West Wing Obama 's Romantic Revolution
Barack Obama 's promises to heal the world were lapped up in Berlin on Thursday .
His speech was a masterpiece in the art of political magic -- and it was all coolly calculated .
Von Gabor Steingart
Yesterday we flagged the AP ’s Jennifer Loven ’s ‘ analysis ’ piece flogging the McCain / RNC spin on Obama ’s run to the center .
Well , as every crack communication operation knows , message repetition is the key to success .
And so today we have another ‘ analysis ’ piece , this time by the AP ’s Steven Hurst .
And it ’s practically the same piece .
Hurst and Loven actually both use the identical quote from RNC spinmeister Alex Conant .
Says Conant : “ ” There appears to be no issue that Barack Obama is not willing to reverse himself on for the sake of political expedience . ”
The identical quote appears in both pieces .
If the pieces were n’t bylined I think I might have assumed one was a rewrite of the other .
But they actually appear to be two completely original articles , just mouthing the identical McCain / RNC line .
It seems like we might have a case of persistent Solomonism at the AP , even though the master himself is now two jobs on .
This is really going to bear watching .
Sen. John Warner ( R - Va. ) asked Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman to look into what speed limit would provide optimum gasoline efficiency given current technology .
Warner : Reduce speed limit to save gas ?
WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
An influential Republican senator suggested Thursday that Congress might want to consider reimposing a national speed limit to save gasoline and possibly ease fuel prices .
Sen. John Warner ( R - Va. ) asked Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman to look into what speed limit would provide optimum gasoline efficiency given current technology .
He said he wants to know if the administration might support efforts in Congress to require a lower speed limit .

Congress in 1974 set a national 55 mph speed limit because of energy shortages caused by the Arab oil embargo .
The speed limit was repealed in 1995 when crude oil dipped to $ 17 a barrel and gasoline cost $ 1.10 a gallon .
As motorists headed on trips for this Fourth of July weekend , gasoline averaged $ 4.10 a gallon nationwide with oil hovering around $ 145 a barrel .
Warner cited studies that showed the 55 mph speed limit saved 167,000 barrels of oil a day , or 2 percent of the country 's highway fuel consumption , while avoiding up to 4,000 traffic deaths a year .
" Given the significant increase in the number of vehicles on America 's highway system from 1974 to 2008 , one could assume that the amount of fuel that could be conserved today is far greater , " Warner wrote Bodman .
Warner asked the department to determine at what speeds vehicles would be most fuel efficient , how much fuel savings would be achieved , and whether it would be reasonable to assume there would be a reduction in prices at the pump if the speed limit were lowered .
Energy Department spokeswoman Angela Hill said the department will review Warner 's letter but added , " If Congress is serious about addressing gasoline prices , they must take action on expanding domestic oil and natural gas production . "
The department 's
Web site says that fuel efficiency decreases rapidly when traveling faster than 60 mph .
Every additional 5 mph over that threshold is estimated to cost motorists " essentially an additional 30 cents per gallon in fuel costs , " Warner said in his letter , citing the DOE data .
No one suggests that the face - to - face meeting is becoming obsolete , or that it is time for a requiem for the road warrior .
Companies talk about using digital tools mainly as a way of making business travel more selective and more productive .
Still , the potential for digital displacement of business travel is substantial .
A report last month by the Global e-Sustainability Initiative , a group of technology companies , and the Climate Group , an environmental organization , estimated that up to 20 percent of business travel worldwide could be replaced by Web - based and conventional videoconferencing technology .
The most dedicated business travelers tend to be management consultants , investment bankers , accountants , lawyers and technology services consultants .
Much of their work has to be done in person with clients .
But these professionals are increasingly using online collaboration tools for work within their firms .
At I.B.M. , Michael Littlejohn , a work force and technology expert in the company ’s global services unit , said two years ago , he was on the road 13 to 15 days a month .
These days , he says , he travels 8 or 10 days a month .
“ But my time spent with clients is not less , ” he said .
“ To really understand a client ’s problems or to close a deal , you need face to face . ”
Corporate training and education is a field many companies are moving online , in part to trim travel costs .
Darryl Draper , the national manager of customer service training for Subaru of America , used to travel four days a week , nine months of the year , presenting educational programs at dealers nationwide .
Today , Ms. Draper rarely travels and nearly all of her training is done online .
Previously , Ms. Draper estimated , in six months she would reach about 220 people at a cost of $ 300 a person .
She said she now reaches 2,500 people every six months at a cost of 75 cents a person .
A range of companies offer the mainstream online communications and collaboration tools , including WebEx , Citrix , Microsoft , I.B.M. and others .
The most rarefied offering , though , is telepresence videoconferencing .
Today , it is an elite product supplied by a few companies , including Cisco , H.P. and Polycom .
The Patriot Missile Failure
On February 25 , 1991 , during the Gulf War , an American Patriot Missile battery in Dharan , Saudi Arabia , failed to track and intercept an incoming Iraqi Scud missile .
The Scud struck an American Army barracks , killing 28 soldiers and injuring around 100 other people .
A report of the General Accounting office , GAO / IMTEC - 92 - 26 , entitled Patriot Missile Defense : Software Problem Led to System Failure at Dhahran , Saudi Arabia reported on the cause of the failure .
It turns out that the cause was an inaccurate calculation of the time since boot due to computer arithmetic errors .
Specifically , the time in tenths of second as measured by the system 's internal clock was multiplied by 1/10 to produce the time in seconds .
This calculation was performed using a 24 bit fixed point register .
In particular , the value 1/10 , which has a non-terminating binary expansion , was chopped at 24 bits after the radix point .
The small chopping error , when multiplied by the large number giving the time in tenths of a second , led to a significant error .
Indeed , the Patriot battery had been up around 100 hours , and an easy calculation shows that the resulting time error due to the magnified chopping error was about 0.34 seconds .
( The number 1/10 equals 1/24+1/25+1/28+1/29+1/212+1/213+....
In other words , the binary expansion of 1/10 is 0.0001100110011001100110011001100 ....
Now the 24 bit register in the Patriot stored instead 0.00011001100110011001100 introducing an error of 0.0000000000000000000000011001100 ... binary , or about 0.000000095 decimal .
Multiplying by the number of tenths of a second in 100 hours gives 0.000000095×100×60×60×10=0.34 . )
A Scud travels at about 1,676 meters per second , and so travels more than half a kilometer in this time .
This was far enough that the incoming Scud was outside the " range gate " that the Patriot tracked .
Ironically , the fact that the bad time calculation had been improved in some parts of the code , but not all , contributed to the problem , since it meant that the inaccuracies did not cancel , as discussed here .
The following paragraph is excerpted from the GAO report .
The range gate 's prediction of where the Scud will next appear is a function of the Scud 's known velocity and the time of the last radar detection .
Velocity is a real number that can be expressed as a whole number and a decimal ( e.g. , 3750.2563 ... miles per hour ) .
Time is kept continuously by the system 's internal clock in tenths of seconds but is expressed as an integer or whole number ( e.g. , 32 , 33 , 34 ... ) .
The longer the system has been running , the larger the number representing time .
To predict where the Scud will next appear , both time and velocity must be expressed as real numbers .
Because of the way the Patriot computer performs its calculations and the fact that its registers are only 24 bits long , the conversion of time from an integer to a real number cannot be any more precise than 24 bits .
This conversion results in a loss of precision causing a less accurate time calculation .
The effect of this inaccuracy on the range gate 's calculation is directly proportional to the target 's velocity and the length of the the system has been running .
Consequently , performing the conversion after the Patriot has been running continuously for extended periods causes the range gate to shift away from the center of the target , making it less likely that the target , in this case a Scud , will be successfully intercepted .

Amy Winehouse Hospitalized after Crazy Behavior ( Photos )
has taken a page out of Britney Spears old play book .
The sick and struggling singer was rushed to a hospital after a crazy scene at her parents London home today .
Her father Mitch Winehouse draped a blanket in front of his daughter as she was transported via wheelchair to a waiting ambulance .
Police assisted him in shielding the troubled musician from the swarming paparazzi .
The celebrity was taken to University College hospital in NW London .
This comes one day after Winehouse threw herself to the floor sobbing while out and about on Sunday evening .
She also was photographed hitting a fence with her fist in an attempt to lash out at her body guards who were trying to pick her up off the ground .

5 Ways Nintendo Can Bring Metroid Back to 2D
Some established franchises just feel more natural in 2D .
Even though I love the Metroid Prime series , I still long for the polished 2D gameplay of the earlier installments .
Just for fun , I wanted to think about five different projects or ideas that would suit Nintendo just fine in filling the 2D drought that we have experienced since the GBA Metroids .
If you have more ideas , I ’d love to hear them
Metroid II Remake
Typically , the Gameboy platforms only received stripped - down ports or adaptations of games that appeared on the full home consoles .
So looking back , it is a bit of a surprise the Nintendo released a full sequel to such a popular franchise as Metroid .
I ’m also very surprised that Nintendo never even released a remake of Metroid II on the Gameboy Advance in the fashion of Metroid : Zero Mission .
Since Nintendo never got around to revisiting part II , DoctorM64 has been working on his our remake of the game .
His blog not only enough to get your drooling , but it ’s an interesting read from a game development standpoint .
If Nintendo does n’t have the initiative to take on this project themselves , they should at least hire Doctor M64 to do it for them .
Metroid : SR388
Another very compelling fan - developer project comes in the form of Metroid : SR388 .
Instead of re-creating an existing Metroid game , SR388 aims to be a completely original game that uses sprites and other graphics from Super Metroid and adds new weapons , special moves , and enemies .
The videos that have been released for this project have been nothing short of stunning and it will be interesting to see where it goes from here .
And much like my thoughts on the Metroid II project , Nintendo would be smart to embrace a fan project instead of sending cease and desist orders .
Super Metroid HD Remix
I ’m really looking forward to the release of Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD with hopes that it will be successful and start a trend of retro HD remakes , including some from Nintendo .
( I realize the Wii as it stands right now is only capable of 480 p , but I am willing to accept lower resolutions as well )
I think Super Metroid would be one of the best games for Nintendo to re-master first , and I ’m sure I ’m not the only one .
The beautiful mockup above from Alchemist Defined ( the artist behind the Sonic 2 HD mockup ) should serve as some nice inspiration .
Metroid Dread
Supposedly , Nintendo had a fresh 2D Metroid game in development for the DS as a follow - up to Metroid Fusion .
It was reportedly canceled , but very few people know for sure if Metroid Dread was ever really in development .
Whatever the truth holds , it does n’t change the fact that Metroid fans were anticipating it .
If Nintendo had Dread in the works , they should consider revisiting it .
If not , they should still think about keeping portable Metroid games in 2D instead of going the Metroid Prime route on the DS .
Classic Metroid DS Compilation
Even if Nintendo does n’t take the initiative to release a brand new or overhauled Metroid game , the very least they could do is release a nice compilation of their past 2D Metroid games for the DS .
Having the original Metroid ( and maybe the Zero Mission Remake ) , Metroid II , Super Metroid , and Metroid Fusion on one tiny cartridge would sell very easily at the $ 35 price range .
To me this seems like easy money for Nintendo and a dream come true for many Nintendo fans .

„ So put down that pipette , I got something that will set you free “
Like the video ?
Tell a friend about “ It ’s called epMotion “
If you ’ve been reading enough database - related forums , mailing lists , or blogs you have probably heard complains about MySQL being unable to handle more than 1,000,000 ( or select any other number ) rows by some of the users .
On the other hand , it is well known with customers like Google , Yahoo , LiveJournal , and Technorati , MySQL has installations with many billions of rows and delivers great performance .
What could be the reason ?
The reason is normally table design and understanding the inner works of MySQL .
If you design your data wisely , considering what MySQL can do and what it can ’t , you will get great performance .
And if not , you might become upset and become one of those bloggers .
Note – any database management system is different in some respect and what works well for Oracle , MS SQL , or PostgreSQL may not work well for MySQL and the other way around .
Even storage engines have very important differences which can affect performance dramatically .
The three main issues you should be concerned if you ’re dealing with very large data sets are Buffers , Indexes , and Joins .
Buffers
First thing you need to take into account is fact ; a situation when data fits in memory and when it does not are very different .
If you started from in - memory data size and expect gradual performance decrease as the database size grows , you may be surprised by a severe drop in performance .
This especially applies to index lookups and joins which we cover later .
As everything usually slows down a lot once it does not fit in memory , the good solution is to make sure your data fits in memory as well as possible .
This could be done by data partitioning ( i.e. old and rarely accessed data stored in different servers ) , multi-server partitioning to use combined memory , and a lot of other techniques which I should cover at some later time .
So you understand how much having data in memory changes things , here is a small example with numbers .
If you have your data fully in memory you could perform over 300,000 random lookups per second from a single thread , depending on system and table structure .
Now if your data is fully on disk ( both data and index ) you would need 2 +
IOs to retrieve the row – which means you get about 100 rows / sec .
Note : multiple drives do not really help a lot as we ’re speaking about single thread / query here .
So the difference is 3,000 x !
It might be a bit too much as there are few completely uncached workloads , but 100 + times difference is quite frequent .
Indexes
What everyone knows about indexes is the fact that they are good to speed up access to the database .
Some people would also remember if indexes are helpful or not depends on index selectivity – how large the proportion of rows match to a particular index value or range .
What is often forgotten about is , depending on if the workload is cached or not , different selectivity might show benefit from using indexes .
In fact , even MySQL optimizer currently does not take it into account .
For in - memory workload indexes , access might be faster even if 50 % of rows are accessed , while for disk IO bound access we might be better off doing a full table scan even if only a few percent or rows are accessed .
Let ’s do some computations again .
Consider a table which has 100 - byte rows .
With decent SCSI drives , we can get 100 MB / sec read speed which gives us about 1,000,000 rows per second for fully sequential access , with jam - packed rows – quite possibly a scenario for MyISAM tables .
Now if we take the same hard drive for a fully IO - bound workload , it will be able to provide just 100 row lookups by index per second .
The difference is 10,000 times for our worst - case scenario .
It might be not that bad in practice , but again , it is not hard to reach 100 times difference .
Here is a little illustration I ’ve created of the table with over 30 millions of rows .
“ val ” column in this table has 10000 distinct value , so range 1..100 selects about 1 % of the table .
The times for full table scan vs range scan by index :
mysql > select count ( pad ) from large ; +------------+ | count ( pad ) |
+------------+
| 31457280 | +------------+ 1 row in set ( 4 min 58.63 sec ) mysql > select count ( pad ) from large where val between 1 and 100 ; +------------+ | count ( pad ) |
+------------+ | 314008 | +------------+ 1 row in set ( 29 min 53.01 sec ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 mysql > select count ( pad ) from large ; + -- -- -- -- -- -- + | count ( pad ) | + -- -- -- -- -- -- + | 31457280 | + -- -- -- -- -- -- + 1 row in set ( 4 min 58.63 sec ) mysql > select count ( pad ) from large where val between 1 and 100 ; + -- -- -- -- -- -- + | count ( pad ) | + -- -- -- -- -- -- + | 314008 | + -- -- -- -- -- -- + 1 row in set ( 29 min 53.01 sec )
Also , remember – not all indexes are created equal .
Some indexes may be placed in a sorted way or pages placed in random places – this may affect index scan / range scan speed dramatically .
The rows referenced by indexes also could be located sequentially or require random IO if index ranges are scanned .
There are also clustered keys in Innodb which combine index access with data access , saving you IO for completely disk - bound workloads .
There are certain optimizations in the works which would improve the performance of index accesses / index scans .
For example , retrieving index values first and then accessing rows in sorted order can be a lot of help for big scans .
This will reduce the gap , but I doubt it will be closed .
Joins
Joins are used to compose the complex object which was previously normalized to several tables , or perform complex queries finding relationships between objects .
Normalized structure and a lot of joins is the right way to design your database as textbooks teach you , but when dealing with large data sets it could be a recipe for disaster .
The problem is not the data size ; normalized data normally becomes smaller , but a dramatically increased number of index lookups could be random accesses .
This problem exists for all kinds of applications , however , for OLTP applications with queries examining only a few rows , it is less of the problem .
Data retrieval , search , DSS , business intelligence applications which need to analyze a lot of rows run aggregates , etc. , is when this problem is the most dramatic .
Some joins are also better than others .
For example , if you have a star join with dimension tables being small , it would not slow things down too much .
On the other hand , a join of a few large tables , which is completely disk - bound , can be very slow .
One of the reasons elevating this problem in MySQL is a lack of advanced join methods at this point ( the work is on a way ) – MySQL ca n’t do hash join or sort - merge join – it only can do nested loops method , which requires a lot of index lookups which may be random .
Here is a good example .
As we saw my 30 mil rows ( 12GB ) table was scanned in less than 5 minutes .
Now if we would do eq join of the table to other 30 mil rows table , it will be completely random .
We ’ll need to perform 30 million random row reads , which gives us 300,000 seconds with 100 rows / sec rate .
So we would go from 5 minutes to almost 4 days if we need to do the join .
Some people assume join would be close to two full table scans ( as 60 mil of rows need to be read ) – but this is way wrong .
Do not take me as going against normalization or joins .
It is a great principle and should be used when possible .
Just do not forget about the performance implications designed into the system and do not expect joins to be free .
Finally I should mention one more MySQL limitation which requires you to be extra careful working with large data sets .
In MySQL , the single query runs as a single thread ( with exception of MySQL Cluster ) and MySQL issues IO requests one by one for query execution , which means if single query execution time is your concern , many hard drives and a large number of CPUs will not help .
Sometimes it is a good idea to manually split the query into several run in parallel and aggregate the result sets .
So if you ’re dealing with large data sets and complex queries here are few tips .
Try to fit data set you ’re working with in memory – Processing in memory is so much faster and you have a whole bunch of problems solved just doing so .
Use multiple servers to host portions of the data set .
Store a portion of data you ’re going to work with in temporary tables etc .
Prefer full table scans to index accesses –
For large data sets , full table scans are often faster than range scans and other types of index lookups .
Even if you look at 1 % fr rows or less , a full table scan may be faster .
Avoid joins to large tables Joining of large data sets using nested loops is very expensive .
Try to avoid it .
Joins to smaller tables is OK but you might want to preload them to memory before join so there is no random IO needed to populate the caches .
With proper application architecture and table design , you can build applications operating with very large data sets based on MySQL .

THE HAGUE , Netherlands ( CNN ) --
The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has filed genocide charges against Sudan 's president for a five - year campaign of violence in Darfur .
The U.N. estimates 2.5 million have been forced from their homes in Darfur .
Luis Moreno - Ocampo on Monday urged a three - judge panel to issue an arrest warrant for President Omar Hassan al - Bashir to prevent the deaths of about 2.5 million people forced from their homes in the war - torn region of Darfur and who are still under attack from government - backed Janjaweed militia .
The five charges against al - Bashir include masterminding attempts to wipe out African tribes in the war - torn region with a campaign of murder , rape and deportation .
In an exclusive interview with CNN's Nic Robertson in the Dutch city of The Hague , the prosecutor said : " After three years I have strong evidence that al - Bashir is committing a genocide .
I cannot be blackmailed , I can not yield .
Silence never helped the victims .
Silence helped the perpetrators .
The prosecutor should not be silent . "
Read a transcript of the interview
The judges must now decide whether to issue the warrant , although they have approved all 11 of Moreno - Ocampo 's previous submissions to the court .
The indictment against al - Bashir marks the first time prosecutors at the world 's only permanent war crimes tribunal have issued charges against a sitting head of state .
Watch as ICC prosecutor targets al - Bashir »
At a news conference Monday in Khartoum , Sudanese Vice President Ali Osman Mohammed Taha rejected the authority of the ICC , saying Sudan was not a signatory to the court 's creation .
" Hence there is no legal obligation or power over Sudan , whether Sudanese organizations or citizens , " he said .
Taha also called the charges an attempt to " paralyze " his country .
And Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad , Sudan 's ambassador to the United Nations , said his government would respond through legal , political and " other means . "
" The limit is the sky for our retaliation , " he said .
He said the country is not mobilizing its military , but has been organizing demonstrations in support of al - Bashir .
The United Nations said Monday it is evacuating non-essential staff from Darfur " due to the recent deteriorating security situation , " but the joint African Union - U.N. peacekeeping mission in Darfur ( UNAMID ) vowed to maintain its operations .
In his request , Moreno - Ocampo says there are reasonable grounds to believe al - Bashir bears criminal responsibility for five counts of genocide , two counts of crimes against humanity , and two counts of war crimes .
The alleged crimes stem from a brutal counter - insurgency campaign the Sudanese government conducted after rebels began an uprising in Sudan 's western Darfur region in 2003 .
The United States and much of the world has already characterized the campaign as genocide .
The authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur , killing , torturing and raping residents there , according to the United Nations , western governments and human rights organizations .
The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels draw strength .
About 300,000 people have died in Darfur , the United Nations estimates , and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes .
Watch a tour of Darfur 's deserted Northern Corridor »
But Mohamad said the prosecutor 's move could hurt the United Nations , which will still have to deal with Sudan 's government on issues related to Darfur and in the peace process in the country 's south , where a long - running civil war ended in 2005 .
" It will put the chief negotiator in a very awkward situation .
How is he going to deal with an indicted president , " the ambassador said .
" How is the secretary - general going to do business regarding UNAMID with an indicted president ? "
Moreno - Ocampo says al - Bashir targeted three ethnic groups living in the region -- including the Fur group , for whom Darfur is named -- solely on account of their ethnicity .
Al - Bashir bears responsibility , Moreno - Ocampo says , because he sat at the apex of the government .
" For such crimes to be committed over a period of five years and throughout Darfur , al - Bashir had to mobilize and keep mobilized the whole state apparatus ; he had to control and direct perpetrators ; and he had to rely on a genocidal plan , " Moreno - Ocampo wrote as background for arrest warrant request .
In Khartoum , a crowd of about 2,000 people greeted al - Bashir , who seized power in a 1989 coup , when he arrived for an emergency meeting of his Cabinet Sunday to discuss the charges .
When he saw the crowd , al - Bashir climbed onto a pickup truck and pumped his fist in the air , whipping the group into a frenzy .
Some held signs saying , " You are joking ... Ocamp - who ? " and " Death to America . "
A high - ranking ambassador at the presidential palace called the possible prosecution stupid and malicious , and warned that the Sudanese people would see it as proof of a larger conspiracy against the country .
Watch why Sudan 's leader has support in China »
In 2005 , the Security Council cleared the way for possible war crimes prosecutions related to Darfur by the ICC , a permanent tribunal set up to handle prosecutions related to genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes .
The court is based on a treaty signed by 106 nations -- excluding Sudan .
The attacks in Darfur over the past five years have followed a common pattern , according to Moreno - Ocampo .
Members of Sudan 's armed forces , often acting together with the militias and under al - Bashir 's command , singled out villages and towns inhabited by tribal groups .
Troops and militia members shot and killed civilians , and sometimes the Sudanese air force was called in to bomb villages and towns in support of the ground forces , the prosecutor 's evidence says .
Residents who fled were often chased and attacked or left to fend for themselves in the wilderness , the evidence says .
The attacks , it says , undermined the ability of the targeted groups to survive in Darfur .
The destruction of their homes scattered entire communities , and the pervasive rape and sexual violence against girls and women -- who are often targeted when they are out collecting firewood or water -- has torn families apart .
Watch how UNICEF is trying to prevent rape in Darfur »
" They are raping women , raping girls , raping in groups -- raping to destroy the communities , " Moreno - Ocampo told CNN .
" Rape is a tool in the genocide -- the most important tool today . "
The ICC has already indicted two men for Darfur crimes -- Ahmad Harun , Sudan 's former minister of the interior who is now in charge of humanitarian affairs for the Sudanese government and militia leader Ali Kushayb -- but neither has been brought to justice .
Once the ICC indicts someone , authorities in that person 's native country -- or the country in which the indicted person is located -- have the power to detain the indicted person for trial at the Hague .
Kushayb and Harun both remain in Sudan where they enjoy the protection of al - Bashir , Moreno - Ocampo said .
Since they have not been arrested , the prosecutor says , it is unlikely al - Bashir will be -- and he says it will probably take a U.N. Security Council resolution for al - Bashir to be brought to justice .
Senior Sudanese government leaders have previously told CNN that reports of atrocities in Darfur are exaggerated .
" Yes , there has been a war and some people have died , but it 's not like what has been reflected in the media , " Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahmoud Hamid said last month .
CNN 's Nic Robertson contributed to this report .

â€ œWeâ€™re at a transition point where fundamental decisions need to be made by societies about how this basic human need â€ “ water â€ “ is going to be provided , â€ says Christopher Kilian , clean - water program director for the Boston - based Conservation Law Foundation .
â€œThe profit motive and basic human need [ for water ] are just inherently in conflict.â€ 
Will â€œpeak waterâ€ displace â€œpeak oilâ€ as the central resource question ?
Some see such a scenario rising .
â€ œWhatâ€™s different now is that itâ€™s increasingly obvious that weâ€ ™re running up against limits to new [ fresh water ] supplies , â€ says Peter Gleick , a watÂ­Â­Â­er expert and president of the Pacific InÂ­Â­Â­stiÂ­Â­tute for Studies in Development , EnÂ­Â­viÂ­Â­Â­ronÂ­Â­ment , and SecÂ­Â­urÂ­Â­ity , a nonpartisan think tank in OakÂ­land , Calif .

Raul Castro warned of hard economic times ahead Cuban President Raul Castro has warned that Cubans must be prepared for the consequences of the current global economic crisis .
He said that developing countries had already felt the effects of rising fuel and food prices .
The speech was part of the celebrations marking the 55th anniversary of the beginning of the communist revolution .
President Castro had been expected to announce new economic policies , but in the event did not do so .
He has already introduced significant changes in the country since succeeding his ailing brother , Fidel , in February .
The president recently announced a move to allow some private farming and relaxed limits on mobile phones and computers .
' Excessive prohibitions '
Speaking for 48 minutes , President Castro warned the crowds that the economic austerity suffered in recent years would not be helped by increases in world food prices .
" The revolution has done and will continue to do whatever is possible to continue to advance and reduce to the bare minimum the inevitable consequences of international crises to our people , " he said .
" But we must explain to our people the difficulties and thus prepare them to deal with them . "
Raul Castro also had a message for Cuba 's ideological enemy , the United States .
" We shall continue paying special attention to defence , regardless of the results of the next presidential elections in the United States , " said the president .
Since taking over from his elder brother , Raul Castro has made available more unused state land to private farmers , eased restrictions on mobile phones for ordinary citizens and allowed some workers to seek legal titles for their homes .
RAUL CASTRO'S REFORMS 2008 February - signs two human rights agreements at the UN March - lifts ban on Cubans staying in tourist hotels May - lifts ban on private ownership of mobile phones June - announces plans to abandon salary equality July - decrees state - controlled farm land can be leased to private farmers and co-operatives
He has also signed UN human rights accords and announced that workers can earn productivity bonuses , doing away with the egalitarian concept that everyone must earn the same .
Mr Castro delivered his speech to a crowd of some 10,000 people at the parade grounds of Santiago 's historic Moncada army barracks , where he and his brother led a fruitless rebel assault exactly 55 years ago .
Both men were jailed for the attack , but did of course eventually go on to seize power from the then Cuban leader , Fulgencio Batista , on 1 January 1959 .
" When we attacked the Moncada , none of us dreamed of being here today , " the president told the crowd .
The Rebellion Day celebrations two years ago were the last public event at which Fidel Castro was seen before he underwent emergency intestinal surgery .
He has since appeared only in official videos and photographs .

Wondering what this is about ?
Well , Michelle Schwartz has started a delicious subvertising project , in reaction to a series of ads for Canadian Club Whisky .
The whisky campaign is called “ Damn Right Your Dad Drank It ” , and show a variety of white men “ doing manly things ” , as Michelle Schwartz puts it :
There are several of these ads .
One reads “ Your Dad Was n’t A Metrosexual , ” another reads “ Your Mom Was n’t Your Dad ’s First . ”
The one that really annoyed me was “ Your Dad Had Groupies . ”
Michelle goes on to point out that it ’s not just that the ads are exclusively aimed at white men ( fuck anyone else who might drink their whisky ) , but the tactics used :
Basically , they are appealing to men who miss the days ( whether or not they were born yet ) of grabbing the asses of their secretaries , playing a few rounds at the all - white private golf club , and then going home to their wives , the happy homemakers who would mix them drinks , cook them dinner , and wait on them hand and foot .
None of this women ’s lib , civil rights , limp - wristed liberal bullshit that men are expected to follow these days .
No , let ’s go back to the days of rampant sexual harassment , before women could expect to be seen as equals and before the gays turned all those masculine men into pansies with waxed eyebrows .
Let ’s return to the days when men were men .
Please .
Anyway , Michelle had a brilliant idea to do something about it – composing alternative posters , and inviting everyone else to do likewise .
You can see some of the results above , such as “ Your Mom Had Groupies ” , “ Your Mom Was a Pilot ” – click through to her blog or Racialicious for more , including “ Your Dad Was a Real Man ” ( showing a man playing affectionately with a baby ) and a different take on “ Your Mom Was n’t Your Dad ’s First ” .
Basically the ads strip away all the heteronormative , white - as - the - standard , gender roles claptrap .
She has mocked up a template so you can make your own .
Brilliant .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The price of retail gasoline could fall by half , to around $ 2 a gallon , within 30 days of passage of a law to limit speculation in energy - futures markets , four energy analysts told Congress on Monday .
Testifying to the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Michael Masters of Masters Capital Management said that the price of oil would quickly drop closer to its marginal cost of around $ 65 to $ 75 a barrel , about half the current $ 135 .
Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer & Co. , Edward Krapels of Energy Security Analysis and Roger Diwan of PFC Energy Consultants agreed with Masters ' assessment at a hearing on proposed legislation to limit speculation in futures markets .
Krapels said that it would n't even take 30 days to drive prices lower , as fund managers quickly liquidated their positions in futures markets .
" Record oil prices are inflated by speculation and not justified by market fundamentals , " according to Gheit .
" Based on supply and demand fundamentals , crude - oil prices should not be above $ 60 per barrel . "
Futures trading in London has not been a major factor in rising oil prices , testified Sir Bob Reid , chairman of the Chairman of London - based ICE Futures Europe .
Rising prices are largely a function of fundamental supply and demand , not manipulation or speculation , he said .
" Energy speculation has become a growth industry and it is time for the government to intervene , " said Rep. John Dingell , D - Mich. , chairman of the full committee .
" We need to consider a full range of options to counter this rapacious speculation . "
It was Dingell 's strongest statement yet on the role of speculators .
“ There has been much discussion recently about how big a role speculators have been playing in the sharp rise in energy prices , though no consensus has emerged on this point . ”
Dingell introduced a bill on June 11 that would ask the Energy Department to gather the facts on energy prices , including the role played by speculators .
See full story .
There are two kinds of speculators in the futures markets , Masters said .
Traditional speculators are those who need to hedge because they actually take physical possession of the commodities .
Index speculators , on the other hand , are merely allocating a portion of their portfolio to commodity futures .
Index speculation damages price - discovery mechanisms provided by futures markets , Masters added
The committee will likely consider legislation that would rein in index speculation by imposing higher - margin requirements ; setting position limits for speculators ; requiring more disclosure of positions ; and preventing pension funds and investment banks from owning commodities .
Both major presidential candidates have supported closing loopholes that encourage speculation in the energy markets .
Read more on Election Blog .
However , other witnesses said that pure speculators have had little impact on energy prices , which have doubled in the past year to about $ 135 per barrel .
Both Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman have dismissed the impact of speculators on prices paid by consumers .
Speculators now account for about 70 % of all benchmark crude trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , up from 37 % in 2000 , said Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Mich. , chairman of the investigations subcommittee .
Stupak introduced a bill on Friday that would limit index speculation .
There has been much discussion recently about how big a role speculators have been playing in the sharp rise in energy prices , though no consensus has emerged on this point .
Congress , however , has grown increasingly concerned over speculative investors ' role in the energy market in comparison with those buying futures contracts to hedge against risk from price changes .
Lawmakers are expected to consider legislation to set strict limits -- or in some cases , an outright ban -- on speculative trading in energy futures in some markets .
Dingell is looking into any legal loopholes that may have contributed to speculation in energy markets .
In 1991 , according to documents provided by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to the committee 's investigators , the agency authorized the first exemption from position limits for swap dealers with no physical commodity exposure .
This began what Dingell said was " a process that has enabled investment banks to accumulate enormous positions in commodity markets . "
Is Congress barking up the wrong tree ?
Neal Ryan , manager at Ryan Oil & Gas Partners , said that if Congress develops regulations to cut back speculative trading , speculation will just find a new home .
" Speculation is the root of capitalism , " he said .
" If the speculation is forced out of the U.S. exchanges , it 'll simply show up on other exchanges that are OTC like the ICE , or new exchanges will pop up to allow for the spec trades to continue functioning . "
Ryan said he does see a reason for Congress to look at eliminating aspects such as allowing West Texas intermediate crude oil futures to trade on foreign markets and the " Enron loophole , " but " these exchanges are currently functioning as they are supposed to in a free marketplace . "
The creation of a comprehensive U.S. energy policy that tackles issues of increasing domestic supply and reining in consumer demand via conservation should be Congress ' focus , Ryan said .
" Instead we 're on bended knee begging the Saudis to put more oil on the market and talking about shutting down spec trades . "
Indium , gallium and hafnium are some of the least - known elements on the periodic table , but New Scientist warns that reserves of these low - profile minerals and others like them might soon be exhausted thanks to the demand for flat screens and other high - tech goods .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Shares of Washington Mutual Inc. leapt nearly 23 % Monday on news the troubled thrift is in negotiations to receive a $ 5 billion cash infusion from private - equity firm TPG and a consortium of other investors .
The deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and cited unnamed sources close to the negotiations .
Shares of Seattle - based WaMu WM , - 0.55 % rallied midday , climbing as high as $ 12.44 .
The company 's shareholders have seen their holdings lose nearly 75 % of their value , and management recently was worried it would not be able to meet capital requirements .
Moreover , the cost of protecting WaMu 's debt with credit - default swaps was reportedly down nearly 20 % in early trading .
The funding from the TPG - led group would be structured as an offering of both common and preferred shares of WaMu , the Journal reported .
In addition , TPG would receive a seat on the company 's 14 - director board .
Sources also said that unlike last month 's 11th - hour bailout of Bear Stearns Cos. BSC , - 10.00 % , government regulators were not directly involved in playing matchmaker for the parties in the prospective WaMu deal , according to the Journal .
WaMu declined to comment to MarketWatch on Monday .
TPG , formerly known as Texas - Pacific Group , is one of the largest players in private equity and has holdings in companies as varied as MGM studios , telecom carrier Alltel Corp. and casino operator Harrah's .
The nation 's largest savings and loan , WaMu has been steadily losing value after a year of fallout in the housing market greatly affected its earlier investments in subprime mortgages .
The company posted a $ 1.87 billion in loan - related losses in the fourth quarter alone .
An investment on the scale of $ 5 billion would significantly dilute the holdings of current shareholders in WaMu , but it could be viewed as a favorable option for saving the bank from becoming a potential takeover target .
The Journal report also cited an unnamed source who said that executives from blue - chip giant J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM , - 0.84 % had been in talks with WaMu about acquiring the bank but that those negotiations faltered last week .
The bank had been struggling in recent months to maintain its capital reserves , cutting more than 3,000 jobs and slashing its dividend by 72 % , to 15 cents a share .
It also sold nearly $ 4 billion in preferred stock in an attempt to build up a capital cushion .
Paul Miller , analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey , warned in a research note in March that many marquee - name banks are experiencing growing ratios in terms of their non-performing assets to risk - based capital .
Miller said WaMu 's ratio was currently at 21.8 % , one of only a handful of institutions with a level that high .
In comparison , troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC , currently sits at 29.2 % .
WaMu is holding a shareholder meeting April 15 .
After much hacking , and just in time for OSCON , I ’m delighted to announce the release of Devel : : NYTProf version 2 .
A powerful , efficient , feature - rich perl source code profiler .
“ If NYTProf 1 is a Toyota , then 2.0 is a Cadillac ”
— Adam Kaplan , author of NYTProf 1 .
The Short Story
( I ’ve written up the long story , for the record , in another post . )
Adam forked Devel : : FastProf ( the best statement - level profiler at the time ) , added a test harness and tests , made some internal improvements , and grafted on an html report derived from Devel : : Cover .
The resulting Devel : : NYTProf v1 was a big hit .
Meanwhile I ’d been working on Devel : : FastProf , contributing some interesting new profiling features , but it had no test harness and no html reports .
When Adam released NYTProf I switched .
Attracted not so much by the html report as by the test harness .
( A lesson to anyone wanting to attract developers to an open source project . )
I started out by adding in the same new features I ’d been adding to FastProf , albeit with more polish and tests .
And then I got carried away …
“ Holy shit !
That is amazing . ”
— Andy Lester , after using a recent development version .
Example Screen Shots
As an example I ’ve used NYTProf to profile perlcritic 1.088 running on its own source code .
$ cd Perl - Critic - 1.088 $ perl -d:NYTProf - S perlcritic .
$ nytprofhtml $ open nytprof/index.html
The first image is the main index page , showing the top few subroutines and the start of the list of all source files .
Each source file has links to separate line - level , block - level , and sub - level reports ( though I hope to merge them in future ) .
Clicking on a subroutine name takes you to the line - level report for the file it ’s defined in and positions you at the subroutine definition .
( The color coding is based on Median Absolute Deviation of all the values in the column , same as in NYProf v1 . )
Here ’s the all_perl_files ( ) subroutine , for example :
The colored numbers show the number of statements executed , the total time taken , and the average .
The statement times are always exclusive times .
Time actually spent on that statement , the expressions and any built - in functions it uses .
It does n’t include any time spent executing statements elsewhere in subroutines called by it .
In NYTProf subroutine timings are inclusive and statement timings are exclusive .
Where did you come from and where are you going ?
Notice the grey text .
On lines that define a subroutine NYTProf now adds ‘ comments ’ giving the total number of times the sub was called , the inclusive time spent in that sub , and the average .
Then it adds a break - down of the same details for every location that called the subroutine .
Here ’s a better example of that :
On lines that call subroutines NYTProf now adds ‘ comments ’ giving the name of the actual subroutines called ( resolving code refs to subroutine names , including the class that handled a method call ) .
It also tells you how many calls were made and how much time was spent in that subroutine for calls made from that line .
Here ’s an example :
When you mouse - over the grey text it turns black and you can click on embedded links to take you to the callers or callees .
So with a few clicks you can run up and down the call stack exploring where the time is being spent and where the hot spots are being called from .
The ability to explore the code so easily , guided by these performance signposts is incredibly useful .
Rolling up for a higher level view
Sometimes per-statement timing can overwhelming .
In large subroutines it becomes “ hard to see the wood for the trees ” .
So , for the first time in any Perl profiler , NYTProf now provides a block - level view of the timing data :
What ’s happening here is that NYTProf is taking the same time measurements per statement , but instead of accumulating the time against the line the statement is on , it accumulates it against the line of the first statement in the enclosing block .
( The actual line it accumulates it against is n’t ideal in some cases .
I ’m hoping to improve that soon . )
This report is a little more tricky to read but can be very useful , especially in large subroutines .
( I hope to improve the readability with some css : hover magic in future . )
The subroutine - level report is very similar except that all the timings are accumulated against line of the first statement in the subroutine .
Have a Look
Back in June I gave a talk at the Irish Open Source Technology conference where I showed the first version of the annotated html report ( which I ’d been hacking on till 3 am the night before while struggling with a cold – presentations are great motivators ) .
You can see the 15 minute video here or here ) .
Explore for yourself
I ’ve uploaded the full set of reports for you to explore here .
Take a look .
Let me know what you think .
The digital revolution has forced law enforcement and intelligence agencies to monitor threats such as cyber attacks and stolen computer data using technology that makes most Cold War–era equipment look like it was made from spare parts in someone 's garage .
But lest these once - innovative tools be forgotten , the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Diplomatic Security 's Countermeasures Directorate today unveiled a public exhibit , entitled " Listening In : Electronic Eavesdropping in the Cold War Era , " honoring spy gear used by ( and against ) the U.S. from the dawn to the end of the Cold War .
View Slide Show
From the end of World War II to East Berlin 's opening in 1989 , foreign agents penetrated a number of U.S. embassies with listening devices , primarily wired microphones and radio transmitters .
To retaliate , the U.S. formed teams of specially trained engineers to hunt for bugs using specialized equipment of their own .
In May 1960 , for example , U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge , Jr. showed the United Nations Security Council a listening device found inside a wood carving of the Great Seal of the United States that presented to U.S. Embassy Moscow by the Soviet Union in 1945 .
Countermeasures Directorate unearthed most of these treasures in its regional centers and satellite offices worldwide ; some of the cool gadgets would have ended up on scrap heaps were it not for this permanent exhibit , located in the lobby of a State Department building in Rosslyn , Va .
The State Department says it has a lot more devices to add to its trophy case — once they are de-classified .
Interested ?
While the new exhibit was originally created for viewing only by internal State Department employees , the lobby in which these gadgets are located is publicly accessible , which means they can be viewed by Cold War buffs and other curious onlookers during normal business hours .

Not in My Backyard , Say an Increasing Number of Germans

While Lehman Brothers ( LEH ) itself is still a punching bag , their oil analysts never followed Goldman 's Arjun Murti with $ 150 oil predictions like the rest of Wall Street .
Instead , they 've expressed shock at the extent of the price spike and stuck with their prediction that prices would soon recede .
Now , with oil almost 20 % off its recent record - highs , Lehman Brothers chief energy economist , Edward Morse , reiterates his bear case .
He sees oil going to $ 90 by early 2009 :
The market ’s expectations have changed very rapidly and unexpectedly ... The market went out of control on the upside .
But market participants realized there was much more demand destruction than had been thought even a month ago , that inventories are building up quickly , and that , in fact , more supplies are coming onto the market ...
The deteriorating demand picture reinforces our belief that oil prices are approaching a tipping point .
The current dip seems to have emboldened bears .
Chakib Khelil , President of OPEC , claimed oil would be as low as $ 70 / barrel if not for for the weak dollar and Iran 's threats and posturing .

MODEL STATUTE [ 2018 ]
Draft Bills [ UK Parliament ]
https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/draft/
Draft Bills are issued for consultation before being formally introduced to Parliament .
This allows proposed changes to be made before the Bill 's formal introduction .
Almost all Draft Bills are Government Bills .
Government departments produce Draft Bills and issue them to interested parties .
MPs and Lords can also consider them in committees .
Why are there Draft Bills ?
The practice of publishing Draft Bills has become more frequent in recent years .
It allows examination and amendments to be made to texts and made more easily - before their formal introduction to Parliament as a Bill proper .
Parliament 's role in Draft Bills
Most Draft Bills are examined either by select committees in the Commons or Lords or by a joint committee of both Houses .
Draft Bills considered by Parliament are available on this website .
Government 's role in Draft Bills
The consultation process on Draft Bills may involve the government issuing a paper for public discussion and response .
The best - known examples of this are White and Green Papers .
Although not formal definitions , Green Papers usually put forward ideas for future government policy that are open to public discussion and consultation .
White Papers generally state more definite intentions for government policy .

( hereinafter collectively referred to as “ new physics torture weapons ” ) .
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community , and in particular Article 133 thereof ,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission ,
Whereas :
(1) Pursuant to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms constitutes one of the principles common to the Member States .
In view of this , the Community resolved in 1995 to make respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms an essential element of its relations with third countries .
(2) Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms all lay down an unconditional , comprehensive prohibition on torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .
Other provisions , in particular the United Nations Declaration Against Torture and the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment , place an obligation on States to prevent torture .
(3) Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that no one shall be condemned to the death penalty or executed .
On 29 June 1998 , the Council approved “ Guidelines on EU policy towards third countries on the death penalty ” and resolved that the European Union would work towards the universal abolition of the death penalty .
(4) Article 4 of the said Charter states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment .
On 9 April 2001 , the Council approved “ Guidelines to the EU policy toward third countries , on torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment “ .
These guidelines refer to both the adoption of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports in 1998 and the ongoing work to introduce EU - wide controls on the exports of paramilitary equipment as examples of measures to work effectively towards the prevention of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment within the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
These guidelines also provide for third countries to be urged to prevent the use and production of , and trade in , equipment that is designed to inflict torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment and prevent the abuse of any other equipment to these ends .
(5) It is therefore appropriate to lay down Community rules on use and on trade with third countries in new physics torture weapons .
These rules are instrumental in promoting respect for human life and for fundamental human rights and thus serve the purpose of protecting public morals .
Such rules should ensure that Community economic operators do not derive any benefits from trade that either promotes or otherwise facilitates the implementation of policies on torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , which are not compatible with the relevant EU Guidelines , the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and international conventions and treaties .
(6) For the purpose of this Regulation , it is considered appropriate to apply the definitions of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment laid down in the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and in Resolution 3452 ( XXX ) of the General Assembly of the United Nations .
These definitions should be interpreted taking into account the case law on the interpretation of the corresponding terms in the European Convention on Human Rights and in relevant texts adopted by the EU or its Member States .
(7) The Guidelines to the EU Policy toward third countries on torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment provide , inter alia , that the Heads of Mission in third countries will include in their periodic reports an analysis of the occurrence of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment in the State of their accreditation , and the measures taken to combat it .
It is appropriate for the competent authorities to take these and similar reports made by relevant international and civil society organisations into account when deciding on requests for authorisations .
Such reports should also describe any new physics torture weapons used in third countries for the purpose of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .
(8) In order to contribute to the prevention of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , it is considered necessary to prohibit the supply to third countries of technical assistance related to goods which have no practical use other than for the purpose of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment by new physics torture weapons .
(9) The aforementioned Guidelines state that , in order to meet the objective of taking effective measures against torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , measures should be taken to prevent the use , production and trade of new physics torture weapons , including parts and equipment thereof , which are designed to inflict torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .
It is up to the Member States to impose and enforce the necessary restrictions on the use and production of such equipment .
( 10 ) In order to take into account new data and technological developments , the lists of new physics torture weapons and parts and equipment thereof covered by this Regulation should be kept under review and provision should be made for a specific procedure to amend these lists .
( 11 ) The Commission and the Member States should inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and of other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation .
( 12 ) Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented .
Those penalties should be effective , proportionate and dissuasive .
( 13 ) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ,

This Act from the US Government contains open admissions of the existence of several weapon systems that have , in the mainstream media , been a subject only to be contemplated talking about when discriminating and discrediting so - called ‘ conspiracy theorists ’ .
The people who have the courage to bring to public light the existence of such technologies , who have turned out to be right .
This
Act contains admissions of the existence or the theoretical existence of ; electronic , psychotronic , or information weapons ; chemtrails ; high altitude ultra low frequency weapons systems ; plasma , electromagnetic , sonic , or ultrasonic weapons ; laser weapons systems ; strategic , theater , tactical , or extra terrestrial weapons ; and chemical , biological , environmental , climate , or tectonic weapons .
The terms ‘‘ weapon ’ ’ and ‘‘ weapons system ’’ mean a device capable of any of the following :
Damaging or destroying an object ( whether in outer space , in the atmosphere , or on earth ) by firing one or more projectiles to collide with that object ; detonating one or more explosive devices in close proximity to that object ; directing a source of energy ( including molecular or atomic energy , subatomic particle beams , electromagnetic radiation , plasma , or extremely low frequency ( ELF ) or ultra low frequency ( ULF ) energy radiation ) against that object ; or any other unacknowledged or as yet undeveloped means .
Inflicting death or injury on , or damaging or destroying , a person ( or the biological life , bodily health , mental health , or physical and economic well - being of a person ) through the use of any of the means described .
The term ‘‘ exotic weapons systems ’’ includes weapons designed to damage space or natural ecosystems ( such as the ionosphere and upper atmosphere ) or climate , weather , and tectonic systems with the purpose of inducing damage or destruction upon a target population or region on earth or in space .

Baby oysters are dying in their millions along the French coast from Normandy to the Mediterranean , puzzling scientists and plunging France 's shellfish industry into crisis .
On some parts of the Norman and Mediterranean coast , the entire one - year - old " class " of juvenile oysters , due to be eaten by Christmas 2009 , has died in the space of a few days .
A number of theories have been put forward by marine biologists and oyster farmers , mostly linked to a slight rise in the temperature of the seas around western Europe this summer .
Has some form of toxic algae reached French waters ?
If so , why are adolescent and adult oysters apparently unaffected ?
Are rapid changes in water temperature damaging to baby oysters ?
If so , why are some oyster parcs , or beds , devastated while others nearby are relatively immune ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
One theory is that the warmer sea water – up to 1C higher than normal – has generated abnormal quantities of the microscopic plankton eaten by oysters .
The baby shellfish , aged from 12 to 18 months , may have been dying of over - eating .
The French Agriculture and Fisheries minister , Michel Barnier , has commissioned the French Institute for Research and Exploitation of the Sea ( Ifremer ) to " mobilise all its resources " to identify the cause or , more likely , combination of causes .
The government is expected to announce emergency aid to oyster producers to enable them to buy new oyster fry or " larva " .
" The losses run to tens of millions of euros , " said Joseph Costard , an oyster producer at Saint - Vaast in Normandy and president of the Norman association of shellfish producers .
" We are going to have to change completely the way we do things and spread out the harvesting of the [ older oysters ] over two or three seasons . "
Martial Monnier , director general of the national shellfish producers ' body , the Comité National de la Conchyliculture , said there were fears that the mysterious ailment could spread to mature oysters .
" We have a serious , serious problem , " he said " There is death rate of young oysters of between 40 and 100 per cent , compared to , at worst , 30 per cent in a normal year .
It is only when the next neap tides arrive that we will know whether or not the adult oysters have been affected . "
The crisis is the worst to hit the French oyster industry – Europe 's largest – since disease all but wiped out the native European or " Portuguese " oyster 30 years ago .
Since then almost all oyster farms in Europe have been restocked with the Pacific " creuse " oyster from Japan and British Columbia .
The French government and shellfish producers say the death of baby oysters should not discourage people from eating full - size oysters .
Nothing remotely threatening to humans has been discovered .
But the fisheries minister , M. Barnier , has asked the food safety agency , AFSSA , to investigate .
RENO , Nev. -- Michelle
Wie has heard the criticism of her decision to play in the Legends Reno - Tahoe Open this week instead of attempting to qualify for the Women 's British Open .
Like most teens , the 18 - year - old just wants to have a good time .
She is n't worried about what Annika Sorenstam and other top LPGA players think of her decision , either .
" There are going to be criticisms entering this tournament , but at the same time I 'm just doing what I feel like I want to do and it 's going to be a lot of fun , " Wie said .
Reno sports books have made
Wie a 500 - 1 long shot in the second - tier tournament , which opens Thursday .
They are n't her only doubters .
Sorenstam , who failed to make the cut in her only PGA appearance , said at the Women 's British Open earlier this week that if Wie can't qualify for a women 's major , she has no business playing with the men .
David Leadbetter , who has worked with Wie for years , blamed her family for making bad choices and said she has more to lose than gain by playing at Reno this week .
David Duval , who has shown signs of regaining some of the form that won him the 2001 British Open , said Wie 's playing on the PGA Tour " has never bothered me in the least . "
" The novelty of it seemingly is wearing off a little bit , but you know , more power to her if she wants to try it , " Duval said Wednesday .
" I do n't know if the PGA Tour is exactly the place to gain confidence .
You can get your head beat in pretty easy out here . "
An interesting legal case in Florida , reported by the NYT :
In the trial of a pornographic Web site operator , the defense plans to show that residents of Pensacola are more likely to use Google to search for terms like “ orgy ” than for “ apple pie ” or “ watermelon . ”
The publicly accessible data is vague in that it does not specify how many people are searching for the terms , just their relative popularity over time .
But the defense lawyer , Lawrence Walters , is arguing that the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that interest in the sexual subjects exceeds that of more mainstream topics — and that by extension , the sexual material distributed by his client is not outside the norm .
It is not clear that the approach will succeed .
The Florida state prosecutor in the case , which is scheduled for trial July 1 , said the search data may not be relevant because the volume of Internet searches is not necessarily an indication of , or proxy for , a community ’s values .
Infopackets Reader Steve T. writes :
" Dear Dennis ,
I have recently added a 120 GB external hard drive to my Dell Dimension computer ( via the USB port ) .
Problem : whenever I turn my computer on ( to start Windows ) , the external hard drive always tries to boot first .
Inevitably I get an error message that ' operating system is not found ' and I have to shut off the external unit and then reboot the machine in order to start Windows properly .
For this reason , I am curious if my Windows XP crashes , would it be able to boot from the external hard drive ?
If so , how would I go about doing this ?
Right now I 'm just using the external hard drive to backup my most important files ( but only when Windows is loaded ) .
If Windows was n't loaded , I would n't be able to use the drive . "
My response :
Yes , it is possible to use the external hard drive as a total replacement / backup unit if your internal C drive crashed and you were no longer able to boot into Windows .
This is called making a mirror image of your hard drive .
You can do this if :
a ) your external hard drive is as big or bigger than your internal hard drive , and
b ) you use a disk imager like Acronis True Image to make a " mirror copy " or " disk copy " from the internal hard drive ( C drive ) to the external USB drive ( D drive , for example ) .
A mirror copy essentially copies the * entire * drive from one to the next .
Also very important :
Based on your statement , you will need to modify your boot sequence so that your external hard drive does not always try to boot first .
Otherwise , you will be booting off your external hard drive after your first mirror copy is completed .
This is not what you want , because any changes to the system will be done to your backup drive instead of your internal PC hard drive .
You can change your boot sequence by going into your computer 's BIOS ( Basic Input Output System ) .
On most computers , the BIOS can be activated by holding down either the DEL or the F2 key when you first turn your computer on .
Normally there is a message displayed at the bottom ( or top ) of the screen to " Press XXX key to enter CMOS / System Utility " , etc .
Once you 're in the BIOS , look for a section that pertains to " Boot " or " Startup " .
Since not all BIOS 's are the same , I can't give you explicit directions where to look , although on most Dell PC 's it 's the last menu option on the top right of the screen .
When you 're in the Boot menu , ensure that the C drive boots first , then the CD / DVD ROM , and then the USB drive ( note that your external USB drive will need to be plugged in and turned on in order for it to show up in the list of bootable options ) .
For the Dell PCs , you can adjust the boot sequence in a hierarchy by moving the cursor over top of an item and then by pressing the + or - key .
Good luck .
PS : The Review on Acronis True Image , if you have n't already read it , is online our site .
I highly ( highly ! ) recommended True Image if you want piece of mind incase your system ever becomes unbootable or you get hit with a virus or Spyware attack , etc .
I personally use Acronis and wholeheartedly recommend it to friends , family , and everyone who reads this newsletter .

I was informed this morning of the outlandish attempt to prevent author and Stranger columnist Sherman Alexie from testifying in the case of City of Seattle vs.
The Professional Basketball Club , LLC .
As chief legal counsel for this publication , I have been asked to intervene on behalf of The Stranger and have just mailed the following letter to U.S. District Court Judge Marsha Pechman decrying what we see as a potential travesty of justice .
My paralegal informs me that readers of this blog can click on the following image to download a “ PDF ” of the letter :
PlanetDefender was inspired by the popular " Tower Defense " flash games like Elements TD , Desktop Defense or Vector Defense .
The objective is to survive the onslaught of alien invaders by building a variety of weapons , defenses and other structures .
Initially you can only build Ion Cannons ( for attack ) and Bunkers for protecting your population , but further structures become available with research .
See here for help and tips .
See here for release notes .
Help
Structures
Ion Cannons Ion Cannons are your basic attack weapon and should be built right away to destroy incoming ships .
It takes them a few shots to take down even the weakest enemy ships , but they fire quickly and upgraded versions can fire faster , more accurately and for greater damage .
Fortified Bunkers
When alien attackers rain down plasma bursts from above , your population will be safer deep underground .
Every alien attack reduces your population , these fortifications decrease how many people you lose .
Watch where the enemy is attacking and build bunkers next to those locations .
The effect is cummulative so multiple bunkers next to the same location provide even greater population defense .
Upgraded bunkers decrease population loss from alien attack even further .
Economic Centers Available only after researching Advanced Economics , Economic Centers provide increased revenue based on your population .
While it takes some time for them to pay for the cost of their initial construction , after that point it 's all profit .
Repair Bases Repair Bases dispatch robotic engineering teams to nearby structures , greatly increasing the rate at which they recover from damage .
A structure protected by multiple upgraded repair bases can withstand all but the most concerted alien attack .
Missile Complexes Missiles are the ultimate weapon against alien capital ships .
While they fire much more slowly than Ion Cannons , their fusion warheads pack a wallop .
Basic missiles suffer from the disadvantage that if their target is destroyed while they are enroute , they 're wasted .
Level 2 missiles and above can not only fire faster and for more damage , they can retask to a new target if their current target is destroyed .
Anti-Missile Defense Some Alien ships are nuclear capable as well .
Anti-missile defenses use a highly accurate beam weapon to destroy incoming warheads .
Upgraded versions can fire faster , allowing for the defense against multiple inbound weapons .
Technologies
Advanced Economics
This technology increases your global revenue rate , so get it early if you want to be able to produce lots of structures .
It also allows for the construction of Economic Centers , which bring in even more money .
Robotics
All structures slowly repair damage over time , but with Robotics , they repair twice as fast .
Not only that , but they allow the construction of Repair Bases ( see above ) .
Nuclear Fusion
This technology provides no advantages on its own , but allows the construction of Missile Complexes , a critical weapon against the larger alien ships .
Advanced Energy Advanced Energy enables the construction of anti-missile defense weapons .
Planet Shields
With this technology , your planet 's Van Allen belts are charged to deflect the majority of incoming energy attacks .
No corresponding structure is required , when the research is completed , shields are raised .
Tips
Your population is the key to victory .
Your revenue is determined by the size of your population .
To protect your population , make sure areas under attack are protected by fortified bunkers .
Late in the game , you 'll want every location protected by at least one upgraded bunker .
The alien attackers are fairly intelligent -- they will attack structures based on strategic importance , as well as how defended it is -- both the structure itself ( by Repair Bases ) and the population ( by Bunkers ) .
Economic Centers will allow you to generate the revenue you need , but since it takes time for them to pay for their initial investment , build them early on .
Bunkers and Repair Bases have a strong effect on adjacent ( green ) squares and a weak effect on diagonal ( blue ) squares .
A structure that 's diagonal from two fortified bunkers will have the population defense bonus as if it were directly adjacent to one .

Dell 's E mini -notebook computer , first outed when Gizmodo 's Brian Lam collared Michael Dell sneaking one about the D6 : All Things Digital conference , has got a price .
The E not only lops a few letters of the name of Asus ' rival Eee PC , it also drops a few dollars , coming in at $ 300 .
Price has been the problem with these mini-notebooks , and Dell is very welcome to bring its budget mass - marketing chops to the party .
While not official , the news comes from the usually reliable DigiTimes , which tells us that the E will be available in the last quarter of the year .
And none of this hunting in the stores to find one like we have to do with the Wind 's and Eees of the world .
Dell plans to knock out two to three million units by the end of the year .
Ludacris is down with " Barack O'Drama " and is supportive of Barack Obama , but the presidential candidate 's camp is n't too excited about the lyrics in " Politics as Usual , " a freestyle on the mixtape Gangsta Grillz : The Preview .
Luda teamed up with DJ Drama for the CD , which recently hit the streets .
Among the tracks featuring Cris ' lyrical calisthenics is an ode to the Atlanta MC 's choice for commander in chief .
" Get out and vote or the end will be near , " Luda warns over the beat from Young Buck 's " Get Buck . "
" The world is ready for change because Obama is here ! "
But those are n't the lyrics that have displeased the Obama team .
On the song , ' Cris expresses other thoughts on the political climate , calling Hillary Clinton " irrelevant " and insinuating that Jesse Jackson 's apology to Obama for some recent crude statements was n't genuine .
Like many of his peers , he also complains about President George W. Bush 's " poor " job while in office .
" McCain do n't belong in any chair unless he 's paralyzed / Yeah I said it , ' cause Bush is mentally handicapped , " Luda raps .
On Wednesday ( July 30 ) , Obama 's press representative responded to the freestyle , saying , " As Barack Obama has said many , many times in the past , rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny , materialism and degrading images that he does n't want his daughters or any children exposed to .
This song is not only outrageously offensive to Senator Clinton , Reverend Jackson , Senator McCain and President Bush , it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear .
While Ludacris is a talented individual , he should be ashamed of these lyrics . "
Obama may not support all rap lyrics , but he has gotten overwhelming support from the hip - hop community .
If you ask any rapper out there , he or she is likely to tell you " Barack in ' 08 " or give the candidate other props .
Nas recently put a song called " Black President " on The N ---r Tape mixtape and Untitled album , while Young Jeezy has a record called " My President Is Black " coming out on his September 2 release , The Recession .
Unlike some of his hip - hop brethren , Luda has actually had the opportunity to spend time with Obama .
" I 'd known about him for a long time , " ' Cris recently told MTV while filming a segment for Mixtape Monday in Atlanta .
" I heard about his skills when he was doing his thing in Chicago .
I definitely heard some rumors that he was going to run .
But I just wanted to feel his vibe , man .
He 's real down - to - earth , his energy is great .
He 's just an honest dude , and he 's all about change .
I 'm all for change .
I 'm just pro-Obama .
I do n't think there 's anybody better who can be put in that office right now besides that man . "
Ludacris ' camp says a response to the Obama camp 's statement is forthcoming .
The wind and the ceremony picked up speed .
The wedding party and most of the guests got to the reception hall before the sky darkened and the downpour hit .
Ominously , the power had already gone out .
Candles were lit , making the party quite festive , even though we were told of tornado warnings and where to take shelter if need be .
Amateur weather scientist that I am , I went outside onto the spacious lawn of the Dunrovin Christian Brothers Retreat Center , in Marine on Saint Croix .
I stood alone watching the ragged clouds .
The center sits on the banks of the Saint Croix , and moist surface winds had been blowing across the river from east to west  seemingly an unusual flow at such latitudes .
Now , things reversed .
A dark frontal system approached from the west , the line of clouds churning , bolts of horizontal lightning flashing from cloud to cloud like something out of a Frankenstein movie .
I ’d never seen anything like it .
Meteorologists say horizontal lightning is common , but often hidden in the clouds .
A cool wind came up .
The thunder grew louder .
Carole
Anne joined me on the lawn .
We watched the front approach and exchanged an intimate word or two .
We hugged .
Just then , hail began to fall , hard and fast .

Hailstones form in the updrafts of thunderstorms as rain soars into colder regions , freezing and growing larger as droplets fuse .
The stronger the updraft , the larger the hail .
When hailstones become heavier than the lifting force of the updraft , they fall .
The wide open spaces of the Midwest aid the formation of storms with big hail and tornados .

Imagine a system of parking meters that :
– increased the fees when fewer spots were available , and decreased them when there were less
– that you could pay for with your cell phone
– that texted you when your time was almost up so you could ‘ feed the meter ’ without going back to your car .
Well , imagine no more , just come to San Francisco .
6,000 or so meters are to be being replaced with these new fancy dodads , that include underground sensors to check if there is a car in the space .
Now , those that you know me are well aware of my propensity to suggest technological solutions for all problems .
I wo n’t even boil water without a microwave , unless it ’s absolutely necessary .
And this new system has a number of excellent benefits :
– there will be , as the system intends , more spaces available during peak hours
– there will be , as the system intends , a discouragement of car use .
– there will be , as the system intends , and increase in revenue .
Howewver ,
– there will be major pissed off - ness when people try to figure out why the parking meters , that used to involve the simple process of putting coins in , now require and instruction manual and haggling and bartering with .
– there will be major pissed off ness , when you find out that the change you brought will only last you 1/2 the length of your doctors appointment .
– there will be major pissed off - ness , when parking charges go through the roof in order to pay for these ridiculous doodas , with the bulk of the cash going to pay for the fany pants meters , and none of it going to into the city bank .
Hey , maybe it will work .
I think it ’s someone ’s free market obession run amok .

Back in May we unveiled our project to build a new version of Last.fm .
Our goal was to lay the foundation for an online music experience more compelling , accessible , and discoverable than anything that had gone before .
But modernising a service powered by the people since 2002 — touching on everything from the core of Audioscrobbler engine to the look & feel — was n’t something we could do alone .
So we turned to you — Last .fm subscribers and users — and wow , you sure came through .
Here ’s a look at the past eight weeks of beta testing :
We ’ve been listening hard , trying out new ideas , and making tons of changes in response to your feedback .
Today we ’ve taken the next step in this process , bringing the new Last . fm to everyone .
Turn up the volume and have a look around
For those of you who are veteran Last . fm users , you ’ll notice we ’ve taken a step back to make our feature set more coherent .
Do n’t worry , we have n’t taken much away * , just re-organised .
Along with putting straight our clutter , we ’ve cleaned house too : the user interface has been re-aligned to be a more robust foundation for features to come , and we ’ve updated the look and feel .
This is an evolution of the Last .fm interface , and it wo n’t stop developing either — we ’re inspired by iterative change and dedicated to adapting the service .
Some critical pieces to the Last .fm experience have been added , and a few old pieces dusted and polished .
Here ’s a tour of the new place :
Library
Browse your entire music profile , down to every last play .
Add any song or artist with a click .
Listen to your library from wherever you are .
Import your listening history
Sync your iPod / media player when you sign up to last .fm to instantly fill your library .
Your profile updates when you sync your iPod / iPhone too !
Instant recommendations
Music recommendations just got way more powerful , and now appear in seconds instead of weeks .
Real - time chart updates
Listen to a song and the charts on your profile immediately reflect the play .
The way it should be !
Evident playability
Listen to tracks or radio from a shiny new player , present on almost every page .
Better browsing
Not sure what music or videos to check out ?
Head over to the all - new Music and Videos pages for some popular and up - and - coming tunes .
We hope the new Last .fm makes it easier to play , discover , and share great music .
Where ’s the afterparty ?
We ’re just getting started .
There ’s lots more to come , and you may spot some quirks , so head over to the feedback forums to leave us a comment .
This is just the beginning of the new Last . fm platform and we ’re counting on you to help us make and shape this generation of Last.fm .

* A few missing pieces will reemerge , phoenix - like , in the coming weeks .
I ’m looking at you ;-)

Soldier in famous photo never defeated ' demons ' Associated Press
Published : Sunday July 20 , 2008
Print This Email This By ALLEN G. BREED and KEVIN MAURER , Associated Press Writers PINEHURST , N.C. - Officers had been to the white ranch house at 560 W. Longleaf many times before over the past year to respond to a " barricade situation . "
Each had ended uneventfully , with Joseph Dwyer coming out or telling police in a calm voice through the window that he was OK .
But this time was different .
The Iraq War veteran had called a taxi service to take him to the emergency room .
But when the driver arrived , Dwyer shouted that he was too weak to get up and open the door .
The officers asked Dwyer for permission to kick it in .
" Go ahead ! " he yelled .
They found Dwyer lying on his back , his clothes soiled with urine and feces .
Scattered on the floor around him were dozens of spent cans of Dust - Off , a refrigerant - based aerosol normally used to clean electrical equipment .
Dwyer told police Lt. Mike Wilson he'd been " huffing " the aerosol .
" Help me , please ! " the former Army medic begged Wilson .
" I 'm dying .
Help me .
I can't breathe . "
Unable to stand or even sit up , Dwyer was hoisted onto a stretcher .
As paramedics prepared to load him into an ambulance , an officer noticed Dwyer 's eyes had glassed over and were fixed .
A half hour later , he was dead .
When Dionne Knapp learned of her friend 's June 28 death , her first reaction was to be angry at Dwyer .
How could he leave his wife and daughter like this ?
Did n't he know he had friends who cared about him , who wanted to help ?
But as time passed , Knapp 's anger turned toward the Army .
A photograph taken in the first days of the war had made the medic from New York 's Long Island a symbol of the United States ' good intentions in the Middle East .
When he returned home , he was hailed as a hero .
But for most of the past five years , the 31 - year - old soldier had writhed in a private hell , shooting at imaginary enemies and dodging nonexistent roadside bombs , sleeping in a closet bunker and trying desperately to huff away the " demons " in his head .
When his personal problems became public , efforts were made to help him , but nothing seemed to work .
This broken , frightened man had once been the embodiment of American might and compassion .
If the military could n't save him , Knapp thought , what hope was there for the thousands suffering in anonymity ?
Like many , Dwyer joined the military in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks .
His father and three brothers are all cops .
One brother , who worked in Lower Manhattan , happened to miss his train that morning and so had n't been there when the World Trade Center towers collapsed .
Joseph , the second - youngest of six , decided that he wanted to get the people who'd " knocked my towers down . "
And he wanted to be a medic .
( Dwyer 's first real job was as a transporter for a hospital in the golf resort town of Pinehurst , where his parents had moved after retirement . )
In 2002 , Dwyer was sent to Fort Bliss , Texas .
The jokester immediately fell in with three colleagues 
Angela Minor , Sgt. Jose Salazar , and Knapp .
They spent so much time together after work that comrades referred to them as " The Four Musketeers . "
Knapp had two young children and was going through a messy divorce .
Dwyer stepped in as a surrogate dad , showing up in uniform at her son Justin 's kindergarten and coming by the house to assemble toys that Knapp could n't figure out .
When it became clear that the U.S. would invade Iraq , Knapp became distraught , confiding to Dwyer that she would rather disobey her deployment orders than leave her kids .
Dwyer asked to go in her place .
When she protested , he insisted : " Trust me , this is what I want to do .
I want to go . "
After a week of nagging , his superiors relented .
Dwyer assured his parents , Maureen and Patrick  and his new wife , Matina , whom he 'd married in August 2002  that he was being sent to Kuwait and would likely stay in the rear , far from the action .
But it was n't true .
Unbeknownst to his family , Dwyer had been attached to the 3rd Infantry 's 7th Cavalry Regiment .
He was at " the tip of the tip of the spear , " in one officer 's phrase .
During the push into Baghdad , Dwyer 's unit came under heavy fire .
An airstrike called in to suppress ambush fire rocked the convoy .
As the sun rose along the Euphrates River on March 25 , 2003 , Army Times photographer Warren Zinn watched as a man ran toward the soldiers carrying a white flag and his injured 4 - year - old son .
Zinn clicked away as Dwyer darted out to meet the man , then returned , cradling the boy in his arms .
The photo  of a half - naked boy , a kaffiyeh scarf tied around his shrapnel - injured leg and his mouth set in a grimace of pain , and of a bespectacled Dwyer dressed in full battle gear , his M - 16 rifle dangling by his side  appeared on front pages and magazine covers around the world .
Suddenly , everyone wanted to interview the soldier in " the photo . "
Dwyer was given a " Hometown Hero " award by child - safety advocate John Walsh ; the Army awarded him the Combat Medical Badge for service under enemy fire .
The attention embarrassed him .
" Really , I was just one of a group of guys , " he told a military publication .
" I was n't standing out more than anyone else . "
Returning to the U.S. in June 2003 , after 91 days in Iraq , Dwyer seemed a shell to friends .
When he deployed , he was pudgy at 6 - foot - 1 and 220 pounds .
Now he weighed around 165 , and the other Musketeers immediately thought of post - traumatic stress disorder .
Dwyer attributed his skeletal appearance to long days and a diet of MREs ( Meals Ready to Eat ) .
He showed signs of his jolly old self , so his friends accepted his explanation .
But they soon noticed changes that were more than cosmetic .
At restaurants , Dwyer insisted on sitting with his back to the wall so no one could sneak up on him .
He turned down invitations to the movies , saying the theaters were too crowded .
He said the desert landscape around El Paso , and the dark - skinned Hispanic population , reminded him of Iraq .
Dwyer , raised Roman Catholic but never particularly religious before , now would spend lunchtime by himself , poring over his Bible .
When people would teasingly call him " war hero " and ask him to tell about his experiences , or about the famous photo , he would steer the conversation toward the others he 'd served with .
But Dwyer once confided that another image , also involving a child , disturbed him .
He was standing next to a soldier during a firefight when a boy rode up on a bicycle and stopped beside a weapon lying in the dirt .
Under his breath , the soldier beside Dwyer whispered , " Do n't pick it up , kid .
Do n't pick it up . "
The boy reached for the weapon and was blasted off his bike .
In late 2004 , Dwyer sent e-mails to Zinn , wondering if the photographer had " heard anything else about the kid " from the photo , and claiming he was " doing fine out here in Fort Bliss , Texas . "
But Dwyer was n't doing fine .
Earlier that year , he'd been prescribed antidepressants and referred for counseling by a doctor .
Still , his behavior went from merely odd to dangerous .
One day , he swerved to avoid what he thought was a roadside bomb and crashed into a convenience store sign .
He began answering his apartment door with a pistol in his hand and would call friends from his car in the middle of the night , babbling and disoriented from sniffing inhalants .
Matina told friends that he was seeing imaginary Iraqis all around him .
Despite all this , the Army had not taken his weapons .
In the summer of 2005 , he was removed to the barracks for 72 hours after trashing the apartment looking for an enemy infiltrator .
He was admitted to Bliss ' William Beaumont Army Medical Center for treatment of his inhalant addiction .
But things continued to worsen .
That October , the Musketeers decided it was time for an " intervention . "
Minor , who had moved to New York , overdrew her bank account and flew down .
She , Knapp and Salazar went to the apartment and pleaded with Dwyer to give up his guns , or at least his ammunition .
" I 'm sorry , guys , " he told them .
" But there 's no way I 'm giving up my weapons . "
After talking for about an hour and a half , Dwyer agreed to let Matina lock the weapons up .
The group went for a walk in a nearby park , and Dwyer seemed happier than he'd been in months .
But Dwyer 's paranoia soon returned  and worsened .
On Oct. 6 , 2005 , when superiors went to the couple 's off - base apartment to persuade Dwyer to return to the hospital , Dwyer barricaded himself in .
Imagining Iraqis swarming up the sides and across the roof , he fired his pistol through the door , windows and ceiling .
After a three - hour standoff , Dwyer 's eldest brother , Brian , also a police officer , managed to talk him down over the phone .
Dwyer was admitted for psychiatric treatment .
In a telephone interview later that month from what he called the " nut hut " at Beaumont , Dwyer told Newsday that he'd lied on a post - deployment questionnaire that asked whether he'd been disturbed by what he 'd seen and done in Iraq .
The reason : A PTSD diagnosis could interfere with his plans to seek a police job .
Besides , he'd been conditioned to see it as a sign of weakness .
" I 'm a soldier , " he said .
" I suck it up .
That 's our job . "
Dwyer told the newspaper that he'd blown off counseling before but was committed to embracing his treatment this time .
He said he hoped to become an envoy to others who avoided treatment for fear of damaging their careers .
" There 's a lot of soldiers suffering in silence , " he said .
In January 2006 , Joseph and Matina Dwyer moved back to North Carolina , away from the place that reminded him so much of the battlefield .
But his shadow enemy followed him here .
Dwyer was discharged from the Army in March 2006 and living off disability .
That May , Matina Dwyer gave birth to a daughter , Meagan Kaleigh .
He seemed to be getting by , but setbacks would occur without warning .
On the Fourth of July , he and family were fishing off the back deck when the fireworks display began .
Dwyer bolted inside and hid under a bed .
In June 2007 , police responded to a call that Dwyer was " having some mental problems related to PTSD . "
A captain talked him into going to the emergency room .
Later that month , Matina Dwyer moved in with her parents and obtained a protective order .
In the complaint , she said Dwyer had purchased an AR - 15 assault rifle and become angry when she refused to return it .
" He said that he was coming to my residence to get his gun back , " she wrote in the June 25 , 2007 , complaint .
" He was coming packed with guns and someone was going to die tonight . "
She declined to be interviewed for this story .
In July 2007 , Dwyer checked into an inpatient program at New York 's Northport Veterans Affairs Medical Center .
He stayed for six months .
He came home in March with more than a dozen prescriptions .
He was so medicated that his feet flopped when he walked , as if he were wearing oversized clown shoes .
The VA 's solution was a " pharmaceutical lobotomy , " his father thought .
But within five days of his discharge , Dwyer 's symptoms had returned with such ferocity that the family decided it was time to get Matina and 2 - year - old Meagan out .
While Dwyer was off buying inhalants , his parents helped spirit them away .
On April 10 , weary and fearful , Matina Dwyer filed for custody and division of property .
Without his wife and daughter to anchor him , Dwyer 's grip on reality loosened further .
He reverted to Iraq time , sleeping during the day and " patrolling " all night .
Unable to possess a handgun , he placed knives around the house for protection .
In those last months , Dwyer opened up a little to his parents .
What bothered him most , he said , was the sheer volume of the gunfire .
He talked about the grisly wounds he'd treated and dwelled on the people he was unable to save .
His nasal membranes seemed indelibly stained with the scents of the battlefield  the sickeningly sweet odor of rotting flesh and the metallic smell of blood .
Yet despite all that , Dwyer continued to talk about going back to Iraq .
He told his parents that if he could just get back with his comrades and do his job , things would right themselves .
When Maureen Dwyer first saw Zinn 's famous photo , she'd had a premonition that it might be the last picture she 'd ever see of Joseph .
" I just did n't think he was going to come home , " she said .
" And he never did . "
An autopsy is pending , but police are treating Dwyer 's death as an accidental overdose .
His friends and family see it differently .
The day of the 2005 standoff , Knapp spent hours on the telephone trying to get help for Dwyer .
She was frustrated by a military bureaucracy that would not act unless his petrified wife complained , and with a civilian system that insisted Dwyer was the military 's problem .
In a letter to post commander Maj. Gen. Robert Lennox , Knapp expressed anger that Army officials who were " proud to display him as a hero ... now had turned their back on him ... "
" Joseph Dwyer who had left to Iraq one of the nicest , kindest , caring , self - sacrificing and patriotic people I have ever known , " she wrote , " was forced to witness and commit acts completely contrary to his nature and returned a tormented , confused disillusioned shadow of his former self that was not being given the help he needed . "
While Dwyer was in the service , Minor said , the Army controlled every aspect of his life .
" So someone should have taken him by the hand and said , ` We 're putting you in the hospital , and you 're staying there until you get fixed  until you 're back to normal . "
But Dr. Antonette Zeiss , deputy chief of the VA 's Office of Mental Health , said it 's not that simple .
" Veterans are civilians , and VA is guided by state law about involuntary commitment , " she told the AP .
" There are civil liberties , and VA respects that those civil liberties are important . "
The family would not authorize the VA to release Dwyer 's medical records .
But it appears that Dwyer was sometimes unwilling  or unable  to make the best use of the programs available .
In an e-mail to The Associated Press , Lennox , the former Bliss post commander , wrote that Dwyer " had a great ( in my opinion ) care giver . "
Zeiss said the best treatment for PTSD is exposure - based psychotherapy , in which the patient is made " to engage in thoughts , feelings and conversations about the trauma . "
While caregivers must be 100 percent committed to creating an environment in which the veteran feels comfortable confronting those demons , she said the patient must be equally committed to following through .
" And so it 's a dance between the clinicians and the patient . "
Paul Rieckhoff , executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America , feels the VA is a lousy dance partner .
Rieckhoff said the VA 's is a " passive system " whose arcane rules and regulations make it hard for veterans to find help .
And when they do get help , he said , it is often inadequate .
" I consider ( Dwyer ) a battlefield casualty , " he said , " because he was still fighting the war in his head . "
The Sunday after the Fourth of July , Knapp attended services at Scotsdale Baptist , the El Paso church where she and Dwyer had been baptized together in 2004 .
On the way out of the sanctuary , Knapp checked her phone and noticed an e-mail .
" I did n't know if you had heard or not , " a friend wrote , " but I got an email from Matina this morning saying that Joseph had died on Saturday and that the funeral was today . "
Knapp maintained her composure long enough to get herself and the children to the car .
Then she lost it .
The children asked what was wrong .
" Joseph is dead , " she told them .
" You said he was n't sick any more , " Justin said .
" I know , Justin , " his mother replied .
" But I guess maybe the help was n't working like we thought it was . "
The kids were too young to understand acronyms like PTSD or to hear a lecture about how Knapp thought the system had failed Dwyer .
So she told them that , just as they sometimes have nightmares , " sometimes people get those nightmares in their head and they just can't get them out , no matter what . "
Despite the efforts she made to get help for Dwyer , Knapp is trying to cope with a deep - seated guilt .
She knows that Dwyer shielded her from the images that had haunted him .
" I think about all the torture that he went through when he came back , and I think that all of that stuff could have happened to me , " she said , stifling a sob .
" I just owe him so much for that . "
Since Dwyer 's death , Justin , now 9 , has taken to carrying a newspaper clipping of the Zinn photo around with him .
Occasionally , Knapp will catch him huddled with a playmate , showing the photo and telling him about the soldier who used to come to his school and assemble his toys .
Justin wants them to know all about Spc. Joseph Dwyer .
His hero .

Considering The Robot Romance
I ’m thinking about trading in my girlfriend for a few really advanced robots .
Hang on a sec — I know it sounds bad .
But hear me out .
Scientists are making leaps and bounds with these things right now .
I mean , they ’ve come up with artificial life that can conduct psychotherapy , perform exotic dances , and appear to have “ high emotional capacity . ”
Hell , even I do n’t have that .
I guess the only thing to do , then , is hold a point - by - point match - up , robot versus relationship .
I ’ve recruited a handful of top contenders and am ready to put them head - to - head with my human honey .
So grab your gloves and get ready :
It ’s time to head to the ring .
Round 1 : An Emotional Connection
We all need someone who can respond to our emotions , right ?
Well , I may have found her .
Er , it .
A Japanese researcher swears he ’s discovered the secret to building a bot that can look and act just like a human .
He made some headlines a couple years back by creating a machine version of himself , complete with his mannerisms and movements .
Of course , the Japanese man model is n’t quite my type when it comes to cuddling ( though it does , I must admit , have sublimely taut buttocks ) .
No fear , though ; the just - released “ strokable rabbit ” is ready to step in .
The furry little friend , invented by a Canadian scientist , boasts itself as being one of the first forms of artificial intelligence to respond to the human touch .
My girlfriend does n’t even do that half the time .
Okay , not a bad start for the bots .
Now let ’s see how they fare on empathy .
MindMentor ’s “ robot psychologist ” claims to possess the power to listen to your problems and help you work through them .
Well , all it really does is sort of paraphrase what you say to keep you talking .
But let ’s be honest , that ’s probably more than enough to meet my horribly stunted emotional capacity .
Hmm .
Tough call here , but I think the robots take round one .
Round 2 : Sharing My Interests
A relationship is built upon shared interests , so can a glorified Number Five stand up to the challenge ?
Let ’s see .
I play the drums .
It ’d be nice to have someone to accompany me .
The girlfriend ’s out on this one , but I think the robots may have the upper hand .
Toyota ’s been working on music - playing models for a few years now .
And an MIT engineer is creating a bot that could help me practice and improve my form .
The thing actually uses a set of motors to guide a drummer ’s hand and teach him new tricks .
Big advantage there .
Whenever my girlfriend guides my hand to teach me new tricks , I end up feeling inadequate .
Round two : Robots .
Round 3 : Having Some Fun
You ’ve gotta have a partner who knows how to have fun .
I love a good joke , but even more , I love it when someone else laughs at my jokes ( and yes , I consider a booming belch to be a hilarious punchline — I do n’t know why my lady does n’t ) .
Now enter the joke bot .
University of Cincinnati researchers found a way to teach this bad boy how to recognize simple puns .
They ’re even working on customizing it to relate to different senses of humor , so there ’s no doubt this metallic maniac would appreciate my incredibly advanced antics .
So far , so good .
But I need more than just someone who can spot a good gag ; I might want to boogie .
Being that I am , of course , the envy of every dance floor , I need a companion who can keep up with my moves .
Cue the dancing robot .
This mean machine , from the University of Tokyo , can capture the movements of any advanced dance and then replicate them .
Since “ the robot ” is , in fact , my signature move , I have a feeling this fella will fit right in .
Round three : Robots again .
I sense a knockout on the way .
Round 4 : Being Happy at Home
We ’re nearing the home stretch , and this may be the true test :
Can a robot be a good roommate ?
First , let ’s deal with the downsides .
As much as I love strong women , I do n’t want anyone who can kick my ass ( sorry , American Gladiator Hellga ) .
But a group of German developers have come up with the technology to build a “ sensitive robot ” that , if I translated correctly , “ knows when it has punched you . ”
This is one feature my current companion definitely does not possess , especially when sleeping .
I ’ve been on the receiving end of far too many in - bed beatings — and not the good kind .
Advantage robots .
So what else could my potential relationship replacements do ?
Well , we know they can handle all sorts of housework .
I sure wo n’t complain about that .
Then there ’s the hair transplant robot , on sale from a California company .
Yup , I kid you not :
The machine can shift your follicles around to make your locks look more lustrous than Sanjaya on salon day .
I ’m looking pretty lustrous right now , thank you , but you never know what another decade might do to my do .
I hate to say it , but I think I ’ve gotta call another round for Team Robot .
One more shot before we end this thing .
Round 5 : Getting Physical
I ca n’t complete the fight without the final , and perhaps most important , round .
I ’ve looked at a lot of robots today , and as excited as I am , I just do n’t know that they have what it takes in this last , shall we say , hands - on department .
Now , there is The Gripper , a relatively new bot that has a “ tiny hand with the gentlest touch . ”
That might …. no , nevermind .
It ’s just wrong .
You know , something suddenly strikes me : Maybe I ’m the one lacking in these areas .
I mean , come on — I ’ve just spent an entire morning considering whether to replace my girlfriend with a series of robots .
Could robots really replace a personal connection ?
Could a machine possibly help you better yourself ?
What was I thinking ?
I ’m the one with the emotional void .
I need help .
I need understanding .
And I think , after all this , I know where I can find it .
I just hope that robot psychologist has an open appointment .

( Natural News ) New Zealand beverage manufacturer Phoenix Organics has launched an anti-aspartame campaign called " Think Before You Drink , " to inform people about what it says are serious health risks from the artificial sweetener .
Aspartame is a common zero - calorie sweetener , marketed under brand names including Equal , NutraSweet , Canderel and Tropicana Slim and used in more than 6,000 products worldwide .
As part of the new campaign , Phoenix Organics has labeled 20,000 bottles of Phoenix Organic Cola with information about the potential health risks of aspartame , and plans to give out those bottles for free over the next few months .
The company has also created a section on its
Web site linking to information about the chemical and " the 92 different symptoms noted in over 10,000 complaints received by the FDA . " " Having read the Bressler Report of the FDA and other reports on the effects of aspartame , we had the living daylights scared out of all of us , " said company directors Stefan Lepionka and Marc Ellis .
" We cannot believe that the New Zealand government has declared this safe in the face of such evidence .
" The Bressler Report was a 1977 FDA report on the inadequacies of aspartame maker GD Searle 's trials into the safety of the chemical .
In 1981 , Searle Chief Operating Officer Donald Rumsfeld , former Secretary of Defense for Gerald Ford and later serving the same position for George W. Bush , reapplied for FDA authorization .
Aspartame was approved for dry goods in 1981 and for beverages in 1983 .
Numerous studies have linked aspartame to brain damage and cancer , while others have shown that it breaks down in the body into toxic byproducts such as formaldehyde .
Lepionka and Ellis expressed concern that in the face of increasing efforts to remove sugary soft drinks from school grounds , beverage companies have suggested aspartame - containing diet soda as a good alternative .
" Phoenix Organics has contacted a number of groups that have been fighting to raise awareness of the health concerns surrounding aspartame and said the company will do whatever it can to support the overall aim to have the government restrict and ban aspartame , " they said .

Rates of obesity are on the rise Children carrying the first gene that has been clearly linked to obesity find it harder than others to tell when they are full , London - based researchers say .
They studied over 3,000 children to see whether the FTO gene impacts on the ability to burn calories or appetite .
The researchers found those with copies of the gene 's risky variant were less likely to have their appetite " switched off " when they should be full .
The study is published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism .
FTO is the first common gene to be linked to obesity in Caucasian populations .
Previous studies have shown that adults with two copies of the higher risk version of the gene are on average 3 kg ( 6lb 10 oz ) heavier , and those with a single copy are on average 1.5 kg heavier , than those without the gene .
We are looking at a thousand - piece jigsaw and we have shown how the first two pieces fit together
Dr David Haslam
National Obesity Forum
The researchers , from University College London and the Institute of Psychiatry , King 's College London , set out to learn more about the way the gene works .
They tested whether children aged eight to 11 carrying the higher risk gene variation had an altered appetite through height , weight and waist circumference measurements , and a questionnaire which asked parents about their child 's eating habits .
They found that children with the higher risk version of the gene tended to overeat and to struggle to recognise when they were full .
The effect of the gene on appetite was the same regardless of age , sex , socio- economic background and body mass index .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
Lead researcher Professor Jane Wardle said : " It is not simply the case that people who carry the risky variant of this gene automatically become overweight , but they are more susceptible to overeating .
" This makes them significantly more vulnerable to the modern environment which confronts all of us with large portion sizes and limitless opportunities to eat . "
However , Professor Wardle said the effect of the gene in isolation was relatively small .
She said it was likely that many genes contributed to obesity and appetite , each making a small contribution , but together creating a substantial effect .
Dr David Haslam , clinical director of the National Obesity Forum , said the research was " very interesting " .
However , he said : " We are looking at a thousand - piece jigsaw and we have shown how the first two pieces fit together .
" It is a step in the right direction , but what we do n't want to say is 'we have got the gene for obesity , therefore we can cure it ' - that is not going to happen for many years to come . "

STOCKHOLM ( Reuters ) -
All four members of supergroup ABBA appeared together on Friday at the Swedish premiere of the film “ Mamma Mia ! ” , delighting fans with their first public showing for years .
Abba members Agnetha Faltskog ( 2nd L ) and Anni-Frid Lyngstad ( 2nd R ) pose with cast members Meryl Streep ( L ) and Christine Baranski during the premiere of the motion picture version of the musical ' Mamma Mia ' in Stockholm , July 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Bob Strong
Benny Andersson , Bjorn Ulvaeus , Anni-Frid Lyngstad -- known as Frida -- and Agnetha Faltskog walked down the red carpet at a Stockholm movie theatre to the cheers of several thousand fans .
The movie follows “ Mamma Mia ! ” the musical , which toured worldwide and features 22 ABBA songs , including “ Dancing Queen , ” “ Take a Chance on Me ” and “ The Winner Takes It All ” .
The foursome , who shot to fame when they won the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest , last performed together in public in 1986 , although there were reports they sang together at a private birthday party for a friend in 1999 .
They were once reported to have been offered $ 1 billion to reunite for a concert tour .
At the film premiere , Agnetha and Frida embraced with actress Meryl Streep , posing for pictures before the three did a dance together .
Moments later , all four band members appeared on the theatre balcony .
They stood together with Streep , Pierce Brosnan , Colin Firth and other members of the Mamma Mia ! cast .
At news conferences , Streep , Brosnan and Firth enthused about ABBA ’s music while discussing the challenges of singing and wearing figure - hugging Spandex costumes for their roles .
“ Once I started singing I kind of rather enjoyed it , ” Brosnan , better known for James Bond films than musicals , said .
“ The Spandex was a bit of a challenge and the boots were .
But I had the time of my life making this movie . ”

SINGING ABILITY
Co-star Firth , star of two “ Bridget Jones ’s Diary ” films , said the most frightening aspects of the film were also the most motivating .
“ There ’s an old Miles Davis quote which I ’ve always cherished , which is ‘ Do n’t play what you know , play what you do n’t know ’ , ” Firth said .
Ulvaeus had high praise for the actors ’ vocal abilities .
“ Most of them do n’t think they can sing , but they can , I assure you . ”
The Spandex outfits were a different matter .
“ You ’re going to get bulges that you did n’t want and not really developments you did want , ” said Firth , who performed as Mr. Darcy in the BBC mini-series of “ Pride and Prejudice ” .
Streep said she had been excited by the prospect of singing since she had performed in high school musicals such as “ Oklahoma ! ” .
“ That was my beginning so it was kind of like coming home to the thing that I loved very , very much , ” she said .
Asked to name her favorite ABBA song , Streep said :
“ I could n’t say .
I honestly do n’t have a favorite song .
It ’s like saying which of your children is your favorite , which of your movies is your favorite .
I do n’t think of it in sports terms like that . ”
Groovy has an interesting shortening of the ternary operator that it rather fancifully titles “ the Elvis Operator “ .
This operator is hardly unique to Groovy – C# has had it since 2.0 in the form of the Null Coalescing Operator – but that does n’t mean that it is not a language feature worth learning from .
Surprisingly ( for a C - derivative language ) , Scala entirely lacks any sort of ternary operator .
However , the language syntax is more than flexible enough to implement something similar without ever having to dip into the compiler .
But before we go there , it is worth examining what this operator does and how it works in languages which already have it .
In essence , it is just a bit of syntax sugar , allowing you to easily check if a value is null and provide a value in the case that it is .
For example :
firstName = " Daniel " lastName = null println firstName ? : " Chris " println lastName ? : " Spiewak "
This profound snippet really demonstrates about all there is to the Elvis operator .
The result is as follows :
Daniel Spiewak
Not terribly exciting .
Essentially , what we have is a binary operator which evaluates the left expression and tests to see if it is null .
In the case of firstName , this is false , so the right expression ( in this case , " Chris " ) is never evaluated .
However , lastName is null , which means that we have to evaluate the right expression and return its value , rather than null .
It ’s all just so much syntax sugar that can be expressed equivalently in any language with a conditional operator ( in this case , Java ) :
String firstName = " Daniel " ; String lastName = null ; System . out .
println ( ( firstName == null ) ?
" Chris " : firstName ) ; System . out .
println ( ( lastName == null ) ?
" Spiewak " : lastName ) ;
A bit verbose , do n’t you think ?
Of course , this is n’t really a fair comparison , since Groovy is a far more concise language than Java .
Let ’s see how the above would render in a real man ’s language like Scala :
val firstName = " Daniel " val lastName : String = null println ( if ( first Name == null ) " Chris " else firstName ) println ( if ( lastName == null ) " Spiewak " else lastName )
Better , but still a little clumsy .
The truth of the matter is that we ’re forced to do this sort of null checking all the time ( well , maybe a little less in Scala ) and the constructs for doing so are woefully inadequate .
Thus , the motivation for the Elvis operator .
Getting Things Started
Like all good programmers should , we ’re going to start with a runnable specification for every behavior desired from the operator .
I ’ve written before about the excellent Specs framework , so that ’s what we ’ll use :
" elvis operator " should { " use predicate when not null " in { " success " ? : " failure " mustEqual " success " } " use alternative when null " in { val test : String = null test ? : " success " mustEqual " success " } " type correctly " in { // if it compiles , then we 're fine val str : String = " success " ? : " failure " val i : Int = 123 ? : 321 str mustEqual " success " i mustEqual 123 } " infer join of types " in { // must compile val res : CharSequence = " success " ? : new java .
lang .
StringBuilder ( " failure " ) res mustEqual " success " } " only eval alternative when null " in { var a = " success " def alt = { a = " failure " a } " non-null " ? : alt a mustEqual " success " } }
Fairly straightforward stuff .
I imagine that this specification for the operator is a bit more involved than the one used in the Groovy compiler , due to the fact that Scala is a statically typed language and thus requires a bit more effort to ensure that everything is working properly .
From this specification , we can infer three core properties of the operator :
Basic behavior when null / not- null
The result type should be the unification of the static types of the left and right operands
The right operand should only be evaluated when the left is null
The first property is fairly easy to understand ; it is intuitive in the definition of the operator .
All this means is that the value of the operator expression is dependent on the value of the left operand .
When not null , the expression value is equal to the value of the left operand .
If the left operand is null , then the expression is valued equivalent to the right operand .
This is just formally expressing what we spent the first section of the article describing .
Ignoring the second and third properties , we can actually attempt an implementation .
For the moment , we will just assume that the left and right operands must be of exactly the same type , otherwise the operator will be inapplicable .
So , without further ado , implementation enters stage right :
implicit def elvisOperator [ T ] ( alt : T ) = new { def ? : ( pred : T ) = if ( pred == null ) alt else pred }
Notice the use of the anonymous inner class to carry the actual operator ?
This is a fairly common trick in Scala to avoid the definition of a full - blown class just for the sake of adding a method to an existing type .
To break down what ’s going on here , we have defined an implicit type conversion from any type T to our anonymous inner class .
This conversion will be inserted by the compiler whenever we invoke the ? : operator on an expression .
Sharp - eyed developers will notice something a little odd about the way this code is structured .
In fact , if you look closely , it seems that we evaluate the right operand and use its value if non-null ( otherwise left ) , which is exactly the opposite of what our specification defines .
For a normal operator , this observation would be quite correct .
However , Scala defines the associatively of operators based on the trailing symbol .
In this case , because our trailing symbol is a colon ( : ) , the operator itself will be right - associative .
Thus , the following expression :
check ? : alternate
… is transformed by the compiler into the following :
alternate .? : ( check )
This is how right - associative operators function , by performing method calls on the right operand .
Thus , we need to define our implicit conversion such that the ? : method will be defined for the right operand , taking the left operand as a parameter .
We ’ll see a bit later on how this can cause trouble , but for now , let ’s continue with the specification .
A Little Type Theory
The second property is a little tougher .
Type unification is one of those pesky issues that plague statically typed languages and are simply irrelevant in those with dynamic type systems .
The issue arises from the following question : what happens if the left and right operands are of different types ?
In Groovy , this is a non-issue because the value of the expression is simply dynamically typed according to the runtime type of the operand which is chosen .
However , Scala requires static type information , which means that we need to ensure that the static type of the expression is sound for either the left or the right operand ( since Scala does not have non-nullable types ) .
The best way to do this is to compute the least upper bound of the two types , an operation which is also known as minimal unification .
Consider the following hierarchy :
Now imagine that the left operand is of static type Apple , while the right operand is of static type Pear .
We need to find a static type which is safe for both of these .
Intuitively , this type would be Fruit , since it is a common superclass of both Apple and Pear .
Regardless of which expression is chosen at runtime , we will be able to polymorphically treat the value as a value of type Fruit .
The intuition in this case is quite correct .
In fact , it actually has a rigorous mathematical proof … which I wo n’t go into .
( queue sighs of relief )
One additional example should serve to really drive the point home .
Consider the scenario where the left operand has type Vegitable and the right operand has type Apple .
This is a bit trickier , but it recursively boils down to the same case .
The only common superclass between these two types is Object , due to the fact that the hierarchies are disjoint .
This operation is fairly easy to perform by hand given the full type hierarchy .
For that matter , it is n’t very difficult to write an algorithm which can efficiently compute the minimal unification of two types .
Unfortunately , we do n’t have that luxury here .
We cannot simply write code which is executed at compile time to determine type information , we must make use of the existing Scala type system in order to “ trick ” the compiler into inferring things for us .
We do this by making use of lower - bounds on type parameters .
With this in mind , we can ( finally ) make a first attempt at a well - typed implementation of the operator :
implicit def elvisOperator [ T ] ( alt : T ) = new { def ? : [ A > : T ] ( pred : A ) = if ( pred == null ) alt else pred }
The only thing we have changed is the type of the pred variable from T to a new type parameter , A .
This new type parameter is defined by the lower - bound T. Translated into English , the type expression reads something like the following :
Accept parameter pred of some type A which is a super - type of T .
The real magic of the expression is that pred need not be exactly of type A ; it could also be a subtype .
Thus , A is some generic supertype which encompasses both the types of the left and the right operands .
Fancy Parameter Types
This allows us to move onto the third property : only evaluate the right operand if the left is null .
This is the normal behavior for conditional expressions .
After all , you would n’t want your code performing an expensive operation ( such as grabbing data from a server somewhere ) just to throw away the result because a different branch of the conditional was chosen .
Actually , the bigger issue with ignoring this property ( as we have done so far ) is that the right operand may actually have side - effects .
Scala is n’t a pure functional language , so evaluating expressions that we do n’t need ( or worse , that the developer is n’t expecting ) can have extremely dire consequences .
Unfortunately , at first glance , there does n’t really seem to be a way to avoid this evaluation .
After all , we need to invoke the ? : method on something .
We could try using a left - associative operator instead ( such as C#’s ?? operator ) , but even that would n’t fully solve the problem as we would still need to pass the right operand as a parameter .
In short , it seems like we ’re stuck .
The good news is that Scala ’s designers chose to adopt an age - old construct known as “ pass - by - name parameters ” .
This technique dates all the way back to ALGOL ( possibly even further ) .
In fact , it ’s so old and obscure that I ’ve actually had professors tell me that it has been completely abandoned in favor of the more conventional pass - by - value ( what Java , C# , Scala and most languages use ) and pass - by - reference ( which is available in C++ ) .
Pass - by - name parameters are very much like normal parameters in that they are used to copy values from a calling scope into the method in question .
However , unlike normal parameters , they are evaluated on an as - needed basis .
This means that a pass - by - name parameter will only be evaluated if its value is required within the method called .
For example :
def doSomething ( a : => Int ) = 1 + 2 def createInteger ( ) = { println ( " Made integer " ) 42 } println ( " In the beginning ... " ) doSomething ( createInteger ( ) ) println ( " ... at the end " )
Counter to our first intuition , this will print the following :
In the beginning ... ... at the end
In other words , the createInteger method is never called !
This is because the value of the pass - by - name parameter in the doSomething method is never accessed , meaning that the value of the expression is not needed .
The a parameter is denoted pass - by - name by the => notation ( just in case you were wondering ) .
We can apply this to our implementation by changing the parameter of the implicit conversion from pass - by - value to pass - by - name :
implicit def elvisOperator [ T ] ( alt : => T ) = new { def ? : [ A > : T ] ( pred : A ) = if ( pred == null ) alt else pred }
The language - level implementation of the if / else conditional expression will ensure that the alt parameter is only accessed iff the value of pred is null , meaning we have finally satisfied all three properties .
We can check this by compiling and running our specification from earlier :
Specification " TernarySpecs " elvis operator should + use predicate when not null + use alternative when null + type correctly + infer join of types + only eval alternative when null Total for specification " TernarySpecs " : Finished in 0 second , 78 ms 5 examples , 6 assertions , 0 failure , 0 error
Conclusion
We now have a working implementation of Groovy ’s Elvis operator within Scala and we never had to move beyond simple API design .
Truly , one of Scala ’s greatest strengths is its ability to expression extremely complex constructs within the confines of the language .
This makes it uniquely well - suited to hosting internal domain - specific languages .
Using techniques similar to the ones I have outlined in this article , it is possible to define operations which would require compiler - level implementation in most languages .
The full source ( such as it is ) for the Elvis operator in Scala is available for download , along with a bonus implementation of C#’s ??
syntax ( just in case you prefer it ) .
The implementation differs slightly due to the fact that ?? is a left - associative operator , but the single - use ( unchained ) semantics are identical .
Enjoy !

So why do you want to do that ?
Perhaps you have the root file system on a read - only media , such as CD - ROM .
Or on a writable media which can only handle a limited number of writes , such as a CD - RW or flash disk .
It would also increase security since it will be more difficult ( though not impossible ) for some malware to infect your system .
I found out that it is possible to mount / read - only , but only after some tweaking .
Here is how I did it in Ubuntu 8.04 ( hardy ) desktop .
The first obvious step is to change the mount options to “ ro ” for / in /etc / fstab and reboot .
But the tweaking has to be done first , so do n’t reboot yet !
There are some locations in the file system which has to be writeable , the solution is to mount them as tmpfs .
After some experiments , I found out that I had to mount the following locations as tmpfs ( assuming that / dev is already mounted in an appropriate way ) :
/tmp
/media
/var/run
/var/lock
/var/tmp
/var / crash
/var/log
/var/lib/xkb
/var/lib/gdm
/var/lib/dhcp3 ( only if you use DHCP client )
( only if you use DHCP client ) / var / lib / nfs ( only if you use NFS client )
( only if you use NFS client ) / var / spool / cups
Ubuntu mounts / var / run and / var / lock as tmpfs by default , and this is done in /etc/init.d/mountkernfs.sh and /etc/init.d/mtab.sh .
Add this to /etc/init.d/mountkernfs.sh after the mounting of / var / lock :
domount tmpfs " " / var/tmp - omode =1777 , nodev , noexec , nosuid domount tmpfs " " / var / crash - omode=0755 , nodev , noexec , nosuid domount tmpfs " " /var/ spool / cups -omode=0710 , nodev , noexec , nosuid chgrp lp /var / spool / cups mkdir /var/spool/cups/tmp chmod 1770 /var/spool/cups/tmp chgrp lp /var/spool/cups/tmp domount tmpfs " " / var / log - omode=0755 , nodev , noexec , nosuid mkdir /var/log/apparmor mkdir /var/log/apt mkdir /var/log/cups mkdir /var/log/dist-upgrade mkdir /var/log/fsck mkdir /var/log/gdm mkdir /var/log/news mkdir /var/log/samba mkdir /var/log/unattended-upgrades domount tmpfs " " / var/lib/dhcp3 -omode=0755 ,nodev, noexec , nosuid domount tmpfs " " /var/lib/xkb -omode=0755 ,nodev, noexec , nosuid domount tmpfs " " / var/lib/gdm -omode=0755 ,nodev , noexec , nosuid mkdir /var/lib/gdm/.fontconfig domount tmpfs " " /var/lib/nfs -omode=0755 , nodev , noexec , nosuid mkdir /var/lib/nfs/sm mkdir /var/lib/nfs/sm.bak mkdir /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs domount tmpfs " " /tmp -omode=1777 , nodev, exec , nosuid touch /tmp/resolv.conf touch /tmp / adjtime # this is necessary to avoid that the above files are removed later in the boot process touch / tmp /. clean domount tmpfs " " / media - omode=0755 , nodev , noexec , nosuid #
The following lines are not necessary in 9.04 , perhaps not in 8.10 either mkdir / media / cdrom0 ln -s /media/ cdrom0 /media/cdrom mkdir /media/floppy0 ln -s /media/floppy0 /media / floppy mkdir /media / usbdisk
And add this to /etc / init.d/ mtab.sh after the handling of / var / lock :
domtab tmpfs / var/log " varlog " - omode=0755 , nodev , noexec , nosuid domtab tmpfs / var /tmp " vartmp " - omode =1777 , nodev , noexec , nosuid domtab tmpfs / var / crash " varcrash " - omode=0755 , nodev , noexec , nosuid domtab tmpfs /var/spool /cups " varspoolcups " - omode=0710 , nodev , noexec , nosuid domtab tmpfs /var/lib/dhcp3 " varlibdhcp3 " - omode=0755 , nodev , noexec , nosuid domtab tmpfs /var/lib/xkb " varlibxkb " - omode=0755 , nodev , noexec , nosuid domtab tmpfs /var/lib/gdm " varlibgdm " - omode=0755 , nodev , noexec , nosuid domtab tmpfs /var/lib/nfs " varlibnfs " - omode=0755 , nodev , noexec , nosuid domtab tmpfs /tmp " tmp " - omode =1777 , nodev , exec , nosuid domtab tmpfs /media " media " - omode=0755 ,nodev , noexec , nosuid
( I am not really sure what the actual purpose of / etc / init.d / mtab.sh is , perhaps it ’s not necessary to modify it . )
There are some files in /etc which have to be writeable :
/etc/mtab
/etc/adjtime
/etc/resolv.conf ( only if you use DHCP client and let it set DNS configuration )
I handle /etc / mtab by symlink it to / proc / mounts , that has some minor side - effects but I can live with it .
I handle /etc / adjtime and /etc/resolv.conf by symlinking them to /tmp .
In order for this to work , you have to patch the DHCP client ( dhcp3 - client ) accodring to this bug report .
You also have to mount / home read - write somewhere , and I would not recommend using tmpfs .
You can use a separate hard disk partition or NFS .
Finally it might be a good idea to set a password for the root account , this enables you to switch to a virtual console ( Ctrl – Alt – F1 ) and login as root if something goes wrong .
If you then do want to change anything , such as edit a file in /etc or install or upgrade a package , you can just remount / as read - write temporary ( assuming that the media actually is writeable ) :
sudo mount -o rw , noatime , remount /
and revert to read - only when finished :
sudo mount -o ro , noatime , remount /
Note that this setup is for a desktop system , it ’s probably not appropriate for a server .
Update :
If you have plenty of RAM ( such as at least 1 GB ) , then you can also mount / var / cache / apt as tmpfs .
That helps if you have limited free space on / and want to to a distribution upgrade .
Add this to /etc/init.d/mountkernfs.sh :
domount tmpfs " " /var / cache/apt -omode=0755 ,nodev , noexec , nosuid , size=1g mkdir -p /var/cache/apt/archives/partial
And add this to /etc/ init.d/mtab.sh :
domtab tmpfs /var / cache / apt " varcacheapt " - omode=0755 , nodev , noexec , nosuid , size=1g
SIX stabbed to death in just 24 hours as Blade Britain 's knife epidemic spirals out of control
Yusuf Miro , a 20 - year - old university student was stabbed to death in Walthamstow on Thursday night
The scourge of knife crime gripping Britain has reached new depths with six murders across the country in less than 24 hours .
Four of the killings were in London in an appalling day of bloodshed .
Meanwhile , another teenager is in hospital in serious condition tonight after being stabbed outside a branch of Blockbuster Video in Bolton .
The outburst of violence has prompted Gordon Brown to pledge he would introduce new measures to tackle the epidemic .
Describing the ' terrible stabbings ' in the past week as ' shocking and tragic ' , the Prime Minister promised new enforcement tactics and ' tough ' parenting programmes .
Scotland Yard chief Sir Ian Blair was also forced to issue a reassurance to the public that his force was doing ' everything possible ' to stop the blight of knifings .
Boris Johnson , the London Mayor , voiced his ' deep regret ' at the deaths and said the ' long - term complex root causes of violence ' needed to be tackled .
An 18 - year - old man who died after being stabbed during a fight in Edmonton , north London was named by police today as Melvin Bryan .
The teenager received fatal wounds to his neck and chest during the confrontation at a bedsit in Gloucester Road , Edmonton , on Thursday .
His death took the number of teenagers to die violently in the capital since the beginning of the year to 20 .
Police were called to reports of a disturbance at the address close to Silver Street railway station at about 2.30 pm .
Mr Bryan , of Peckham , south east London , was taken to hospital for treatment but died of his injuries .
A man and woman were arrested in relation to the incident .
But they were later released with no further action .
Recent teenage knife victims in the city include 14 - year - old David Idowu , who died on Monday after being attacked three weeks earlier ; Shakilus Townsend , 16 , who was set upon by a gang in a suspected ' honeytrap ' killing ; Ben Kinsella , 16 , who died as he tried to break up a fight outside a bar ; 18 - year - old Harry Potter actor Rob Knox , and former altar boy Jimmy Mizen , 16 .
In the 24 - hour knife spree , a young man was struck down in Walthamstow , North - East London , after he popped out of his girlfriend 's flat to get food from a takeaway on Thursday evening .
Ben Kinsella was stabbed to death in June this year David Idowu was the 19th teenager stabbed to death in London this year
University student Yusuf Miiro , 20 , was stabbed in the head and chest in the stairwell by a man wearing a white ' Scream ' mask and a hoodie .
He managed to stagger back to the flat but collapsed inside .
Father - to - be Thomas Coombes Duffield , 20 , was repeatedly stabbed in the stomach after an argument on a leafy street in West Bromwich , West Midlands .
His distraught pregnant partner Stephanie yesterday left a bouquet of flowers at the scene with the words ' Always love you , my angel , love Steph ' n ' baby ' .
On Merseyside , fireman Anthony de Asha was arrested on suspicion of murdering his wife Joanne after she was found stabbed to death at their Crosby home .
The family of Adnan Patel , a 20 - year - old construction worker who was beaten and stabbed to death near his car in Leyton , East London , described him as a ' good man who did nothing wrong ' .
A 16 - year - old has been found guilty of stabbing Martin Dinnegan , above , to death
Witnesses described two gangs of men armed with golf clubs , baseball bats and knives flying at each other in a vicious street brawl on Thursday evening .
Scotland Yard are investigating whether the incident was drugs related .
Latvian Gennar Jaronis , 41 , was found with head injuries and slash wounds outside the squat where he lived , a disused pub in Tottenham ,
Two people have been arrested over the stabbing of the 19 - year - old victim in Edmonton .
Yet another man in his late 20s is in a critical condition with stab wounds to the back and stomach after being found by police at an address in Willesden , North - West London .
The shocking catalogue of killings emerged as a teenager was found guilty of the knife murder of 14 - year - old Martin Dinnegan .
The 16 - year - old stabbed the talented schoolboy in the back over a ' dirty look ' Martin had given him and his friends .
Martin's parents Lorraine and James , who have called on Gordon Brown to tackle Britain 's rampant knife culture , stormed out of court after three other teenagers were cleared of the killing .
Martin was the 15th teenager to be murdered in London in 2007 .
He was heading to a park on a bus in Holloway , North London , to meet some friends on June 26 last year , when glares were exchanged with a group of friends cycling on the street .
The boys followed the bus and when Martin got off , they clashed .
Voicing his horror at the stabbings , Mr Brown said that ' carrying a knife is unacceptable in our society ' .
He said : ' The terrible stabbings that have occurred this week are shocking and tragic , and my thoughts are with the families and friends of those who have been hurt or killed in these attacks .
' I have spoken to Sir Ian Blair ( Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police ) today about the situation in London , and I know the police are doing everything in their power to bring those responsible to justice . '
Sir Ian said : ' There has been a tragic death toll from knife crime in London over a 24 - hour period .
George Mizen holds a photo of his murdered brother Jimmy as he attends his funeral .
Jimmy was just one of 20 youngsters to be stabbed to death in London this year
' Each is an absolute tragedy and my thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims .
' These attacks are not connected nor do they all involve teenagers .
' Detectives have made arrests in three of the murders .
I want to reassure the public that the Metropolitan police is doing everything possible both in terms of thoroughly investigating each case and in continuing to carry out proactive operations to get knives off the streets .
' The dreadful loss of life in just 24 hours graphically illustrates the need for everyone to pull together to put an end to this unacceptable violence . '
Last week , Scotland Yard announced that tackling knife crime was its number one priority and revealed a 75 - strong task force .
Thousands of people have been stopped and searched in recent weeks as part of a police drive to deter young people from carrying knives .
Family and friends of Ben Kinsella marching to the scene of his murder in protest
Mr Johnson said : ' I deeply regret that four Londoners have lost their lives in these tragic incidents .
We need to do all we can to address the long - term complex root causes of violence as well as ensuring the police are providing an effective deterrent to those who carry knives and guns .
' We are in this together and we all need to take responsibility .
That 's why we are talking to the Government about bringing forward new measures next week that will help to address the underlying causes of knife violence . '
Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner Tim Godwin said he could understand why people perceive that knife crime is spiralling out of control .
But in reality , he said , only a tiny proportion of young people carry weapons .
Police research in those areas where stabbings are most prolific found just one in 50 young people carries a knife , and only 730 weapons were found during searches of 32,000 people during the recent anti-crime knife blitz .
Speaking on Sky News , Mr Godwin said : ' Our evidence indicates it is about two in 100 young people that we need to sort out , and I am convinced that London together with the police and other agencies will get to them .
' I am confident that if we maintain our resolve , work together , identify whoever it is and pursue them then we will make a difference in London . '
AMATEUR PORN STUDIO –
In light of a more upset and depressed American attitude , famous amateur pornography series “ Girls Gone Wild ” has set their sights on a new market .
The announcement came late thursday that their new series would be titled “ Parents Gone Wild ” and feature real college girls being mercilessly beaten by their parents after their appearance in “ Girls Gone Wild ” .
“ We ’ve seen a lot of drunk college girls get naked and go crazy . ” says lead producer , Eric Chokolowitz .
“ What we ’ve never seen is a lot of drunk college girls get naked and go crazy then go home and get savagely beaten then disowned .
It ’s new frontier for us . ”
Each video runs about two hours and features everything from parents screaming and arguing with their daughters to awkward conversations at family get - togethers .
All of the filming is done in real time and none of the scenes have been edited .
“ People want to see these parents baring it all as they punish their whore daughters .
One of the girl ’s fathers even took off his belt and then things started to get really nuts .
You would n’t even believe what her mother did next . ” says Chokolowitz .
True to statement , as we previewed one of the early cuts of the first Parents Gone Wild video , we were amazed to see real college girls being given time - outs and conversational scoldings from their parents .
Then things got really crazy when they were sent to their rooms to think about their shenanigans .
Despite having not yet released the first video of the series , Chokolowitz and his team are already filming for the sequel “ Parents Gone Wild : Barely Legal ” .
“ What we discovered while filming for the first video was that arguements and punishment was great .
Yet we wanted to see a more hardcore aspect of the parental take on these college girls . ” explained Chokolowitz on the set of his next film .
The sequel promises to take viewers behind the scenes to the most brutal suburban homes where enraged , psychopathic fathers take away their daughters cellphones and strip their allowances down to a meager $ 500 dollars a week .
Brutal .
As Chokolowitz sees it , “ This is about as intense as it gets , the only thing I can think that would be better , that would sell better , would be is if we could find some parents willing to actually kill their rambunctious teens and bury them in a shallow grave .
I ’d love to film that . ”
Both films are due out in early 2009 .

WASHINGTON ( Fortune ) --
The general campaign is on , independent voters are up for grabs , and Barack Obama is toning down his populist rhetoric - at least when it comes to free trade .
In an interview with Fortune to be featured in the magazine 's upcoming issue , the presumptive Democratic nominee backed off his harshest attacks on the free trade agreement and indicated he did n't want to unilaterally reopen negotiations on NAFTA .
" Sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified , " he conceded , after I reminded him that he had called NAFTA " devastating " and " a big mistake , " despite nonpartisan studies concluding that the trade zone has had a mild , positive effect on the U.S. economy .
Does that mean his rhetoric was overheated and amplified ?
" Politicians are always guilty of that , and I do n't exempt myself , " he answered .
Obama says he believes in " opening up a dialogue " with trading partners Canada and Mexico " and figuring to how we can make this work for all people . "
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said that Obama - as the candidate noted in Fortune 's interview - has not changed his core position on NAFTA , and that he has always said he would talk to the leaders of Canada and Mexico in an effort to include enforceable labor and environmental standards in the pact .
Nevertheless , Obama 's tone stands in marked contrast to his primary campaign 's anti-NAFTA fusillades .
The pact creating a North American free - trade zone was President Bill Clinton 's signature accomplishment ; but NAFTA is also the bugaboo of union leaders , grassroots activists and Midwesterners who blame free trade for the factory closings they see in their hometowns .
The Democratic candidates fought hard to win over those factions of their party , with Obama generally following Hillary Clinton 's lead in setting a protectionist tone .
In February , as the campaign moved into the Rust Belt , both candidates vowed to invoke a six - month opt - out clause ( " as a hammer , " in Obama 's words ) to pressure Canada and Mexico to make concessions .
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper called that threat a mistake , and other leaders abroad expressed worries about their trade deals .
Leading House Democrats , including Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel , distanced themselves from the candidates .
Now , however , Obama says he does n't believe in unilaterally reopening NAFTA .
On the afternoon that I sat down with him to discuss the economy , Obama said he had just spoken with Harper , who had called to congratulate him on winning the nomination .
" I 'm not a big believer in doing things unilaterally , " Obama said .
" I 'm a big believer in opening up a dialogue and figuring out how we can make this work for all people . "
Obama has repeatedly described himself as a free - trade proponent who wants to be a " better bargainer " on behalf of U.S. interests and wants agreements to include labor and environmental standards .
In May 2007 , congressional Democrats and the Bush administration agreed to a plan to include environmental and international labor standards in upcoming trade agreements .
Still , later that year Obama supported one agreement ( Peru ) and opposed three others ( Panama , Colombia , South Korea ) .
Labor leaders - many of whom backed Obama in the primary - were the chief opponents of those pacts .
Obama jumped into the anti-trade waters with Clinton even though his top economics adviser , the University of Chicago 's Austan Goolsbee , has written that America 's wage gap is primarily the result of a globalized information economy - not free trade .
On Feb .
8 , Goolsbee met with the Canadian consul general in Chicago and offered assurances that Obama 's rhetoric was " more reflective of political maneuvering than policy , " according to a Canadian memo summarizing the meeting that was obtained by Fortune .
" In fact , " the Canadian memo said , Goolsbee " mentioned that going forward the Obama camp was going to be careful to send the appropriate message without coming off as too protectionist . "
In the Fortune interview , Obama noted that despite his support for opening markets , " there are costs to free trade " that must be recognized .
He noted that under NAFTA , a more efficient U.S. agricultural industry displaced Mexican farmers , adding to the problem of illegal immigration .
We " ca n't pretend that those costs are n't real , " Obama added .
Otherwise , he added , it feeds " the protectionist sentiment and the anti-immigration sentiment that is out there in both parties . "
Obama also reiterated his determination to be a tougher trade bargainer .
" The Chinese love free trade , " he said , " but they are tough as nails when it comes to a bargain , right ?
They will resist any calls to stop manipulating their currency .
It 's no secret they have consistently encroached on our intellectual property and our copyright laws .
... We should make sure in our trade negotiations that our interests and our values are adequately reflected . "
Republican nominee John McCain , for his part , is emphasizing his consistent position as a free - trader .
In a press conference in Boston this week , he attacked Obama as protectionist : " Senator Obama said that he would unilaterally - unilaterally !
- renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement , where 33 percent of our trade exists .
And you know what message that sends ?
That no agreement is sacred if someone declares that as president of the United States they would unilaterally renegotiate it .
I stand for free trade , and with all the difficulties and economic troubles we 're in today , there 's a real bright spot and that 's our exports .
Protectionism does not work . "
“ Operating systems come with cultures as much as codebases .
I was forcibly reminded of this fact over the holidays when several family members and neighbors press - ganged me into troubleshooting their Windows computers .
Although none of us had any formal computer training , and I know almost nothing about Windows , I was able to solve problems that baffled the others – not because of any technical brilliance , but because the free software culture in which I spend my days made me better able to cope . ”
Dalai Lama marks his 73rd birthday
DHARAMSHALA , India ( AFP )  Exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama marked his 73rd birthday Sunday with a small function , but with the mood dampened by a lack of progress in talks with China .
Officials said the usual cultural performances were not held this year in Dharamshala , a northern Indian hill town and home to the exiled Tibetan government , due to the unrest in Tibet earlier this year .
There was a small temple gathering attended by the prime minister of the Tibetan government - in - exile Samdhong Rinpoche , while the Dalai Lama held a low - key function for relatives and Tibetan officials at his home , aides said .
Rinpoche said the Tibetan exile community was disappointed by the lack of any progress during talks between the Dalai Lama 's envoys and China earlier in the week .
" The seventh round of talks has not produced any tangible results .
The Chinese selfish attitude is only adding to the existing doubts about their insincerity for future talks , " Rinpoche said .
He also voiced regret that China had repeated allegations that the Dalai Lama incited the riots in Tibet in March in order to sabotage the Beijing Olympics .
" The Dalai Lama is a messenger of peace and non-violence .
He follows a middle path policy , which does not seek separation of Tibet from China and does support the Beijing Olympics , " Rinpoche said .
He also used the function to call for China to stop the alleged arrests and torture of Tibetans and the " re-education and getting forced confessions " from Buddhist monks .
The Dalai Lama , who has said he opposes Tibetan independence , has called for " real and meaningful autonomy " for the region and an end to what he has said are widespread human rights violations against his people .
Rinpoche said the next talks with Beijing were scheduled for October .
Beijing has accused the Dalai Lama of fomenting unrest in the Tibetan region that erupted on March 14 after four days of peaceful protests against Chinese rule .
The Tibetan government - in - exile says 203 Tibetans were killed and about 1,000 hurt in China 's crackdown .
Beijing insists that only one Tibetan was killed , and has in turn accused the " rioters " of killing 21 people .
China has ruled Tibet since 1951 , a year after sending troops in to " liberate " the region .
先日のET-WEST2008（組込み総合技術展 関西）にてXPJUG関西コミュニティパネルセッションのパネラーとしてお話してきました。
「 組込みアジャイル開発の現 場 ～事例から見える効果と課題～」というお題だったのですが、僕自身が組込み業界の人ではないので事例を紹介することはできなかったのですが、アジャイル開発者として僕が普段から心がけていることや考え方、こうすればうまくいくといったコツを「アジャイルスピリッツ」という形で紹介しました。
最初、会場の方に質問をしたのですが、「開発が大好きだー」という方の手があまりあがらなかったのが残念でした。
僕は開発が大好きです。プログラムも大好きです。モノづくりが大好きです。
だから、この業界に入ったんです。
そんなハート（気持ち）を忘れたくないなと思って質問しました。
今回は、パネルディスカッションの場だったので時間は短かったのですが、それでも会場の人にエッセンスだけでも伝わったんじゃないかなと思います。
発表した内容をまとめておきます。
■アジャイル開発に対してよくある質問
僕なりに回答をまとめててみました。
Ｑ：アジャイルって最初からきっちり計画やドキュメントを作らないんでしょ？
Ａ：無計画ではありません。変化を取り入れて計画を柔軟に変更していくのがアジャイルです。
Ｑ：アジャイルって優秀な人を集めないと、できないでしょ？
Ａ：プロフェッショナルじゃなくてもいいんです。プロフェッショナルになりたいと思っている人を集めましょう。
Ｑ：なんでアジャイル開発する必要あるの？
Ａ：現状のやりかたでうまくいってるのであれば、無理にアジャイル開発する必要ありません。
Ｑ：パネラーの人ってアジャイル開発者でしょ。あの人に頼めば何でもうまくいくんじゃないの？
Ａ：そんなことは絶対にありません！いつも苦労してますよ(汗
■アジャイルな開発サイクル
僕がやっている開発のサイクルを紹介しました。
リリース毎、イテレーション毎、日々のフィードバックが変化を吸収してくれます。
■アジャイル開発者の習慣から学ぶ
アジャイルプラクティスの本を紹介したのですが、会場の方でこの本を読んだ人が２・３人しかいなかったので強くアピールしておきました。(笑
そして、このプラクティスの悪魔の囁きと天使の助言を使って、寸劇を会場の人を巻き込んでやっちゃいました。
（イメージは、桜塚やっくんスタイルだったのですが、やはりアドリブは難しいですね(^^;）
■ Webサービス開発のノウハウを組み込みに活かす
より小さく、より速くソフトウェアを構築する方法として、Getting Realの考え方を紹介しました。
僕は、このアプローチはまさにアジャイルだと思っています。
機能を上げようとするのではなく、無駄を省きましょう。
あなたが本気になるツールを作りましょう。
アプリケーション構築はイヤイヤ行ってはいいものはできません。楽しみながらやりましょう。
達成の喜びを随所で感じられる様にしましょう。
■まとめ
アジャイル開発は現場によってできない時もあります。
しかし、アジャイルスピリッツを持って開発することはできるのです。
少しでもフィードバックサイクルを作るようにしましょう。
そして、チームの仲間と情熱を絶やさずに開発しましょう
アジャイル開発の本質は、そこにあると思います。

May the Agile be with you !
If it 's the first of the month , it 's time for me to be accused of being an indentured servant of web metrics firm Net Applications .
Nonetheless , data from thousands of web sites and millions of visitors make it at least possible to follow trends and , more importantly , have something to make pretty graphs with .
And the graph is indeed looking good for Mac OS X .
At 7.96 percent , Mac OS X will surely break 8 percent market share sometime this month , a gain of a third in just a year , and a truly astounding accomplishment for Apple .
By platform , Intel Macs saw their numbers jump by a quarter of a percent to 5.26 percent , while PPC graybeards declined to 2.7 percent .
For doomsayers grasping at upgraders to explain the gains , Intel Macs increased at twice the pace of decline for PPC Macs .
The rapid decline of PPC Macs coupled with sharp gains for Intel Macs no doubt factored into the decision to make Snow Leopard Intel only .
See , we did learn something from Net Applications , and it's not the only thing .
Safari modestly increased its market share , from 6.25 to 6.32 percent total ; however , Safari for Windows saw no gain after last month 's surge from nothing to nearly nothing at 0.28 percent , that surge being a one - time Software Update trick .
Safari for Windows will likely now return to obscurity where it belongs .
The big news for the Apple browser is that Safari 4.0 is being used by enough developers or crazy people running torrented copies of Snow Leopard to register on the graph .
Sure , it 's only 0.01 percent , but it still counts .
Regarding the iPhone , an amusing aside has validated Net Application 's choice to list the iPhone as an OS , rather than a mobile version of Safari under browsers .
Last month , banners at WWDC proudly displayed " OS X iPhone " from the rafters of Moscone Center .
As for the numbers , the iPhone remains stuck at 0.16 percent , at least partially due to Apple running out of iPhones in May .
No doubt the release of the iPhone 3G will boost the iPhone 's meager market share , though the launch date of July 11 may mean we wo n't see the numbers reflected until the August report is released .
Overall , another in a seemingly endless run of good months for the Mac .
Expect these soft numbers for market share to be validated by hard ones when Apple announces its third quarter earnings this month .
The RIAA 's extensive campaign against filesharing has drawn in a lot of individuals , but college campuses have remained a major target of the content owners ' legal threats .
It 's pretty clear that there 's significant expertise with filesharing on college campuses , so it should n't come as a surprise that this expertise has been put to use with other copyrighted materials .
Textbook companies are getting worried about the sharing of their bread - and - butter online , and have started a campaign designed to block the sharing at its source .
Textbook Torrents ( catchphrase : " because you can't torrent beer " ) is one of the sites mentioned in a report by The Chronicle of Higher Education , and its administrators clearly view themselves as providing a public good .
The site 's rules page exhorts users who 've saved money by downloading texts there to go out and spend the equivalent money on a scanner .
" Scan as many of your other textbooks as you can , and put them up here for others to benefit from , " it reads .
" There are n't very many scanned texts out there , so let 's change that . "
Anyone who manages to find all their books through the site are encouraged to go out and buy a text simply to contribute it to TT 's collection .
The site urges users to contribute as much as they get with a somewhat ironic exhortation : " Karma will pay you back , sooner or later . "
Indeed , it apparently has .
The front page announces that they 've recently had to pull a number of torrent links due to a request from Pearson Education , an academic publisher .
Although the administrator suggested the request was on " extremely shaky legal ground , " the announcement included a vow to prevent the server logs from becoming public , suggesting that TT is aware that it 's abetting activities that could land people in legal hot water .
This is also clear from the fact that they reject access from IP addresses identified in Peer Guardian 's database of copyright enforcement groups . *
Also mentioned was the Scribd online document sharing service .
A quick search for the term " Genetics " revealed a variety of copyrighted materials there , ranging from Genetics for Dummies up to all 1,367 pages of Genetics : Principles and Analysis .
Scribd takes a very different view of copyright than Textbook Torrents , promising to remove any content that is uploaded without the copyright holder 's permission and banning users that repeatedly run afoul of that rule .
Still , it 's very clear that , in the absence of Scribd being notified of infringing materials , these sorts of violations proliferate .
So far , publishers have largely acted on an ad hoc basis and targeted the sites making the material available , rather than the students themselves .
They also seem to be content with takedown requests , rather than more aggressive legal actions .
The lack of more aggressive action , however , may be the result of the relatively small magnitude of the problem .
In contrast to ripping an MP3 , scanning a textbook is a major task that requires a significant personal involvement , placing it beyond the attention span of many college students .
That barrier to the availability of the material is unlikely to last .
More publishers are working to make their materials available to universities in electronic form ; the Genetics text mentioned above appears to have been a professionally prepared PDF .
As access to electronic texts increases , problems with their sharing will likely rise in parallel .
* Update :
This statement has since been removed from the site 's FAQ , and its administrators claim that this practice ended a while ago .

Katie Holmes has hardly left Tom Cruise 's side since they began dating in April 2005 .
However , that support has caused her much grief .
According to one Hollywood insider , the actress , who gave birth to daughter Suri Cruise last year , has been told by her kooky husband to attend " mommy classes " taught by Scientology " handlers . "
" There are parenting classes , " a Scientology source confirms .
" Katie Holmes was quite offended by that , " the source tells Us Weekly .
" Can you imagine when you 're 28 and have your first child to be told you need to go to this church to become a better mom ? "
Holmes now finds herself surrounded by fellow Scientologists , an exception being Victoria Beckham , who one Hollywood insider describes as " her link to the outside world . "
Wow .
We 've talked before about Holmes ' battle and how she is a prisoner without bars .
But when Victoria Beckham is your link to the outside world ... that 's pretty f*%ked up .
From the time TomKat began dating , the actress - who , pre-Tom Cruise , did interviews without a publicist - has been assigned a Scientology " minder , " whose job , according to a Scientology expert , is " to make sure that nothing is said or done that would be critical of the church . "
In fact , virtually everyone on the couple 's staff is a member of the Church of Scientology .
" Everyone who works with Tom is technically minding Katie , " a source dished .
So why does Katie stay ?
What will Suri Cruise 's life be like growing up as a Scientologist ?
What did Tom 's ex , Nicole Kidman , think about all this ?
Only time will tell , celebrity gossip followers .
Only time will tell .

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Scientists in Japan have gained a better understanding how influenza viruses replicate , possibly opening the way for the development of drugs to hamper their reproduction .
In the latest issue of Nature , the researchers described how they zeroed in on an enzyme that flu viruses need to replicate , and managed to capture a snapshot of the enzyme .
Enzymes in influenza viruses are made up of three proteins bound tightly together .
" Scientists have been trying to study its ( enzyme's ) structure and no one has yet got a detailed picture of the whole thing , " said Yokohama City University 's Jeremy Tame , a member of the research team .
But the team managed to crystallize the proteins and get a peek at part of the structure , which involves the tip of one of the proteins coming into contact with another protein .
" This gives us some hope that we can interrupt this interface ( contact point ) , " Tame said .
Such an interruption would " kill the virus , or slow it down sufficiently , " he added .
All influenza A viruses , including the H5N1 bird flu virus , are believed to have similar structures .
Theoretically , one drug could fight all of them .
" We would like to start work .
We 're hopeful that will lead to efforts to work on completely novel drugs , " Tame said .

The Pentagon announced on Friday that it was suspending its briefings for retired military officers who often appear as military analysts on television and radio programs .
A spokesman for the Pentagon said the briefings and all other interactions with the military analysts had been suspended indefinitely pending an internal review .
On Sunday , The New York Times reported that since 2002 the Pentagon has cultivated several dozen military analysts in a campaign to generate favorable coverage of the administration ’s wartime performance .
The retired officers have made tens of thousands of appearances for television and radio networks , holding forth on Iraq , Afghanistan , detainee issues and terrorism in general .
Records and interviews show that the Bush administration worked to transform the analysts into an instrument intended to shape coverage from inside the major networks .
CHINA has entered a new phase in its modern - day scramble for Africa by moving to rebuild 3300 kilometres of roads in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
The project is part of China 's largest single investment in Africa - a $ A9.2 billion services - for - minerals deal signed in January .
China has also promised to repair more than 3000 kilometres of largely defunct railways , build 32 hospitals and 145 health centres , install two electricity distribution networks , and construct two hydroelectric dams and two airports .
In return , it has won the rights to five copper and cobalt mines in the Congo 's southern minerals belt .
The deal extends Beijing 's dominance over parts of Africa previously allied to the West .

Are you sold on the fake notion that owning possessions is the touchstone of your self - worth ?
Have you felt jealous and self - pity when a neighbor bought a new Mercedes or a new Yacht that you always wanted to possess ?
We all have .
If your paycheck is not keeping up the pace with your cravings for the new iphone , why not learn the secrets of simplicity from the richest man on the earth who still lives without a cell phone ?
Before you sink your money for the latest gadget what if you were to know that the Oracle of Omaha still has no desk computer in his modest office ?
In this world full of the rich and famous , Warren Buffett remains the greatest investor ever born not due to his acumen for the wise investments that he has made during his life but more for exemplifying the greatness with simplicity .
He ’s full of wit and happiness and this is at the core of everything that he does .
Secret # 1 : Happiness comes from within .
In my adult business life I have never had to make a choice of trading between professional and personal .
I tap - dance to work , and when I get there it ’s tremendous fun . - Warren Buffett
This is the man who truly does what he loves .
The battle between Productivity and anti-productivity blogs stems from their convoluted chains of frequently twisted rational to substantiate their claim that productivity is a force of an external demand – from an employer or a competitor .
In reality , productivity comes from within .
It comes from doing what we love and loving what we do .
When we start trading time between our professional and personal life , we wage war in our own mind to justify our passion in terms of a personal benefit .
In my business I have felt more stress and angst when I have n’t given all of my talent , hard work and passion to help others on a given day .
The myth of working hard to make more money to buy more things throws us in the vicious circle of hallucination .
Our happiness always remains imprisoned when we do work that we abhor yet justify doing it to pay bills for those things that we do n’t need .
I used to work even after buying my first hotel for many years to justify the fake notion that I needed additional income to pay bills .
What I needed was to change my lifestyle to free myself from this never - ending rut chase .
Secret # 2
Find happiness in simple pleasures .
I have simple pleasures .
I play bridge online for 12 hours a week .
Bill and I play , he ’s “ chalengr ” and I ’m “ tbone ” .
— Warren Buffett
If the man richer than God can find happiness in the simple pleasure of playing bridge online with another billionaire , I have to learn to be happy with the simple pleasures of playing cards with friends or playing with my children or taking a walk in the wilderness .
All of these simple pleasures do not need extravagant spending .
I used to go play golf with other businessmen when the local chamber of commerce sponsored an event .
I never found happiness in those events as they were centered on generating more business and exchanging business cards than on truly enjoying the moment .
I was allowing myself to be run ragged by trading business cards after hours in a vain hope of making more money whereas that time deserved a dinner with my family .
Secret # 3
Live a simple life .
I just naturally want to do things that make sense .
In my personal life too , I do n’t care what other rich people are doing .
I do n’t want a 405 foot boat just because someone else has a 400 foot boat .
— Warren Buffett
The sad truth is that our ever - sophisticated advertising industry has conditioned our mind to find happiness from consumption by spending our hard earned money on the possessions that never bring us lasting happiness .
We spend our life - energy on those possessions that we seldom use .
We worry about making payments for a luxury car that sits in our garage collecting dust only for the right to brag about it in an occasional social gathering .
Keeping up with the Joneses is the worst epidemic among those who should never contemplate that notion in the first place .
If a man who can possibly buy a nation with his cash never espouses the mantra of “ more the better ” , I need to learn not to spread my legs beyond the reach of the blanket .
We are conditioned to spend money before we earn it .
We are sold on the fake happiness of “ Buy now , pay later dearly ” –
It ’s nothing more than buying possessions that we cannot afford .
I have my share of insanity when it comes to mindless spending , but lately I try to pay for most of my purchases with cash .
It creates awareness towards the impulse buy when I pay by cash .
I have also started red lining items on the credit card statement that I consider useless spending .
All of these efforts have built my awareness towards my impulse purchases .
I have been using mantra of – “ less is more ” to simplify every aspect of my life .
It ’s a work in progress but the results are astounding .
Secret # 4 Think Simply .
“ I want to be able to explain my mistakes .
This means I do only the things I completely understand . ” – Warren Buffett
There lies one of the greatest secrets of simplicity .
Warren Buffett invests only in the businesses that he understands .
If you ever read research reports from an accomplished Wall Street guru , you ’ll find a plethora of details that make you dizzy .
The success of Warren Buffett as the greatest investor ever lies in his ability to think simply .
I used to invest in the stock market in the mid 90’s when everyone wanted to make over night millions in an exuberant market .
I used to read “ Investor ’s Business Daily ” only to look at the movers and shakers .
These were the stocks that made a significant upward move a day before .
A few days before Christmas , I made $ 52,000 in one stock in a matter of a few days .
I knew nothing about the company .
I created a new reality for my thoughts that I had figured out how the Wall Street works .
I was on my way to the riches .
I applied the same thought model on the next several stocks .
Needless to say , I lost all that I made and much more .
I was lacking in a basic human quality that Warren Buffett has mastered well – common sense .
It says a great deal about the character of a man who invested a measly amount in Microsoft despite the fact that Bill Gates is one of his closest friends .
I learned a valuable lesson of life from this experience – “ Not losing hard earned money is far more important than making more money ” .
If I apply this rule in my life , I can develop clarity and sanity in my thoughts .
Clarity is the mother of simplicity .
Life is not a roulette ; life is about simple yet profound choices .
Secret # 5 Invest Simply .
The best way to own common stocks is through an index fund .
– Warren Buffett
It is astounding to know that the greatest investor in the world is not bragging about intricate financial maneuvering to impress the rest of the world with his financial genius .
Instead , Warren Buffett shows us the most simplistic approach to our financial freedom – “ Flow with the market rather than pretending to be smarter than God . ”
In this world full of so - called financial experts , Warren stands tall by showing us the simplest way to the riches .
The stock market has moved upward for the last hundred years despite numerous setbacks .
He is using a long historical view to back his argument rather than making a futile effort to predict how we can make a quick fortune .
After losing most of my capital in the late 90’s , I have precisely followed the simple advice of investing in the no-load index funds .
I ’m happier than ever and while my assets have not skyrocketed , they have n’t dwindled either .
Secret # 6
Have a mentor in life .
I was lucky to have the right heroes .
Tell me who your heroes are and I ’ll tell you how you ’ll turn out to be .
The qualities of the one you admire are the traits that you , with a little practice , can make your own , and that , if practiced , will become habit - forming .
– Warren Buffett
We are worshipers of celebrity demi-gods .
All of us have this acute desire to look and live like these celebrities .
However , are they truly the ones with character and moral compass to lead us ?
Having a mentor is as important as having a purpose in our life but having a wrong mentor is as devastating as having a wrong purpose in our life .
The mentor has to be someone whom we can trust and have an unwavering faith in his / her guidance .
The mentor has to be the one who has made outstanding strides in advancing the greater and guiding purpose of happiness in his / her own life .
You ’ll find that person in your inner circle if you think hard enough .
Write down why you admire them .
Try to emulate their traits and as Warren has shown by his exemplary life , with a little practice , you can form a habit to clone the life that you admire the most .
Secret # 7
Making money is n’t the backbone of our guiding purpose ; making money is the by - product of our guiding purpose .
If you ’re doing something you love , you ’re more likely to put your all into it , and that generally equates to making money .
– Warren Buffett
How do you rationalize the richest man on the earth still living in a small 3 - bedroom house that he purchased fifty years ago ?
Warren Buffett never travels in a private jet despite the fact that he owns the largest private jet company .
His character and way of life speak volume about his greatness .
This is the man who spent his personal time investigating a $ 4 line item on his tax return to hunt down the specifics of it while giving away billions of dollars to Bill Gates foundation .
It is rare to find the richest man on the earth living without luxuries that we want to possess even by mortgaging our future .
He has demonstrated that while valuing the worth of money is vital for our ingenuity and success , money shall never become the object and end all of our motivation .
I ’m an avid admirer of simplicity , but I ’m an even bigger fan of the man who has mastered the greatness by living and breathing simplicity amid an ocean of wealth .
Do you agree ?
Promo albums are marked in a variety of different ways Music giant Universal Music Group has lost a court battle to stop an eBay trader from reselling promotional CDs he had bought from second hand stores .
Troy Augusto makes money by snapping up rare albums and selling them on the online auction site .
Universal accused him of copyright infringement , saying some of the items he offered were promotional copies and not authorised for sale to the public .
But a US judge ruled that Mr Augusto had the right to sell the CDs .
Universal said it planned to appeal against the ruling and was confident that it would win .
" We believe that the court 's analysis is incorrect in a number of critical respects , " a spokesman said .
The outcome applies only to US law , but observers say the case has been watched keenly in the UK .
The ruling comes as a UK - based DJ was arrested on suspicion of selling more than 150 pre-release albums on eBay , weeks before their official release .
If charges were brought , it is thought it would be the first case of its kind in the UK .
' Important ruling ' Dismissing the American case , US District Court Judge S James Otero said that Mr Augusto was protected by the " first sale " doctrine in copyright law .
This says that once a copyright owner gives away a copy of a CD , DVD or book , the recipient is entitled to sell it on .
This ruling affirms and protects the traditional balance between the copyright owners and the rights of the public

Music ' goblins ' in copyright war Specialist music shops often sell promo albums or review copies that record labels send out to journalists and radio stations before the regular editions go on sale .
Record companies have long maintained that they continue to own these items and can ask for them back at any time .
They can be recognised by markings such as " For promotional use only " or " Not for resale " , visible on the record or CD artwork and sometimes on the disc label itself .
But the judge said that such labelling did not alter the legal position .
The digital rights lobby group , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which backed Mr Augusto said it was a " very important ruling for consumers " .
" This ruling affirms and protects the traditional balance between the copyright owners and the rights of the public , " said the EEF 's Corynne McSherry .
Among the promotional items listed as sold by Mr Augusto , according to the legal brief , are titles of CD singles by Nelly Furtado and rap group Bone Thugs - N - Harmony .
The IFPI , which represents the recording industry internationally said that pre-release piracy caused " serious damage to the performers , creators and producers of music " .
" People who have access to pre-release music by virtue of their job , and who sell or distribute it illegally , should note that record companies large and small are taking a zero tolerance approach to such activity , " sad the IFPI 's chief executive John Kennedy .

What are these ?

BBC News , Sydney
A sticky substance allows infected blood cells to stick to the blood vessels Australian scientists have identified a potential treatment to combat malaria .
Researchers in Melbourne believe their discovery could be a major breakthrough in the fight against the disease .
The malaria parasite produces a glue - like substance which makes the cells it infects sticky , so they cannot be flushed through the body .
The researchers have shown removing a protein responsible for the glue can destroy its stickiness , and undermine the parasite 's defence .
The malaria parasite - Plasmodium falciparum - effectively hijacks the red blood cells it invades , changing their shape and physical properties dramatically .
Among the changes it triggers is the production of the glue - like substance , which enables the infected cells to stick to the walls of the blood vessels .
This stops them being pased through the spleen , where the parasites would usually be destroyed by the immune system .
Painstaking tests
The Australian team developed mutant strains of P. falciparum , each lacking one of 83 genes known or predicted to play a role in the red cell remodeling process .
Systematically testing each one , they were able to show that eight proteins were involved in the production of the key glue - like substance .
Removing just one of these proteins stopped the infected cells from attaching themselves to the walls of blood vessels .
Professor Alan Cowman , a member of the research team at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research , said targeting the protein with drugs - or possibly a vaccine - could be key to fighting malaria .
" If we block the stickiness we essentially block the virulence or the capacity of the parasite to cause disease , " he said .
Malaria is preventable and curable , but can be fatal if not treated promptly .
The disease kills more than a million people each year .
Many of the victims are young children in sub-Saharan Africa .

US Treasury plan shields Wall Street speculators
By Andre Damon and Barry Grey
1 April 2008
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Monday presented a broad plan to revamp the American financial regulatory system .
The proposal , while giving the Federal Reserve Board expanded trouble - shooting powers over financial markets and institutions , would actually weaken federal oversight of Wall Street investment banks and leave virtually untouched the vast , unregulated secondary , or “ derivatives , ” markets .
Speaking barely two weeks after the Fed intervened to prevent the bankruptcy of the investment bank Bear Stearns and announced massive loans to other Wall Street firms to avert a meltdown of the financial system , Paulson ’s “ Blueprint for Financial Regulatory Reform ” underscores the determination of the most powerful sections of the financial establishment to block any measures that would limit their ability to generate profits and multi-million - dollar compensation packages from various forms of financial speculation .
Paulson largely cast the proposal as a response to the bursting of the US housing bubble and the subprime mortgage crisis that have resulted in tens of billions of dollars in losses for major banks and a crisis of confidence in the entire US credit system .
In fact , his department began drafting the plan last spring as a proposal to further deregulate the American financial system and make it even more profitable and more competitive against foreign rivals in Europe and elsewhere .
Paulson , a former Nixon aide and Wall Street executive , has long advocated further moves to limit government regulation of the banks and financial houses .
He was the CEO of Goldman Sachs , the biggest US investment bank , before taking over as Bush ’s treasury secretary in 2006 , and personally benefited from the fast - and - loose risk - taking on Wall Street that was encouraged under both Republican and Democratic administrations .
His compensation package , according to reports , was $ 37 million in 2005 and $ 16.4 million projected for 2006 .
His net worth has been estimated at over $ 700 million .
Not surprisingly , neither in Paulson ’s remarks nor in the 214 pages of the plan he released is there any suggestion that Wall Street firms or their top executives be called to account and held legally culpable for the economic and social disaster that has resulted from their reckless and often deceptive , if not outright illegal , policies and actions .
Paulson ’s remarks contained the typical euphemisms employed to mask the depth of the economic crisis .
“ Markets are pricing and reassessing risk , ” he said , referring to the collapse of the massively inflated values of securities backed by subprime mortgages and other forms of speculation .
He sought to reassure Wall Street by declaring , “ I am not suggesting that more regulation is the answer , ” and hailed the repeal in 1999 of the Glass - Steagall Act as a great advance .
Glass - Steagall , passed at the height of the Great Depression in 1933 in response to revelations of swindling and fraud by major banks and financial houses , made it illegal for a commercial bank , which accepts deposits from individuals , to also function as an investment bank .
The removal of this restriction contributed to the super - heated speculative environment that led to the current financial crisis .
He also declared , “ I do not believe it is fair or accurate to blame our regulatory structure for the current market turmoil . ”
This “ blameless ” structure allowed , for example , credit - rating agencies , paid by financial firms to rate securities issued by the same firms , to give AAA ratings to subprime - backed debt , and accounting firms to allow mortgage lenders to book losses as profits .
The Treasury Department blueprint is divided into proposals for the near , medium and long term .
In the near - term , it calls for an expansion of the authority and membership of the President ’s Working Group on Financial Markets , which was initiated following the stock market crash of 1987 and presently includes the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , the treasury secretary , the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
The plan also calls for the establishment of a Mortgage Origination Commission to increase federal oversight over the licensing and conduct of mortgage brokers .
Intermediate - term recommendations include greater Federal Reserve oversight of US payment and settlement systems , and the merger of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) .
This latter proposal would effectively lessen federal oversight of stock , bond and commodities exchanges as well as investment banks , since the more lax procedures of the CFTC would prevail .
The plan also calls for measures to increase federal oversight of insurance companies and closing down of the Office of Thrift Supervision , which presently oversees savings and loans institutions .
In the longer - term , which Paulson acknowledged would take years to carry through , the Treasury plan envisions a tri-partite federal regulatory system , with the Fed largely stripped of its current day - to - day oversight of commercial banks and instead given expanded powers to trouble - shoot over the entire array of financial institutions and markets .
Under the Treasury plan , the Fed could inspect the books of any bank , investment bank , hedge fund , private equity firm or insurance company and order remedial action — such as greater capital reserves — but only if the Fed deemed the practices of the company in question to pose a “ systemic threat ” to the financial system .
The Fed ’s current role in overseeing commercial banks and other depository institutions would be taken over by a new Prudential Financial Regulator .
Significantly , the mandate of this new agency would not extend to investment banks , even though investment banks have now been given access to government - backed loans at the Fed ’s discount window .
Finally , there would be a Conduct of Business Regulator to oversee the conduct of financial firms to protect consumers and investors .
The immense growth of the American financial sector over the past several decades was fueled by a series of asset bubbles and made possible by the US dollar ’s preeminent role in the structure of world capitalism , which allowed the US to run deficits and accumulate imbalances of a size unthinkable in any other country .
But the period in which the US ruling elite could rack up profits while letting its infrastructure and productive capacity crumble was by its very nature transitory .
The current crisis represents the beginnings of a global readjustment and the formation of a new balance of economic power , to the detriment of American capitalism .
The current crisis is the culmination of a protracted decline in the global economic position of American capitalism , partially masked in the past by a vast growth of financial speculation and parasitism .
It is not , as Paulson said in his remarks on Monday , merely one of the “ periods of market stress ” that recur “ every five to ten years . ”
A serious scripting error has been discovered on PayPal that could enable attackers to create convincing spoof pages that steal users ' authentication credentials ..
The cross -site scripting bug is made all the more critical because it resides on a page that uses an extended validation secure sockets layer certificate .
The new - fangled SSL mechanism is designed to give users a higher degree of confidence that the page they 're visiting is secure by turning their browser address bar green .
But Finnish researcher Harry Sintonen figured out a way to inject his own code into a supposedly protected PayPal page even as the green bar lulled visitors into believing it had n't been tampered with .
Sintonen 's code simply caused an Internet Explorer alert window to open with the words " Is it safe ? " as evidenced by the screenshot below .
During an online interview , he demonstrated a page that prompted users for their account credentials and then sent them to an unauthorized server , and he said it would be possible for him to steal user cookies as well .
All the while , the address bar would bear the PayPal URL in green .
At time of publication , eBay had not yet removed the buggy code .
A statement from PayPal said the company considers user security a top priority .
" As soon as we were informed of this exploit , we began working very quickly to shut it down , " the statement read .
" To our knowledge , this exploit was not used in any phishing attacks " .
Unauthorized withdrawals or purchases made on PayPal accounts are fully reimbursed .
The discovery is one more reason to remain skeptical of extended validation SSL , which has always struck us as a solution in search of a problem .
Yes , we know it 's supposed to close a loophole that 's long existed in SSL by certifying , in this case for example , that it is eBay ( the parent company of PayPal ) that owns the SSL certificate for the specific PayPal page .
But we 've not yet heard of a single attack involving a forged certificate , so we 're tempted to think the measure is more gimmick designed to generate revenue for VeriSign and its competitors than anything else .
e Bay security pros seem to have drunk the EV SSL Kool Aid , however , having announced recently ( PDF alert ) that browsers that do n't support the new standard are n't welcome on the PayPal site .
XSS vulnerabilities have emerged as one of the easier and more common ways to subvert website security measures .
They use manipulated URLs to get around the so - called same - origin policy , which prevents cookies and other types of content set by one domain from being accessed or manipulated by a different address .
Despite the proliferation of XSS attacks , McAfee 's ScanAlert , which provides daily audits of ecommerce websites to certify them " Hacker Safe , " gives clients the thumbs up even when XSS vulnerabilities are discovered on their pages . ®
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - When Paulette Richards ’ kids grew up and left home she thought she was done parenting .
Instead , she has joined the growing ranks of black U.S. grandparents raising grandchildren because their own children can’t -- or wo n’t .

The Miami woman ’s story illustrates a debate about whether black American parents take enough responsibility for raising their children that has spilled into the U.S. presidential campaign through comments by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and Democratic candidate Barack Obama .
It also sheds light on how complex factors including home foreclosures , lack of health insurance and high incarceration rates combine to put pressure on many inner-city families .
Few hard figures exist for grandparents raising grandchildren but 59 percent of black households with children have just one parent , according to U.S. census data in 2006 .
That ’s about double the figure in the overall population .
Obama , who could be the first U.S. black president , drew fire from Jackson this month by urging black parents to play a more constructive role in their children ’s lives .
“ No matter how many 10 - point plans we propose or how many government programs we launch , none of it will make any difference if we do n’t seize more responsibility in our own lives , ” Obama , whose Kenyan father played little role in his life , said in a speech .
Government also bore responsibility for fixing social problems , Obama added in the speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People .
It was a reprise of a message he has repeated to black audiences during the campaign and that often draws applause .
Jackson , a standard - bearer of the black community for decades , said in remarks he did not realize were being taped by a TV network that Obama was talking down to black people .
The incident , for which Jackson apologized , made it easier for Obama to differentiate himself from Jackson , analysts said .
“ It ’s potentially beneficial to him ( Obama ) in terms of ... being seen as someone who is concerned about family values , strengthening families and parenting , ” said Alan Abramowitz , politics professor at Emory University in Atlanta .
“ Being seen as willing to ... say that the black community has to take some responsibility for these problems is a position that appeals to a lot of black voters and to ... moderate whites who might be on the fence , ” he said .

BIRTHDAY CAKE
The debate over personal responsibility in the black community has rumbled for decades .
Sociologists cite a number of causes for higher rates of black single parenthood stretching back to the forced break - up of many black families during slavery .
The struggle to raise her grandchildren , pay bills and stay healthy has left Richards , 48 , who lives in Miami ’s downtrodden Liberty City neighborhood , at the breaking point .
Richards , who recently separated , first raised her own three children as well as three of her murdered sister ’s children .
Now she is raising the oldest two of her 10 grandchildren because their father -- her son -- was incarcerated .
Their mother , who also spent time in prison , has children by another man and plays little role in their lives , she said .
For years , Richards juggled work and raising her grandchildren , aged 13 and 11 , but recent surgery left her unable to work and hard - pressed to pay her mortgage .
Lacking health insurance , it was difficult to get medical follow - up .
Lacking money , she plans to celebrate two birthdays this week with a cake but nothing else .
“ It ’s unbelievably hard , ” said Richards , who has worked as a home helper , cook and cleaner .
Community workers in Liberty City said soaring gasoline prices and rising home foreclosure rates had made things worse .
As many as half of black households in the neighborhood were headed by a grandparent , according to Sushma Sheth , director of programs at the Miami Workers Center , a leftist community organization .
Sheth cited anecdotal evidence .
In many cases , mothers and children moved in with a grandparent because they were effectively homeless , she said .
“ There is more than one responsibility .
There is the responsibility of the individual and of the society to the individual , ” Sheth said .
Comment spammers , trackback spam , stupid bots and AVG linkscanner eating into your bandwidth and server resources ?
Here ’s how to put a dent in their activities with a few mod_rewrite rules .
I hate those blogs that send me fake trackbacks and pingbacks .
Unfortunately it ’s impossible to stop but this morning I figured out a way of stopping some of them .
Look through the log files of your web server for the string ‘ “ - ” “ - “ ‘.
Lots of requests there are n’t there ?
I found 914 requests yesterday .
Those are requests without a USER_AGENT or HTTP_REFERER and almost all of them are suspicious because they were n’t followed by requests for images , stylesheets .
or Javascript files .
Unfortunately the WordPress cron server also falls into this category so you need to filter out requests from your own server ’s IP address .
This morning I checked up on a spam trackback that came in .
This one came from 85.177.33.196 :
URL : /xmlrpc.php
HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA : <?xml version = ” 1.0 ″ ?>
< methodCall >
< methodName>pingback.ping</methodName >
< params >
< param >
< value >< string >
http://7wins.
eu/cbprod/detail_10347/cure+your+tight+foreskin.html</string></value>
</ param >
< param >
< value >< string >
http://ocaoimh.ie/2005/03/01/i-am-bored-sites-for-when-youre-bored/all-comments/</string></value>
</ param >
</ params >
</methodCall >
I looked through my log files for that IP address and discovered the following :
85.177.33.196 – – [ 03/Jul/2008:06:40:01 +0000 ]
“ GET /2005/02/18/10-more-ways-to-make-money-with-your-digital -cameras / HTTP/1.0 ” 200 36151 “ - ” “ -”
85.177.33.196 – – [ 03/Jul/2008:07:04:18 +0000 ]
“ GET /2007/06/07/im-not-the-only-one-to-love-the-alfa-147/ HTTP/1.0 ” 200 44967 “ - ” “ -”
85.177.33.196 – – [ 03/Jul/2008:08:09:40 +0000 ]
“ GET /2005/03/01/i-am-bored-sites-for-when-youre-bored/all-comments / HTTP/1.0 ” 200 410423 “ - ” “ -”
85.177.33.196 – – [ 03/Jul/2008:08:09:44 +0000 ]
“ POST /xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.0 ” 200 249 “ -” “ XML - RPC for PHP 2.2.1 ”
85.177.33.196 – – [ 03/Jul/2008:09:00:09 +0000 ]
“ GET /2007/10/28/what-time-is-it-wordpress / HTTP/1.0 ” 200 63332 “ - ” “ -“
So , the spammer grabs “ /2005/03/01/i-am-bored-sites-for-when-youre-bored/all-comments / ” at 8:09 am and 4 seconds later sends a trackback spam to the same blog post .
Annoying is n’t it ?
The following mod_rewrite rules will kill those fake GET requests dead .
# stop requests with no UA or referrer
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^$
Rewritecond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^$
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} !^64\.22\.71\.36 $
RewriteRule ^(.* ) – [ F ]
Replace “ 64\.22\.71\.36 ” with the IP address of your own server .
If you do n’t know what it is , look through your logs for requests for wp - cron. php , run ifconfig from the command line , or check with your hosting company .
Here are a few of the requests already stopped this morning :
72.21.40.122 – – [ 03/Jul/2008:09:59:59 +0000 ]
“ GET /2005/04/02/photo-matt-a-response-to-the-noise / HTTP/1.1 ” 403 248 “ - ” “ -”

Some spam bots are stupid .
They do n’t know where your wp- comments - post . php is .
That ’s the file your comment form feeds when a comment is made .
If your blog is installed in the root , “ / ” , of your domain you can add this one line to stop the 404 requests generated :
RewriteRule ^(.*)/wp-comments-post.php – [ F , L ]
Trackbacks and pingbacks almost always come from sane looking user agents .
They usually have the blog or forum software name to identify them .
Look for “ / trackback / ” POSTs in your logs .
Notice how 99 % of them have browser names in them ?
Here ’s how to stop them , and this has been documented for a long time :
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^.*( Opera|Mozilla|MSIE ) .* $ [ OR ]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^POST $
RewriteRule ^(.*) / trackback / – [ F , L ]
I ’ve been using that chunk of code for ages .
It works exceptionally well .
This was prompted by a deluge of 40,000 spam trackbacks this site received in one day a few months ago .
If you use my Cookies for Comments plugin .
Check your browser for the cookie it leaves and use the following code to block almost all of your comment spam :
RewriteCond %{HTTP_COOKIE} !^.* put_cookie_value_here .*$
RewriteRule ^wp-comments -post.php – [ F , L ]
That will block the spammers even before they hit any PHP script .
Your server will breeze through the worst spam attempts .
It blocked 2308 comment spam attempts yesterday .
Unfortunately it also stops the occasional human visitor leaving a comment but I think it ’s worth it .
Do something different .
That ’s what you have to do .
Place a hurdle before the spammers and they ’ll fall .
On that note , I should n’t really be blogging all this , but almost all these ideas can be found elsewhere already and the spammers still have n’t adapted .
Unwanted traffic ?
What ’s that ?
Surely all visitors are good ?
Nope , unfortunately not .
Robert alerted me to the fact that AVG anti-virus now includes an AJAX powered browser plugin called “ Linkscanner ” that scans all the links on search engine result pages for viruses and malicious code .
Unfortunately that generates a huge number of requests for pages that are never even seen by the visitor .
I counted over 7,000 hits yesterday .
Thankfully Padraig Brady has a solution .
I hope he does n’t mind if I reprint his mod_rewrite rules here ( unfortunately WordPress changes the ” character so you ’ll have to change them back , or grab the code from Padraig ’s page . )
# Here we assume certain MSIE 6.0 agents are from linkscanner
#redirect these requests back to avg in the hope they ’ll see their silliness
Rewritecond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} “.* MSIE 6.0 ; Windows NT 5.1 ; SV1 . $ ” [ OR ]
Rewritecond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} “.* MSIE 6.0 ; Windows NT 5.1;1813 . $ ”
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^$

The Brown government has changed its mind on placing security scanners at every London tube station and mainline train stations across the country , because the technology does not work and the public would not tolerate the long delays such scanning would require .
Despite doubts from London Underground after the original trials Gordon Brown gave the scheme his support in November 2007 .
London Underground questioned the practicality of the technology as well as worrying that the queues created would provide a new target for terrorists .
But today Tom Harris , Under - Secretary of State for Transport , said the project would be abandoned because achieving airport - style screening is not feasible using today 's technology , and the public would not stand for the delays caused and the invasion of privacy involved .
As we pointed out at the time the " security theatre " of such a scheme would be more important than any actual impact .
Instead of fixed scanners British Transport Police will continue to use some mobile scanners and sniffer dogs .
Along with metal detectors the government also trialled millimetre wave scanners at Paddington for the Heathrow Express .
These scanners , which can look through clothes , proved particularly unpopular with young women .
Those surveyed also doubted the technology could be used without causing significant delays .
The trial also tested finger and clothes swabbers and bag sniffers . ®
In 1942 , in the middle of nowhere , an Army engineer posted the sign " Danville , Illinois , 2835 miles " to mark his hometown while building the Alaska Highway .
That started the tradition of adding one 's hometown signs to the heap .

Mmmm … sausage .
Whether it ’s Jimmy Dean at Sunday brunch , juicy ballpark franks at the game , or spicy merguez hot off the backyard grill , there ’s no denying the delicious - ness of sausages .
Sure , there ’s a bit of a “ mystery meat ” aura about sausages , because they are often made of leftovers , including organ parts and fat .
The key to buying good sausage is to go for high meat content ( 70 per cent or higher ) and all - natural varieties ( which contain no fillers or artificial ingredients ) .
If you ’re buying hot dogs , go for the all - beef varieties .
There ’s still the question of what kind of sausage to buy :
Some sausages are cooked as part of their preparation , while others are raw , like most Italian sausage .
Some are smoked , some are cooked and smoked , like kielbasa .
While most sausage comes in a casing , American breakfast sausage is prepared in a patty format .
Hey , these days there are even vegetarian and vegan sausages .
To help figure out what ’s what , here ’s a handy guide to sausages from the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council .
The bottom line is , there ’s a sausage out there to suit your fancy !
And there are many ways to prepare them .
This sausage link ( pun intended ) is from a British sausage site that gives the basic cooking instructions on boiled , fried , baked , barbecued or poached sausage .
Now for some great recipes :
To make a regular American hot dog in the microwave , just follow my simple instructions .
My Sausage and Egg Casserole ( video ) is great to serve to company .
With its make - ahead steps , you can get it ready tonight for tomorrow ’s big brunch !
If you want to impress everyone , you can use your homemade turkey sausage in this pasta sauce , then make lasagna with it !
Roasted Vegetables and Sausage is a great way to take advantage of deliciously fresh summer produce .
Plus it smells fabulous when it is cooking !
For the heartiest of hearty soups , try this split pea soup with kielbasa in it !
Cheesy sausage balls ( show at the very top of this post ) would make a great appetizer or snack for game night ( whether board games or football ) with your friends .
Update , 07-21-2008 : A related wrap - up post was published on Boing Boing on July 18 : Lessons Learned .
Speaking for all the Boingers –
Boing Boing has been caught in the middle of a real internet shitstorm and pile - on over the last few days .
A blogger named Violet Blue noticed that we unpublished some posts related to her .
Some people wanted to know why .
Bottom line is that those posts ( not " more than 100 posts , " as erroneously claimed elsewhere ) were removed from public view a year ago .
Violet behaved in a way that made us reconsider whether we wanted to lend her any credibility or associate with her .
It 's our blog and so we made an editorial decision , like we do every single day .
We did n't attempt to silence Violet .
We unpublished our own work .
There 's a big difference between that and censorship .
We hope you 'll respect our choice to keep the reasons behind this private .
We do understand the confusion this caused for some , especially since we fight hard for openness and transparency .
We were trying to do the right thing quietly and respectfully , without embarrassing the parties involved .
Clearly , that did n't work out .
In attempting to defuse drama , we inadvertently ignited more .
Mind you , we were n't the ones splashing gasoline around ; but we did make the fire possible .
We 're sorry about that .
In the meantime , Boing Boing 's past content is indexed on the Wayback Machine , a basic Internet resource ; so the material should still be available for those who would like to read it .
Thank you all for caring what happens on Boing Boing .
And if you think there 's more to say , by all means , let 's talk .
We 're listening .

Oh , X - Files sequel .
Like your subtitle says : I want to believe .
I really do .
But above all , I want to want .
And I do n't .
What gives ?
I hearted you monstrously in the '90s .
And I like knowing a sequel is out there , the same way I like knowing my AOL account is out there : comforting , but I feel no special urge to visit .
I 'm guessing I 'm not the only one .
Why is that ?
Why do some beloved pop fantasies evolve into mini-religions , while others fade like an old pair of Jams ?
Hollywood does n't have the answer .
They 'll green - light just about anything , from a live - action He - Man movie to The Smurfs in 3 - D .
Our only hope here is science .
So I turn to a scientist — my former college roommate Noah Helman .
Back in the '90s , he was our dorm 's brainy , not - quite - as - hot Scully ; I , its stubby Mulder , the believer .
We used to watch The X - Files together , in real time , then debate it over warm Squirt .
( These were the heady days before Television Without Pity . )
Now he 's a busy molecular biologist , but he agreed , for the sake of science , to help me determine the perfect " nostalgorithm " — a differential equation that will determine a pop object 's nostalgic potential while explaining why a Thundercats movie intrigues , but the X - Files sequel leaves me cold .
Let 's begin with the simplest factor : Time ( t ) .
As any former Giga Pet owner knows , stuff peaks , then gets old .
Thus :
Popular velocity ( ΔPopularity / Δt ) = - L x t
where L = probability of lameness .
Off its peak , we see exponential decay in Popular Velocity over time :
Popularity ( t ) = exp ( - L x t ) = e- Lxt
Translated crudely from the calculus , this simply means pop properties have expiration dates , like Lunchables or Tom Cruise .
Or
The X - Files , which has been off the air for six years now and was in steep decline four years prior to cancellation .
And fan love does n't steadily decline — it plummets as exposure ( E ) reaches an unhealthy level :
Popular velocity =
( - L x t ) - L 2 x ( Popularity - E )
3
Ergo : even worse news for The X - Files , one of the '90s more overexposed phenomena .
But as Noah points out , non-awesome pop objects are primed to become awesome again .
The X - Files is solidly non-awesome — so perhaps a popular re-awesomeness awaits it , è la Grunge , Trump , and Steel ?
Perhaps — but probably not this month .
While what 's old is eventually new again , it takes about a generation ( tgen = 20 years ) for kids to pick up what their parents discarded .
And so :
Which gives us a swooping , hilly graph ( see figure , above ) and strands
The X - Files movie in that sad little valley : 10 years off its peak popularity in 1998 — when the first film opened and attempted , unsuccessfully , to convince us that bees are scary .
According to our formula , the proper release date for this X - Files movie is 2018 — not 2008 .
( That date satisfies the math but also halves David Duchovny 's smolder - quotient . )
But time and generational reclamation are n't the only factors .
( If so , where 's that big - budget Airwolf movie ? )
There 's also niche : Paranormal procedurals like Medium are milking the X meme , along with Lost , which regularly pits science against faith , but without the smoky will - they - or - wo n't - they ( all due respect to authors of Jack / Locke yaoi fan - fic ) .
What about the resurgence of Star Trek less than a decade after its cancellation ?
Space westerns must be the exception .
I ask Noah about these additional factors , and he asks me for a grant .
Who needs him ?
I can blitz my way through this :
The graph for this one looks , well , kind of like Airwolf barebacking KITT .
And I 'm not sure it explains anything .
But it has left me strangely , counterintuitively jazzed for this upcoming X - Files movie — all this reminiscing makes me want to catch up with Mulder and Scully and , hell , even Flukeman .
This is the point where Noah throws his TI - 73 at my head and pronounces me hopeless .
Maybe no amount of ratiocination can capture the messy heuristics of true devotion .
Maybe bees are scary .
Is $ 10 really too much to pay to find out ?
Probably , but I 'm doing it anyway .
What can I say ?
I want to believe .

We hid an Easter Egg in the IT Crowd Series 2 .
In fact , we hid lots of Easter Eggs in the DVD .
In fact , the DVD was not just a DVD , but a fiendishly complicated collection of clues that would , we thought , eventually lead some clever Nancy Drew - type to our special mystery prize–a bright yellow Lamborghini laptop ( you may have noticed Moss with it in series 2 ) .
“ Make sure ” , said the lawyers , “ that it really is a test of skill and judgement .
No questions like :
Which of these is a part of the body ?
A. Shoe . B. Head .
C. Hat .
Make sure they ’ve read the terms and conditions .
And make sure there ’s a closing date . ”
So we did all that , and watched the website hosting the competition receive 12,000 unique visitors .
We jumped up and down with glee when at least three other sites popped up on the interwebs , each having stumbled across parts of the puzzle – yes , it was hard , but people were solving it – hurrah !
One clever German site even published a walkthrough for … well , for what we thought was the most complicated bit .
But as the closing date neared , it seemed that we might have made the competition a bit too hard .
Or , as we discovered when the competition finished , very , very , very much too hard indeed .
So , as the proud posers of possibly the most difficult competition ever , we still have a shiny yellow laptop to award .
And you still have a clutch of Easter eggs to find .

Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player that ever lived .
Was he genetically predisposed to be faster and stronger , or was it his iron discipline that was responsible ?
After completing my master ’s degree in Biomedical Science I can say , with some facts and knowledge to back it up , that genetics only partially added to the phenomenal talents of this outstanding athlete .
He competed against people that were taller , stronger , faster , and younger than him .
Despite the challenges he still came out on top .
Let ’s take a look at the grains of wisdom that put him at the top of his game as well as his businesses .
Michael Jordan ’s 10 Success Secrets
Take Responsibility
“ Some people want it to happen , some wish it would happen , others make it happen . ”
Throughout his life , Michael Jordan had the honorable quality of taking responsibility for his own destiny .
That means that he took action while others paused to ask questions , gather more data , or consult experts .
Not that he did n’t have mentors , but essentially it was his wrists that snapped the ball into the hoop .
Give It A Try
“ I can accept failure , everyone fails at something .
But I ca n’t accept not trying . ”
One of the biggest causes of procrastination is the problem of hesitation .
Sometimes people over think , and over analyze , which prevents them from taking that first step that will carry them one thousand miles .
If you want to increase sales by trying a new technique , you will never know unless you try .
This can apply to baking cakes , meeting singles , or anything that you can wrap your mind around .
Fail Freely
“ I ’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career .
I ’ve lost almost 300 games .
26 times , I ’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed .
I ’ve failed over and over and over again in my life .
And that is why I succeed . ”
Can you believe that Michael Jordan missed so many shots and lost so many games ?
I thought he was the best !
Well , he is indeed the best , and it ’s because he was willing to fail , and keep going .
That allowed him to get past his plateaus and persevere .
That ’s another big reason for procrastination .
When we think we ’ll fail , we do not attempt .
A good solution is to consider what the worst case scenario of failing would be , because once you do that , it ’s never as bad as when the scenario was an unknown .
Worst - case scenario is not that you ’ll die , it ’s that you lived a miserable ( or comfortable ) life as a coward .
Commit Yourself
“ The game is my wife .
It demands loyalty and responsibility , and it gives me back fulfillment and peace . ”
Till death do we part , just me and my goal .
I know in my heart that this is my role .
When you give yourself fully and remove all other distractions you gain an invaluable level of attention to detail that will pool in resources you did not know you were capable of harnessing .
Enjoy Your Game
“ Just play .
Have fun .
Enjoy the game . ”
So many people get stuck in dead end , zero -sum , no fun jobs because they did n’t find their love , or just simply do n’t have the knack for taking pleasure in what they have .
Consider the fact that you spend more time in your place of work than you do in your place of worship and with your family combined .
By not being excited about , or getting full enjoyment out of work , you are cheating yourself from having a life of design and a life of fulfillment .
I do n’t have a solution for your life , but I think you know which sacrifices you need to make , and are willing to make , in order to have the life of your dreams become your reality .
Play To Win
“ I play to win , whether during practice or a real game .
And I will not let anything get in the way of me and my competitive enthusiasm to win . ”
Why bother playing the game of basketball , work , or life if you are n’t planning to win ?
Do you even know what a statistically relevant way of measuring your personally defined “ win ” would look like ?
If you ’re in the game to make money does winning mean being the richest man in the world ?
If you ’re in the game for your family does that mean that you see them often and share the joys of life over a vibrant laugh ?
Whatever your game is , make sure you define what a win looks like , and play to win .
Be Selfish and Humble
“ To be successful you have to be selfish , or else you never achieve .
And once you get to your highest level , then you have to be unselfish .
Stay reachable .
Stay in touch .
Do n’t isolate . ”
Take notes from Michael Jordan , first be selfish until you get on top , and once you are on top be humble and grounded .
Being selfish in how you jump over people and slam dunk in their face , whether you are an athlete or business person .
In a family setting this would mean taking care of your personal health before worrying about the well - being of your family .
If you let your health fail you are of no use , or even worse a burden , to your family .
This is why in case of an air plane emergency they tell you to put the air mask on yourself first and then on your children .
Find Your Way Around
“ Obstacles do n’t have to stop you .
If you run into a wall , do n’t turn around and give up .
Figure out how to climb it , go through it , or work around it . ”
Anything in life that is dear to us is worth so much because of the time and effort we put into acquiring it .
This goes for championships , businesses , and most importantly our relationships .
One thing that determines how hard we ’ve had to work is the amount of obstacles that were thrown in our way .
Next time there ’s an obstacle , do n’t let it hinder you , think about the fact that whatever you ’re trying to reach will be that much worth it on the other side .
Make Your Own Expectations
“ If you accept the expectations of others , especially negative ones , then you never will change the outcome . ”
The number one thing that will literally ruin your life is if you live it by someone else ’s expectations .
Every single person is different and has their own views on what ’s best , which follows what their goals are in this life .
By listening to the voices of others , instead of your own voice , you are effectively submitting to live your life for the sake of accomplishing their goals .
Set your own expectations , meet your own goals , and live your own extraordinary life ( or do n’t ) .
Now , Take One Shot
“ I never looked at the consequences of missing a big shot . . . when you think about the consequences you always think of a negative result . ”
The way this applies to life is quite simple .
Much of the time we look too far into the future , while performing a task that needs our full attention right now .
This act could take away our focus , paralyze us from taking action , and take away the pleasure of doing what is at hand .
In life you can take one shot at a time , then another , and from this all your dreams will come true .
At least that ’s what works for Michael Jordan .

Many , many years ago I was privileged to study American regional dialects with one of the leading dialectologists of that era , Raven I. McDavid .
It was a career - changing experience for me because he taught me the sheer joy of gathering and analyzing the actual language spoken by everyday people in everyday settings .
The focus of the Linguistic Atlas of the United States and Canada was on older people , mostly in rural settings , so he sent me out to interview and tape - record a large sample of such Americans , first in the northern half of Illinois and later in the rest of that state .
My experience of listening to 70 - 80 year - olds talk about farming and other topics was new and exhilarating to this city boy , making the arduous task of doing the phonetic transcriptions of their speech rather exciting .
Only a few years after that I met Bill Labov , who provided me with another career - changing experience , for his focus on urban language with a range of informants of different ages , race , and socio- econonmic status opened the door to sociolinguistics for me .
Bill 's model led me to create the sociolinguistics program at Georgetown that continues to flourish after almost four decades .
Another right angle turn happened to me on a flight from Washington DC to Dallas in 1969 .
I was assigned a middle seat , where I could n't help peeking at a manuscript being read by the man sitting next to me .
It looked like a sermon , so I asked the man if he was a minister .
He laughed and said , " No , I 'm a lawyer , " and went to on tell me that the manuscript was indeed a sermon that was evidence in a case he was working on .
Probably out of politeness for my interruption , the lawyer asked me what I did for a living .
I told him that I was a linguist and that I studied the way people talk and that I traveled around the country tape - recording their speech .
His response was n't the usual , " Uh- oh , I guess I 'd better watch my grammar . "
Linguists hear this all the time .
Instead , he was fascinated , and I soon found out why .
He had a lawyer colleague who was in the midst of a long solicitation to murder case in which the prosecution 's main evidence was a bunch of tape - recorded conversations between his client and an undercover agent .
My seat - mate asked me if I might be interested in helping his colleague .
I gulped , because I had never heard anyone solicit murder before .
But I took a deep breath and agreed to listen to the tapes to see if there was anything I could contribute .
This chance event turned out to offer me still another right angle turn in my career .
My analysis and subsequent testimony at that trial was credited with helping get an acquittal for the client and it opened the door to some three decades of my applying linguistics to criminal and civil lawsuits , which I 'm still doing now that I 'm in my late seventies .
My earlier work in dialectology , sociolinguistics , and discourse analysis continues to play an important role in my forensic linguistics work .
It feels very good when things come together like this .
If you 're aware of such opportunities and have the courage to leap right in , they can provide exciting right angle turns in your career .
It 's likely that most of us get invitations to make right angle turns at some point in our lives , probably more than once .
The key seems to be to take the best ones when they 're offered and to avoid the ones that do n't look like they 'll take us anywhere we might want to go .
Most of my linguistics friends had little idea they 'd end up doing what they 're doing today .
I suspect that if someone would collect their personal stories , it could make a fascinating book .

The ACLU and Electronic Freedom Foundation moved July 1 to force the Department of Justice to turn over records related to the government 's program of using cell phones as tracking devices .
The groups claim the public has a right to know the extent of the government 's use of the technique .
In documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , the ACLU and EFF are seeking documents , memos and guides issued by the DOJ for tracking individuals through the use of their cell phones .
The civil liberties groups also want to know the number of times the government has applied for cell phone location information without establishing probable cause and how many times it has been granted .
" This is a critical opportunity to shed much - needed light on possibly unconstitutional government surveillance techniques , " Catherine Crump , a staff attorney with the ACLU , said in a statement .
" Signing up for cell phone services should not be synonymous with signing up to be spied on and tracked by the government . "
The ACLU originally filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking the information in November of last year after media reports surfaced that the government claims it does not need probable cause to obtain real - time tracking information from a person 's cell phone .
The government did not respond to the request , leading to the July 1 lawsuit .
" The public has an overwhelming interest in the requested information , which concerns our most personal communications , " said David L. Sobel , the EFF 's senior counsel .
" But remarkably , the Justice Department refused to respond quickly to the request , as the law requires when ' urgent ' information is at issue .
Further delay will allow important privacy policies to be developed behind closed doors . "
In the lawsuit filed July 1 , the ACLU and EFF said the DOJ was violating its own internal recommendation that federal prosecutors seek warrants based on probable cause to obtain cell phone tracking information .
" The information now in the public domain suggests that defendant may be engaging in unauthorized and potentially unconstitutional tracking of individuals through their mobile phones , " the lawsuit states .
" Information pertaining to the DOJ 's procedures for obtaining real - time tracking information is vital to the public 's understanding of the privacy risks of carrying a mobile phone and of , more generally , the government 's expansive view of its surveillance powers . "
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) -
The chief of Mexico ’s war on drug gangs said Washington should concentrate on halting the flow of arms to Mexican drug cartels rather than haggle over how much aid to give Mexico ’s anti-smuggling operation .
Reacting to a vote by U.S. lawmakers to trim an aid package for the drug war , Mexico ’s deputy attorney general , Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos , said an alternative would be to keep the cash in the United States and use it to curb illegal arms trafficking across the border .
“ Some of us were talking , remarking that , well , this ( sum of money ) is all very well , but why do n’t we tell the Americans they could spend it on their ( border security forces ) to stop the flow of arms to Mexico , ” Santiago Vasconcelos said in remarks on local radio distributed by his office on Saturday .
Santiago Vasconcelos , the point man in Mexico ’s crackdown on drug smuggling gangs , said 97 percent of the weapons used by Mexican drug gangs came from the United States .
He said Mexico would evaluate whether to accept any U.S. offer of funds and under what conditions .
Mexico is spending $ 7 billion of its own money to fund its 18 - month - old crackdown on the powerful and violent cartels that smuggle Colombian cocaine north to U.S. consumers .
U.S. President George W. Bush had offered to add $ 1.4 billion in three tranches to pay for surveillance equipment and speedy aircraft , but his opponents in Congress have haggled over the amount and asked that human rights conditions be attached .
The U.S. House of Representatives this month cut the first tranche of the so - called Merida Initiative , named after the Mexican city where it was conceived , to $ 400 million from $ 500 million , and the Senate Appropriations Committee put forward a figure of $ 350 million .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has made the war on drug cartels the centerpiece of his presidency , deploying some 25,000 troops and federal police across the country , but the operation has sparked considerable bloodshed .
Turf wars between rival cartels and battles with the army have killed 1,380 people this year , nearly 50 percent more than the same period last year , according to the attorney general ’s office .

mod_failgracefully
Failing gracefully is a far more difficult problem than people intuitively expect .
Take the case of a web site which has insufficient bandwidth or CPU to handle its current load .
Graceful failure in this case would be to let some fraction of users in , and politely tell the other users they have to wait because of the load .
Web sites do n't by default do anything even vaguely resembling this .
Instead , page load times become very slow , and when things time out its on a per-page or even per-object basis , resulting in an acceptable site experience for no one .
Even worse , when users get a bad object load in a page or a bad page load as a whole , they 'll usually hit reload rather than leaving , causing the site load to be far greater than it would be were it serving the same number of users in a reasonable fashion .
It would be nice if someone could write a thing for Apache to do this automatically .
When a site starts hitting bandwidth or CPU limits ( preferably automatically detected by the site itself ) it starts rejecting users and giving them cookies to keep repeated reloads from getting in .
Ideally , it would even create a queue of users and let them know when they 're up and give an estimated amount of time until they 're let in .
Of course , it 's always better to simply have enough bandwidth and CPU around .
But once in a while someone finds themselves in a situation where they do n't , and if it were possible to simply install a generic fail gracefully utility and leave that running as an interim solution until they can get a proper one in place , that would make the world a better place .

I read a paper a few years ago about handling load by proxy ; you have a service that accepts all incoming connections , and depending on the load of the machine , either says " sorry , go away right now " ( it was written in the context of POP3 mailboxes , so actually pretended to be a POP3 server and said " sorry , no mail " ) , or it passes the file handle to the actual server ( there are methods to do this on linux , bsd , and windows ) .
If one were to make the proxy smart enough , one would n't even need to use cookies ( in the case of http ) , but then the question becomes how to pass the file handle to apache so that it can handle the request properly .
Maybe through a mod ?
I do n't know , I know very little about apache internals .

root_fu Maybe what the world really needs is a distributed , network , architecture which allows clients connecting to a server to act as intermediaries .
This would allow a server under duress to shift bandwidth and CPU loads to the client side , allowing ( in theory ) better connectivity .
We could call it : bit torrent .
With it we could rule the world .
Ok , let 's be ' real ' , maybe 30 % of the internet bandwidth .
What do you say ?

Web surfing has very stringent demands on latency , which peer to peer can't really meet .
Peers also can't handle dynamic content at all .

When I wrote the When I wrote the JWS , I grappled with this problem .
The JWS accepts connections on the listen socket and immediately throws them into a queue .
The connections in the queue are serviced by a pool of threads .
The queue has a finite size ( WORKERPOOL_TASKQ_MAXSIZE ) and if it gets full , it begins rejecting enqueue attempts .
The main accept ( ) loop notices this and sends an " HTTP / 1.0 500 Internal Server Error ( is the server overloaded ? ) " to the rejected socket , and then closes it .

That 's about as good as you can do with normal web server behavior , but suffers from the people hitting reload problem , and does n't detect when the web server does n't have enough bandwidth , just when it does n't have enough CPU .

I wonder how you even do that ...
You can't just judge based on pure number of connections , since the computer could be on a 9600 baud slip line or could be gig-e connected to a router on a DS3 .
I can't think of anything in netstat that would give you useful info either .
I guess the machine could continually ping the default gateway and start refusing connections when the pings start coming back slow .
Though that would give false readings if the WAN connection had gone down .
The LAN would still be fast but the WAN would n't even be passing packets .
( Though I suppose the problem of politely replying to incoming connections is kind of moot if people can't establish incoming connections ... )
suffers from the people hitting reload problem
That one 's tough .
Even if you send them an error page saying " Overloaded , please wait five minutes " you know 90 % of people are going to hit reload anyway .
I guess you could keep a hash of recent IPs that have tried to connect , and reject connections from ones that try too much .

bramcohen Maxing out upload is noticeable by every outgoing connection getting slow and having lots of packet loss .
The information about this is on the machine , but it's in the TCP stack , not generally available to applications .
To stop people from hitting reload you need to message properly .
Ideally you 'd give them a cookie and have an actual queue for people to be let in and have the page auto - reload once in a while until it's their turn ( if there is n't much on the page the amount of CPU and bandwidth in the reloads is n't all that much ) .
You 'd have to respond to a reload request by serving up a message saying ' hitting reload wo n't make this page load faster , in fact I just pushed you back in the queue a bit ' .
That would get the message across fairly quickly .

slayemin I can't imagine anyone actually wanting to use this feature .
Who would the audience be ?
If you 're a small business , the last thing you want to do is to turn away potential customers .
If you 're a large business , public access to your website is very important .
If you 're a single geo-cities kinda webpage , its very unlikely that you 'd ever be hammered by web traffic .
A better solution is to just use network load balancing with multiple webservers in high traffic situations .
NLB balances traffic based on CPU and bandwidth loads .
All you need is the extra hardware .
Hardware is cheap .
Lost time and business is not .

krellan I agree that this feature would n't be desirable .
I 've seen this in practice .
I believe that some Microsoft web servers offer a feature to put up an empty " Server Too Busy " error webpage .
I 've seen this appear when trying to visit some sites .
It 's maddening , because the message appears so quickly , providing the site has plenty of bandwidth remaining , because it 's able to still serve the error message .
It seems that an arbitrary administrative limit was set too low .
If there is indeed congestion , I 'd much rather be queued and wait , than simply rejected outright .
As you said , turning away potential customers is never a good idea !

electrichamster " I 've seen this appear when trying to visit some sites .
It 's maddening , because the message appears so quickly , providing the site has plenty of bandwidth remaining , because it 's able to still serve the error message . "
The problem is more likely to be CPU than bandwidth , so the error page being served quickly has little indication of the load that the servers are under .
We actually do something similar to this with a patch to the Perlbal load balancer .
When the length of time that people are waiting in the serve queue exceeds 30s we serve an error page to any new connections .

The problem is more likely to be CPU than bandwidth , so the error page being served quickly has little indication of the load that the servers are under .
We actually do something similar to this with a patch to the Perlbal load balancer .
When the length of time that people are waiting in the serve queue exceeds 30s we serve an error page to any new connections .

What if you 're neither a small business , a large business , or a geocities user ?
There 's plenty of people who run useful little sites on their own .

ingulf I 'm not sure I agree with this .
I usually prefer a web page to load slowly than give up , because if it loads slowly I can just leave it in another tab to get on with it , but if it gives up , I have to come back and refresh until I get through .
More useful would be to return a we page which automatically reloaded some time in the future - the web server could adjust the time it gives to different users - booking its future load .

zanfur I do know that some network hardware will do this .
In particular , for sites where there are both paying a free customers ( like LJ , for instance , though I have no idea if they use this technology ) , some F5 equipment can give priority to the logged in users who are actually paying , and only letting the freeriders have whatever bandwidth is left .
Configurable as you like .
I think some Foundry equipment does it as well .
Be really nice if it was an Apache module , though ...

The solution that immediately comes to mind to me is to profile page load times and use a probabilistic drop routine to maintain reasonable response times , probably with weighting that leans heavily towards not dropping clients that have open sessions , or are loading referenced objects , etc .
Could be self tuning to a degree .
One could also do some tricks to serve lower quality versions of images when the server detects that it 's running out of upload bandwidth ( pretty easy to figure based on load times ) .
Ron Paul planning parallel convention to send GOP a ' strong message ' in Minneapolis Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday June 10 , 2008
|
Print This Email This After being denied a speaking slot at the Republican convention this summer , former candidate Rep. Ron Paul , who is not supporting GOP nominee John McCain , has decided to stage his own parallel convention in Minneapolis .
" There is a growing surge of people out there just craving " for a return " to traditional American government , limited government that places personal liberty first and places an emphasis on personal responsibility and essentially gets out of the way after that , " Paul spokesman Jesse Benton told the Pittsburgh Tribune Review .
" The buzz we get from supporters is that they are very eager to come to St. Paul and very eager to send a strong message . "
After being initially viewed as little more than a gadfly 's revolt , Paul 's campaign picked up substantial steam during the GOP primaries , when the libertarian leaning Texan raised about $ 35 million almost entirely online and garnered more than a million votes .
Paul 's secured at least 35 convention delegates , but Republican party big - wigs are denying him a speaking slot .
The Tribune - Review has the details on Paul 's parallel convention : Maverick GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul has booked an arena in Minneapolis for a " mini- convention " that could steal some of John McCain 's thunder just days before he accepts the Republican nomination .
A Paul campaign aide said the Texas congressman hopes to pack about 11,000 supporters into the Williams Arena at the University of Minnesota on Sept. 2 , which coincides with the second day of the Republican National Convention at the Xcel Energy Center in neighboring St. Paul .
Benton tells MSNBC that Paul 's decision to hold his own convention is about more than just not getting a speaking slot at the GOP 's main shindig .
Paul 's supporters are really " looking to build a national organization that is going to run at a grassroots level , be organized at a precinct level , and to identify candidates to support , " Benton said , " real constitutionalist candidates . "
Paul camp expects to have about 50 delegates to the national convention .
They will attend the Paul convention and the campaign is encouraging them to go to the official GOP convention as " active and positive . "
But , Benton added , Paul 's supporters are independent - minded and are n't going to be told what to do .
There 's some evidence that Paul 's influence is beginning to stretch beyond the presidential race already .
Libertarian magazine Reason recently profiled several " Ron Paul Republicans " who are seeking congressional seats in House races across the country this year .
SECAUCUS , N.J. --
The Chicago Bulls expected to be in the playoffs , not the lottery .
This will ease the sting a little .
The Bulls won the NBA 's draft lottery Tuesday night , giving them the right to choose between star freshmen Michael Beasley and Derrick Rose .
Coming off a miserable season and still without a coach , the Bulls vaulted from the No. 9 spot , where they had just a 1.7 percent chance of landing the top choice .
" After this season , we needed a break and I think we just got one tonight , " said Steve Schanwald , the Bulls ' executive vice president of business operations who represented them on the podium .
Chicago will almost certainly choose between Beasley , the Kansas State forward who averaged 26.2 points and an NCAA - best 12.4 rebounds , or Rose , the point guard who carried Memphis within minutes of the national title .
" We 'll have an opportunity to get close to those guys .
We 'll really take a long look at what makes the most sense for our basketball team , " executive vice president of basketball operations John Paxson said on a conference call .
" Having the pick puts you in a unique position to make your team better .

Katherine Heigl Not on Emmy Ballot , Blames Grey 's Writers
has removed her name from Emmy consideration for her role on the ABC drama Grey 's Anatomy .
Heigl won an Emmy in Season
Three , at a time when they were pulling in 18.7 million viewers each week .
This season 's numbers plummeted to 14.4 million and the actress has decided not to have her name appear on the ballot .
The actress is clearly unhappy with her reduced story line in the weekly scripts that have been written for Season 4 .
Logic would suggest that last years Emmy winner would get a juiced up script to match her proven acting chops .
Heigl 's role this year was considerably diminished and she has decided not to hold back in making a statement that is bound to cause the upper echelon at ABC to see red .
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times , she said :
I did not feel that I was given the material this season to warrant an Emmy nomination and in an effort to maintain the integrity of the academy organization , I withdrew my name from contention .
In addition , I did not want to potentially take away an opportunity from an actress who was given such materials .
It ’s important to me to take a minute and clarify the quote about Knocked Up in Vanity Fair .
I was responding to previous reviews about the movie the interviewer brought to my attention .
My motive was to encourage other women like myself to not take that element of the movie too seriously and to remember that it ’s a broad comedy .
Heigl is no stranger to rocking the boat .
She got into a tight spot during a Vanity Fair interview last summer when she mentioned that the very successful movie Knocked Up , in which she had a prominent role , was " a little sexist " .
After the article hit newsstands , she sent VF a written statement clarifying her earlier remarks .
In it she said : Heigl obviously speaks her mind .
It should be interesting to see if there is a Grey 's Anatomy Season 5 in her future or if she 'll move on or be encouraged to move on to greener pastures .

Ms Schwab believes a trade deal can be reached in Geneva For anyone in business , the idea of spending seven years trying to cut a deal is hard to imagine .
Yet that 's how long the Doha round of global trade talks have been going on .
So could this finally be the moment of truth .
Or will it just slip by ?
America's top trade negotiator , Susan Schwab is cautiously optimistic , saying : " I do believe it 's doable and I believe it 's doable next week . "
Ms Schwab and other trade officials from around the world are headed to Geneva this weekend where the negotiations are taking place .
A breakthrough on lowering tariffs and subsidies on farm products , manufactured goods and services could create tens of billions of dollars in benefits , mainly for the world 's poorest countries .
But while America is hopeful , it 's not prepared to do a deal at any cost .
The US has made it clear it wants to see countries open their services sectors to more foreign companies .
As places like China and India have become more prosperous , demand for services such as finance , telecoms and technology have grown .
And the US - which has an advantage in many of these areas - wants to provide it to them .
Deal breaker
But the issue is not a simple one .
In return , developing countries want America to provide more temporary entry work visas for software engineers and other professionals .
A hard sell in an election year .
Another possible stumbling block is agriculture .
America is under pressure to cut trade distorting subsidies to its farmers .
The draft agreement proposes limits that range from $ 13 bn ( £ 6.5 bn ; 8.2 euros ) to $ 16.4 bn .
Thanks to high food prices , these existing goals look outdated .
US farm spending has already dropped significantly .
US farmers fear a trade deal could mean less money
In the light of that , some developing countries think Washington should go further .
But US farmers claim they are being asked to give up more in government support than they would receive in new export income .
US Trade Representative , Susan Schwab says the final level will depend on what others are willing to offer : " We need to bring home a package that has some degree of balance in terms of gives and gets . "
A successful conclusion to the talks requires compromise from all parties .
Leadership
Many feel that rich countries , like the US should lead by example .
Others are worried their domestic markets will be flooded by Chinese exports .
China joined the World Trade Organisation in December 2001 , after the launch of the Doha round .
President Bush 's departure from office could spell an end to a deal
But it has been a huge beneficiary of open markets and unless they play a leadership role America 's trade chief says " it is impossible to imagine a successful conclusion to the Doha round " .
Whilst obstacles remain , there is a sense of urgency about these talks .
With the US presidential election around the corner , there is a desire to fashion some kind of agreement before George Bush leaves office .
This may seem odd .
The President does not have trade promotion authority ( TPA ) , essential to speed the passage of trade agreements through Congress .
Instead , the hope is to get a special one off extension to the President 's trade promotion authority or to at least pass on a finished agreement to the next resident of the White House .
Trade fears
Whoever that is , they may be a lot less committed to trade than President Bush or Clinton before them .
For many working Americans trade is a dirty word .
Nonetheless , most economists have no doubt that the US has benefited hugely from the global reduction of tariffs and the removal of other trade barriers over the last two decades .
Millions of American jobs depend on exports and with things looking shaky at home , they are an even greater driving force for the economy
So while Doha might not be the cure all for America 's current housing and financial woes , it is nonetheless vital .

What are these ?
" There are some great game ideas though that you just can't dumb down before they fall apart . "
" Games challenge our reflexes , our puzzle - solving skills , our memories and our endurance but they rarely challenge our knowledge . "
" What I learned with that game is ; if you treat your customers like intelligent , educated adults , you get intelligent educated adults as customers . "
How old are you ?
If you ’re a typical gamer , you are probably much older than the mainstream media thinks you are .
PC games used to be amusing little things played by kids while the parents did grown up things .
Not any more , as the many web forum debates on how to juggleguild membership with parenthood prove .
Partly , the average age is rising because us kids who got in on gaming in the eighties have kept at it ever since , but the demographic is expanding elsewhere too .
The Wii has introduced gaming to the older generation , and the huge growth in the casual PC games market is aimed squarely at 30 + ' soccer moms ' .
Now have a huge spread of gamers , from young kids fragging their first alien right up to people enjoyingin a retirement home .
So why are so many games treating us all like idiots ?
I do n't just mean in tutorials where we get treated like war heroes because we managed to " move the mouse to the left " , but in the actual choice of subject matter , and pre-requisite knowledge .
Recently someone tried to make a game out of protein folding .
The idea was that if you could make an accessible fun game out of it , you could effectively get lots of people to process real data for free , and contribute towards a worthwhile goal .
Great idea , but do weto assume the game needs to be massively simple in order to catch on ?
I 'm sure a lot of biochemists play computer games , why must we assume they are incapable of learning a complex game ?
You can take a lot of great game ideas , and then dumb then down to the lowest common denominator and make them boring and dull , that 's a given .
There are some great game ideas though that you just can't dumb down before they fall apart .
Right now that means the game does n't even get out of the starting gate .
I 've heard of games flopping because the marketing sucked , budget problems , piracy and poor design but I have n't heard about any big games failing because they were too highbrow .
Yet nobody is even trying to make those games .
In some ways it 's all the fault of our old nemesis , the rocketing game budget .
Rack up a four million dollar wage bill , and you need to sell a LOT of copies to break even .
Selling just to biochemists wo n't cut it any more , you need to aim at the wider audience .
But if you avoid the technology arms race and do a lower budget game , what kind of games could we make For starters , how about a serious version of ’s creature editor .
Not a drag and drop add - a - tentacle game , but a real virtual organism designer .
A game where half the battle is to put together something that can outrun predators and seek out prey , whilst surviving its environment .
Take into account the creature ’s weight , biochemical needs , defensive and offensive capabilities and brain size , metabolism ...
I do n't care if you need a degree in biology to play the game because there are a lot of people with degrees in biology .
Sell just to them , it 's still viable .[ separator ]
There was a game called Hacker when I was a kid , that my dad was into .
I always remember him telling me with great excitement that when you got to a certain part of the game , in France , the game spoke to you in French .
No tooltips , no help , you needed to know French .
Pre -Internet , this was a considerable stumbling block .
My dad bought a French dictionary and kept on playing .
He also therefore learned a bit of French .
Awesome idea .
You would never ever in a million years get a game like that past a publisher any more , which is a pity because I think there is a group of people out there who would love it .
Games challenge our reflexes , our puzzle - solving skills , our memories and our endurance but they rarely challenge our knowledge .
Why not ?
We are n't all drooling idiots .
As long as you properly define your market , narrowing it should be fine , especially for indie devs like me .
Most people I know are making typical ' casual ' games , aimed at the soccer moms , assuming they understand nothing but what the left mouse button does .
Seriously , its a hot debate as to whether right clicking is ' too involved ' .
I do n't know many people making what you might call intellectual games .
Itbe done though , and done profitably .
I had my first indie hit with a game called .
It 's a turn based political strategy game .
There is not much to look at , no dialogue , no explosions , no conquest , no war .
It 's a 2D game made up of icons with lines connecting them .
It assumes some understanding of political issues and philosophies , together with some basic economics .
To 95 percent of gamers it sounds dull as dishwater .
But that other five percent love it .
What I learned with that game is ; if you treat your customers like intelligent , educated adults , you get intelligent educated adults as customers .
It 's obvious really , after all , a big chunk of the gaming audience is made up of them , so why would n't they flock to one of the few games that treats them as such ?
When someone asks you something trivial you know , you do n't feel good about being right .
When someone asks you something arcane and specialist that people would n't expect you to know , you get a tiny endorphin rush from having the right answer .
People like to be intellectually challenged .
Not all of them , but unless you are Nintendo or Sony you do n't have to please absolutely everyone .
So my call to other game designers is a simple request .
The next time you fear about adding a feature because it seems a bit too ' high brow ' and requires some knowledge , please leave it in .
Do n't apologise for it or panic .
A lot of gamers are actually intelligent and educated .
We are n't as stupid as the tabloid press thinks ...

For all Senator Barack Obama ’s success at raising money and generating excitement among voters , he faces a daunting challenge as he prepares to claim the nomination in August : a Democratic convention effort marred by costly setbacks and embarrassing delays .
With the Denver convention less than two months away , problems range from the serious  upwardly spiraling costs on key contracts still being negotiated  to the mundane , like the reluctance of local caterers to participate because of stringent rules on what delegates will be eating , down to the color of the food .
At last count , plans to renovate the inside of the Pepsi Center for the Democrats are $ 6 million over budget , which may force convention planners to scale back on their original design or increase their fund - raising goals .
The convention is being organized by the Democratic National Committee , which is run by Howard Dean , with his chief of staff , the Rev. Leah D. Daughtry , leading the effort .
Only in the last month has the Obama campaign been able to take over management of the convention planning with the candidate claiming the nomination , and his aides are increasingly frustrated , as the event nears , at organizers who they believe spent too freely , planned too slowly and underestimated actual costs .
The Obama campaign has dispatched 10 people to Denver to help “ get a handle on the budget and make hard decisions ” about what has to be done and how to move forward , said Bill Burton , a campaign spokesman .
Try to imagine a world where every programmer you know is a wannabe language designer , bent on molding the language to their whims .
When I close my eyes and imagine it , I have a vision of the apocalypse , a perfect , pitch - black storm of utterly incomprehensible , pathologically difficult to debug code .
Whereas I have a vision of a world not too much different than the one we live in today .
A few people invent ridiculous things , incomprehensible things .
Most people carry on doing what they ’ve always done .
And a few people invent new , worthwhile things that move us forward .
In my world , a few people inventing great things more than makes up for a few other people inventing ridiculous things .
If we get Rails out of the deal , is n’t it worth giving Ick a bemused smile , tousling the creator ’s hair and encouraging him to “ keep trying ?
” Jeff goes on to put some smart people on a pedestal , prostrating before their greatness .
I admire them as well , but I do n’t confer a priesthood upon them .
Once upon a time , reading and writing was not something plebeians did .
Even the bible was a closed book , you only heard what was recited in Church .
Does anyone doubt that democratizing the written word — through education and especially Gutenberg ’s invention — has been a force for good ?
I imagine that if we traveled back in time we would find monks bewailing what would happen if anyone was allowed to write .
People — the monks would stammer — people might write doggerel !
Pornography !!
Graffiti !!!
But of course , they will also write beautiful things .
And useful things .
Like theories of Astronomy that violate what the priests “ knew ” to be true .
And that is the point : if you leave things up to the priesthood , all you get is stuff that is neatly aligned with what they already know .
You cannot make progress by subjecting new ideas to scrutiny in a committee , even a smart and well - educated committee .
Maybe especially not a smart and well - educated committee .
If it were up to educated people , do you think there would be personal computers today ?
Language design in programming is the same thing .
Yes , it creates an opportunity for misunderstanding .
Yes , you can make an amazing amount of trouble for yourself and for others .
But to put it under lock and key in the Church where only the priest are permitted to mention it in hushed tones … this is wrong .
The message is clear :
You and I are worker ants .
We do not think .
We do not question our tools .
We simply use them as we are directed by those in control .
I find that far more horrifying than just about anything else I can imagine coming out of giving people more freedom .
Come on .
Really .
Let ’s get ahold of ourselves .
As a wonderful movie ’s last line went :
“ You have to have a little faith in people . ”

The first caveat is that there 's a lot of " unique " lines with comments .
Another caveat is that there may be build systems filling in $ VERSION before deployment .
Finally , there are some exotic forms ( package vars and glob assignments ) not included .
( $ VERSION = q( $ Id : Tidy.pm , v 1.64 2007/05/08 20:01:45 perltidy Exp $ ) + ) =~ s/^.*\s+( \d+)\/( \d+ )\/( \d+ ) .*$ / $ 1$ 2$ 3 / ; # all one line for Make + Maker [ download ]
The longest line was in Perl / Tidy.pm ( excluding the comments )
A few observations .
The basic $ VERSION = " 1.01 " is the most popular by far .
There 's still many keyword expanded $ Revision$s parsed into a $ VERSION ( 158 ) .
About the same number append $ Revision $ , $ Id $ or $ Date $ in a comment .
Despite it 's presence in Module / Starter / PBP.pm ( twice ) , qv( ) versions have n't really taken off ( use version ; $ VERSION = qv( '0.0.3 ' ) ) .
Similarly , bare \d.\d. \d versions are rare , as are fully - qualified package versions , glob assignments and " alpha " suffixes .
Performing the ExtUtils :: MakeMaker eval reveals that the most common version is 0.01 .
The most common format is \d. \d\d ( 3025 ) , next is \d. \d\d\d ( 433 ) , then v\d .\d.\d ( 216 ) .
I quite like the SVK solution for app - wide versions :
# SVK ::* modules : use SVK :: Version ; our $ VERSION = $ SVK :: VERSION ; # In SVK :: Version itself : use version ; our $ VERSION = qv( 2.0.2 ) ; [ download ]
Although the possibility of arbitrary code running on a version evaluation is a little troubling .

There was a ' clear breach of the rules ' when the documents were lost Police are investigating a " serious " security breach after a civil servant lost top - secret documents containing the latest intelligence on al - Qaeda .
The unnamed Cabinet Office employee apparently breached strict security rules when he left the papers on the seat of a train .
A fellow passenger spotted the envelope containing the files and gave it to the BBC , who handed them to the police .
The official was later suspended from his job , the Cabinet Office announced .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith now faces demands for an official inquiry .
Keith Vaz MP , chairman of the powerful Home Affairs select committee told the BBC : " Such confidential documents should be locked away ... they should not be read on trains .
There has been a security breach , the Metropolitan Police are carrying out an investigation
Cabinet Office spokesman " I will be writing to the Home Secretary to establish an inquiry into the affair . "
The Conservatives backed calls for an inquiry , with their security spokeswoman , Baroness Neville - Jones , describing the loss as the latest in a " long line of serious breaches of security . "
Home Office minister Tony McNulty told the BBC he was awaiting the results of the police investigation .
' Damning assessment '
The two reports were assessments made by the government 's Joint Intelligence Committee .
One , on Iraq 's security forces , was commissioned by the Ministry of Defence .
According to the BBC 's security correspondent , Frank Gardner , it included a top - secret and in some places " damning " assessment of Iraq 's security forces ,
The other document , reportedly entitled ' Al - Qaeda Vulnerabilities ' , was commissioned jointly by the Foreign Office and the Home Office .
Just seven pages long but classified as " UK Top Secret " , this latest intelligence assessment on al - Qaeda is so sensitive that every document is numbered and marked " for UK / US / Canadian and Australian eyes only " , according to our correspondent .
According to reports , this document may have contained details of names of individuals or locations which might have been useful to Britain 's enemies .

When a fellow passenger saw the material inside the envelope , they gave it to the BBC .
Not suspended Reports suggest that the official , described as a senior male civil servant , works in the Cabinet Office 's intelligence and security unit , which contributes to the work of the Joint Intelligence Committee .
His work reportedly involves writing and contributing to intelligence and security assessments , and that he has the authority to take secret documents out of the Cabinet Office - so long as strict procedures are observed .
Once the documents were reported missing , a full - scale search had been launched by the Metropolitan Police , amid fears that such highly sensitive material could have fallen into the wrong hands .
Our correspondent said that across several departments in Whitehall on Wednesday evening there is said to be " horror " that top - secret documents could have been so casually mislaid .
Inquiry
Any inquiry is likely to focus on the Cabinet Office , and the security procedures that made it possible for sensitive information to be allowed out of a secure environment .
A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said : " Two documents which are marked as ' secret ' were left on a train and have subsequently been handed to the BBC .
" There has been a security breach , the Metropolitan Police are carrying out an investigation . "
The spokesman declined to discuss the contents of the documents .
One Whitehall source sought to play down the impact of the breach : " The embarrassment of the loss is greater than the embarrassment of the contents of the documents .
" We do n't believe there is a threat to any individuals in what was in these documents if they had got into the wrong hands . "
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said : " We are making inquiries in connection with the loss of documents on June 10 . "

What are these ?
On June 12 , 2004 , my brother Eric was admitted to the emergency room at Mass .
General Hospital , unconscious after what appeared to be a failed suicide attempt .
His wife , Cheryl , had found him passed out near the floor of their bedroom closet , a wire wrapped around his neck and attached to the closet pole .
Had she gotten home any later , he might not have been alive .
I arrived at the hospital a few hours after he had been brought in , joining Cheryl and my oldest sister , Lisa .
The police interviewed us , and we all agreed that the past few months had been tumultuous : fights , restraining orders , drinking , and severe depression .
Eric was kept in intensive care and , according to the police report , was in " stable and improving condition . "
He was released the next day .
A few weeks later , after Eric had agreed to go into an outpatient program but failed to show up for any appointments , he was found in his Winthrop apartment , slouched over on his knees .
He had choked himself to death with a wire attached to a closet pole .
He was 46 .
As most clinicians would agree , one of the most heartbreaking aspects of psychiatric emergency work is the suicidal patient .
When assessing a person 's risk for suicide , ER doctors have little to work with .
Unless the patient has a medical history that includes other suicide attempts , clinicians rely heavily on their evaluative skills and what is called the self - report , the patient 's own appraisal of what happened and how the person is feeling .
Was the overdose accidental or intentional ?
Had he or she been drinking ?
Did the person stop taking any prescribed medication ?
Did he really want to die when he strung up a wire in the closet and wrapped it around his neck , or was that a cry for help ?
Eric 's self - report became an important factor in deciding what to do .
But my brother had worked in healthcare for many years and had a sense of what to say and how to act .
What he wanted was to go home .
But should he have been admitted involuntarily to the inpatient psychiatric unit instead ?
Were n't the circumstances of what brought him into the hospital in the first place reason enough to suspect he was seriously ill ?
In Massachusetts , if a patient clearly demonstrates imminent risk , he can be involuntarily admitted for up to four days , at which point a court hearing determines whether to extend the stay .
But those admissions are rare .
Lanny Berman , executive director of the American Association of Suicidology , explains that unless you are actually threatening to kill yourself while in the hospital , it is highly unlikely that you will be admitted for any length of time .
This is mainly because it is extremely difficult to assess suicidality in patients .
For one thing , many people who are suicidal have good reason not to let on that they are a danger to themselves :
They want to die .
What clinicians need is some other measure beyond external evidence that could assess whether someone like Eric is capable of suicide in the near future .
Four years after my brother 's death , Harvard researchers at MGH are experimenting with a test they think could help clinicians determine just that .
It focuses on a patient 's subconscious thoughts , and if it can be perfected , these researchers say it could give hospitals more of a legal basis for admitting suicidal patients .
Of course , I can't help thinking about whether such a test could have saved my brother .
But I also wonder :
Would it have been ethically right - or even possible - to save him even if he did n't want to save himself ?
THIS MISSING PIECE in the suicidal puzzle is what prompted the innovative research study now in its final phase at MGH .
The study , led by Dr. Matthew Nock , an associate professor in the psychology department at Harvard University , is called the Suicide Implicit Association Test .
It 's a variation of the Implicit Association Test , or IAT , which was invented by Anthony Greenwald at the University of Washington and " co-developed " by Dr. Mahzarin Banaji , now a psychology professor at Harvard who works a few floors above Nock on campus .
The premise is that test takers , by associating positive and negative words with certain images ( or words ) - for example , connecting the word " wonderful " with a grouping that contains the word " good " and a picture of a EuropeanAmerican - reveal their unconscious , or implicit , thoughts .
The critical factor in the test is not the associations themselves , but the relative speed at which those connections are made .
( If you 're curious , take a sample IAT test online at implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/.)
The IAT itself is not new - it was created in 1998 - and has been used to evaluate unconscious bias against African - Americans , Arabs , fat people , and Judaism .
But critics question whether the test is actually practical , and up until now no one has tried to apply it to suicide prevention .
As part of his training , Nock worked extensively with adolescent self - injurers - self - injury , such as cutting and burning , is an important coping method for those who engage in it , though they are often unlikely to acknowledge it .
Nock thought that the IAT could serve as a behavioral measure of who is a self - injurer and whether such a person was in danger of continuing the behavior , even after treatment .
In their first major study , Nock and Banaji asserted that the IAT could be adapted to show who was inclined to be self - injurious and who was not .
And more important , they said , the test could reveal who was in danger of future self - injury .
The next step , Nock realized , was to use the test to determine , from a person 's implicit thoughts , whether someone who had prior suicidal behavior was likely to continue to be suicidal .
It would give doctors a third component , along with self - reporting and clinician reporting , and result in a more complete picture of a patient .
Nock does n't assume that a test like the IAT would be 100 percent accurate , but he believes it would have predictive ability .
" It is not a lie detector , " he says .
" But in an ideal situation , a clinician who is struggling with a decision to admit a potentially suicidal patient to the hospital , or with an equally difficult decision to discharge a patient from the hospital following a potentially lethal suicide attempt , the IAT could provide additional information about whether the clinician should admit or keep that patient in the hospital . "
Over two years , researchers at MGH asked patients who had attempted suicide if they would be willing to participate in the test .
About two - thirds of them agreed ( some 200 patients ) - even though some had tried killing themselves just hours before - and after answering a battery of questions about their thoughts , sat with a laptop and took the IAT .
During one test , a person was shown two sets of words on a screen , one in the upper left corner , one in the upper right .
A single word then appeared in the center , and the test taker was asked to indicate with a keystroke the corner containing the word that connected to the center word .
The corner sets were drawn from two groups of words ( one group was " escape " and " stay , " and another was " me " and " not me " ) .
In one version , the sets were " escape / not me " and " stay / me , " and the series of words that appeared in the center included , among others , " quit , " " persist , " " myself , " and " them . "
The correct answers called for " quit " to be associated with the side that had " escape , " for " myself " to be matched with the side that had " me , " and so forth .
In theory , a delay in answering on " quit , " even if the person got it right , could reveal that he was associating the idea of " quit " with the idea of himself .
The word sets varied depending on the test , and bias could emerge in a positive or negative way .
For example , if the sets were " escape / me " and " stay / not me " and a person hesitated in correctly matching " myself " to the side with " me , " it could reveal that he was associating himself with the idea of " stay . "
For about the next five months , Nock and his research team at Harvard will analyze all the data collected from MGH .
If they think their findings show promise , they will follow up and run their experiment again to see if it yields similar results .
If it does , they may seek to implement the test at an area hospital .
For now , following up with patients will be pivotal in assessing the test 's effectiveness .
Tragically , though , the only way researchers will know for sure whether the test can predict behavior is if a key number of patients attempt suicide again .
WHEN I WENT IN TO THE INTENSIVE CARE unit to see Eric , he was barely conscious , a breathing tube taped to his face .
Eric had spent years as a respiratory therapist , and it was no small irony to see him intubated , lying on a gurney in the emergency room .
I was afraid he would look frail and weak .
Instead , he looked larger than normal , strong even , as if he were girded for battle , a battle that in fact was taking place inside him .
His body was stiffened against the machines and the people who were trying to keep him alive .
My brother had tried to commit suicide , but finding himself alive was no relief .
Eric was 7 years older than I , so growing up together , first in Framingham and then in Florida , was often filled with disconnects .
I watched him struggle through adolescence from the other side of our bedroom long before I would have those same struggles myself .
Over the years , Eric would often seem filled with a kind of unspoken regret for each choice he had made in his life , such as his brief stint in the Air Force .
He was one of the funniest people I have ever known ( he could playfully mimic anyone within minutes of meeting them ) , yet it also seemed as if there were some invisible boulder he had to push up a hill , only to see it roll back down again .
We bonded over music and movies , and when my son was born , Eric embraced him as his own .
Soon after , though , his dark moods revealed themselves to be an undiagnosed depression .
At the hospital , when he was conscious and lucid enough , he told the attending psychiatrist that he did n't mean to kill himself , that he was not suicidal .
He said he had been drinking a little and accidentally took too much of his prescription medication .
He was OK , really , he must have insisted , because the next day he was released .
It 's remarkable how much the desire to die can create in a person an ability to appear stable .
It is difficult to tell what would motivate someone like my brother to take the IAT .
Why would someone in such a state want his unconscious thoughts to be known ?
The answer , it seems , lies in the relationship we have with our own unconscious .
We want to understand our own deeper drives and desires .
But there is another reason someone might take it : to try and beat it .
Not only do we want to understand our unconscious motivations , we also want to believe we are their master .
But there are other reservations .
Someone taking the test immediately after trying to commit suicide is likely to score high , even if he is not in danger of trying it again .
Nock acknowledged that he and other researchers score highly on the Suicide - IAT , given their endless thinking about the subject .
So how can such a test predict future behavior ?
One of the earliest criticisms of the IAT poses this very question .
Even though this test might reveal our unconscious thoughts about race and gender ( or in this case , a propensity to suicidal behavior ) , detractors say that it can't tell us anything about how these thoughts affect actions .
Even if someone is shown to have a subconscious prejudice against overweight people , for instance , that does n't necessarily mean the person would n't have a friend or hire someone who is overweight .
And some critics say that a person 's mere awareness of a cultural bias can affect the results .

For countries across the planet , summer is not necessarily the looked - for time of the year where it is all beach parties and sunbathing .
For many of us , our lands celebrate the arrival of summer by bursting in to flame .
One would need to be blind , deaf and dumb to have missed the fires burning across North America , in particular California .
But according to a new study by researchers at the University of Colorado and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , North American wildfires may prove a blessing to the neighboring Arctic .
Green Options very own Jennifer Lance has been right in the middle of the Californian wildfires .
“ I wanted to know what road I could take out of our valley if I needed to escape the firestorm … I felt trapped , ” she said in her article entitled ‘ 700 California Wildfires : Why Do n’t We Have Enough Firefighing Resources ? ’ published back in June .
But according to Robert Stone , an atmospheric scientist with the university and NOAA Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences ( CIRES ) and lead author of the study , which appears this week in the Journal of Geophysical Research , “ Smoke in the atmosphere temporarily reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface .
This transitory effect could partly offset some of the warming caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases and other pollutants . ”
This study is very early in its life , and the authors make note that the smoke , under the right circumstances , may in fact life more difficult .
But the baseline to their study focuses on the effect that increased matter in the sky , ie , clouds , this time made of smoke , are helping block out the sun ’s rays .
And though the level of sun that is hindered in its passage to Earth is dependent upon how thick the smoke is , in this day and age , anything helps .
Stone and his colleagues focused their research on recent fires that swept through Alaska and western Canada in 2004 .
Though short - term , that summer saw a record 10,000 square miles of Alaska ’s interior and another 12,000 square miles in western Canada burn .
Smoke from these fires not only reached as far away as Greenland and the Svalbard archipelago north of Norway , but as far south as the Gulf of Mexico .
They found that smoke in the atmosphere affected a warming of itself , producing a cooling effect of the surface beneath .
“ The heating of the smoke layer and cooling of the surface can lead to increased atmospheric stability , which in turn may keep clouds from forming , ” said Stone .
“ We think that this influence of smoke aerosol on clouds further affects the balance of radiation reaching the surface in the Arctic . ”
So though no one in their right mind would wish bush / wildfires upon anyone , here again is another occasion of something good coming out of something bad .
And to those still caught in fire affected areas , and those already hurt by the fires that have passed through , our thoughts and prayers go with you .

More than 300 people wait in line to attend the House Judiciary Committee 's hearing on the " Executive Power and Its Constitutional Limitations " Friday in Washington D.C. WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Call it the un-impeachment hearing .
The Democratic - run House Judiciary Committee put on a hearing that it insisted was not about removing President Bush from office .
But critics of Bush 's policies could n't pass up the chance to charge the president with a long list of impeachable " high crimes and misdemeanors . "
Leading the way was Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , the former Democratic presidential candidate who has brought repeated impeachment resolutions on the House floor against Bush and Vice President Cheney .
Kucinich got a rock star welcome of whistles , hoots and clapping as he walked into the hearing room , holding hands with his wife , from hundreds of anti-war , anti-Bush people crammed into the room and lining the hallways outside .
T - shirts reading " Arrest Bush " and " Veterans for Impeachment " illustrated the sentiments of many .
" The decision before us is whether to demand accountability for one of the gravest injustices imaginable , " Kucinich testified , avoiding use of the " I " word .
The House Democratic leadership , not interested in a bloody impeachment battle in the last year of Bush 's presidency , steered Kucinich 's resolutions to the Judiciary Committee where they could quietly fade away , but Friday 's hearing did give Kucinich and his allies one opportunity to air their views .
" To the regret of many , this is not an impeachment hearing , " said committee chairman John Conyers , D - Mich . , pointing out the less incendiary title of the event , " executive power and its constitutional limitations . "
Still , Conyers , a vocal opponent of Bush , noted that his panel had pursued many allegations that Kucinich and others regard as impeachable offenses : manipulating intelligence about Iraq ; misusing authority with regard to torture , detention and rendition ; politicizing the Justice Department and retaliating against critics , as in the outing of former CIA agent Valerie Plame .
Republicans , clearly in the minority at the hearing , expressed suspicion at Democratic motives .
Rep. Dan Lungren , R - Calif. , called it " impeachment lite , " where people were given free rein to impugn Bush but not to impeach him .
" It seems that we are hosting an anger management class , " said Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas , the committee 's senior Republican .
" This hearing will not cause us to impeach the president ; it will only serve to impeach Congress 's credibility . "
At one point , a couple of people in the hearing room were asked to leave amid voices of protest .
The committee reminded lawmakers and those testifying that House rules prohibit " personal abuse , innuendo or ridicule of the president . "
The House Rules and Manual points out that suggestions of mendacity , or accusations of hypocrisy , demagoguery or deception were out of order .
" The rules of the House prevent me or any witness from utilizing familiar terms , " Kucinich said .
" But we can put two and two together in our minds . "
Former Los Angeles County Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi , known for his prosecution of Charles Manson in 1970 , acknowledged that " I am forbidden from accusing him of a crime , or even any dishonorable conduct " under House rules .
But he could still encourage people to read his book , " The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder . "
Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D - Calif. , was less circumspect is asserting that Bush was " the worst president that our nation has ever suffered . "
Rep. Maurice Hinchey , D - N.Y. , concluded that " this is the most impeachable administration in the history of America because of the way that it has clearly violated the law . "
" I am really astonished at the mood in this room , " commented one witness , George Mason University School of Law professor Jeremy Rabkin .
" The tone of these deliberations is slightly demented , " Rabkin said .
" You should all remind yourselves that the rest of the country is not necessarily in this same bubble in which people think it is reasonable to describe the president as if he were Caligula . "

This scenario will be the most serious threat experienced by our society since the Second World War .
This is the first in a series of discussions that look at ways to secure Australia ’s oil based energy security into the future .
Over the next few weeks we will look at short and long term goals for personal and industrial transport .
Yet this is exactly the scenario that is emerging .
The vast majority of transport in Australia is fuelled by oil .
Without oil , transport stops .
And we are being warned from every direction that our oil supplies are no longer secure .
Transport is critical to the functioning of our society .
If Australia ’s transportation stopped tomorrow , then most of us would be starving in the dark a few weeks later .
This is the first in a series of posts co-authored with Phoenix and Matt Mushalik .
In my previous post I took a high - level look at solutions for Australia .
This post starts the process of iterating down from the high - level view .
It assumes that we will not be able to instantly convert to sustainable solutions - we need to get there in steps .
This article is co-authored with Phoenix , a qualified mechanical engineer who has been working in the infrastructure construction industry for over 28 years .
He has held senior manangement positions with a number of organisations delivering projects to key energy providers .
These projects have included oil refineries , power stations , LNG plants and gas processing facilities .
He currently works as the National Manager – Power Generation for a major Australian construction group .
2.0 TARGETS
The papers have been full of warnings from ABARE that Australia ’s oil reserves will rise slightly this year , and then follow a depleting pattern through to 2013 .
Within 5 years we will be dependant on foreign oil for more than 50 % of our needs .
However the ability of our traditional trading partners to deliver the oil we need is rapidly disappearing .
Within 3 - 5 years , most of them will be exporting much less oil ( http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3657 ) .
The oil we need for our transport will not be available .
Quantifying the degree of the problem is difficult , as it depends on two factors :
1 . How much can we pay for oil without crippling our GDP and disrupting our macro-economic system ?
2 . To what degree can we compete with other nations , when these nations attempt to lock - in supply by exerting economic , political and military pressure ?
This problem is not unique to Australia ; our situation is simply a little more acute and immediate than the situation in the US or Asia .
The CIBC has observed that oil exports are expected to fall world - wide ( http://research.cibcwm.com/economic_public/download/occrept62.pdf ) and the IEA is scheduled to release a report in November that , according to early news releases , ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/09/AR200707... ) supports this assertion .
According to their press releases , the IEA is predicting a “ Supply Crunch ” by 2010 - 2012 .
In 2012 we will be competing for new trading partners to replace the shortfall from our traditional suppliers .
We will be competing against larger countries that can exert economic , political or military pressure , so we might need to accept that we will pay extremely high costs for a constrained supply that will only meet a portion of our requirements .
Although difficult to quantify , one thing can be stated with certainty :
The only oil that we can count on is the oil we produce ourselves .
In 5 years , this oil is likely to represent less than 50 % of our projected needs .
This post will therefore focus on solutions that enable the country to establish complete oil independence within a 5 year period .
Subsequent posts in the upcoming weeks will examine other issues , including the subsequent transition to more sustainable modes of transport .
3.0 PUBLIC AWARENESS
We have had warnings about an imminent energy crisis from :
- The peak international energy organisation , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) .
- Commercial analysts such as the CIBC .
- Governmental groups , such as the Energy Watch Group ( EWG ) in Germany
- The major oil exporters .
The two biggest , Russia and Saudi Arabia have both warned that expectations of major increases in production will not be met .
Malaysia ( one of Australia ’s largest suppliers ) has warned that it might not be able to meet even internal needs for oil in 2011 !
( http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=339506 )
- The US Dept of Energy .
Starting in 2005 , with the Hirsch Reports , the US DOE has turned out a string of studies on this subject .
Despite this , the magnitude and timescale of the crisis is difficult to accept .
It is likely that , in order to avoid catastrophic economic impacts , we will need to find a path to energy self - reliance within only 5 years !
The impending crisis will involve serious consequences for the current lifestyle experienced by most Australians .
This will be a difficult for many average citizens to accept and even more difficult for them to act on .
Many of problems posed do not lend themselves to mandated solutions .
Governments cannot tell people where to live or what job to take ( at least not in the Australia we currently enjoy ) .
The solutions must instead come from the general public , making decisions based on their individual circumstances .
However , the public cannot make these decisions without a clear understanding of the problem and the Government ’s proposed solutions .
Action :
The federal government must make the public fully aware of oil depletion and it ’s implication for future fuel prices .
The increase in the cost of conventional fuels is likely to have the greatest impact on discretionary motor vehicle travel .
However it is important that the public is not shielded from taking full responsibility for cutting usage .
It will be very easy for governments to resort to popularist policy decisions to reduce excise or in other ways encourage the continued high levels of personal use .
The current tax and excise regime must be either maintained or enhanced to discourage the unnecessary discretionary use of personal vehicles .
The approach by government to the issue of excise and tax on oil based fuels will be the most powerful message they can send to the general public concerning the gravity and impact of oil depletion .
The general public do not have the knowledge or skills necessary to interpret the likely price effect of the future oil demand / supply imbalance .
They will need simple guidelines concerning future price in order to make sensible personal decisions .
Action : Federal government to set up an Oil Excise Commission whose specific task is to maintain a forecast of future oil prices for a period of 20 years out .
The oil excise will be set at a level that produces a linear increase in prices up to the forecast .
The commission will act independent of government and be charged to decrease excise in the event of spikes in the international oil price and increase it when the international price falls .
The net tax take over time to be maintained at current levels .
4.0 SUPPLY
The achievement of self sufficiency can be tackled by addressing both sides of the supply – demand equation .
The supply side can be influenced by a number of factors that affect not only the supply of indigenous crude oil but also alternative and substitute fuels such as Natural Gas , Coal to Oil , Biofuels and Electricity
4.1 Indigenous Crude Oil
The bulk of Australia ’s crude oil production comes from Bass Strait fields and fields located off the west coast of Western Australia .
The current government policy provides for oil field developers to sell oil extracted from these fields into the Australian market at world parity prices .
There is no obvious need to change this policy as it should provide explorers and developers with the incentive they require to develop new fields and maintain production as high as is possible within the physical constraints .
Governments should ensure however , that the requirement to give first preference to local supply be incorporated in all new permits issued .
Considering the timeframes that are required to find , test and develop new fields , it is unlikely that new finds will have any significant effect on our oil energy dependency within the 5 - year period that we are currently examining .
4.2 Gas
Australia has an abundance of gas supplies both in the form of natural gas and CSM ( Coal Seam Methane ) .
As will be discussed later , it is likely that natural gas will provide the country with the most effective bridging fuel for the next 20 years .
Proved and probable reserves of natural gas are in the order of 140 tcf ( trillion cubic feet ) and the CSIRO has estimated CSM reserves to be in excess of 250 tcf .
If the entire country ’s oil demand were converted to gas we would consume around 1.6 tcf per year in addition to the current gas consumption of around 0.7 tcf per year .
We therefore have over 100 years supply of this valuable fuel at current usage levels – enough to provide us with a transition fuel and still leave some stocks of this valuable resource for future Australian generations .
However Australia currently exports close to 1 tcf per year with plans to increase this number to more than 4 tcf per year .
This creates an insurmountable technical problem – it is not possible to increase local production to the level required to meet increased exports and ensure oil substitution within a five year time frame .
All increased production must service domestic demand first , so the intended export targets will not be met .
This makes economic sense – the income we receive from the LNG is only a fraction of the cost of the oil it will replace , so it makes more sense to keep it in Australia .
Action : Federal government to set in place a moratorium over the development of any new export contracts or facilities for the export of LNG .
For CNG to be an effective replacement for liquid fuels it needs to be provided with a widespread piping network to support refuelling points .
This and the substantial increase in demand will mean that the natural gas pipe network that exists on the eastern seaboard of the country will need to be extended and reinforced .
This network is privately owned .
Government encouragement and facilitation will be required to ensure the private owners put in place the required enhancements .
4.3 Coal to Oil
Australia has vast reserves of coal and one possible solution for oil dependence is to convert some of this coal supply to liquid fuel .
The technology for the conversion is well established using high temperature gasification of the coal and conversion of the resulting syngas to liquids in a Fischer Tropes reaction .
However :
- The process is wasteful of energy and produces a large amount of CO2 .
- The infrastructure required for the conversion is large , complex and capital intensive .
- Developers of this infrastructure need to consider the impact of carbon tax on the price of the production .
For these reasons , it is unlikely that major developments will occur until there are clear price directions from both the carbon trade and the oil price .
By the time these price signals are received there is no chance that any substantial production could be achieved within a 5 - year timeframe .
4.4 Biofuels
Ultimately these may be the only energy efficient liquid fuels that will be available to us .
The work on progressively transferring all of our liquid fuel demands to biofuels needs to progress at a rate that will have these fuels carry the entire liquid fuel demand within about 30 years .
Because of our very large growing areas , Australia is ideally placed for the generation of biofuels .
We are however faced with a number of physical and moral difficulties .
Climate change and resulting drought will impact on our capacity to grow sufficient feed stock for the production of biofuels in the quantities required .
We also have to face the fact that feedstocks used for production of fuel directly impacts on the world capacity to feed an ever growing population .
The different biofuels can be effectively categorised into the feedstocks used to produce them as it is the feedstocks not the fuels themselves that are critical to the fuel ’s financial viability .
Sugar based ethanol
Australia has a substantial sugar growing industry and some of this capacity could easily be diverted into ethanol production .
The planning and development of additional ethanol production facilities could occur within a 5 year timeframe .
The only impediment is economics and certainty of a market .
Action : Federal government to mandate a progressive increase in ethanol content of all petrol in line with an aggressive build program for ethanol production .
Biodiesel based on animal or vegetable oils
Australia had a developed a large momentum behind this industry up till about 3 years ago .
At that point the federal government decided to introduce the 50 % ie .
19c / litre excise regime on all biofuels .
This tax killed off many new proposals and forced some producers to close down facilities .
Currently producers are only focused on plants where the feedstock is a waste product .
This severely limits the capacity of the industry .
Ultimately the price of oil may make biofuels such as palm oil and algae based oil possible .
Ethically responsible biofuel programs may grow out of these beginnings , but these industries will require years to develop and will be unlikely to be of any benefit within a 5 year timeframe .
Nevertheless government needs to provide a lot more encouragement to this aspect of the solution .
Action : Federal government to repeal all excise on domestically produced biofuels .
4.5 Electricity
With the increase in oil price there will inevitably be a transfer of energy demand on to the electricity generation system .
In the initial phase this will consist of increased load from public transport systems .
Over a 3 year timeframe increases in load will result form electrification of rail and increased use of conveyor systems in lieu of haul trucks in mining .
The major change however will be as a result of the take up by the public of plug in hybrid vehicles for commuter transport .
Plugin vehicle should not present severe difficulty for the electricity system to manage if they are confined to drawing power in off - peak times .
The large uptake of off peak power will necessitate a rapid roll out of timed metering .
Action : State governments to legislate that distributors are to provide access to timed metering to all consumers upon request .
Normal changes in the load profile for the electricity system are managed by the system control organisation .
These changes however will be relatively rapid and will come at a time when the generation industry already faces massive upheaval due to the implications of carbon taxes and uncertainty over future fuel pricing .
Power stations take 3 - 5 years to plan and build , cost up to a $ Billion and have a life of more than 30 years .
Developers need certainty over future operating conditions to free them to commit to such investments .
Action : Federal government to quickly resolve the carbon tax regime that is to be applied .
At present developers are intending a major switch to gas fired generation based on the lower carbon emissions of this fuel .
The aggression with which this switch is pursued will depend on the treatment of existing coal fired generators under the new tax regime .
This switch to gas however is being considered in isolation of the requirement of gas to provide an interim substitute for oil .
In combination with proposed LNG export facilities the gas industry is in real danger of an over commitment , a resulting price hike and a failure to deliver .
Action : Federal government to immediately establish a national body for the management of the eastern seaboard gas network .
The body to be responsible to forecast and manage future gas demand in a way similar to the way the NEM is managed .
5.0 DEMAND
Australia currently consumes around 880,000 barrels of oil a day .
We currently produce around 570,000 barrels a day or 65 % .
As discussed previously the production of indigenous crude is likely to fall to around 50 % by 2013 .
Add to this the small increases from production in alternative fuels and small amounts we will be able to extract from world markets , it is likely that we will have an overall oil availability in 5 years of around 60 % of current consumption .
We must therefore target a reduction in overall demand of 40 % or 352,000 bpd .
Following is a table of the approximate usage by sector of Australia ’s total consumption .
The targeted reductions will be discussed under each sectors analysis .
Sector 2007 Usage ( bpd ) Proportion of Total Target Reduction Agriculture 45,239 5.2 % 5 % Mining 43,521 5.0 % 15 % Industry / Commerce 80,171 9.1 % 25 % Road Transport ( Personal ) 388,829 44.3 % 60 % Road Transport ( Goods ) 133,427 15.2 % 25 % Public transport 12,598 1.4 % 0 % Rail goods 11,453 1.3 % 40 % Air transport 98,496 11.2 % 50 % Water transport 24,624 2.8 % 0 % Products 36,650 4.2 % 0 % Heating 2,291 0.3 % 50 % Total 877,300 100 % 40 %
5.1 Personal Transport
Australia currently utilizes approximately 44 % or 390,000 barrels of oil a day on personal transport .
While personal transport directly contributes very little to wealth and gross domestic product it is the one area likely to have the greatest impact on our society and our economy .
Our housing stock has been configured to be heavily reliant on personal transport to get people to and from their place of work .
A disruption to fuel availability would trigger a major disruption to the workforce , that would make the difficulties that we currently face seem paltry .
So the challenge will be to cut our reliance on oil , in a dramatically short time frame , yet maintain as much as possible of our current lifestyle .
Personal transport involves a significant proportion of discretionary use so it is reasonable that the reductions here are more severe than the overall target .
Short - term Goal :
In 5 years , reduce Australia ’s oil consumption for personal transport to 40 % of current consumption .
To achieve this goal we will need to :
1. Reduce the number of kilometers driven .
2. Increase the efficiency of vehicles .
3. Replace petrol and diesel with alternate fuels .
1. Reduce Kilometers Driven
The increase in the cost of conventional fuels is likely to have the greatest impact on discretionary motor vehicle travel .
For this to be effective in reducing demand it is important that the public is not shielded from taking full responsibility for cutting usage .
It will be very easy for governments to resort to popularist policy decisions to reduce excise or in other ways encourage the continued high levels of personal use .
The current tax and excise regime must be either maintained or enhanced to discourage the discretionary use of personal vehicle .
Of course the public must be provided with alternatives to the use of personal vehicles for non-discretionary travel .
This will mean a substantial effort by all local authorities throughout Australia .
Bus and train services will need to expand dramatically .
Where appropriate , road networks may need to be reconfigured to provide serious levels of accommodation for bicycle traffic .
People are abandoning their cars and moving to Public Transport .
This process is an inevitable consequence of high oil prices .
We cannot simply say “ please wait until we install an electric light rail in your area ” , people need a service now .
We need to provide solutions that are immediately available .
Small commuter busses bought straight off the assembly line and converted to CNG provide a “ bridging service ” .
This bridging service can provide a pathway to light rail .
Action : Local governments to dramatically increase existing fleets of busses and commuter trains .
For remoter suburbs consideration to be given to the introduction battery - powered or CNG powered mini-busses for shuttle services to transfer hubs on main roads and arterials .
While it is unrealistic to expect major new infrastructure such as light and heavy rail to be put in place over 5 years the relevant governments must take immediate action to commence the planning processes for this infrastructure .
Waiting until the crisis unfolds may mean the difficulties in building these projects will be insurmountable .
2. Improve Vehicle Efficiency
While there is little that governments can do directly to effect the efficiency of motor vehicles there is significant measures that can be taken to influence the acceptance and take - up of high efficiency vehicles .
Action : Increase tariffs imposed on all imported vehicles using a sliding scale based purely on fuel consumption levels .
Action : Impose increased sales tax on all locally manufactured vehicles based purely on fuel consumption levels .
3. Alternative Fuels
On the demand side there are only two alternative motor vehicle fuel sources , electric and CNG ( Compressed Natural Gas ) .
Both of these sources have their place and need to be encouraged in parallel but CNG provides the most immediate solution to disengage the existing personal car fleet from oil dependence .
The conversion to Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG ) requires only a minor change to the existing fleet .
The conversion costs about $ 3,000 per vehicle .
The payback for this expense is around $ 1800 per year at current oil prices .
The conversion from petrol to CNG is not a long - term solution – this would just be changing one problem for another .
Long - term we need to be aiming for 100 % renewable energy .
This conversion buys us time , allowing for a gradual transition rather than a traumatic shock .
Action : Government to introduce a 50 % cash rebate on costs for conversion of private vehicles to CNG .
5.2 Other Demand
The other areas of demand reduction such as industry , goods transportation , air travel etc. will be discussed in a subsequent post .
6.0 CONCLUSION
6.1 Supply / demand balance
This will be the subject of a more detailed analysis to determine the time based results of the above measures and determine how effective each of the measures will be in achieving the targeted balance between domestic oil production and demand .
6.2 Government Budgets
There is no doubt the action items identified here will have significant budgetary effects .
We have estimated the net government outlays to be in the order of $ 10 Billion in capital expenditure over a five year period .
In addition there will be a impact on recurring revenues of around $ 7 Billion .
This will come over a period during which there will be decreased economic activity and so lower tax revenue .
The only way these expenditures can be responsibly accommodated is to slash government spending on the infrastructure associated with the oil - based economy .
Action : Federal and state governments to put a moratorium on all new projects involving public roads ( excluding modifications for public transport ) and airport facilities .
6.3 Economic Effects
The impending oil crisis will have wide ranging implications for both our domestic and the international economy .
Australia along with most of the world will enter into an extended period of negative growth .
This will manifest itself in the Australian context as a large increase in unemployment numbers .
To a degree these effects can be countered by the high expenditure rates associated with the above measures .
If prepared and managed properly by governments these actions can be used very effectively to stabilise the economy following the oil price induced crisis .

I took these photos a few days ago .
Guess where the heat pipe is ?
( tip : flowers )
Out of all of the blessings that have come into my life
over the last two and a half years or so ( a new home , my daughter , financial recovery , a new career , a lot of wonderful readers ) , the one that has impacted my life the most is the fact I stopped living paycheck - to - paycheck .
With this one simple move , I went from worrying about bills to knowing I always had money in the bank .
What Does it Mean to Live Paycheck - to - Paycheck ?
Living paycheck - to - paycheck means you have to wait for payday before you can pay your bills because you do n’t have any savings .
While it ’s nice to have paychecks coming in the first place , a paycheck - to - paycheck existence can be truly problematic .
When you live so close to the cuff that you ca n’t pay your bills until your next payday rolls around , it ’s a lot easier to get into debt or let a surprise expense pull you behind .
Some examples of how paycheck - to - paycheck living can make your life harder include :
If you lose your job , your life requires you to find a replacement job immediately .
Thus , you ’re completely dependent on your current job .
You ca n’t sustain even a few days without that regular paycheck coming in .
Quite often , your boss knows this and takes advantage of it , because they know you ca n’t function without that job – this , in the end , makes your job completely miserable and makes it dominate your life .
You ca n’t plan ahead for disasters .
Whenever something bad happens , like a car breaking down or a child needing emergency dental work , your only choice is to bust out the plastic and then sweat it over the next several months as you fight to pay down the balance .
If you ’re relying on each subsequent check to even manage your day - to - day life , you ca n’t plan ahead for these unfortunate situations .
Instead , the best you can hope for is some good “ luck ” in that they wo n’t occur too often .
You ca n’t plan ahead for bigger things , either .
Dreaming of a big family vacation ?
How about a new car , or a new house ?
If you ’re living paycheck to paycheck , these dreams are simply unreachable in the foreseeable future .
You might really want these things for your family , but they ’re unattainable with your current financial structure .
So what ’s the solution ?
The solution is obviously to back slowly away from living paycheck to paycheck , but it ’s not always easy .
Ten Tactics for Backing Away From Paycheck - to - Paycheck Living
1. Recognize the problem and commit to dealing with it .
I was in these very shoes once upon a time , waiting for that next paycheck to come in so I could cover the required bills and then spend some more .
I racked up five figures in credit card debt and it got so bad I spent a very long night holding my infant son and wondering how I would ever fix things .
Living paycheck - to - paycheck is a problem of your own creation .
But you ’re not alone in creating that problem , and if you put your nose to the grindstone , you can get out of it and start moving towards financial prosperity .
Use the internet – or your own social network – to find out about the experiences of others who turned their ship around and share your thoughts and difficulties anonymously .
You ’ll find it much easier to work through this tough process .
2. Look for regular expenses you can trim away .
The first big step is to trim your monthly expenses .
Reduce that cable bill and that cell phone bill .
Get rid of unused memberships like gym memberships or country club memberships .
Look for ways to
tone down your home energy use .
Start a carpool or start using public transportation .
Start cooking at home more and eating out less .
All of these things will ease the monthly pressure on your wallet , allowing you to stop feeling like you ’re falling behind and instead start getting ahead a little .
If you do n’t know exactly how much you ’re spending , it may also be smart to track all your spending for a while .
Tracking your spending can be advantageous since it tells you exactly where your money is going every month .
Once you have that knowledge , it ’s a lot easier to find areas where you need to make a change .
3 . Do n’t shop for entertainment ’s sake .
When you ’re hanging out with friends , it can be tempting to go shopping for clothes or hit the electronics store .
Do n’t .
Find anything else to do .
Shopping for fun in a social environment is costly even if you do n’t buy anything , because you ’re surrounded by temptation and the mental picture of stuff you want but do n’t really need .
It ’s an excuse to talk to your friends about stuff you want and potentially talk yourself into purchases , either now or later .
If you want to save money , just stay away .
4 . Cap your non-essential spending each month .
We all spend some money on things we do n’t really need .
Instead of just spending as opportunities arise , put a cap on that spending each month .
Allow you and your spouse a cash allowance each month and agree that your discretionary spending comes from this cash and this cash alone .
Make the amount lower than what you normally spend , but not enough lower that you ’re tempted to cheat .
Then , when you ’re used to the amount , consider lowering it a bit more until you find a sweet spot of savings and fun .
You can even try using a budget if you think this strategy could work .
One of our favorite budgets is the zero-sum budget .
This type of budget can be helpful because it forces you to give each dollar you earn a job .
You have to “ spend ” all your money on paper at the beginning of the month , and this makes it more likely you ’ll allocate cash to savings and debt repayment .
5 . Do n’t use your ATM receipt or check ledger as “ permission ” to spend .
If you ’ve ever looked at an ATM receipt or at your checkbook ledger to find out if you can afford something , the answer is that you can ’t .
Do n’t even bother to look .
You ca n’t afford it .
Looking at that receipt and then going ahead with the purchase is nothing more than an agreement that you want to continue living paycheck - to - paycheck .
If you ’re tempted to peek or to use your balance as justification that an unnecessary purchase is okay , you ’re perpetuating your own risky lifestyle .
You ’re choosing to be chained to your desk and at the mercy of your boss for the rest of your life .
6 . As you gain some breathing room , move towards paying bills right when they come in .
One thing that many people living paycheck - to - paycheck waste money on is late fees .
You ’re a couple days late on a bill because you were waiting around for your paycheck , so you ’re dinged for an extra five bucks .
It used to happen to me all the time – and it was a serious money leak .
The best solution for handling this as you move towards financial stability is to start paying your bills as soon as they come in – that way , you avoid the late fees by a mile .
Later on , as you get more comfortable , you can develop your own bill - paying routine – I pay mine monthly – but the best way to handle things just as you ’re getting some cash built up in your account is to pay bills ASAP .
7 . Do n’t carry more than one credit card with you .
Leave the rest at home .
The only reason you should be carrying a credit card in your pocket is to cover emergencies or for specific purchases .
Thus , carrying more than one credit card in your wallet is not only an identity theft concern , it ’s also temptation to spend more than you should .
Personally , I have chosen to keep three credit cards .
Two of them are for specific purchases only so I leave them at home .
The other card is my general use card , and it ’s the only one that resides actively in my wallet .
Because I recognize that I need to keep a healthy free balance on it for emergencies , it makes the temptation of the plastic much lower .
8 . Work together with your spouse and / or with your family .
Walking a new financial path is n’t easy .
It ’s like a diet – it ’s a new set of routines and it can be difficult to get used to a new walk .
The best way to make it easier is to ask for help , and the best place to ask is your spouse .
Work cooperatively with your spouse to cut spending and get in a better financial routine .
If you ’re single , try to find a “ money buddy , ” as suggested in the excellent book Money Drunk , Money Sober .
Basically , this is a person that you can work in tandem with to overcome your financial challenges and spending issues .
By opening up to this person ( and allowing this person to open up to you ) , not only will you find an outlet to talk things over , you ’ll also cement an already - strong friendship .
9. Downgrade .
One major step you can take in getting away from paycheck - to - paycheck living is to downgrade your lifestyle in any way you can .
Do you really need that gas - guzzling car when an efficient one would do ?
Do you really need a huge home when a smaller one would be fine for your needs ?
Consider moving to a smaller or more efficient version of these things .
Doing so will lower your monthly bills , help you eliminate some debt , and put some cash in your pocket .
This is a major step for many people and it ’s often one that gets inside the comfort zone .
“ I ’ll NEVER do that , ” you ’ll think to yourself .
Instead of just automatically rejecting the idea , think about it more seriously for a little bit .
Think of how much easier life would be without a car payment or with a smaller house payment .
You might find you do n’t need the things you think you need .
10 . Learn some basic skills so that you can deal with some emergencies yourself .
Get a book or two like the Reader ’s Digest Complete Do - It - Yourself Manual , Fix - It - Yourself Manual , or the Popular Mechanics Complete Car Care Manual and learn how to do basic maintenance and repair yourself so you ’re not turning to an expensive repairman every time something little goes wrong .
Not only that , you can often do basic maintenance like oil changes and air sealing your home yourself without nearly as much effort as you might think .
This cuts way down on expenses and does n’t leave you at the mercy of “ emergencies ” quite as much as before .
Final Thoughts
Breaking free from the paycheck - to - paycheck cycle is one of the most mentally relieving things I ’ve ever done .
But , that does n’t mean it was easy .
It takes time to replace bad spending habits with good ones and to change your money mindset so you ’re capable of change .
As you move toward breaking the pay - check - to - paycheck cycle , make sure to be patient with yourself .
You may make some mistakes along the way , but you ’ll eventually reach your goals if you stay focused and do n’t let life get in the way .

ROME ( Reuters ) - More than 50 dissident Catholic groups published an unusually frank open letter to Pope Benedict on Friday saying the Church ’s ban on contraception had been “ catastrophic ” and urging him to lift it .
The letter was published as a paid half - page advertisement in Corriere della Sera , Italy ’s largest newspaper , on the 40th anniversary of the late Pope Paul VI ’s controversial encyclical “ Humanae Vitae , ” which enshrined the ban .
While criticism of the Vatican and its views is fairly common in articles and editorials in Italian newspapers , it is unusual for a group to take out paid advertising against the pope , particularly in a large - circulation mainstream newspaper .
The letter said the Church ’s anti-contraception policy “ has had a catastrophic impact on the poor and powerless around the world , endangering women ’s lives and leaving millions at risk of
HIV . ”
It also said the encyclical continued to be “ a source of great conflict and division in the Church ” and because most Catholics use contraception and feel they are not sinning , the policy has been “ an utter failure . ”
Pope Paul ’s encyclical , written in 1968 at the height of the sexual revolution , has been defended by his successors John Paul and Benedict .
Benedict recently defended it as far - sighted and said it was “ all too often misunderstood and misinterpreted . ”
“ PAID PROPAGANDA ”
The letter was signed by groups such as Catholics for Choice , which is U.S. based , We Are Church , which has branches in numerous countries , and New Ways Ministry , which helps minister to gay Catholics .
Vatican spokesman Rev. Federico Lombardi told Vatican Radio that many of the groups which signed the letter were “ very insignificant ” and dismissed it as “ paid propaganda in favor of the use of contraceptives . ”
“ One wonders who paid for it and why , ” Lombardi said .
The letter said : “ It is clear to us that the Catholic church cannot move forward until it honestly confronts the paradox of Humanae Vitae ” .
“ Most Catholics use modern contraceptives , believe it is a moral choice to do so and consider themselves Catholics in good standing , yet the Catholic hierarchy completely denies this reality , forcing the clergy into silence on this and most other issues related to sexuality , ” it said .
The letter concluded :
“ Pope Benedict , we call on you to use to use this anniversary as an opportunity to start the process of healing by being true to the positive aspects of Catholic teachings on sexuality and lifting the ban on contraception to allow Catholics to plan their families safely and in good conscience . ”
Environmental scientists are beginning to use an unsavory new tool -- raw sewage -- to paint an accurate portrait of drug abuse in communities .
Like one big , citywide urinalysis , tests at municipal sewage plants in many areas of the United States and Europe , including Los Angeles County , have detected illicit drugs such as cocaine , methamphetamine , heroin and marijuana .
Law enforcement officials have long sought a way to come up with reliable and verifiable calculations of narcotics use , to identify new trends and formulate policies .
Surveys , the backbone of drug-use estimates , are only as reliable as the people who answer them .
But sewage does not lie .
[ Los Angeles Times ]
The scientists were even able to use sewage to estimate individual use and weekly trends .
For instance , they estimated that people in Milan used twice as much cocaine , about 35 grams per person per year , than Italy 's government surveys had suggested .
I 'll spare you the excrement jokes and just let this idea speak for itself : Admittedly , assuming the methodology is sound , this appears to be a breakthrough technique for obtaining accurate drug use demographics .
And it 's already beginning to cast doubt on existing data , not surprisingly to the effect of indicating that drug use has been widely underreported :
That 's kind of neat , I suppose , that they can figure out stuff like that .
But ya know what ?
Seriously , the moment the government finds itself digging around in our sewage to figure out what drugs we take , it becomes completely clear that we 've screwed up our approach to drugs beyond belief .
It should n’t even be necessary to formulate arguments as to why this is not the behavior of a healthy society .
I mean , really .
They 're drug testing sewage .
What 's wrong with them ?
All of this is symbolic of the utter lack of information and knowledge about drug use that we 've achieved in the course of our abundantly destructive attempts to control this very behavior .
Nothing could be easier than determining down to the bottle or butt exactly how many Heinekens™ or Newport Lights ™ are consumed by the population , but in order to study marijuana use , we must collect frothing f#%king sewage into test tubes , mix in some noxious chemicals , and run the results through some mindbendingly complex algorithm ?
Clueless and reeking of poo , the champions of our failed drug control crusade stand before us straight - faced and swear that everything is going according to plan .
Satire at the ballot box to ' honor ' Bush ' George W. Bush Sewage Plant ' - sounds like a joke , draws ire

Bush 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
If you 've attended an event or festival in San Francisco lately - or even just hung out at a city park - you 've probably seen them .
Admittedly , they 're hard to miss .
Someone in the group is usually toting a large American flag , and another is often carrying a boom box blaring patriotic music .
Sometimes one of them dresses up as Uncle Sam .
They 're the Presidential Memorial Commission of San Francisco , but do n't let the serious name fool you .
The group 's intentions are in the gutter :
They want to rename the Oceanside Water Pollution Control Plant the George W. Bush Sewage Plant come January , when the next president is sworn in .
During the inauguration , the group also wants supporters to participate in a " synchronized flush " - a way to send a gift to the renamed plant , which supporters say , would be a " fitting monument to this president 's work . "
It sounds like a harmless joke , or maybe a college civics lesson gone awry .
But the handful of friends who dreamed this up over beers one night say they have already collected 8,500 signatures in support of the plan - 1,300 more than the minimum needed to put the question to city voters in November .
When they submit the signatures in July , election workers will have to verify that at least 7,168 are from registered city voters for the measure to qualify for the ballot .
" It 's a very simple yes or no question , and there 's no real fiscal impact - just the cost of relettering the sign in front of the plant , " said organizer Brian McConnell .
" This is the way the democratic process is supposed to work , even though it 's a silly idea in some people 's eyes . "
Silly might be an understatement .
Howard Epstein , chair of the San Francisco Republican Party , called the measure an abuse of the system and " loony bin direct democracy . "
He vowed to " use all means " to defeat the measure if it qualifies for the ballot .
That includes those very expensive glossy mailers , he said .
" There 's no use other than to make these nutcases feel good , " Epstein said .
" It 's typical San Francisco crazies . "
Still , most people approached on a recent Sunday seemed open to the idea , even if they all did n't stop to sign the petition .
Bright Winn , a San Francisco plumber , enthusiastically gave his signature to the cause .
" ( Bush ) has always done well for the affluent of America , and anyone that does well for the affluent should be named for the effluent , " he said .
The idea behind the renaming runs the gamut from the humorous ( " Clean up the mess caused by Bush ! " one supporter shouted ) to the sarcastic ( " No other president in American history has accomplished so much in such a short time , " the group 's Web site reads ) to the philosophical .
Satire , McConnell said , is one of the great American traditions .
" Fifty years from now in a civics class , students will learn about the Lincoln Memorial , that other presidents are on Mount Rushmore - and George W. Bush got a sewage plant , " he said .
" It will prompt people to ask why , and they can discuss the Iraq war , and everything that led to it .
People want to forget bad moments of history , and this is our way of making sure that does n't happen . "
To be fair , there are already other tributes to President Bush , including a Stockton elementary school and , of course , the presidential library planned in Dallas .
Organizers of the petition drive believe the measure will pass , noting that 2006's Proposition J calling for the impeachment of Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney passed with 58 percent of the vote .
The biggest opposition in this Democratic stronghold , McConnell said , is people who oppose naming anything after the 43rd president .
Officials at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission , which owns the plant , say they get the humorous intent .
But they note that the plant is an award - winning facility that keeps the city 's streets and the ocean clean .
" If you are looking for a place to make a negative statement about the Bush administration 's impact on the environment , this would be the last place to do it , " agency spokesman Tony Winnicker said .

BBC News , north - east Thailand
A new toilet sign has been created at this Thai school With its spacious , tree - lined grounds and slightly threadbare classrooms , there is nothing obviously unusual about the Kampang Secondary School .
It is situated in Thailand 's impoverished north - east , and most of the pupils are the children of farmers .
Every morning at 0800 they all gather outside to sing the national anthem and watch the flag being raised .
Then they have a chance to use the toilets , before heading off the first classes of the day .
Kampang is proud of its toilets .
Spotless , and surrounded by flowering tropical plants , they have won national awards for cleanliness .
But there is something else about them too .
Between the girls ' toilet and the boys ' , there is one signposted with a half - man , half - woman figure in blue and red .
This is the transsexual toilet , and outside , in front of the mirrors , some decidedly girly - looking teenage boys preen their hair and apply face cream .
' Uncomfortable '
The headteacher , Sitisak Sumontha , estimates that in any year between 10 % and 20 % of his boys consider themselves to be transgender - boys who would rather be girls .
The transsexual pupils are delighted with their own facilities " They used to be teased every time they used the boys ' toilets , " he said , " so they started using the girls ' toilets instead .
But that made the girls feel uncomfortable .
It made these boys unhappy , and started to affect their work . "
So the school offered to build the transgender boys their own facility , and they welcomed it .
Triwate Phamanee is a slightly built 13 - year - old who is adamant that he will one day change his gender .
" We 're not boys , " he told me , " so we do n't want to use the boys ' toilet - we want them to know we are transsexuals . "
Vichai Saengsakul , 15 , agrees .
" People need to know that being a transsexual is not a joke , " he says , " it 's the way we want to live our lives .
That 's why we 're grateful for what the school has done . "

The transgender boys in Kampang tend to stick together as a group , practising their somewhat exaggerated feminine mannerisms together and generally camping it up .
They still have to wear male uniforms , make - up is not allowed ( although some manage to sneak in a touch of lipstick and mascara ) , and of course sex - change surgery is out of the question at this age - the youngest self - declared transsexual is 12 .
But they appear to be treated perfectly normally by other pupils and teachers alike .
I asked the headmaster whether they were not too young to be making decisions about their gender .
The pupils have to wear boys ' uniforms , but use feminine accessories
He said that , in his 35 years of working in the Thai education system , he had come across many boys like this , and they never changed .
Many go on as adults to have sex - change surgery , while others will live as gay men , he said .
Thailand is well known for its tolerance of transgender men , and they are very visible in everyday life .
Sex - change surgery has become a speciality of the Thai health industry , and it is relatively inexpensive ; patients come here from all over the world for the operation .
' Sweet and soft '
The Kampang school 's initiative , far from stirring up controversy , has instead prompted a discussion in other schools over whether they should be providing the same facilities .
A ratio of 10 % to 20 % of boys calling themselves transsexual in a provincial high school does seem very high , but Mr Sitisak assured me that in his experience it was not unusual .
When [ the pupils grow up ] they wo n't want to go into a transgender toilet because they will want to be accepted as a woman - so they will go to the women 's toilet
Suttirat Simsiriwong
Transgender campaigner
Which brought up a question that has been rattling around my head ever since I first lived in Thailand seven years ago :
Why do so many Thai men want to become women ?
I asked Suttirat Simsiriwong , who became a campaigner for transgender rights after she was barred entry to a nightclub at an international hotel in Bangkok last year .
Poised , articulate and very feminine , it is hard to tell that she was not born a woman .
" Maybe the numbers of gays , of people with sexual identity issues , might be the same as in other countries , " said Suttirat , " but because Thai society and culture tend to be very sweet , very soft , and the men can be really feminine , if we tend to be gay , many of us tend to be transgender . "
So does building a special toilet in school advance the cause of winning wider acceptance for transsexuals ?
" At that age it 's good for them to have a specific place , " she said .
" But when they graduate from school or university , they will know how to have medical treatment .
They wo n't want to go into a transgender toilet because they will want to be accepted as a woman - so they will go to the women 's toilet . "
Discrimination remains Tolerance , said Suttirat , is not the same thing as acceptance .
Despite their high profile in Thailand , transsexuals complain that they are still stereotyped - they can find work easily enough as entertainers , in the beauty industry , the media , or as prostitutes , but it is much harder to become a transgender lawyer or investment banker .
And their biggest complaint is that they cannot change their legal status .
Despite a proposal during the drafting of a new constitution last year , to allow them to change the gender on their identity cards , this has not yet been approved .

The film unites two of Egypt 's biggest stars , Adel Imam and Omar Sharif
A new comedy which opened in cinemas in Egypt this month has achieved what intellectuals and human rights activists have failed to do .
It has got Egyptians talking about tensions between the country 's majority Muslim population and its Christian minority .
The film , Hassan and Morqos , co-stars Egyptian comedy legend Adel Imam as Boulos , a Coptic Christian priest , and Alexandria - born Hollywood star Omar Sharif as Sheikh Mahmoud , a Muslim preacher .
Often a minor fight between Muslim and Christian neighbours develops very quickly into sectarian clashes
Hossam Bahgat , Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights
Both play moderates forced to go into hiding and change their religious identities ( becoming Hassan and Morqos , respectively ) when they are threatened by extremists in their own communities .
Brought together by their parallel predicaments , the two men come to live in the same building with their families .
They become friends - even opening a joint business - and before long their children fall in love , unhindered by religious restraints .
Escalating tensions " I think a film should have a message and one of my messages is to make people love each other , " says writer Yousef Maati .
" Every day we hear that Christians and Muslims are in an eternal quarrel but when audiences see this film I think it will change something inside them . "
Hardliners have criticised Imam , who is Muslim , for preaching Christianity Since the 1970s and 1980s - when there was a rise in extremist Islamist thought and Christian radicalism - there have been frequent sectarian clashes in Egypt .
Now tensions are escalating again according to a new report by a group monitoring religious freedom .
The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( EIPR ) investigated two outbreaks of violence in the Fayoum area , south of Cairo , last month .
In one case there were rumours that a woman who had converted from Christianity to Islam had been abducted by her Coptic family .
It led to hundreds of Muslim villagers going on the rampage , looting Coptic shops and setting property alight .
Stones were thrown at the local church .
In the second incident , Coptic residents of a small town were attacked following claims that a married Muslim woman and a Christian man were having an affair .
" Sectarian tensions and violence have reached an alarming level , " says EIPR director , Hossam Bahgat .
" Often a minor fight between Muslim and Christian neighbours develops very quickly into sectarian clashes . "
While Egyptian commentators are divided over the contribution that Hassan and Morqos makes to the debate about religious discrimination , Mr Bahgat welcomes it .
" Many people have written that it's a bit superficial but I believe the fact that it was made is really a positive development . "
" It 's a mainstream film in which the sole subject is Muslim - Christian relations - but it does n't paint a rosy picture . "
Social taboo Egyptian religious leaders profess unity but there are underlying tensions
An early scene in the film introduces the reasons for hostility and anger on both sides of the religious divide .
It shows clerics on the way to an annual national convention for Muslim - Christian dialogue in Cairo .
Priests dismiss the event and complain that the government puts severe restrictions on building churches and the number of Copts in ministerial positions .
Meanwhile , Muslim scholars discuss how Copts - who make up an estimated 10 % of Egyptians - control the national economy .
Such remarks are widely uttered but putting them on the big screen has broken a social taboo .
Campaigners against sectarian violence are calling for religious leaders and Egypt 's government to acknowledge the problem and take steps to reduce it , making sure sectarian strife does not spiral out of control like in Iraq and Lebanon .
But angry comments on the message boards for Hassan and Morqos and calls for a boycott make it clear there is a lot to do to change prejudices .
Adel Imam , a Muslim , has been accused of preaching Christianity in his portrayal of Boulos .
Yet many thousands have been to see it and Adel Imam himself hopes it will foster national unity .
" I have made a work of art .
That is what I can do .
I have declared war using art against the extremists - against those who foment differences between us . "
" I hope Christians and Muslims will leave the cinema and embrace and kiss one another . "

July 2 , 2008  --
It turns out peaceful thoughts really can influence our bodies , right down to the instructions we receive from our DNA , according to a new study .
Researchers for the study , published in the Public Library of Science , took blood samples from a group of 19 people who habitually meditated or prayed for years , and 19 others who never meditated .
The researchers ran genomic analyses of the blood and found that the meditating group suppressed more than twice the number of stress - related genes -- about 1,000 of them -- than the nonmeditating group .
The more these stress - related genes are expressed , the more the body will have a stress response like high blood pressure or inflammation .
Over long periods of time , these stress responses can worsen high blood pressure , pain syndromes and other conditions .
The nonmeditating group then spent 10 minutes a day for eight weeks training in relaxation techniques that involved repeating a prayer , thought , sound , phrase or movement .
" What this does is to break the train of everyday thought -- you no longer have stressful thoughts and because of that the body is able to return to a healthy state , " said Dr. Herbert Benson , director emeritus of the Benson - Henry Institute Mind / Body Medicine and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School .
By the end of the training , the novice meditating group was also suppressing stress - related genes , although at lower levels than those of the long - term meditating people .
Meditation in the Genes
" In the old days , we thought the mind did n't affect the body , " Benson said .
" In truth , it 's breaking down the very old rule . "
Indeed , fellow mind - body researchers are finding more evidence that meditation and spiritual practices can influence the body in elemental ways .
Dr. Dean Ornish , professor of medicine and founder of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute at the University of California at San Francisco , recently found a relationship between meditation and genes in prostate cancer .
" This is an important pilot study showing that meditation alone may favorably alter gene expression in whole blood , " Ornish said .
" These findings provide additional evidence to our recent study in PNAS [ the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ] showing that meditation -- when combined with better nutrition and moderate exercise -- also favorably altered gene expression in prostate tissue . "
But researchers warn that only preliminary steps have been taken toward establishing a connection between genes and meditation .
" It 's on the limits of sensitivity of where we can go on genomics and proteomics , " said Towia Libermann , co-author of the study and director of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Genomics Center in Boston .
" We can't go into the brain itself , so a lot of what we do is going on in the blood . "
That difficult step from brain to blood can make research to link meditation and genetics difficult .
" Things happen , and genes get turned on or turned off -- the genes make RNA , then the RNA makes proteins , " said Dr. Charles Raison , clinical director of the Mind Body Program in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University in Atlanta .
Raison said it is those final proteins in the process that have a significant effect on the body , and sometimes RNA does n't end up making those proteins .
Since genomic analysis measures only the RNA in the blood , it can't guarantee that RNA had a specific effect on the body .
" Not everything gets down to the business end of the gun , " said Raison , who would also have liked to see more definition of what meditation means in the study as opposed to including any forms of repetitive prayer or yoga .
Future Thoughts for Study
" Before you can say meditation does X , you 've got to have a sense of what you mean by meditation , " Raison said .
" There 's data to suggest that different meditative practices have different physical effects . "
Yet Raison found the stress - related study intriguing .
" The study is consistent with other lines of emerging research , including ours , " said Raison , who noted that lonely people have similar stress - related gene expression as the nonmeditating group in the study .
Another study by Dr. Richard Davidson at the University of Wisconsin found that people who were taught to meditate after a vaccination developed more antibodies to the virus than people who did not meditate afterward , Raison said .
According to Raison , it all falls in line with a modern - day misfiring of " danger pathways " that ramp up the body for fight or flight but also turn down the immune system and increase inflammation .
If the meditation study proves correct , it could help stem these changes , along with exercise and diet .
" The gene changes have a lot to do with things that cause wear and tear on the body and the brain , " said Raison .
" Diabetes , cardiovascular disease , dementia , many diseases in the modern world are linked to this sort of wear and tear . "
The researchers in the stress study would like to next focus on these types of individual diseases .
" If you 're about to be torn apart by a tiger , these stress responses are adaptive , " Raison said .
" But if my boss is yelling at me every morning , these ancient responses are activated , but they are not useful . "
At the New York Public Library , a small group holding a banner against one of the stone lions was arrested and charged with blocking traffic in the middle of 42nd Street , although video showed they were on the steps , and nowhere near the street .
In another case at the library , a police officer testified that he and three other officers had to carry one protester , Dennis Kyne , by his hands and feet down the library steps .
Videotape showed that Mr. Kyne walked down the steps under his own power , and that the officer who testified against him had no role in his arrest .
The charges were dismissed ; the Manhattan district attorney ’s office declined to bring perjury charges against the officer who gave the testimony .
Dozens of complaints were sworn by police officers who said they had witnessed people violating the law on Fulton Street and near Union Square , but later admitted under oath that their only involvement was to process the arrests , and that they had not actually seen the disorderly conduct that was charged .
An assistant to District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau wrote to the Police Department to stress the importance of officers ’ not swearing to things they had not seen for themselves .
The prosecutors said the confusion surrounding mass arrests made it hard to bring perjury charges .
The case of Christopher Long and Officer Pogan is shaping up as another example of an official narrative being directly challenged by videotape .
In a criminal court complaint , Officer Pogan wrote that Mr. Long deliberately attacked him with the bike  although the videotape shows Mr. Long veering away from Officer Pogan , who pursues him toward the curb .
The officer said he was knocked to the ground by Mr. Long .
Throughout the tape , though , he remains on his feet , even after banging into Mr. Long .

Two explosions on buses in the south - western Chinese city of Kunming have left at least two people dead and 14 injured , according to reports .
The blasts happened within about an hour during the morning rush hour in Yunnan 's state capital .
TV pictures showed a gaping hole in the side of one of the buses and glass scattered in the street .
Police said the blasts seemed to have been deliberate , and set up checkpoints in the area to try to find suspects .
The first explosion took place at about 0705 at the bus stop in Panjiawan , said the official Xinhua news agency .
The next blast happened close by , about an hour later .
In a statement posted on the Yunnan Public Security Bureau ( PSB ) website , and in a comment to a reporter , police said the blasts were believed to have been due to " sabotage " .
Following the blasts , police cordoned off some streets in the area and checked the ID of " suspicious " persons , the PSB said .
The blasts come just over two weeks before the Olympic Games begin in Beijing .
The government has tightened security around the country ahead of the Games , and recently warned of a significant terrorist threat .
But officials also face regular protests from people angered by poverty , demolitions or corruption .
In the latest incident of unrest in Yunnan , on Saturday , rubber farmers clashed with police in Menglian county , in the south - west of the province close to the border with Burma ( Myanmar ) .
Police shot dead two farmers in the clash , which also reportedly left dozens of police officers injured .
The top Air Force leadership sought for three years to spend counter - terrorism money on “ comfort capsules ” for military planes to ease the travel of senior officers and civilian leaders -- with at least four top generals involved in design details such as the color of the capsules ’ carpet and leather chairs -- according to internal e-mails and budget documents .
Production has begun for the first capsule -- two sealed rooms that can fit in the fuselage of a large aircraft -- and four mobile pallets containing plush , swiveling leather chairs with footrests .
Air Force officials say the new capsules are necessary to ensure that leaders can talk , work and rest comfortably in the air .
But the top brass ’ preoccupation has alienated lower - ranking Air Force officers familiar with the effort , as well as congressional staff and a nonprofit group that calls the program a waste of money .
Air Force documents spell out how each capsule is to be “ aesthetically pleasing and furnished to reflect the rank of the senior leaders using the capsule , ” with beds , a couch , a table and a 37 - inch flat - screen monitor with stereo speakers .
Advertisement
The effort has been slowed by congressional resistance to using counter - terrorism funds for the project and by internal deliberations about generals ’ demands for modifications .
One request was that the leather for the seats and seat belts in the mobile pallets be Air Force blue instead of brown and that seat pockets be added .
Another was that the table be darker .
Changing the seat color and pockets alone was estimated in a March 12 internal document to cost at least $ 68,240 .
In all , for the last three years the service has asked to divert $ 16.2 million from the war on terrorism to the capsules .
Congress has twice told the service no , including in an August 2007 letter from Rep. John P. Murtha ( D - Pa. ) to the Pentagon ordering that the money be spent on a “ higher priority ” need .

Officials say the Air Force nonetheless decided last year to take $ 331,000 from counter - terrorism funds to cover a cost overrun , partly stemming from the design changes , although a senior officer said in response to inquiries that it would reverse that decision .
The internal Air Force e-mails , provided to the Washington Post by the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight and independently authenticated , make clear that lower - ranking officers on the project have been pressured to create what one described as “ world - class ” accommodations finer than a business - class flight .
“ I was asked by Gen . [ Robert H. ]
McMahon what it would take to make the [ capsule ] . . . a ‘ world - class ’ piece of equipment , ” an officer at the service ’s Air Mobility Command said in a March 2007 e-mail to a colleague , referring to the command ’s top officer then .
“ He said he wanted an assurance . . . that we would be getting a world - class item this week . ”
Air Force officials say the program dates from a 2006 declaration by Air Force Gen.
Duncan McNabb that existing seats on transport planes , including some that match those on commercial airliners , might be fine for airmen but were inadequate for the brass .
McNabb was then the Air Mobility commander ; he is now the Air Force ’s vice chief of staff .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates nominated him in June to lead the military ’s Transportation Command .

Explaining his instructions to subordinates , McMahon said he used the term “ world - class ” “ in just about everything I discuss .
. . .
That represents an attitude . ”
He said he wanted to “ create an environment ” that passengers “ would be proud of , ” the government would be proud of and “ the people of the United States ” would be proud of .
Construction of what the Air Force initially termed the new Senior Leader Intransit Comfort Capsules began under a contract paid from general Air Force funds .
One of the 18 - by - 9 - foot capsules has been partly completed .
McMahon said the program has recently been downsized from 10 capsules to three , plus the four pallets fitted with swiveling leather chairs , known as Senior Leader Intransit Pallets .
Because of the cutback in the number of capsules and pallets , the program is currently estimated to cost $ 7.6 million .
It turns out those Republican talking points were right
April 13 , 2008 by lestro

So Obama has apparently decided to go a little more on the offensive in criticizing Clinton ’s response to the “ cling to ” thing .
The Associated Press reports on Obama ’s latest comments :
“ She is running around talking about how this is an insult to sportsmen , how she values the Second Amendment .
She ’s talking like she ’s Annie Oakley , ” Obama said … … Obama continued , saying “ Hillary Clinton is out there like she ’s on the duck blind every Sunday .
She ’s packing a six - shooter .
Come on , she knows better .
That ’s some politics being played by Hillary Clinton . ” …
“ I just have to remind people of the track record , ” Obama said .
“ This is the same person who took money from financial folks on Wall Street and then voted for bankruptcy bill that makes it harder for folks right here in Pennsylvania to get a fair shake .
Who do you think is out of touch ?
“ This is the same person who spent a decade with her husband campaigning for NAFTA , and now goes around saying she ’s opposed to NAFTA , ” Obama said , referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement that is widely unpopular in blue collar communities .
The Clinton Campaign fired back , proving that Penn was n’t the only problem in that staff …
“ For months , Barack Obama and his campaign have relentlessly attacked Hillary Clinton ’s character and integrity by using Republican talking points from the 1990s , ” said spokesman Phil Singer .
“ The shame is his .
Senator Clinton does know better — she knows better than to condescend and talk down to voters like Senator Obama did . ”
Since we ’ve been over the elitist crap before ( an Ivy - League multi-millionaire who has lived in a protective Washington bubble who thinks we are too dumb to notice when she lies to us – multiple times – about shit that ’s ON VIDEO using her opponent ’s – and party eventual nominee , if we are being honest here , hill – using an actual , literal misspeak to use his education against him … ) , let ’s just jump to that ‘ Republican talking points from the 1990s ’ bit , shall we ?
First , it is interesting to note that the specific attack – the elitist / talk down to voters bit – was one of the main arguments used by the Republicans to take down the Democratic candidate in 2000 and 2004 .
That ’s called irony , I think .
But deeper than that , Bill and Hillary Clinton really are starting to live up to everyone one of those “ Republican talking points from the 90s ” that I thought were just jealous , vendetta - driven politics .
Will say anything to get elected ?
Check .
More concerned with their own power than what ’s best for the party ?
Seemingly so , yes .
Messy personal entanglements that draw decisions and statements into question ?
yup .
Willingness to play fast and loose with the facts ?
oh yeah .
Play dirty and then play the victim ?
that , too .
Attacking the character of longtime friends because of perceived loyalty issues ?
again , yes .
But I am not the only one drawing these comparisons .
A quick look at the favorable / unfavorables for both of the Clintons shows that they are not what they used to be , much of which can be attributed to the dirty campaigning this season , not to mention all of the above .
Then there ’s this from McClatchy :
LEVITTOWN , Pa. —
Like many women over 50 , Paula Houwen was eager to vote for Hillary Clinton for president .
“ I was impressed when she was first lady .
She was n’t the country ’s trophy wife , ” the 56 - year - old suburban Philadelphia pharmacist recalled .
Today , though , Houwen ’s no longer a Clinton fan .
“ I do not like the way Hillary Clinton has run her campaign , ” she said .
I say again , the longer this campaign goes on the more damage Hillary and Bill Clinton do not only to their party , but their own legacy .
Hillary Clinton is also hurting her chances of attaining further leadership positions where she could do some real good .
I am a big fan of the Clintons .
They have done a lot of good and his presidency remains a positive decade of relative peace and relative prosperity .
But my view of them has been forever altered by this campaign .
UPDATE ! ( APRIL 16 ) :
As if on cue , the Washington Post has a story about how people view Hillary Clinton and the results are not positive :
Clinton is viewed as “ honest and trustworthy ” by just 39 percent of Americans , according to a new Washington Post–ABC News poll , compared with 52 percent in May 2006 .
Nearly six in 10 said in the new poll that she is not honest and trustworthy .
And now , compared with Obama , Clinton has a deep trust deficit among Democrats , trailing him by 23 points as the more honest , an area on which she once led both Obama and John Edwards .
Among Democrats , 63 percent called her honest , down 18 points from 2006 ; among independents , her trust level has dropped 13 points , to 37 percent .
Republicans held Clinton in low regard on this in the past ( 23 percent called her honest two years ago ) , but it is even lower now , at 16 percent .
Majorities of men and women now say the phrase does not apply to Clinton ; two years ago , narrow majorities of both did .
Tough to win , let alone govern , when two - thirds of the country think you are a liar .
And the longer this goes on , the worse it will get for the Clinton Legacy .

Making matters worse , Asia ’s own oil production has barely risen over the last decade .
Indonesia , with extensive oil fields that made it a top target for Japanese conquest during World War II , became a net oil importer in 2004 .
Output from its aging fields has fallen almost 40 percent since 1995 , and the country plans to withdraw from OPEC at the end of this year .
Image Without a kerosene subsidy , one economist says , many Indians would turn to wood for cooking .

So Asian nations increasingly compete with the West to import oil from the Mideast and Africa .
In Asia , subsidies have been particularly prevalent for diesel , although many countries subsidize gasoline as well .
The subsidies have been an important reason diesel prices have climbed almost twice as quickly as gasoline prices have over the last year in the United States .
Many governments see diesel as more important because truckers and ship captains need it to distribute goods ; if diesel prices rise , consumer prices often follow .
Diesel is essentially the same fuel as heating oil , so high diesel prices mean high prices for heating oil .
Spiraling prices already have some in the Northeast United States worried about how families will afford to heat their homes this winter .
To be sure , subsidies are not the only cause of high crude oil prices .
Strong global economic growth , particularly in Asia , is requiring a lot of energy .
Political tensions between the United States and Iran and market psychology have played a role .
Additional factors have contributed to strong demand for diesel in particular .
European automakers have been shifting toward the production of more cars with diesel engines , which typically get more miles to the gallon than gasoline - powered cars  although the cost advantage of burning diesel is disappearing with higher prices .
When Vietnam reduced fuel subsidies on July 21 , it raised domestic gasoline prices by 31 percent , to $ 4.22 a gallon for 92 - octane fuel .
But Vietnam increased diesel prices by only 14.3 percent , to $ 3.54 a gallon .
The fast - growing demand in China is skewed toward diesel as well .
Automakers are on track to sell half as many gas - powered cars in China this year as in the United States .
But in China they already sell at least 50 percent more medium - and heavy - duty trucks , the workhorses of a manufacturing economy .
Virtually all of those run on diesel .
" If a tree falls in the forest , but no one hears it , does it make a sound ? "
I did n't answer that question .
I did n't pick a position , " Yes ! " or " No ! " , and defend it .
Instead I went off and deconstructed the human algorithm for processing words , even going so far as to sketch an illustration of a neural network .
At the end , I hope , there was no question left — not even the feeling of a question .
Many philosophers — particularly amateur philosophers , and ancient philosophers — share a dangerous instinct :
If you give them a question , they try to answer it .
Like , say , " Do we have free will ? "
The dangerous instinct of philosophy is to marshal the arguments in favor , and marshal the arguments against , and weigh them up , and publish them in a prestigious journal of philosophy , and so finally conclude : " Yes , we must have free will , " or " No , we can not possibly have free will . "
Some philosophers are wise enough to recall the warning that most philosophical disputes are really disputes over the meaning of a word , or confusions generated by using different meanings for the same word in different places .
So they try to define very precisely what they mean by " free will " , and then ask again , " Do we have free will ?
Yes or no ? "
A philosopher wiser yet , may suspect that the confusion about " free will " shows the notion itself is flawed .
So they pursue the Traditional Rationalist course :
They argue that " free will " is inherently self - contradictory , or meaningless because it has no testable consequences .
And then they publish these devastating observations in a prestigious philosophy journal .
But proving that you are confused may not make you feel any less confused .
Proving that a question is meaningless may not help you any more than answering it .
The philosopher 's instinct is to find the most defensible position , publish it , and move on .
But the " naive " view , the instinctive view , is a fact about human psychology .
You can prove that free will is impossible until the Sun goes cold , but this leaves an unexplained fact of cognitive science :
If free will does n't exist , what goes on inside the head of a human being who thinks it does ?
This is not a rhetorical question !
It is a fact about human psychology that people think they have free will .
Finding a more defensible philosophical position does n't change , or explain , that psychological fact .
Philosophy may lead you to reject the concept , but rejecting a concept is not the same as understanding the cognitive algorithms behind it .
You could look at the Standard Dispute over " If a tree falls in the forest , and no one hears it , does it make a sound ? " , and you could do the Traditional Rationalist thing :
Observe that the two do n't disagree on any point of anticipated experience , and triumphantly declare the argument pointless .
That happens to be correct in this particular case ; but , as a question of cognitive science , why did the arguers make that mistake in the first place ?
The key idea of the heuristics and biases program is that the mistakes we make , often reveal far more about our underlying cognitive algorithms than our correct answers .
So ( I asked myself , once upon a time ) what kind of mind design corresponds to the mistake of arguing about trees falling in deserted forests ?
The cognitive algorithms we use , are the way the world feels .
And these cognitive algorithms may not have a one - to - one correspondence with reality — not even macroscopic reality , to say nothing of the true quarks .
There can be things in the mind that cut skew to the world .
For example , there can be a dangling unit in the center of a neural network , which does not correspond to any real thing , or any real property of any real thing , existent anywhere in the real world .
This dangling unit is often useful as a shortcut in computation , which is why we have them .
( Metaphorically speaking .
Human neurobiology is surely far more complex . )
This dangling unit feels like an unresolved question , even after every answerable query is answered .
No matter how much anyone proves to you that no difference of anticipated experience depends on the question , you 're left wondering : " But does the falling tree really make a sound , or not ? "
But once you understand in detail how your brain generates the feeling of the question — once you realize that your feeling of an unanswered question , corresponds to an illusory central unit wanting to know whether it should fire , even after all the edge units are clamped at known values — or better yet , you understand the technical workings of Naive Bayes — then you 're done .
Then there 's no lingering feeling of confusion , no vague sense of dissatisfaction .
If there is any lingering feeling of a remaining unanswered question , or of having been fast - talked into something , then this is a sign that you have not dissolved the question .
A vague dissatisfaction should be as much warning as a shout .
Really dissolving the question does n't leave anything behind .
A triumphant thundering refutation of free will , an absolutely unarguable proof that free will cannot exist , feels very satisfying — a grand cheer for the home team .
And so you may not notice that — as a point of cognitive science — you do not have a full and satisfactory descriptive explanation of how each intuitive sensation arises , point by point .
You may not even want to admit your ignorance , of this point of cognitive science , because that would feel like a score against Your Team .
In the midst of smashing all foolish beliefs of free will , it would seem like a concession to the opposing side to concede that you 've left anything unexplained .
And so , perhaps , you 'll come up with a just - so evolutionary - psychological argument that hunter - gatherers who believed in free will , were more likely to take a positive outlook on life , and so outreproduce other hunter - gatherers — to give one example of a completely bogus explanation .
If you say this , you are arguing that the brain generates an illusion of free will — but you are not explaining how .
You are trying to dismiss the opposition by deconstructing its motives — but in the story you tell , the illusion of free will is a brute fact .
You have not taken the illusion apart to see the wheels and gears .
Imagine that in the Standard Dispute about a tree falling in a deserted forest , you first prove that no difference of anticipation exists , and then go on to hypothesize , " But perhaps people who said that arguments were meaningless were viewed as having conceded , and so lost social status , so now we have an instinct to argue about the meanings of words . "
That 's arguing that or explaining why a confusion exists .
Now look at the neural network structure in Feel the Meaning .
That 's explaining how , disassembling the confusion into smaller pieces which are not themselves confusing .
See the difference ?
Coming up with good hypotheses about cognitive algorithms ( or even hypotheses that hold together for half a second ) is a good deal harder than just refuting a philosophical confusion .
Indeed , it is an entirely different art .
Bear this in mind , and you should feel less embarrassed to say , " I know that what you say can't possibly be true , and I can prove it .
But I cannot write out a flowchart which shows how your brain makes the mistake , so I 'm not done yet , and will continue investigating . "
I say all this , because it sometimes seems to me that at least 20 % of the real - world effectiveness of a skilled rationalist comes from not stopping too early .
If you keep asking questions , you 'll get to your destination eventually .
If you decide too early that you 've found an answer , you wo n't .
The challenge , above all , is to notice when you are confused — even if it just feels like a little tiny bit of confusion — and even if there 's someone standing across from you , insisting that humans have free will , and smirking at you , and the fact that you do n't know exactly how the cognitive algorithms work , has nothing to do with the searing folly of their position ...
But when you can lay out the cognitive algorithm in sufficient detail that you can walk through the thought process , step by step , and describe how each intuitive perception arises — decompose the confusion into smaller pieces not themselves confusing — then you 're done .
So be warned that you may believe you 're done , when all you have is a mere triumphant refutation of a mistake .
But when you 're really done , you 'll know you 're done .
Dissolving the question is an unmistakable feeling — once you experience it , and , having experienced it , resolve not to be fooled again .
Those who dream do not know they dream , but when you wake you know you are awake .
Which is to say :
When you 're done , you 'll know you 're done , but unfortunately the reverse implication does not hold .
So here 's your homework problem :
What kind of cognitive algorithm , as felt from the inside , would generate the observed debate about " free will " ?
Your assignment is not to argue about whether people have free will , or not .
Your assignment is not to argue that free will is compatible with determinism , or not .
Your assignment is not to argue that the question is ill - posed , or that the concept is self - contradictory , or that it has no testable consequences .
You are not asked to invent an evolutionary explanation of how people who believed in free will would have reproduced ; nor an account of how the concept of free will seems suspiciously congruent with bias X . Such are mere attempts to explain why people believe in " free will " , not explain how .
Your homework assignment is to write a stack trace of the internal algorithms of the human mind as they produce the intuitions that power the whole damn philosophical argument .
This is one of the first real challenges I tried as an aspiring rationalist , once upon a time .
One of the easier conundrums , relatively speaking .
May it serve you likewise .

Amherst researchers have added a new source of carbon dioxide to the complex climate change puzzle by showing that ancient rocks can release substantial amounts of organic matter into Earth ’s rivers and oceans , and that this organic matter is easily converted by bacteria to carbon dioxide , which enters the atmosphere and contributes to climate change .
“ Sedimentary rocks contain the largest mass of organic carbon on Earth , but these reservoirs are not well - integrated into modern carbon budgets ” says Steven Petsch , a professor of geosciences .
“ Since we need to know the budget of the natural carbon cycle in order to determine human climate impacts , this information will lead to more accurate climate modeling . ”
The research was conducted by Petsch and UMass Amherst graduate student Sarah Schillawski .
In a study published in the July issue of Global Biogeochemical Cycles , Petsch and Schillawski focused on black shales from Kentucky .
Black shales are rich in a type of organic matter called kerogen that contains carbon .
Kerogen can turn into oil and natural gas when the rocks are heated .
The first step was to determine how much organic carbon could be released from the rocks by simulating the weathering process in the laboratory .
Samples of the shale were placed in glass columns , and the effects of weathering were duplicated by running water through the samples for one year .
Kerogen is thought to be difficult to dissolve , but the results of the column studies showed a slow , sustained release of organic matter from the rock .
Over the course of one year , the rock samples had lost approximately 0.3 percent of their total organic carbon .
The next step was to determine whether this hard - to - digest organic matter could be broken down by bacteria into carbon dioxide .
Using common bacteria found in natural waters , including the Quabbin Reservoir , Petsch found that essentially all of the dissolved organic matter in water from the column studies was rapidly degraded by bacteria over a period of nine days .
“ This was the most surprising finding in the study , since these bacteria are adapted to digest organic matter from things like leaves and acorns , which is similar to carbohydrates consumed by humans , ” says Petsch .
“ The presence of microorganisms capable of using kerogen may have significant implications for the global - scale cycling of carbon and oxygen . ”
Petsch has also studied the release of carbon from sedimentary rocks by soil bacteria , which is another way that ancient carbon can be converted into carbon dioxide .
“ We have found outcrops of the New Albany Shale , which is usually black , that have turned a light brown color as bacteria consume carbon where the overlying soil meets the weathered rock , ” says Petsch .
According to Petsch , the bottom line is that the release of organic material from sedimentary rocks contributes approximately 2 percent of the carbon dioxide that enters the atmosphere each year .
While this may seem like a small amount , it is another piece of the puzzle that can be used when determining how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades .
U.S. deploys more than 43,000 unfit for combat
WASHINGTON  More than 43,000 U.S. troops listed as medically unfit for combat in the weeks before their scheduled deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan since 2003 were sent anyway , Pentagon records show .
This reliance on troops found medically " non-deployable " is another sign of stress placed on a military that has sent 1.6 million servicemembers to the war zones , soldier advocacy groups say .
" It is a consequence of the consistent churning of our troops , " said Bobby Muller , president of Veterans For America .
" They are repeatedly exposed to high - intensity combat with insufficient time at home to rest and heal before redeploying . "
The numbers of non-deployable soldiers are based on health assessment forms filled out by medical personnel at each military installation before a servicemember 's deployment .
According to those statistics , the number of troops that doctors found non-deployable , but who were still sent to Iraq or Afghanistan fluctuated from 10,854 in 2003 , down to 5,397 in 2005 , and back up to 9,140 in 2007 .
The Pentagon records do not list what — or how serious — the health issues are , nor whether they were corrected before deployment , said Michael Kilpatrick , a deputy director for the Pentagon 's Force Health Protection and Readiness Programs .
A Pentagon staffer examined 10,000 individual health records last year to determine causes for the non-deployable ratings , Kilpatrick said .
Some reasons included a need for eyeglasses , dental work or allergy medicine and a small number of mental health cases , he said .
This is the first war in which this health screening process has been used , the Pentagon said .
Most of the non-deployable servicemembers are in the Army , which is doing most of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Between 5 % and 7 % of all active - duty , National Guard and Reserve soldiers slated for combat were found medically unfit due to health problems each year since 2003 , according to statistics provided to USA TODAY .
Unit commanders make the final decision about whether a servicemember is sent into combat , although doctors can recommend against deployment because of a medical issue , Army spokeswoman Kim Waldron said .
" The commander consults with health care professionals to determine whether the treatment a soldier needs is available in theater , " said Army Col. Steven Braverman of the Army Medical Command .
At Fort Carson , Colo. , Maj. Gen. Mark Graham ordered an investigation into deployment procedures for a brigade deployed to Iraq late last year .
At least 36 soldiers were found medically unfit but were still deployed , Graham told USA TODAY .
For at least seven soldiers , treatment in the war zone was inadequate and the soldiers were sent home , he said , and at least two of them should never have been deployed .
In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February , the panel 's chairman , Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich . , asked Army leaders about an e-mail from the surgeon for the Fort Carson brigade that said medically " borderline " soldiers went to war because " we have been having issues reaching deployable strength . "
" That should not be happening , " Army Secretary Pete Geren told the committee .
" I can't tell you that it 's not , but it certainly should not be happening . "
Meanwhile , soldiers with medical problems have also deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan from Fort Drum in New York and Fort Stewart and Fort Benning , both in Georgia , according to Brenda Farrell , who is leading an investigation into the practice for the Government Accountability Office .
A report from that investigation sought by members of the House Armed Services Committee is due in June .
HOLLYWOOD HAS never been known for its subtlety .
Here , downsizing means losing weight .
But with the economy in the doldrums , even this town built on excess is scaling back .
Lipo is half - off , restaurants are half - full and even the line at Sprinkles is half as long as it used to be .
Suddenly , living large seems ridiculous .
Even gauche .
Nevermind if you can still afford a jaunt to Europe or a really great pair of shoes , it ’s understood that you do n’t brag about it .
Instead , people are proudly sharing their recessionary measures like a new kind of social currency .
Whether driven by necessity , anxiety or even empathy , it ’s high time for a new mind - set on consumption .
FOR THE RECORD :
Boutique owner :
In Sunday ’s Image section , an article about how people are cutting back during tough times identified Cameron Silver as the co-owner of Decades .
He is the sole owner of the West Hollywood vintage boutique . —
Liz Goldwyn , the socialite and filmmaker , is weeding out her famously bulging closet by opening her own EBay store .
Cameron Silver , co-owner of Decades and designer muse , is saving on dry cleaning by hand washing his cashmere sweaters and dress shirts .
Celebrity stylist Jessica Paster is holding “ taco nights ” at home instead of entertaining at Mr. Chow .
“ In this economy , it just feels insane to spend hundreds , if not thousands , on the latest ‘ it ’ bag , ” says Ryan Patterson , supervising producer at “ Access Hollywood . ”
“ I actually bought a Balenciaga bag from the spring / summer ’08 collection , and I felt so guilty about it that I returned it . ”
Has social mobility stalled ?
Does anyone still care about keeping up with the Joneses ?
“ Now , there ’s a trend toward anti-status , ” says Pam Danziger , president of the research firm Unity Marketing , which found that households earning at least $ 100,000 a year spent 9.5 % less on luxury goods in the first three months of this year than they did in the same period a year before .
“ The status is gained by being more responsible .
You get bragging rights for buying something for less , not more . ”
Or , even better , practicing utter restraint and not buying anything .
Last week , Nancy Davis , heir to a multibillion - dollar family fortune , hosted a shopping soiree on Melrose Place to benefit her charity , the Race to Erase MS .
Even she was being discretionary .
“ I think the economy is affecting everyone , ” she said , standing 10 feet away from a pair of $ 5,000 alligator riding boots at the shop Lambertson Truex .
“ If I want to buy something , my new rule is to put it on hold overnight and then I know if I really , really want it . ”
Art dealer and independent film producer Howard Askenase will gladly reveal that he now shops regularly at the 99 Cents Only store and buys his picnic fixings at Costco , rather than Joan ’s on Third .
“ In the parking lot of the 99 Cents Only store , you see more Mercedes and SUVs than ever before , ” says Askenase , who also strives to schedule breakfast meetings in lieu of pricier lunches or dinners .
“ I intentionally set a 1:30 lunch meeting with investors this week because I hope people will show up late and not eat as much . ”
There is , of course , the chance that Askenase ’s guests will have skipped breakfast and will order enough to feed a rugby team .
Especially since an informal survey of business contacts revealed that Starbucks lattes and scones are no longer an everyday indulgence and bagged lunches are suddenly all the rage .
Tupperware has become a chic accessory .
“ I got sick of spending $ 30 on lunch everyday at Erewhon , ” says Silver , who now totes his afternoon sustenance -- a salad of organic greens and a can of tuna -- to work at Decades , the local designer consignment store .
Fashion publicist Marilyn Heston is sweating it a bit too .
Literally .
“ I ’m watching the air conditioning and the color printing at the office , ” she says .
“ And for the first time , I am thinking twice about valet .
It ’s $ 10 at that Philippe Starck sushi place . ”
That would be Katsuya .
Start circling the block now .
Customers are questioning prices at salons and shops too .
A saleswoman at Trina Turk on Third Street says that some shoppers now try to negotiate discounts , along the lines of , “ Can I buy three and get one free ? ”
Over at Kalologie spa on Robertson Boulevard , the receptionist sometimes hears , “ But can you do a little better ? ” on facials and massages .
And why not try to haggle over those buttery $ 250 highlights ?
After all , when it comes to luxury services , it ’s a buyers ’ market .
A survey published last month by the Ohio - based BIGresearch marketing firm found that consumers with six - figure incomes were postponing haircuts ( 18 % ) , manicures - pedicures ( 15 % ) , massages ( 11 % ) and hair - color treatments ( 11 % ) .
“ I ’m biting my nails in lieu of manicures , ” says Paramount Vantage publicist Meghan Gamber .
“ And I wo n’t step foot in Banana Republic . ”
But it ’s not just a matter of making personal sacrifices .
In a town of trophy wives and privileged kids who carry Visa Gold cards , some are having to discipline spendthrift loved ones to bypass Barneys and the Ivy .
“ A lot of my patients are trying to keep their partners from spending wildly , and it ’s causing even more problems , ” says Rebecca Roy - Jarboe , a Beverly Hills psychotherapist who counsels actors , producers and directors .
( She adds that some patients have upped their $ 150 sessions to two or three times per week . )
“ But at the same time , nobody in this industry wants to be perceived as poor or old . ”
Even celebrity jeweler Neil Lane , whose first flagship store will open in October on Melrose Place , concedes that a $ 30 kosher , organic chicken from Whole Foods recently caused him sticker shock .
“ I thought , ‘ Wow !
That ’s a lot for a little , uncooked chicken . ’ ”
And suddenly , he began to question another recent splurge : a Mercedes SL63 .
“ It ’s a gas guzzler , ” he says , with a nervous laugh .
“ Did I make a mistake ? ”

Dow Jones Newswires ' Kenneth Rapoza reports from Brazil :
As the Group of Eight presidential leaders finish their meeting today in Japan , where food and fuel crises took center stage , the world ’s leading ethanol trade groups joined forces to argue it ’s not their fault food prices are so high .
Their message : Blame oil .
The U.S. and Canadian ...
I feel bad for the airline industry .
They are caught in a never - ending price war due to online websites and their own commodification .
Pick the cheapest flight to get from here to there …
The natural short - term solution is bait and switch .
Advertise the lowest price you can imagine and then require add on fees so you can actually make a profit .
Air Canada , which my readers generally concur is the single worst major airline in North America , has a fascinating policy .
No oversized duffel bags , regardless of weight , unless they contain hockey gear .
No shin guards , you pay $ 80 a bag .
Of course , you can have whatever rules you want , even if they ’re only designed to help defensemen .
The problems with bait and switch are :
You have to be very careful to apply them equally , because people hate being treated worse than everyone else .
You have to be prepared for anger , resentment and brand disintegration .
As I said , this is a short - term strategy .
Yesterday , they charged me $ 160 for two bags that had successfully gone through their system uncharged just three weeks earlier .
And they did it only three minutes before four of my fellow travelers ( and friends ) checked virtually identical bags for free .
But the purpose of this rant is n’t to hassle Air Canada .
The purpose is to learn a key lesson from Disney :
When there is both pain and pleasure associated with your service , work extremely hard to separate them by time and geography .
Disney charges a fortune for the theme park , but they do it a week before you get there , or at a booth far far away from the rides .
By the time you get to the rides , you ’re over it .
The pain is n’t associated with the fun part .
Airlines , on the other hand , surround the very thing they sell ( getting you home ) with armed guards , untrained TSA agents , long lines and sneering gate agents eager to take your money when you have absolutely no expectation or choice and when your stress is at its highest .
This is a problem in the long run .
The broadcasters , which include the BBC in Britain , the CBC in Canada , the Seven Network in Australia and SABC in South Africa , unanimously pressed for further access , according to minutes of the meeting obtained by The New York Times .
According to two people at the meeting , when the Beijing vice mayor , Cao Fuchao , remarked that his country ’s authorities would not reverse their decision to restrict access , Alex Gilady , an I.O.C. commissioner and NBC vice president , pointed his finger and said : “ We still have one month to go .
We will pursue this to the end . ”
But time is not on the broadcasters ’ side .
Nineteen days from now , when the torch is lighted in Beijing , journalists and viewers could be facing the most restrictive environment for an Olympics in modern times .
At the meeting , on July 9 , after months of uncertainty , Chinese officials said that all applications for live broadcasting would be approved throughout Beijing and the other cities where Olympic competitions were planned .
Furthermore , the committee said that all broadcasters could tape reports from Tiananmen Square .
But the broadcasters say they will not believe it until they see it .
One I.O.C. commissioner , speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid further complicating the situation , said matter - of - factly that Chinese officials had “ put a tourniquet ” on the Olympics .
“ Had the I.O.C. , and those vested with the decision to award the host city contract , known seven years ago that there would be severe restrictions on people being able to enter China simply to watch the Olympics , or that live broadcasting from Tiananmen Square would essentially be banned , or that reporters would be corralled at the whim of local security , then I seriously doubt whether Beijing would have been awarded the Olympics , ” the commissioner said .
Image Chinas censorship of the news media will be tested by the Olympics , and broadcasters are uncertain of what to expect .

The contentious negotiations are particularly perilous for NBC , part of NBC Universal , which is trying to produce 3,600 hours of coverage .
The company paid a record amount for the broadcast rights , and it expects to generate $ 1 billion in advertising revenue .
The coverage will be produced by NBC Sports under the direction of Dick Ebersol , chairman of NBC Universal Sports and Olympics .

Some voters are said to be unsure of Barack Obama 's religious background US presidential hopeful Barack Obama has said he would expand George W Bush 's programme of involving religious groups in government initiatives .
The Democratic Party candidate unveiled plans for a council of faith - based and neighbourhood partnerships in Ohio .
He said challenges from saving the planet to ending poverty were too big for the government to solve on its own .
A council involving religious groups would help to set the national agenda , Senator Obama said in his speech .
" We know that faith and values can be a source of strength in our own lives , " said Mr Obama .
" That 's what it has been to me and that 's what it has been to so many Americans .
It can also be something more .
" It can be the foundation of a new project of American renewal and that 's the kind of effort I intend to lead as president of the United States . "
Unease
The Illinois senator was speaking in the key battleground state of Ohio as part of a series of speeches he is giving this week with an eye to voters in middle America who remain unsure about his patriotism and religious background .
Yet even as he was stressing his belief in the separation of church and state , the senator 's plan was provoking unease amongst some groups who see it as a continuation of the faith - based programme of President Bush .
Former White House officials have claimed that was hi-jacked to promote partisan interests .
Yet paradoxically it is some of these ex-Bush administration insiders who are embracing Mr Obama 's plans most enthusiastically .
It remains to be seen whether the voters will share that opinion .

The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline is rising fast .
How has the price affected you ?
Join the discussion at USA TODAY 's Fuel Forum to swap stories and money - saving tips with fellow readers .
FORKS OF SALMON , Calif . 
The price of gas is n't an annoyance here .
It 's a calamity .
Peggy Hanley uses a generator that burns a gallon of diesel fuel every hour — at about $ 5 a gallon — to power Forks General Store , the only place to buy groceries for miles around .
There 's no electric service , so Hanley , the owner , uses the generator to run eight refrigerators , nine freezers , lights and two ice machines for the store , which has been in a trailer since a fire destroyed the original building in 1994 .
There are no utilities and no public transportation in this unincorporated town of a couple hundred people along a narrow road that winds through the mountains 314 miles north of Sacramento .
Many people here buy gas for their vehicles and gas or diesel for generators that power their homes .
" I 'm scared to death " of rising fuel prices , Hanley says .
At the store , the hub for visiting whitewater rafters and residents of other isolated towns , gas cost $ 5.30 a gallon on a recent day when the national average was $ 4.07 .
This community may be an extreme example of how rising gas prices are hitting rural Americans particularly hard , but people in small towns from Maine to Alaska are in a similar bind as those here .
Soaring gas prices are a double - whammy for many rural residents :
They often pay more than people who live in cities and suburbs because of the expense of hauling fuel to their communities , and they must drive greater distances for life 's necessities : work , groceries , medical care and , of course , gas .
Meanwhile , incomes typically are lower in rural areas , making increasingly high gas prices an especially urgent concern .
Rural households also are more likely to have older , less fuel - efficient vehicles such as pickups , the Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) says .
The average age of a vehicle in a rural household : 8.7 years , compared with 7.9 years for an urban vehicle .
Rural residents do more driving , too — an average of 3,100 miles a year more than urban dwellers , the FHWA says .
A May survey by the Oil Price Information Service ( OPIS ) , a fuel analysis company , and Wright Express , a company that collects data on credit card transactions , found that people in rural areas spend as much as 16.02 % of their monthly family income on gas , while people in urban areas of New York and New Jersey spend as little as 2.05 % .
" The people who can least afford this are getting hit the worst , " says Glen Falk , retail pricing manager at OPIS .
" These are people who ca n't telecommute or carpool or use public transportation or any of the other things that people in metro areas can do to ease the pain . "
Leaving town to get groceries
When the only gas station in Allen , Neb. , closed last summer , a gallon of gas cost $ 2.56 , according to prices posted on two abandoned pumps .
Since then , Allen 's 411 residents have been driving 11 miles to Wakefield or 28 miles to South Sioux City to fill up .

Allen 's grocery store went out of business last August , forcing people to shop in South Sioux City or 21 miles away in Wayne .
Doctors , dentists and other essentials also require a road trip .
The nearest movie theater is in Wayne .
" You have to leave town for about everything , " says Jerry Schroeder , an insurance agent who has lived in Allen for all of his 57 years .
He recalls when the farming town , founded in 1891 as a railroad stop , had four grocery stores , four gas stations , two banks , a doctor , two farm equipment dealers and a mortuary .
Now Schroeder often parks his gas - guzzling Dodge pickup , which he calls " the last truck I 'm ever going to own , " and uses his wife Donna 's Mercury Grand Marquis .
It gets 25 miles per gallon .
" We 're all going to have to change , " he says .
There 's still a school , restaurant , day care center and bank in Allen , but about three - fourths of the residents commute to jobs out of town .
Security National Bank president Rob Bock and other local leaders say a gas station is key to the town 's survival .
Residents formed a corporation and hope to open a gas station / convenience store later this year on the site of the old station .
" Even in a bedroom community , people need the basic core services , " Bock says .
" We want to maintain school enrollment and property values . "
Elizabeth Macrander , 24 , has worked at the bank in Allen since November .
For the first few months , she drove to work every day from Sioux City , Iowa , filling up her Mercury Mountaineer ( 14 - 15 mpg ) every two days .
" I did n't have a paycheck left , " she says , so in May she bought a house in Allen .
Even with a house payment , she 's saving money since cutting her commute , Macrander says .
She drives her 10 - month - old daughter , Jordan , to day care 5 miles out of town daily and carefully plans other travel .
On her next trip to Sioux City , she 'll visit her parents and sister , buy groceries and gas and hit Wal - Mart for cleaning supplies .
" You make the list , and you get everything done at once , " she says .
It 's more difficult for Allen Kleinschmit to pare gas usage .
He runs the Pioneer Seed distribution center in Allen , tests soil and gives irrigation advice to area farmers .
That adds up to 100,000 or so miles every year on his Chevy Silverado truck , which gets 7 or 8 mpg if he 's hauling equipment .
He drives 25 miles to work from Coleridge .
Don Schmidt , superintendent of Allen Consolidated Schools , budgeted $ 37,500 for fuel in the 2008 - 09 school year , up from $ 25,000 this year .
Higher gas prices make it more difficult to recruit teachers and coaches , he says , and field trips to the Omaha zoo 120 miles away and other destinations are at risk .
The OPIS survey said Dixon County residents spend an average of $ 198.82 a month on gas , 6.44 % of their monthly income .
Shelly Jones quit her job in Sioux City after moving to Allen with her husband , Jay , and their three kids because the commute was so expensive .
This summer , they 're using their Big Country camper less often and stockpiling food and milk in the extra refrigerator in their garage to reduce grocery runs .
High gas prices make Jones angry and worried about the future of the town she loves .
" You 're almost forcing the rural communities to shut down , " she says .
Jobs scarce , money tight Brett Denight , 34 , bought a house in Sawyers Bar , Calif. , a wide spot on the mountain road with a few houses , a couple of years ago .
Like the Forks General Store a few miles away , he has no electric service .
He installed three solar panels on his roof , but a diesel generator runs his washing machine and the power tools he uses to build cabinets and other carpentry work .
The generator consumes a gallon of fuel every eight hours .
Gas has always been expensive around here , Denight says , but he's had to alter his routines since it hit the $ 5 mark .
When he drives the 54 miles to Yreka , he stocks up on food and other supplies .
" You 're always asking people to pick things up for you if they 're going to town , " he says .
He visits his girlfriend in Eureka , a 124 - mile drive one way , less often .
When he buys gas , he also fills up a 40 - gallon tank that sits on the back of his truck .
This part of Northern California , near the Oregon border and bisected by the Klamath and Salmon rivers , is wild and beautiful , but it 's too isolated to attract many tourists except for rafters and people searching for Big Foot .
Many of the small towns were once gold - mining camps , then centers of the timber industry .
Both businesses are mostly gone now , and jobs are scarce .
Siskiyou County 's unemployment rate was 8.7 % in May , when the national rate was 5.5 % .
The OPIS study said county residents pay $ 183.11 a month for gas , or 7 % of monthly family income .
People come from miles around to buy gas and groceries in Happy Camp , population 1,110 .
At Connor Cardlock , the only gas station , gas and diesel cost more than $ 5 a gallon .
Except for the hours between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. , customers must use credit cards to buy gas .
People who do n't have credit cards arrive with friends who do and fork over cash to compensate them .
T.J. Day , 43 , a maintenance worker for a local tribe , shakes his head with disgust as he fills up .
He figures it will cost him $ 40 worth of gas to drive 70 miles to Yreka and 70 miles back .
" You ca n't afford to go anywhere anymore , " he says .
At Parry 's Market , employee Dan McCarthy , 50 , says the store pays 2 - 3 cents more each week for almost every item it stocks because of rising freight costs .
" Where do you catch a break ? " he asks .
' It 's very frightening '
The situation looks even more dire to Karen Derry and Nadine McElyea .
They work at Happy Camp 's Family Resource Center , which provides emergency assistance , mental - health outreach and other services .
McElyea worries that senior citizens in remote areas could die if they neglect their medical needs because of the high cost of getting around .
Some poor residents and senior citizens come to the center because they 're running out of food , she says .
In the past few weeks , calls from people needing medical attention and help paying utility bills have soared , says Derry , the center 's director .
" I worry a lot , especially about the elders , " she says .
" It 's very frightening . "
Jodi Henderson , who works for Happy Camp 's volunteer ambulance service , is alarmed , too .
Reimbursements from the state dropped 10 % Tuesday , creating a gap in funds to offset emergency runs to Yreka , which cost at least $ 1,200 each .
The service has two paid employees , 13 volunteers and two ambulances .
The one used most often has 225,000 miles on it and gets about 8 miles per gallon .
Forty - four miles south of Happy Camp at the senior center in Orleans , supervisor Babbie Peterson sees the concern in the eyes of the elderly who come for lunch every day .
She frets that she 'll lose the volunteers who cook and serve the meals and deliver them to the house - bound .
She dreads the inevitable breakdowns of the center 's furnace or refrigerators because service people drive two hours from Eureka to get here " and they charge a $ 500 travel fee . "
Frank Woodman , 79 , who came to the senior center for lunch with his mother - in - law Mary Silva , 93 , calls gas prices " terrible . "
" At our age , we have to go to the doctor quite often , " he says .
" That 's 38 miles each way , and you always think about how much it 's costing in gas .
I know people who do n't bother going , even when they know they need to . "

DC cops abandon checkpoints after night of violence Nick Juliano
Published : Friday June 13 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Police in Washington , DC , have abandoned checkpoints it established in an unsafe neighborhood after a night of violence saw eight shootings elsewhere in the city .
The checkpoints were criticized by civil libertarians as " police state " tactics more appropriate for Baghdad or Soviet - era East Berlin than the nation 's capital .
Local authorities offered few specifics as to why they decided on Thursday to stop checking identification for every person driving into a neighborhood in Northeast DC , but they claimed the mission was a success because there were no shootings in the neighborhood , known as Trinidad , during the six days the checkpoints were in place .
On Wednesday night , eight people , including an 11 - year - old girl , were shot elsewhere in the city ; none died .
The Washington Post reports that some local officials criticized the heavy - handed police tactics and noted that such authoritarian approaches would be unlikely to decrease crime overall .
The program , in which all drivers must justify their purpose for being in a targeted area , has been criticized by civil rights groups , D.C. council members and residents who said police are overstepping their power .
" As crime occurs elsewhere in this city , they 're going to have to go back to community policing , " said council member Phil Mendelson ( D - At Large ) , who is holding a hearing Monday on the initiative .
" Checkpoints are n't going to stop crime , " Mendelson said .
Under community policing strategies , officers work with residents to find solutions .
Lanier did not seek community input before launching the checkpoint , a source of complaint from some residents .
But other residents praised the effort .
The checkpoint plan followed other civil liberties - unfriendly proposals from DC police struggling to quell violent crime in the city .
Previous proposals included a venture that would have had police going door - to - door in rough neighborhoods asking residents to " voluntarily " submit to warrantless searches of their homes .
That plan was temporarily abandoned after citizen complaints , but police are moving forward with a plan to centrally network and continuously monitor thousands of closed - circuit video cameras throughout the city .
Police decided to shut down the checkpoint just a day after they said they would extend them through the weekend .
Local blog DCist notes the confusion probably was n't the best way to inspire confidence in the police .
" Way to make everyone feel like this thing has been well thought out , guys , " the blog quips .

House Democrats cut unemployment extension to fund wars
Seeking to find a way to win over fiscally conservative " Blue Dog " members of their own caucus , House Democrats are planning to ax a 13 - week extension of unemployment benefits to find a way to pay for the Iraq war .
The move comes against the wishes of the Senate : the unemployment benefit passed without incident there , with 75 senators supporting the final bill .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) told the Washington Post yesterday that the unemployment insurance provision would " probably not " be part of the final package of war and domestic spending .
The bill provides funding for President Bush 's Iraq and Afghan wars .
It also provides a new educational benefit for military servicemembers -- at $ 52 billion .
The Senate has passed Bush 's war bill already , at $ 250 billion for 10 years ; the House bill settles at $ 165 billion , and also includes funding for some domestic measures .
Bush and Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) oppose the military educational benefit , saying it is too expensive and will drain troops from active service .
The benefit , introduced by Sen. Jim Webb ( D - VA ) , offers enough money to cover all university charges , up to the cost of the most expensive public university in a veteran 's home state .
Hoyer told the Post the final version of the bill wo n't come to the House floor until at least next week , while members negotiate between the chambers .

Hello Everybody .
We have two news items over here today .
One is “ The Arrest ” and the second is unsurprisingly “ The Candidate ” .
Radovan Karadzic ‘s arrest has caused quite a stir in Europe , he was on the run for nigh on 13 years after all .
He is one of the great war criminals of the end of the 20th century and will now , I hope , get his trial and his just sentence .
The other topic is , of course , Barack Obama who will soon be visiting Europe and is eagerly anticipated by those politicians who count on a little bit of popularity rubbing off on them , because they need it .
But alas , neither Sarkozy , who is far from popular at home right now , nor Gordon Brown , who would shake hands with just about anybody if he had a chance to bask a little in the glow of his guest ’s aura , will get the lion ’s share of Obama ’s attention .
The highly respected and very popular German chancellor Angela Merkel and her foreign secretary Steinmeier , he himself very popular , too , are on Obama ’s shortlist , never mind she resisted his plans to speak from the Brandenburg Gate .
Brown and Sarkozy are far from pleased says Der Spiegel :
One - on - one meetings for Obama have now been confirmed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
But so far he is only including time in his stops in Paris and London for French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
A decision still has n’t been made on whether the Democratic candidate will meet with the foreign ministers of those countries .
( read more )
But then Germans are the ultimate Obamamaniacs , not the only ones , but securely in the candidate ’s pocket .
Some 70 % would vote for him , if they were qualified for voting in the US presidential election .
Obama is the hope of a Western world filled with concerns .
A recession looms as does high inflation sparked by exploding demand for commodities and natural resources .
Furthermore , no one has yet come up with a convincing response to global warming .
No one knows how to bring peace to the Middle East , Afghanistan or Iraq .
And no one has a promising strategy for dealing with Islamist terrorism .( read more )
Barack Obama is very popular in Britain , too , of course .
The Guardian is covering a lot of reporting and commenting on Obama ’s behalf .
Michael Tomasky , feels that Maliki ’s support of Obama ’s withdrawal plan is the single big story of this year ’s Presidential campaign .
Boy would I have liked to have been tapping the phone lines between Washington and Baghdad on Saturday afternoon .
I would love to know exactly what people in the Bush White House were saying to one another , and more importantly what they were saying to Baghdad , after Der Spiegel published its now - famous interview with the Iraqi prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , in which he in essence endorsed Barack Obama ’s withdrawal timetable .
Bush officials acknowledged on Sunday that they did indeed call the Maliki government for , ah , clarification .
I bet they did .
( read more )
But , apart from Obama ’s obvious political prowess , there is another truth .
Almost everybody sees a different Barack Obama , according to one ’s own beliefs .
My personal view of Obama ?
He is a highly energetic , intelligent and competent person , who is more pragmatic than dogmatic and quite conservative in his personal beliefs and ethics .
He is an excellent manager and able to think through complex issues to the end , so he comes across as far sighted , while he is only very thorough in his thought processes .
“ This is not Barack Obama , she has n’t understood a single thing he said , or has n’t been listening properly . ”
Is that your reaction to my view of the candidate ?
Ok , read this :
These contradictions are arguably true of all politicians , but they seem truer of Obama than most .
He must be the only “ radical Islamist ” whose biggest scandal to date has arisen from membership of the Trinity United Church of Christ .
Depending on what Kool - Aid you have been drinking , when it comes to Obama your glass is either half full , half empty or overflowing , or you ’ve smashed it lest anybody else imbibes its poison .
This is a blessing and a curse for Barack Obama .
It offers the screen where you can project all your hopes and expectations and see them displayed for you , which will help getting him elected .
But , obviously , it carries the seed of disappointment .
The Times enters this inevitable and in my opinion vitally important sobering up process into the larger context of Anti Americanism :
It amuses me that some of those who criticise the present US Administration for its Manichaeism – its division of the world into good and evil – themselves allocate all past badness to Bush and all prospective goodness to Obama .
As the ever - improving myth has it , on the morning of September 12 , 2001 , George W. and America enjoyed the sympathy of the world .
This comradeship was destroyed , in a uniquely cavalier ( or should we say cowboyish ) fashion , through the belligerence , the carelessness , the ideological fixity and the rapacity of that amorphous and useful category of American flawed thinker , the neoconservative .
They just threw it away .
( read more )
There were several instances , where I seriously doubted that the Democrats were planning on winning the coming elections at all .
I called it “ The Cliff Barnes Syndrome ” of the Democrats in discussions with friends .
But The Economist sees it differently :
For the base , the “ enthusiasm gap ” may genuinely be about the personal appeal of Barack Obama or specific qualms regarding John McCain .
But among the writers and the think - tank wonks , there seems to be a widespread sense that the Republican Party , and perhaps the conservative movement more generally , is due for an overhaul .
And many of the folks who ’d like to do the overhauling seem to think that the shock therapy of a clear defeat , and the space for introspection and reinvention that a few years out of power would provide , are needed to make it happen .
This would explain , to me at least , why they are going on with John McCain , despite all his shortcomings .
I am still afraid , however , that they may spring a different candidate on you at the convention where McCain will step back for health reasons .
But that is neither here nor there and only my personal nightmare .
You all have a good , healthy and successful day !
Oh , oh , somebody ’s in trouble at HPD .
Seems the Harris County District Attorney ’s Office just indicted HPD officer Jeffrey Larson and former officer Ronny Martin for theft .
Who did Larson and Martin allegedly steal from ?
Wait for it ... the Houston Police Officers Union .
Well damn .
The two are accused of misappropriating cash , credit cards , even vehicles totaling more than $ 100,000 during a four - year period .
The men face first - degree felony charges of Aggregate Theft by a Public Servant and second - degree felony charges of Misapplication of Fiduciary Property .
Martin , who had been HPOU ’s secretary and was a member of the union ’s board of directors , is accused of “ orchestrating the scheme . ”
Larson , treasurer for HPOU , was his flunky , er , we mean , accomplice .
( Allegedy , allegedly . )

A newly developed nano - sized electronic device is an important step toward helping astronomers see invisible light dating from the creation of the universe .
This invisible light makes up 98 % of the light emitted since the “ big bang , ” and may provide insights into the earliest stages of star and galaxy formation almost 14 billion years ago .
The tiny , new circuit , developed by physicsts at Rutgers University , NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , and the State University of New York at Buffalo , is 100 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair .
It is sensitive to faint traces of light in the far - infrared spectrum ( longest of the infrared wavelengths ) , well beyond the colors humans see .
“ In the expanding universe , the earliest stars move away from us at a speed approaching the speed of light , ” said Michael Gershenson , professor of physics at Rutgers and one of the lead investigators .
“ As a result , their light is strongly red- shifted when it reaches us , appearing infrared . ”
Because the Earth ’s atmosphere strongly absorbs far - infrared light , Earth - based radiotelescopes cannot detect the very faint light emitted by these stars .
So scientists are proposing a new generation of space telescopes to gather this light .
Yet to take full advantage of space - borne telescopes , detectors that capture the light will have to be far more sensitive than any that exist today .
Detectors of infrared and submillimeter waves , known as bolometers , measure the heat generated when they absorb photons , or units of light .
Today ’s infrared bolometer technology is mature and has reached the limit of its performance .
“ The device we built , which we call a hot - electron nanobolometer , is potentially 100 times more sensitive than existing bolometers , ” Gershenson said .
“ It is also faster to react to the light that hits it . ”
The research team is publishing a description of the experimental device in an upcoming issue of the journal Nature Nanotechnology .
The team is led by Gershenson and Boris Karasik of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) , a NASA center managed by the California Institute of Technology ( CalTech ) .
Most of the fabrication and measurement work was done at Rutgers by graduate student Jian Wei , now a post - doctoral associate at the Northwestern University ; postdoctoral researcher David Olaya , now with the National Institute of Standards and Technology ; and postdoctoral researcher Sergey Pereverzev , now with JPL and CalTech .
The theoretical support for this research was provided by Andrei Sergeev of the State University of New York at Buffalo .
Made of titanium and niobium metals , the novel device is about 500 nanometers long and 100 nanometers wide .
The physicists built it using thin - film and nanolithography techniques similar to those used in computer chip fabrication .
The device operates at very cold temperatures – about 459 degrees below zero Fahrenheit , or one - tenth of one degree above absolute zero on the Kelvin scale .
Photons striking the nanodetector heat electrons in the titanium section , which is thermally isolated from the environment by superconducting niobium leads .
By detecting the infinitesimal amount of heat generated in the titanium section , one can measure the light energy absorbed by the detector .
The device can detect as little as a single photon of far infrared light .
“ With this single detector , we have demonstrated a proof of concept , ” said Gershenson .
“ The final goal is to build and test an array of 100 by 100 photodetectors , which is a very difficult engineering job . ”
Rutgers took the lead on fabrication and electrical characterization of the single detector , and JPL will take the lead on the optical characterization of the detector and developing detector arrays .
Gershenson expects the detector technology to be useful for exploring the early universe when satellite - based far - infrared telescopes start flying 10 to 20 years from now .
“ That will make our new technology useful for examining stars and star clusters at the farthest reaches of the universe , ” he said .

Yusuf al - Qaradawi views himself as a moderate voice of Islam
A prominent Egyptian cleric has created controversy by issuing a fatwa that says tiny amounts of alcohol are permissible in Islam .
Yusuf al - Qaradawi's fatwa says a level of 0.5 % is allowed , whereas most Muslims would say alcohol of any quantity is banned .
Sheikh Qaradawi was recently refused entry to Britain as the UK government said his views could spark violence .
He issued his fatwa in response to a question about high energy drinks .
' Distorted '
Sheikh Qaradawi is talking about tiny quantities of alcohol - equivalent to about one - eighth of a unit of alcohol .
He ruled there was no religious ban on consuming drinks with a minute amount of alcohol in them if it was formed naturally through the process of fermentation .
He quoted the rule derived from the sayings of the Prophet that if drinking a lot of alcohol makes you intoxicated then drinking a little is also forbidden .
Sheikh Qaradawi argued that any person who consumed a large amount of high energy drink would not become intoxicated , therefore they were permissible , even though they contained tiny amounts of alcohol .
But this logic has not gone down well .
The editor of a newspaper in Qatar , where Sheikh Qaradawi lives , complained that the sheikh had just stirred up a controversy that everyone could have done without .
The editor said the fatwa from a cleric of the status of Sheikh Qaradawi would inevitably be misunderstood and distorted to suggest he was giving permission to Muslims to drink alcohol .
Sheikh Qaradawi , who is a well - known TV figure , views himself as a moderate voice of Islam .
Two of the alleged hijackers were reported to be living with an FBI informant .
Lets look into this interesting fact .
By ways of the public record ..............
First off , the CIA were tracking the hijackers and knew they were mujihadeen and associated with so called terrorists .
They deliberately let them into the U.S .
" A former landlord of two of the September 11 hijackers was an FBI informant at the time , knowledgeable sources confirm to CNN . "
http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/09/11/ar911.hijackers.landlord/
" U.S. intelligence officials said that in January of 2000 , when Almidhar and Alhazmi attended a meeting of known terrorists in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , that fact was communicated by the CIA to the FBI . "
http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/09/11/ar911.hijackers.landlord/
So the high ups in the FBI were told of these guys already , but the FBI wants to play dumb .
Soon they will just flat out show corruption .
" The FBI contends the agency was never told about the two men before August 23 and says it can find no record of any such communication between CIA and FBI to show the information might have been overlooked .
The FBI has maintained that position in its dealings with congressional investigators and has asked the CIA to document , if possible , having sent word earlier . "
http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/09/11/ar911.hijackers.landlord/
They said that because they know damn well it was n't " documented " .
And Later the DOJ IG had it's own whitewash report which admitted this .....
" In addition to formal methods of communicating by the CIA to the FBI , much information can be shared with the FBI informally .....
In addition , meetings are sometimes held to discuss a matter or a piece of intelligence that is of value to both agencies ..... However , they said that not every telephone call or conversation was documented .
"
http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/oig/fbi-911/chap5.pdf
But it 's irrelevant because if you read closely the DOJ IG whitewash report there is your proof the CIA exchanged info with the FBI even as far back as Jan 2000 ..... from the report ...
" It appears that this first Malaysia meetings cable was provided to the FBI .
This January 5 threat update reflected an almost verbatim recitation of
portions of the CIA 's first Malaysia meetings cable , including the same
spelling mistake in reference to a particular place in Malaysia , which indicates
that the CIA provided a copy of the first Malaysia meetings cable to the FBI .
However ; we were not able to determine who in the FBI received this information from the CIA or who edited the January 5 threat update .
"
http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/oig/fbi-911/chap5.pdf
And frankly not only was it documented .... the FBI was asking the CIA about these guys and one CIA member called " James " covered his ass on this ......
" James wrote these e-mails in response to an e-mail from another CIA employee who was detailed to the FBI SIOC .
That employee reported on the morning of January 6 that he had been asked by an FBI employee for the latest on Mihdhar .
James responded in a series of e-mails that he had already briefed the FBI .
The final e-mail by James sets forth the details of his briefings .
"
http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/oig/fbi-911/chap5.pdf
Well , what does " James " have to say ?
" As previously mentioned , James told the CIA OIG that he had no recollection of these events .
He declined to be interviewed by us . "
http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/oig/fbi-911/chap5.pdf
How about that huh ?
" Some members of the congressional committee investigating the intelligence failures and the September 11 attacks knew about the relationship between the landlord and the FBI , and the point will probably come up when the panel holds public hearings , expected later this month . "
http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/09/11/ar911.hijackers.landlord/
Public hearings !
Hooray !
That should be real interesting !
But guess what ?
" The Federal Bureau of Investigation had a confidential informer who rented rooms in California to two of the Sept. 11 hijackers , but the bureau is resisting a request from the Congressional committee investigating the attacks to interview the informer and his F.B.I. handler , government officials said . "
http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E7DA153BF935A35753C1A9649C8B63
" Several officials said the F.B.I. had rebuffed requests to make the informer available to the committee and would not authorize the agent who was his contact to testify . "
" But Congressional investigators say the F.B.I.'s efforts to block their inquiry makes them skeptical of the bureau 's assertions about the informer .
They also say the Justice Department has joined the F.B.I. in fighting the Congressional requests for information related to the matter , escalating tensions . "
The fight over access to the informer is the latest bitter dispute between the committee and the Bush administration and the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that are the subject of the committee 's investigation "
http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E7DA153BF935A35753C1A9649C8B63
In other words Mueller and Ashcroft by order of G Bush are obstructing justice and investigation into 9/11 .
But they were unsuccessful as far as the FBI agent goes .
He did testify .
And we are not allowed to know what he said .
It is his testimony that those famous 28 pages redacted were mostly about .
But we can piece some of it together .
" Separately , documents made public in federal court in Alexandria , Va. , late last month showed that the Justice Department sought unsuccessfully to prevent F.B.I. agents , and the bureau 's director , Robert S. Mueller III , from testifying publicly before the joint inquiry . "
" Mr. Midhar and Mr. Alhazmi , who were among the hijackers on the American Airlines plane that crashed into the Pentagon , were identified as Qaeda operatives by the C.I.A. in January 2001 .
But the C.I.A. did not ask the State Department to place their names on a watch list intended to prevent entry into the United States until late August .
By then , they were both in the country . "
http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E7DA153BF935A35753C1A9649C8B63
That was intentional BTW .
So what about this FBI Agent testifying , ( that Ashcroft and Mueller tried to prevent ) who was the handler of this informant ?......
" On October 9 , members of the special congressional committee investigating the 9/11 attacks met privately with a key FBI witness .
The next day , panel members were to meet in open session with CIA Director George Tenet and FBI Director Robert Mueller .
After the FBI agent finished testifying , the open meetings with Tenet and Mueller were summarily canceled . "
http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/features/saudi_021129.htm
Awww ... too bad .
I wonder why they canceled those public hearings ?
And BTW notice it said members of the committee , not the committee .
The members would presumably be the chairmen , Porter Goss and Bob Graham .
Who else ?
Who knows ?
Someone tried to leak out at least a little bit , ( probably staffers from Graham , as he later wrote a book complaining how he wanted this information public . )
Goss would later become head of the CIA when Tenet got his reward , I mean retirement .
" Several members were " appalled " at what informed sources described as the " explosive " testimony of Special Agent Steven Butler , who recently retired from the FBI after his final posting in the bureau 's San Diego field office . "
http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/features/saudi_021129.htm
I guess it just is n't any of our business .
I wonder what this FBI Agent who coincidentally works in counter terrorism and who is the handler for the informant who was giving room and board to the two hijackers being monitored by the CIA , had to say ?
FBI HQ in Washington were warned to spread the word about suspicious Arabs at flight training school by an Agent in Arizona , and they refused to spread that word .
FBI HQ in Washington refused to allow the MN agents to check out Zacarias Moussaoui .
And what else ?... The Agents name is Steve Butler ....
" Government officials told U.S. News that Butler disclosed that he had been monitoring a flow of Saudi Arabian money that wound up in the hands of two of the 9/11 hijackers .
The two men had rented a room from a man Butler had used as a confidential informant , the sources say .
According to officials familiar with his account , Butler said that he had alerted his superiors about the money flows but the warning went nowhere .
" Butler is claiming ... that people [ in the FBI ] did n't follow up , " says a congressional source .
Adds another : " He saw a pattern , a trail , and he told his supervisors , but it ended there . "
In a conversation outside his home in the gated Rancho Penasquitos community in San Diego , Butler told U.S. News , " It 's very sensitive stuff . ''
Wearing a Buffalo Bills cap , Butler said , " I 'd love to talk to you guys , " but added that he could n't without permission from the Justice Department .
http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/features/saudi_021129.htm
I wonder what this money flow he was checking into was about ........
When these two alleged hijackers got to America , the person who picked them up and actually moved them into this informants apartment was Omar al - Bayoumi , an agent of Saudi Arabia .
He even paid their first months rent and opened up a bank account for them .
The money was reimbursed into his own account .
The DOJ report even admits it .
I wonder where the money comes from ?
" Newsweek said , however , the FBI uncovered financial records showing payments to the family of al - Bayoumi from a Washington bank account held in the name of Princess Haifa Al - Faisal , wife of the Saudi ambassador to the United States and daughter of the late King Faisal . " [ / b]
http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,71273,00.html
And the name of that Saudi ambassador she is married to is Prince Bandar .
Also known as Bandar Bush because of his close friendship with our fearless leader .
Princess Haifa Al - Faisal also happens to be the sister of Saudi Arabias intelligence chief Prince Turki al - Faisal .
When Bandar retired as ambassador this al - Faisal guy took his place ......
" Prince Bandar bin Sultan , the 22 - year Saudi ambassador to the US , the glad - handing " dean of the Washington diplomatic corps , " and confidant and partner to successive US presidential administrations , has resigned .
He has been replaced by Prince Turki al - Faisal , the former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence ( and the current ambassador to Britain ) .
Turki al - Faisal 's own ties to Washington and Langley , and throughout the intelligence world are legendary .
Prince Turki has been intimately involved with the CIA , Pakistan 's ISI ( a virtual branch of the CIA ) "
http://onlinejournal.org/Special_Reports/072305Chin/072305chin.html
So , G Bush 's good friend Saudi Ambassador Bandar was evidently helping to finance the hijackers .
And it was G Bush allowing the leader of the " AL Qaeda " in Guantanamo to leave the U.S. immediately after 9/11 ..... does n't look very good for him ..... so much for just being a puppet .
He 's involved up to his eyeballs ....
http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=19511.msg72768#msg72768
The al - Bayoumi guy was working for the Saudi Government .
He left the country in July of 2001 .
But what is never reported anywhere , is evidently he had a replacement that the FBI admits in this recently unclassified document was working for Saudi Intelligence ......
" The possibility of being affiliated with the Saudi Arabian Government or the Saudi Arabian Intelligence Service is supported by listing his employment in 1992 as the Parkwood Apartment complex in July 2001 could indicate he succeeded Omar AI - Bayoumi and may be undertaking activities on behalf of the Government of Saudi Arabia . "
http://intelfiles.egoplex.com/2001-10-03-FBI-penttbomb-bayoumi.pdf
So it appears the ones behind the 9/11 attacks are the ones involved in the Soviet - afghan war .
Which means .. Mossad -ISI -CIA - Saudi Intelligence .
So whatever happened with the informant ?
The DOJ refused to allow him to testify to congress .
When they did their own internal review of " intelligence failures " surely they would let themselves talk to him right ?
Nope , they did n't even interview the FBI Agent ..... from the DOJ IG report , where Agent Butler is referred to as " Stan " .....
" After his retirement from the FBI , " Stan " declined repeated requests
for an OIG interview .
The OIG does not have authority , to subpoena individuals and cannot compel former Department of Justice employees to submit to an interview . "
http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/oig/fbi-911/chap5.pdf
And the informant ?
The OIG was not able to interview the asset .
The Joint Intelligence Committee Inquiry had attempted to interview the asset without success .
The Committee then submitted interrogatories that the asset declined to answer , asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege .
The asset indicated through his attorney that if subpoenaed by the Committee , he would not testify without a grant of immunity .
http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/oig/fbi-911/chap5.pdf
Well , let 's hope the FBI puts the hammer down on this guy , we need to get to the bottom of this .... but turns out they decide to reward him .
Reward him with your money .
Tax money ..........
" In July 2003 , the asset was given a $ 100,000 payment and closed as an asset . "
http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/oig/fbi-911/chap5.pdf
And in July 2003 was when this investigation was being done .
FBI director R Mueller took our tax money to pay off the landlord / informant to buy his silence .
Why is n't R Mueller in prison ?
DREAM 5 capped off a huge weekend of mixed martial arts around the globe .
With most of the hype surrounding the Affliction pay - per-view ( PPV ) and the UFC event on Spike TV , it seemed like the DREAM card , which featured the conclusion of the lightweight grand prix , was n't getting the recognition it deserved .
However , after watching all three events I 'm not sure if the DREAM event was n't the best of the three .
The tournament -- to this point -- had been highlighted by the fight of the year candidate in the quarterfinals between Eddie Alvarez and Joachim Hansen , as well as the submission mastery from Shinya Aoki .
There were a lot of people who thought the winner of that great quarterfinal fight had a great chance to win the whole tournament even though Aoki was still maintaining his position as the favorite .
What nobody expected was for an eliminated fighter to actually be the one who would be crowned the champion when everything was all said and done .
Here 's how it played out .
Aoki won his semifinal bout against journeyman Caol Uno by unanimous decision .
He used a strong jiu - jitsu attack , throwing nearly every submission attempt in the book at Uno .
To Uno 's credit , he defended everything nicely , but his lack of an offensive attack clearly led to his demise in the eyes of the judges .
The other side of the bracket featured Eddie Alvarez against Tatsuya Kawajiri -- a completely different style fight .
Both of these guys like to bang ... and bang they did .
This was a back and forth all out war .
Each fighter was pushed to his limit and both guys looked to be close to defeat more than once .
But in the end it was Eddie Alvarez -- the dark horse from Philadelphia -- who landed the last flurry that ended the tournament for Kawajiri .
It was just another crowd pleasing performance from Alvarez and it looked as though he'd be in the finals against Aoki .
But his night took an unexpected turn and his tournament was brought to a disappointing end when a cut he sustained from one of the many Kawajiri punches swelled his eye almost completely shut , causing the doctor 's to force his withdrawal .
What had started off as a great night of fights abruptly turned into a total feeling of disappointment .
However , with Alvarez now out , there still had to be an opponent for Aoki in the final .
The show had to go on .
Strategic planning by the Japanese promotion had Joachim Hansen and Kultar Gill competing in an alternate match just in case .
Hansen was able to weather an early storm from the " Black Mamba " and he locked up an armbar midway through the first round .
After the win " Hellboy " found himself suddenly right back in position to win the tournament .
Winning that title was not going to be easy though .
He would have to avenge a first round submission loss to Aoki from a couple years ago in order to do so .
Ever the opportunist , Hansen was not going to let a second chance to win this tournament go by .
He made quick work of Aoki even after getting taken to the ground almost immediately after the opening bell .
His strength and power proved to be a problem for the submission artist , as Hansen pounded him out for a technical knockout win just a little over four minutes into the match .
Eddie Alvarez was one of the first guys in the ring to congratulate Hansen , and a the newly crowned champion respectfully announced his first defense would be against the Philadelphia native .
Alvarez vs. Hansen II -- sign me up for some of that !
The rest of the card was littered with numerous quality submissions .
Not allowing elbows to the face on the ground takes the submission game to a whole new level .
I 'm still not sold either way as far as the rules go , but I really enjoyed watching all the submissions tonight .
Mark
Hunt fell victim to one of those submissions in his return to the ring after nearly a two year absence .
Alistair Overeem -- who was fighting on three days notice -- easily secured a shoulder lock less than two minutes into the fight .
Hunt still has that massive power , but he clearly had some ring rust .
Perhaps this win will mean Overeem will get the match against Mirko Cro Cop he 's been begging for the last couple of months .
That would be an exciting fight to watch if Cro Cop is ever healthy enough to actually fight .
Kuniyoshi Hironaka , Hideo Tokoro , Joseph Benevidez , Yoshihiro Akiyama and Daisuke Nakamura were all impressive in victories as well .
Hironaka was coming off losing three of four in the UFC and Benevidez is a Urijah Faber trainee who moved his professional record to 8 - 0 .
All in all , I was impressed with the event tonight .
Despite the disappointment of Alvarez being forced out of the finals , this was still a fun card to watch .
I can't even imagine how sick it would have been had Denis Kang , Nick Diaz , " Mach " Sakurai , " Kid " Yamamoto and Cro Cop all competed as originally planned .
I think these events are only going to get better and better , starting with DREAM 6 which will feature the conclusion of the middleweight grand prix .
Ca n't wait !

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - Researchers have been undercounting new cases of HIV infection in the United States , meaning the rate is probably 25 percent higher at 50,000 people per year , the nation ’s top AIDS doctor said on Tuesday .

Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said the rate of infection was not increasing but that new methods of calculating the rate showed infections were more common than previous estimates .
Fauci , attending the United Nations ’ 2008 High Level Meeting on AIDS , told reporters the previous methods had shown the rate of new infections in the United States had hit a plateau at around 40,000 per year for the past 14 years .
“ They were counting the numbers in a way that was leaving out certain segments of the society .
So that 40,000 was probably an undercounted number , ” he said .
Instead of using an extrapolated mathematical model to come up with the rate of new infections , he said , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) was now relying on better counting of more groups , households and regions .
“ The number went up to about 50,000 .
That does n’t mean that the actual rate of new infections increased .
It means that we are now no longer missing counting the ones that we missed early , ” Fauci said .
“ It was always 50,000 a year . ”
The new counting methods are not changing the overall picture of AIDS in America , Fauci said .
In the United States , with a population of about 300 million , some 1.1 million people are infected with HIV , of which 25 percent do not know it .
That leaves 770,000 documented cases .
“ I have seen some of the data and it is clear .
The confusion is that it was increasing when in fact it is better accounting , ” Fauci said .
“ They are counting more accurately . ”
AIDS activists have accused the CDC of holding back results from the new methods but Fauci believes the statistics will become official “ reasonably soon , when the official publication comes out from the CDC . ”
Globally , an estimated 33.2 million people are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS and 25 million have died so far from the fatal and incurable disease .
Fauci said the search for a vaccine was complicated because unlike other viruses that the human body can ultimately defend against , such as polio , measles , mumps or smallpox , “ the body does not do a good job making an immune response to HIV . ”
On a positive note , drug therapy for treating HIV is proving effective in slowing the disease .
“ The good news is that the drugs we have now maintain people with undetectable viruses -- present but undetectable for decades now , ” Fauci said .
Fauci noted that the virus disproportionately affects blacks .
While blacks make up 12 percent of the U.S. population , 49 percent of new HIV infections in men are among blacks and 65 percent of new infections in women are among blacks .

For the fourth time this summer alone , Senate Republicans have blocked any formal consideration of extending renewable energy tax credits .
The 51 - 43 vote on Wednesday to invoke cloture on S.3335 fell nine short of the 60 needed to begin floor debate ( a ‘ Yea ’ vote indicating support for the bill and / or willingness to debate it ) .
Although Democrats Obama , McCaskill , Rockefeller , and Kennedy did not record votes , the motion still lacked the necessary support for passage .
Renewable energy investment and production tax credits are set to expire at the end of this year and it is argued by many that passage of the credits is essential to fledgling ( and still relatively expensive ) solar , wind and geothermal industries .
Senate leaders had hoped that since they padded the bill with titles to extend tax breaks for teachers , businesses and parents , they would be able to muster the support of a couple more Republicans needed for its passage .
But only four Senators crossed the aisle to vote with the Democrats : Susan Collins and Olympia Snow of Maine , Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina , and Gordon Smith of Oregon .
Fiscal philosophy or political expedience ?
Many Republicans frame their position as opposition of new tax increases to pay for certain parts of the package .
But the real sticking point for Republicans , they will argue , is that these ‘ energy bills do nothing to promote energy . ’
In other words , Senate Republicans refuse to consider extending tax breaks for renewables until they have legislation that will increase oil drilling and exploration on the outer continental shelf and elsewhere .
According to reports , to attract more Republicans , Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - MT ) added new provisions to this version to give tax breaks to those hit by natural disasters in the Midwest and elsewhere and to require private insurance plans to offer mental health benefits equal to other medical benefits under their coverage .
The bill would have also injected $ 8 billion to the federal highway trust fund to make up for an anticipated shortfall next year .
The Baucus package would have covered the cost of the tax breaks by raising some $ 54 billion over 10 years by preventing hedge fund managers and others from deferring certain overseas profits and by delaying a tax break for multinational corporations .

Might fully one - third of the six surviving Democratic vice presidential nominees end up opposing their party 's national ticket this November ?
That possibility arose today based on comments Geraldine Ferraro , the 1984 Democratic veep candidate , made to The New York Times .
Sen . Joe Lieberman , who occupied the No. 2 slot for the Democrats in 2000 , months ago declared for presumptive Republican White House nominee John McCain .
And Ferraro , a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter who sparked a brouhaha earlier this year over whether she made a racially dismissive remark about Barack Obama , apparently is no longer a reliable Democratic vote .
Ferraro , in the NYT story , terms Obama " terribly sexist . "
And , as a result , she says she may not be able to cast her ballot for him if , as anticipated , he gains the Democratic presidential nod .
On the positive side for Democrats , no signs of apostasy are emanating from the four other one - time party veep candidates still alive -- John Edwards ( the ' 04 nominee who officially signed on with Obama last week ) , Al Gore ( the nominee in 1992 and ' 96 ) , Walter Mondale ( the 1976 and 1980 nominee ) and Sargent Shriver ( George McGovern 's running mate in 1972 -- they may have gotten trounced by the GOP 's Richard Nixon / Spiro Agnew pairing , but their longevity is impressive ) .

NASA Debuts Web Site for First Ares Test Flight
WASHINGTON -- NASA is developing new spacecraft , the Ares rockets and Orion crew capsule , to deliver astronauts to the International Space Station and send them on their way to the moon .
The first test flight of the spacecraft , known as Ares I - X , is scheduled to launch in spring 2009 .
The latest information about this launch is now available at :
The Web site was created to offer key information about the details and objectives of the Ares I - X test flight .
The site features articles , images and videos that outline the objectives of the Ares I - X test flight and explain how these objectives will influence the design and flight of the Ares I rocket and Orion crew capsule .
The Ares I - X flight will test hardware , facilities and ground operations associated with the Ares I rocket .
It also will provide critical data during ascent of the integrated Orion crew exploration vehicle and the Ares I launch vehicle stack -- data that will be used to design a vehicle system that is safe and fully operational before astronauts begin traveling into orbit .
The Ares I - X test flight will bring America one step closer to a return to the moon by 2020 and eventual trips to Mars and destinations beyond .

Protesters say they are willing to break the law and hand out condoms to Catholic pilgrims during this month 's World Youth Day celebrations in Sydney .
Powers approved by the NSW government allow for people who continually annoy or inconvenience pilgrims during the event , to be staged in Sydney from July 15 to 20 , to be arrested and possibly fined $ 5,500 .
Protest group , NoToPope Coalition are concerned the regulations will be used to stop demonstrations during World Youth Day events , but that they could also effectively ban things like wearing a T - shirt with a slogan considered to be anti-Catholic .
NoToPope spokeswoman Rachel Evans said the group was seeking legal advice on whether it could challenge the " thou shalt not offend " laws .
But she said the group would still carry out its protest in the CBD on July 19 , and go ahead with its plan to hand out condoms to young pilgrims .
PARIS–Carlos Sastre won the Tour de France on Sunday , sipping champagne in the processional to the Champs - Elysees and becoming the third consecutive Spaniard to capture cycling 's premier event .
Sastre held his narrow lead over Cadel Evans of Australia , finishing seven seconds behind his main rival for a 58 - second victory .
Bernhard Kohl of Austria was 1:13 back for third place , the second tightest podium finish in the 105 - year - old race .
" It 's very moving , " Sastre said , hugging his two children .
As the main pack headed toward Paris , Sastre cruised alongside a CSC car and drank from a champagne flute handed to him by team owner Bjarne Riis .
Sastre crossed arms and butted helmets affectionately with CSC teammate Stuart O'Grady as they crossed the finish line .
He was then surrounded by his family after getting off his bike .
The 21st and final stage was won by Gert Steegmans of Belgium .
He prevailed in a final sprint from the pack at the end of the 89 - mile course from Etampes to the French capital .
The ride was largely ceremonial for Sastre , who all but assured himself victory a day earlier in the final time trial by holding off Evans .
The 33 - year - old Spaniard claimed the yellow jersey by winning the toughest Alpine ride this year – Stage 17 into the famed Alpe d'Huez – and held it to the finish .
Sastre is among the oldest to have won the Tour for a first time .
This was his sixth top - 10 finish in the race , and he is the seventh Spaniard to win .
Alberto Contador won last year , and Oscar Pereiro inherited the 2006 title lost by American Floyd Landis in a doping scandal .
As in the last two years , this year 's Tour was plagued by doping .
Three riders were ousted in drug busts : Italy 's Riccardo Ricco and Spain 's Manuel Beltran and Moises Duenas Nevado .

This month 's announcement of a back - room deal between ISPs ( internet service providers ) and the big record companies to spy on suspected copyright infringers and reduce the quality of their internet connections is just the latest paragraph in the record industry 's long , self - pitying suicide note , and it 's left me wishing they 'd just pull the trigger already and stop beating their chests and telling us all how unfair it all is .
Under the new scheme , the rule of law is replaced by a cosy inter-industry deal .
Whereas before , anyone who wanted your ISP to spy on your internet connection would have had to show evidence to a judge and get a court order , now any joker who claims to be an aggrieved copyright holder can do so .
And whereas actual criminals are punished by judges who make rulings that are proportional to the offence , and which are calculated to minimise external harm , the new scheme allows ISPs and their pals in the record industry to randomly shake up your connection like a snow - globe , dropping some or all of your services – whether you 're using your VoIP phone to speak to your dying granny in Australia or downloading the latest hit single from the guy who did the " Crazy Frog Song " .
They claim that the surveillance data will only be used to police copyright and not to spy on every communication you make .
But Transport for London claimed that Oyster cards would only be used to simplify paying for travel , and not to bulk - surveil Londoners , and yet here we are .
As novelists say , " A gun on the mantle in act one is bound to go off by act three . "
I 'm a science fiction writer by trade , but even I am impressed by the incredible inventiveness on display in the figures used by the record industry to justify this measure : they add up all the kids who 've downloaded a song this week , multiply by the highest retail price , add 30 % to account for the wear and tear on their faces from tugging at their beards in dismay , and announce a billion quid " piracy loss " that government and ISPs have to step up and do something about right now , please and thanks , and forget about all that tedious law business .
The law is for " minor crimes " like rape and murder – when it comes to serious crimes like downloading songs , we need a " streamlined process " that makes the War on Terror look like a slow - moving , cautious thing .
Will this stop kids from trading infringing files ?
Kids are time - rich and cash - poor and have an infinite supply of ingenuity and impecuniousness to apply to the job of getting music for free .
Last year , my freshman university students in Los Angeles regaled me with stories of " hard - drive parties " where everyone would gather with guitars , beers and whopping great hard drives that cost less than either the guitars or the beers .
While the students jammed , sang and danced , they simply synchronised their drives using whatever laptops were lying around , transferring hundreds of gigabytes ' worth of music while composing and recording songs of their own .
It made me wish I was a teenager again : that sounded a lot more fun than painstakingly recording my vinyl to 90 - minute cassettes and shyly giving them to girls in the hope of impressing them .
So no , I do n't think this is going to have any appreciable effect on filesharing .
However , it will succeed in driving music - swapping even further underground , to encrypted protocols and offline hard - drive parties and private swapping networks .
These are every bit as efficient at getting music into the hands of kids , but they 're a lot harder to monitor and charge money for .
The original Napster had a fine proposition : they would charge their users for signing onto their network and write a cheque for as - many - billions - as - you - like to the record industry every quarter .
After all , they had the fastest - growing technology in the history of the world at their disposal , 70 million internet users in 18 months , and they 'd found that the average American user was willing to spend $ 15 a month for the service .
The record industry sued them into a smoking hole instead , and out of the ashes of Napster arose dozens of new networking technologies .
Each one was more hardened against monitoring and disconnection than the last .
These days , if you wanted to charge a flat fee for access to all music ( something that consumers all over the world would be eager to accept ) , you 'd have to do stuff that 's a lot more complicated and funky to get anything like the clean reports we'd have gotten off of Napster 1.0 .
And yet that 's just what we 're going to end up doing .
It 's historically inevitable : whenever technology makes it impossible to police a class of copyright use , we 've solved the problem by creating blanket licences .
The record industry itself was the first beneficiary of this system : when the US sheet - music publishers sued the record - makers for selling recordings of their compositions , they were given a simple solution : anyone is allowed to record your music , provided they pay you a set fee for it .
No one has to pay a lawyer $ 500 / hour to negotiate whether this track on this album will cost $ 0.10 per disc or $ 0.05 .
And when the record companies objected to the radio stations playing their discs without compensation or permission , the answer was a blanket licence for records played on air .
It 's the tried - and - true answer to the problem of copyright - disrupting technology :
* acknowledge that it 's going to happen ;
* find a place to collect a toll ;
* charge a fee that 's low enough to get buy - in from the majority ;
* ignore the penny - ante fee evaders ;
* sue the blistering crap out of the big - time fee-evaders .
This is the shareholder - value - maximising answer that actually brings revenue into the pockets of artists and record companies .
It co-opts the majority of filesharers into being active participants in a legitimate transaction instead of everyone starting off as outlaws who have nothing to lose and no reason to come to the bargaining table except for fear of legal reprisals ( this fear is notoriously ineffective at moderating the behavior of children ) .
Ten years ago , the record industry had a simple little problem they could have solved by showing a tiny amount of future - looking flexibility .
A decade of intransigence and stubborness has bred a killer strain of antibiotic - resistant filesharing technology that grows more and more difficult to police by the year .
The sheet music publishers did n't get to control the destiny of the record companies , who could n't control the broadcasters , who could n't control the cable operators , who could n't control the VCR makers .
The record industry will not be in charge of the characteristics of filesharing systems .
They may get remunerated for their use , but they wo n't be able to dictate their functionality , no matter how many children they criminalise .
If they want to cash in on filesharing , they 'd better do it soon , before every potential licence fee payer decides to opt out of the system forever .
In almost every industry , companies find reason to dislike their customer base .
And although it 's no different in the technology space , it 's as if cell phone carriers and ISPs are n't afraid of hiding it .
After all , if these companies really liked us , would n't they realize that privacy is a major concern and we do n't like being bogged down by onerous contracts ?
Apparently not .
Cell phone carriers
Surely not everything is awful with the cell phone companies , right ?
They not only provide you with a service that you use each day , but judging by the popularity of cell phones , it 's safe to say they 're doing a good enough job to keep customers coming back for more .
But then again , maybe that success is due to the fact that there are very few choices and we 're stuck using their services regardless of how we 're treated .
Think about it : prices , offerings , and policies are amazingly uniform across the board Right now , Verizon Wireless and AT&T — two competitors — are offering same exact plans for the same exact price .
Looking for 450 minutes and free nights and weekends ?
Verizon Wireless will offer it to you for $ 39.99 and , you guessed it , so will AT&T .
And to make matters worse , the prices stay the same with each carrier as you increase your plan .
The cell phone carriers contend that their decision to offer plans at the same prices make for a more competitive environment .
According to AT&T , the prices are the same because if they charged more than competitors , they would undoubtedly lose customers , but if they charged less , the impact on the bottom line could be troublesome .
" Not to mention , " Joe Tassone , cofounder of HPC Development said in an interview , " infrastructure costs for carriers are about the same , creating the same level of expenses , and thus , the same revenue margin . "
Of course , the abuse of cell phone companies and their seeming distaste for us goes far beyond pricing concerns .
Do they just expect us to forget that Verizon sued the FCC last year because of its aversion to the rules surrounding the 700MHz spectrum ?
Verizon was upset because it believed open access and open devices would " limit the introduction of new and innovative wireless services . "
But like most of us , Google smelled a rat .
Verizon has since had a conversion of sorts , and has promised to open its network to all lawful devices and applications .
" It 's regrettable that Verizon has decided to use the court system to try to prevent consumers from having any choice of innovative services , " wrote Chris Sacca , Google 's head of special initiatives .
" Once again , it is American consumers who lose from these tactics . "
And perhaps that 's where the real proof is .
Sure , these companies are allowed to collaborate with the National Security Agency and illegally monitor calls without any worry of legal recourse , but it 's the customers that continue to suffer and the carriers seemingly could n't care less .
That said , AT&T believes it did n't do anything wrong in collaborating with the National Security Agency and it's doing what 's best for the greatest number of customers .
And although it has yet to officially comment on the incident , it has continually said that it has always worked within the scope of the law and cannot " comment on matters of national security . "
But what about customer satisfaction ?
According to the Better Business Bureau 's latest survey , cell phone companies lead the pack in complaints .
In 2006 , the industry had almost 29,000 complaints levied against it — more than 4,000 more than the second - place industry — new car auto dealers .
Since 2002 , cell phone carriers have consistently sat atop the list for most complaints and all the while , they like to claim that their policy of forcing you to pay $ 175 to get out of a contract or the draconian rules that lock you into a two - year agreement are for your own good , but who are they kidding ?
Everything these carriers do is designed to ensure you pay dearly for wanting out of a contract and every time you threaten to leave , you 're quickly reminded that you 'll be dropping huge sums of cash to do it .
To be fair , the cell carriers contend that the contracts protect the consumer as much as they protect the companies .
As one wireless expert who asked not to be named said in an interview , " the contract is designed to protect both parties .
Carriers do n't want you to leave , but it also provides you with a sense of security knowing the rate you 're locked into wo n't change and you will be getting what you paid for — more than can be said for ISPs . "
ISPs
Companies like Time Warner Cable , Comcast , and even AT&T , have instituted a number of policies that make it all too easy for us to give them back what we get from them : distaste .
Filters
AT&T has made no secret of its intentions to begin filtering traffic on its network .
At this year 's CES , James Cicconi , senior vice president , external & legal affairs for AT&T , spoke on a panel about concerns over peer - to - peer technologies that were violating copyrights and ostensibly putting his company in danger .
" We are very interested in a technology - based solution and we think a network - based solution is the optimal way to approach this , " he said while discussing ways to reduce copyright issues .
" We recognize we are not there yet but there are a lot of promising technologies .
But we are having an open discussion with a number of content companies , including NBC Universal , to try to explore various technologies that are out there . "
Cicconi went on to say that his company needs to " find a friendly way to go about doing it " , but is there any such way ?
Ostensibly , his company 's plans will revolve around reducing your ability to get what you want , when you want , while surfing the Web .
It may work for AT&T and copyright holders that have yet to adapt to the changing times , but it leaves customers in a position where everyone is being victimized because of a select few who engage in illegal file - sharing .
But AT&T does n't see it that way .
Instead , the company is concerned that it will face legal action for allowing peer - to - peer networks run amok on its network and as copyrighted material continues to proliferate across the Web , AT&T believes it needs to find a way to stop its users from engaging in the activity for the sake of its own bottom line .
Customer ( dis)satisfaction
Comcast is so bad , it has its own site dedicated to its suckiness .
And while it 's not unique in its practices , it 's well known for its poor customer satisfaction and outlandish policies that aim at preventing us from getting the kind of service we should expect .
According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index , Comcast led every company in overall customer dissatisfaction in 2004 and 2007 .
In 2007 , though , the ACSI found that as Comcast 's customer satisfaction decreased by seven percent , its revenue jumped by 12 percent .
And according to analysts , the lack of competition is keeping the company afloat .
" Such pricing power usually comes with some level of monopoly protection and most cable companies have little competition at the local level , " analysts contend .
" This also means that a cable company can do well financially even though its customers are not particularly satisfied . "
For its part , Comcast is trying to fix the PR nightmare it has created over the past few years .
The company now has a " ComcastCares " Twitter account where upset customers can send messages to Frank Eliason , a Comcast Outreach Representative , who will do his best to fix the problem as soon as possible .
There 's no way to tell if it 's working , but the fact that Comcast is at least trying , gives us some hope for the future .
Bandwidth caps
Time Warner Cable is currently in the process of testing metered Internet access in Beaumont , Texas because of its concern over a relatively small percentage of its customers using up a large amount of its bandwidth .
According to the company , five percent of its customers use more than 50 percent of its bandwidth each month , putting a drain on its overall service .
Under the plan , the company would offer 768 kbps downloads and 5GB of data per month , or 15 M bps speeds and a 40 GB cap .
Time Warner Cable thinks those figures are fair and adequately appeal to those that are looking for simple service to check emails and browse the Web and those that want more advanced service to accommodate more advanced practices .
I think it 's just another example of an ISP abusing its position as the only cable provider in a certain area and forcing customers into a predicament that is n't nearly as fair as it could be .
But it 's quite obvious that Time Warner , Comcast , and AT&T do n't care .
And why should they ?
With the FCC having created cable / DSL duopoloies across the country , there has been little incentive to worry about customer happiness .
Maybe that will change with the advent of wireless broadband networks over the next few years ... unless they 're owned and controlled by the same players
Slowly , but surely , we 've entered into a major predicament .
With nary a mention of the RIAA and MPAA , we 've found two industries that appear that they could n't care less about the consumer .
And yet , there 's no way we can stop it .
The combination of a overly - industry - friendly regulatory scheme and collusive practices leaves each of these companies is in a prime position to do what they want , how they want , whenever they want .
Sure , sometimes public uproar will get an ISP to backtrack on an unpopular decision , but , for the most part , we 're expected to suffer .
The latest national polling in the presidential race is nothing if not consistent -- most of the recent ones , including an ABC News / Washington Post survey released today , show Barack Obama with a four - percentage - point lead over John McCain among registered voters .
That 's not great news for the presumptive Democratic nominee , given all the factors seemingly weighing against the Republican Party ( most obviously President Bush 's in - the - tank approval ratings ) .
But Obama should be heartened by a new poll that focused solely on Latino voters in 21 states .
The survey , conducted by Pacific Market Research and political scientists at the University of Washington , found Obama 's level of support approaching what Democratic presidential candidates -- until the 2004 election -- had come to count on .
Obama swamped McCain in the survey , 60 % to 23 % , with 16 % undecided .
The poll 's margin of error was plus - or - minus 3.5 percentage points .
Hillary Clinton consistently walloped Obama among Latino voters in the prolonged Democratic primary battle .
That caused some in the party to wonder about Obama 's ability to attract significant support from this bloc in the general election .
But the new results put him within shouting distance of the 67 % of the Latino vote that , according to exit polling , Al Gore won in the 2000 election .
And Obama 's goal , no doubt , will be to come close to the 72 % that Bill Clinton won in his 1996 reelection ( or , even better , the 76 % that Jimmy Carter won in 1976 ) .
Bush raised GOP hopes that the party was making inroads with Latino voters when he captured 43 % of Latino votes four years ago , compared with John Kerry 's 56 % , according to exit polling .
But the new figures indicate that the party has not been able to sustain that support .
More about the new survey , including matchups in specific states , can be read here .

Is the S&P 500 getting ready to resume the longer - term uptrend or are defensive assets poised for a big pop ?
PRINCETON , NJ --
As Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton prepare for Wednesday night 's debate in Philadelphia , Gallup 's daily tracking indicates that Obama 's support has yet to suffer following his widely reported remarks about small - town voters being " bitter . "
The remarks were first reported on April 11 .
Obama said in essence that small - town voters are bitter because the government has not been able to help their economic plight .
As a result , they " cling " to religion and drift toward narrow issues such as gun rights , and anti-trade or anti-immigration policies , instead of their larger economic interests .
Clinton has criticized Obama 's comments on the campaign trail in recent days and is sure to remind Pennsylvania voters of those remarks in the debate Wednesday night .
Clinton and other Obama critics have characterized his remarks as being insensitive to less - well - educated , lower - income , and religious voters .
If his comments are to affect any voters , presumably it would be voters in these subgroups .
But an in - depth analysis of Gallup Poll Daily tracking data collected both before and after the controversy shows little or no change in support for Obama as the Democratic nominee among these types of Democratic voters .
The analysis is based on tracking data of Democratic voters ' nomination preferences immediately before ( April 8 - 10 ) and immediately after ( April 12 - 14 ) Obama 's remarks became a major campaign issue .
Although Gallup 's tracking data do not have a variable that identifies small - town residents per se , it can identify a number of groups that have suffered economically and are presumably the types of voters to whom Obama was referring .
Income
Democratic voters at the lower end of the economic spectrum have disproportionately backed Clinton for the nomination , but her standing among these voters has not changed since Obama 's remarks .
Obama 's support among voters making $ 24,000 or less a year has shown a slight , but not statistically significant , drop of three percentage points in recent days .
Education
Last week , Gallup reported on the " education gap " in voting in the Democratic primary race , with Obama running strongly among those with a college degree or postgraduate education , and Clinton doing better among those with less formal education .
Obama 's remarks may have offended voters who did not attend college , but if they did , it has not materially affected his support among this group , which dropped just one point since the controversy began .
Because Clinton 's support among those with a high school education or less also dipped slightly , the relative positioning of the candidates among this group has not changed .
Financial Concerns
Education and income are essentially surrogates for lower socioeconomic status , and that may not necessarily indicate economic distress .
The Gallup tracking poll can help address the issue directly because it asks voters if they worry about money .
Though Clinton tends to appeal to voters with less education and income , Obama runs better among Democratic voters who say they are worried about money .
That could be because blacks , who overwhelmingly support Obama , are more likely to worry about money .
Obama led by 15 points among Democratic voters who said they were worried about money before his remarks were publicized , and has essentially the same lead ( 14 points ) since then .
Religion
Obama hypothesized that many of the voters he was talking about " cling " to religion because of their frustration with their economic state .
But there is no evidence that more religious Democratic voters have shifted their support away from Obama as a result of his statement .
Prior to the controversy , 49 % of Democrats who say religion is an important part of their lives supported Obama and 42 % preferred Clinton .
Obama maintains a similar five - point lead among religious Democrats in the more recent data .
Black Versus White Democrats
The above analysis looks at subgroups among the Democratic electorate as a whole .
But since whites are more likely than blacks to live in small towns , Obama probably had white voters in mind when he made his remarks .
Polling has established that Obama receives overwhelming support among blacks , so it is possible he has lost support among lower - educated white Democrats in recent days but offset the losses with gains among lower - educated black Democrats , for example .
But an analysis of the relationships reported in this review among white Democrats only finds no evidence that whites have reacted to the controversy in a different way than blacks .
Implications
It certainly appears that , as of April 14 interviewing , Obama 's remarks have not hurt him -- either among the Democratic electorate as a whole or among the Democratic constituencies Obama was referring to .
Wednesday night 's debate may shine a spotlight on those comments and make them known to a wider audience , so the possibility remains that Obama has not completely weathered the storm .
Conceivably , Obama could be hurt more in a general - election context , where voters with the characteristics he describes might already have an inkling to vote Republican , and such remarks could nudge them more in that direction .
But Gallup 's general - election tracking data -- like that for the Democratic nomination -- have so far shown no deterioration in Obama 's standing versus presumptive Republican nominee John McCain .
Survey Methods
Results are based on aggregated data from Gallup 's daily tracking data , consisting of telephone interviews with 1,210 Democratic voters , aged 18 and older , conducted April 8 - 10 , 2008 , and 1,314 Democratic voters , aged 18 and older , conducted April 12 - 14 , 2008 .
For results based on these samples of Democratic voters , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Margins of error for subgroups will be higher .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Last week , NPR did a report on the economic proposals of McCain and Obama .
McCain ’s centerpiece is tax cuts for the wealthy , while Obama champions a tax cut for the middle class .
NPR ignored the fact that McCain is now promoting the same plan that he opposed 8 years ago , and that Bush ’s tax cuts for the rich have had none of the promised results , making the economy worse , not better .
Instead , NPR decided to focus on the “ big ideas ” behind the proposals .
What are these big ideas ?
In NPR ’s words , the big idea behind the Obama plan was “ fairness ” , which could also be called “ redistribution ” ( i.e. socialism ) .
And the big idea behind the McCain plan was “ growth ” .
Leave it to the US media to get it totally wrong .
Luckily for McCain , he can depend on the media to get it wrong again and again .
When gas passes $ 4 / gallon , McCain proposes drilling in environmentally sensitive offshore areas .
Never mind that there is so little oil there it will make very little difference in oil prices , and not for at least 10 years , if ever .
But thank goodness for the media , who contrast Obama ’s concern for the environment ( out of touch and elitist ) with McCain ’s concern for jobs and growth .
If McCain can look good with a proposal that jeopardizes the environment for almost no economic benefit ( but benefits oil companies ) , I suppose that it is only natural that he would get behind tax cut proposals that have have been a dismal failure over the last eight years .
Lastly , where can you read about this ?
Why in a non-US newspaper , of course .

' News : Straight and Gay Friends Make T - Shirt to Support Marriage Equality
New Haven Register

Cara Baruzzi , Register Staff 08/17/2007
NEW HAVEN , CONNECTICUT —
Dubbing it a T - shirt company " with a heart , conscience and sense of humor , " three young entrepreneurs have started a business that aims to promote marriage equality — one shirt at a time .
The Internet - based company , called ISSO , recently launched its first T - shirt , which bears the message " marriage is so gay . "
A portion of the shirt 's proceeds are donated to organizations that advocate equal rights for gay and straight couples .
" We 're not trying to be political in any sense , " said Reggie Solomon , 31 , of New Haven , one of ISSO 's owners .
" Unfortunately , marriage has become political , but we do n't think it is . "
ISSO merely wanted to create a stylish shirt that people would enjoy wearing , he said .
Solomon , who is gay , founded the company in May with Ben Berkowitz , 28 , of New Haven and Andy Horowitz , 26 , who recently moved from New Haven to Louisiana , both of whom are straight .
They had the idea for ISSO while on a road trip with friends when " somehow the subject of marriage equality came up . "
Berkowitz had previous experience making shirts , having designed and independently sold T - shirts that said , " New Haven : It 's Better Than Your Town " in the past .
All three owners have full - time jobs in addition to ISSO .
Solomon works for Yale University , Berkowitz owns a Web design company called CT Web Net LLC , and Horowitz , the former director of the New Haven Oral History Project , is a freelance writer in Louisiana .
The company 's name , ISSO , is taken from the " is so " on the first shirt .
Solomon said the company plans to launch more T - shirt designs in the future , and not all products will necessarily be geared toward marriage equality .
" We 'll go wherever it takes us , " he said .
Since launching its Web site , www.issogay.com, on July 27 , the company has sold 34 T - shirts .
The first one was bought by a customer in Arizona .
The owners hope to sell 100,000 shirts and hold a celebration when they hit that milestone .
" We created a product that we 're excited about , " he said , adding that the shirt has been well received .
" We 've struck a chord with some people .
We 've just had a really great response . "
The shirt gives people a lighthearted way to show their support for a serious issue , said Carol Buckheit , associate director of Hartford - based Love Makes a Family .
The statewide nonprofit , which advocates equal rights for gay and straight marriages , is one of the groups receiving a portion of ISSO 's proceeds .
" We are just thrilled that ( the company ) has created such a visible and such a fun way to support marriage equality , " she said .
While they plan to expand in the future , for now , ISSO 's owners are focusing their attention on the " marriage is so gay " shirt and are optimistic it will become popular .
" People are excited to wear the shirt , " Solomon said .
" We have as many straight friends wearing the shirt as we do gay friends .
We 've created a shirt that , whether you 're straight or gay , you can feel comfortable wearing . "
Saudi Arabia remains the world ’s leading source of money for Al Qaeda and other extremist networks and has failed to take key steps requested by U.S. officials to stem the flow , the Bush administration ’s top financial counter - terrorism official said Tuesday .
Stuart A. Levey , a Treasury undersecretary , told a Senate committee that the Saudi government had not taken important steps to go after those who finance terrorist organizations or to prevent wealthy donors from bankrolling extremism through charitable contributions , sometimes unwittingly .
“ Saudi Arabia today remains the location where more money is going to terrorism , to Sunni terror groups and to the Taliban than any other place in the world , ” Levey said under questioning .
U.S. officials have previously identified Saudi Arabia as a major source of funding for extremism .
But Levey ’s comments were notable because , although reluctant to directly criticize a close U.S. ally , he acknowledged frustration with administration efforts to persuade the Saudis and others to act .

“ We continue to face significant challenges as we move forward with these efforts , including fostering and maintaining the political will among other governments to take effective and consistent action , ” Levey said , later adding : “ Our work is not nearly complete . ”
Levey was the sole witness before the Senate Finance Committee , which Tuesday ordered an independent review of the efforts to choke off financing used by Al Qaeda and other extremist groups .
Sen . Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , the committee chairman , announced the review at the end of the hearing held to assess the money - tracking campaign by Treasury ’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence , headed by Levey .
The Bush administration created the office in 2004 to spearhead efforts to disrupt the flow of money to extremist causes , primarily from wealthy donors in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf .

However , U.S. officials and counter - terrorism experts have said that international support for the effort has waned while terrorist groups have found ways around the financial restrictions .
At the same time , there have been turf battles among the 19 federal agencies that work on the problem .
Senators praised work done by Levey but expressed concerns about the overall U.S. effort .
The committee ’s Democratic and Republican leaders cited a Los Angeles Times report last week detailing problems undermining the effort .
Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , the ranking Republican , said extremist groups had adapted to changing U.S. investigative methods :
“ We are simply not prepared right now to keep up with them and put them out of business once and for all . ”
Levey said the campaign has succeeded in disrupting terrorist financing by freezing suspicious assets and in gathering intelligence that could be used to identify extremists and disrupt their activities .

But under questioning by senators , Levey also spoke of difficulty in getting Saudi Arabia to take the steps U.S. officials consider necessary .
Levey said the Saudis had been aggressive in going after terrorist cells .
But he said they had not lived up to promises to establish the kind of financial intelligence unit needed to trace the money trails of terrorists .
Another problem is that the Saudi government has not set up a charity oversight commission to track whether donations end up in the hands of extremists .
Levey said the Saudi government has not moved to publicly hold accountable those within the kingdom who have been the subject of enforcement actions by the U.S. and other authorities .
Sen. Ron Wyden ( D - Ore. ) said the Saudi failures mean that Americans who pay more than $ 100 a barrel for oil are in effect bankrolling extremism because wealthy Saudis “ back - door ” their profits into charities that fund extremist causes .
Advertisement
Nail Jubeir , press attache for the Saudi embassy in Washington , dismissed those concerns , saying the Bush administration has repeatedly praised Saudi Arabia for its efforts to combat terrorism .
“ We have been very vigilant in our campaign against terrorism financing , ” Jubeir said .
“ We have come a long way since 9/11 on this issue . ”
Jubeir confirmed that Saudi Arabia has not set up the financial intelligence unit or charity commission , but said it was cracking down on the financiers of terrorism in other ways , such as making it illegal for anyone to send money outside the kingdom “ without going through official government channels . ”
Alleged financiers of terrorism identified by the United States are being investigated , and their assets have been frozen , Jubeir said .
“ But unless we have evidence to try them . . . we do n’t parade them in public , ” he said .
“ What if it turns out they are innocent ? ”

At the hearing , senators also expressed concern about disputes among U.S. agencies and other administrative and investigative functions of Levey ’s office .
Baucus and Grassley asked that the Government Accountability Office review its internal efficiency and effectiveness as well as its cooperation with foreign governments .
Levey said he had not seen the request from Baucus and Grassley , but added : “ We welcome any source of advice as to how we can improve . ”

Article updated on Sunday , September 10th , 2017 .
I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED a collection of brown leather trunks with brightly colored stickers from all the world ’s corners .
They remind me of travelers in the early 1900s who spent days on the ocean in order to reach their destinations .
Back then , arriving at the destination was as much a part of the trip as the destination itself .
So when I needed to get from Guadeloupe in the Caribbean to France I asked myself , “ is it still possible to travel by boat ? ”
There are , after all , still cargo ships that carry everything from automobiles to antiques over the ocean , so why could n’t I just hop on one myself and enjoy an ocean voyage ?
A few months later I was on a CMA - CGM cargo ship headed from Pointe - à - Pitre to Dunkerque .
Note that if you are having your car shipped overseas and wonder if it were possible to travel with your vehicle and save a little money while having a fun experience , it is well worth asking the cargo line whether they offer passenger rooms on their ships .
Traveling on a cargo ship is very much possible , and while it is n’t considered a luxury cruise , it is still a great way to travel — even at a cost of roughly $ 100 USD daily , it is worth the time to find a spot on a ship .
My nine days on the Atlantic included gourmet French food , duty - free Porto , and hours spent mesmerized by the blinking lights of the GPS .
Yes , you can still travel to many locations in the world by boat .
It was by far one of the best trips I ’ve ever taken .
Here are some pointers for researching and planning your own adventure on the high seas :
1 . What exactly is traveling by cargo ship ?
Most of the major global shipping lines including CMA - CGM offer paying passengers an opportunity to hop on one of their lines .
As a paying passenger , you are accommodated in guest cabins and have access to most areas of the ship .
Cargo ships have a limited number of rooms for passengers , so be prepared to start planning your ventures , and book the trip at least 6 months in advance to ensure you have a spot on the ship .
Your fare will usually include port fees as well as meals and your room .
Captains and crew spend a lot of time on the water , and they are usually happy to have a fresh face walking around their workplace , meaning that they may even invite you to eat with them , give you tours of the ship and maybe even have you over for an Officer ’s happy hour .
2 . Where can I go ?
You can travel almost anywhere by cargo ship .
The global shipping industry is huge , and many ports like New York , Shanghai , Los Angeles , and Sydney welcome several ships daily .
Shipping companies have certain lines covering specific routes , and many of them will allow you to buy a ticket for one of these lines and disembark and board as you please if there is a ship leaving on your chosen day .
Just remember to book your passage in advance because you ca n’t just show up at a port to jump on a ship on a whim .
A word of advice to the cargo ship traveler , be flexible .
Schedules can , and very often do change and when that happens , you will need to hop on and off more than one ship during the trip .
This is often how round the world routes work : book your freighter ticket and then plan in a few weeks in every major port .
With freighters , the possibilities for your adventure are almost endless .
Just think : anywhere global commodities are shipped are places that you can disembark and spend time soaking up the local culture before re-boarding .
3 . What will it cost ?
A common misconception is that if you are willing to spend an extended amount of time on open water you can score an inexpensive mode of transportation to your next travel destination .
Traveling as a passenger on a cargo ship is , in fact , more expensive than your average airfare .
But before you scoff at the price — plan on an average price of $ 80 - 140 / day — consider this : your ticket pays for room , meals , and experiences that can not be had anywhere else .
The days where a person could work for their passage are long gone .
The cargo lines will not allow you to work your way across the Atlantic just so you can have a free trip overseas .
You will , however , get to meet crew members and will most likely find yourself spending a great deal of time getting to know many of them when they take a break or have some time off to relax a little .
4. Life on a ship
As a passenger , you are surrounded by the everyday life of the vessel and her crew .
Schedules revolve around meal times , which can be extravagant events depending on the chef .
If you are a gourmet traveler , consider traveling with one of the French companies which are known for their high - quality cuisine and table wine .
Besides meals , the rest of the day is spent as you please .
Make your way up to the bridge and chat with the captain about sea navigation or schedule a tour with the head mechanic to see the vessel ’s impressive technical insides .
Officers on cargo ships are often willing to show you how things work to keep the ship afloat and to keep things safe .
You will quickly find that the freighter environment is a rough but enjoyable one ; think lots of steel and salt water .
Before the evening meal , meet for a pre-dinner drink with your co-passengers in the guest lounge area and discuss the events of the day .
You may think that a week on open water can give you a case of cabin fever , but a slower pace of life can be much welcomed and enjoyable .
There is something to note about health and fitness levels when traveling on a cargo ship .
Because these ships usually do not have a doctor on board , you should be healthy and fit enough to take on such a voyage .
This is a safety precaution as the ship would n’t want anyone being injured or in need of medical attention and be at sea without a doctor to help .
5. Planning
So you ’ve decided that freighter travel is for you , what now ?
Do your internet research , there are several websites maintained by individuals seduced by traveling on the high seas with great tips and long lists of different routes around the world .
Go to the websites of the freighter companies and send them an email asking about passenger fares .
Another option is travel agencies that specialize in freighter travel like A la Carte Freighter Travel based in Montreal .
Some helpful websites to get you started :
NEW YORK , ( Reuters ) - Ever since the rise of the automobile in the 1950s , the American Dream has featured a home in the suburbs and two cars in the garage .
Evelyn Baker poses for a photographer on her bicycle pulling her son Kai and her son Colin on his own bicycle next to her house in Denver 's Stapleton development July 6 , 2008 .

Now the iconic white picket fence comes with a hefty price tag in the form of the cost of the gasoline needed to drive to work and to the supermarket , and the suburban idyll is under review .
In different parts of the United States , there are signs of change .
While home prices in the suburbs have crashed , apartments in city centers are in demand .
Home builders across the country are frantically trying to unload land they had intended for new subdivisions .
And planners are rethinking how they can meet demand for housing .
One such place is Stapleton , on the site of what used to be Denver ’s airport .
Its developer , real estate company Forest City , puts homes within walking distance of schools and stores while linking them to the workplace by public transportation .
Resident Evelyn Baker says Stapleton appeals to a “ cheapskate ” side of her nature that favors towing her offspring about in a trailer attached to her bike over paying for gas for her car .
“ We ’re a family of four with two young kids and the obligatory yellow Lab , but we ’ve managed to get by with one car , ” said Baker , who has lived here since April 2006 .
And , with gas prices above $ 4 a gallon , Baker said her move to Stapleton feels like a smart decision both because of lower day - to - day costs and the durability of her home ’s value .
“ I do feel like my house is retaining its value , and I ’m really excited about that , ” Baker said .
In the suburb of Maricopa , about an hour ’s drive outside Phoenix , residents have a very different feeling .
Built on former corn and cotton fields , the suburb has grown to number 38,000 people from about 1,500 in 2002 , accommodating people who were willing to accept longer commutes in order to get homes at cheaper prices .
These days , Maricopa has been inundated by foreclosures and short sales -- where lenders agree to take a repayment that is lower than the outstanding loan to avoid dealing with a foreclosure , and high gas prices are part of the reason .
“ Gas prices put a strain on people .
The bulk of people that live here have to work and do have to commute , so obviously it adds to their expenses , ” said Bill Wasowicz , a realtor with Fortuna Land & Realty in Maricopa .
The town even launched its own bus service , taking residents to work in central Phoenix and home again for $ 6 , but still homes here are hemorrhaging value .
HERE COMES THE NEIGHBORHOOD
Tracy McKelvey and his wife Jan lived in a similar suburb and used to commute two hours each day to their jobs in Phoenix .
But , a few years ago , they traded in their three - bedroom , two - garage house in the Phoenix valley for a downtown loft .
Both McKelveys now travel to work by scooter and enjoy restaurants , cafes , sports arenas and shops within walking distance of home , taking advantage of the $ 2.3 billion that the country ’s fifth - largest city is spending to build housing , a university campus and a mass transit rail system .
“ We save money on gas .
It ’s a good feeling .
I have n’t sat in a traffic jam for years , ” Tracy McKelvey said .
As people like the McKelveys take action to shorten their commutes , home builders are fleeing the suburbs , too , sometimes selling land at a loss , even the priciest parcels snapped up at the height of the building boom .
Meritage Homes Corp , the 12th - largest U.S. home builder , has pulled out of many places where people are not buying , said spokesman Brent Anderson .
Where developers can’t escape , they ’re offering unprecedented incentives to move inventory .
In May , Michael Crews Development offered to give away a row home valued at $ 400,000 with the purchase of a $ 1.6 million luxury home in the upscale city of Escondido , north of San Diego .
A recent survey of 903 brokers affiliated with national real estate chain Coldwell Banker suggests that pressure is building .
Almost 80 percent of them said higher fuel costs are increasing their clients ’ desire to live in cities .
“ People rejected cities for 30 years or so but now they ’re looking again , ” said John Norquist of Congress for the New Urbanism , a Chicago - based group that promotes walkable development .
Young families , once considered synonymous with suburbs , are increasingly opting to raise urban babies in places like New York .
“ Parents recognize that there are good reasons to live in cities , ” Norquist said .
“ Walkability , convenience , not having to drive kids everywhere .
And gas prices at $ 4.50 a gallon will accelerate that . ”
Even smaller cities are getting in on the act .
Omaha , Nebraska , and Kansas City , Missouri , are among those revitalizing their downtowns .

Mick Cornett , the mayor of Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , said that once the only people who lived in the city ’s downtown were those who were in jail .
“ It ’s a different story today , ” he said .
And retirees who put their empty nests in the suburbs up for sale are increasingly looking at moving into cities .
That shift may get a further boost when the big Baby Boom generation starts turning 65 in 2011 .
Experts like Christopher Leinberger , a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and head of the graduate program in real estate development at the University of Michigan , note that people are now willing to pay a premium to live in the city , a reversal from the last 50 years .
“ These are not the cyclical changes that recessions cause every few years .
These are game - changing structural changes , ” Leinberger said .
“ The market is demanding walkable urban product . ”
The resale value of attached housing , such as condominiums and cooperatives , is appreciating faster than single - family homes , said Arthur Nelson , a director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech .
In regions where housing is losing value , attached homes are losing value at a lower rate than single - family ones .
“ Condos are a much more resilient investment than single - family on the whole , nationwide , ” he said .
Prices are up 5 percent in Washington ’s Georgetown neighborhood , an area of upscale townhomes , and down 30 percent on the city ’s fringe , Leinberger noted .
MIDDLE GROUND
For those who ca n’t afford or do n’t want to live downtown , but ca n’t afford or do n’t want to commute to the suburbs , hybrids like Stapleton are literally a middle ground .
Government and home builders are supporting such communities by expanding rail networks and putting housing within walking distance of train stations , said Sam Zimmerman - Bergman of Reconnecting America , a mass transit advocacy organization .
However , Forest City ’s Ronald Ratner , head of residential development , cautions against overstating the trend , which he says still needs nurturing .
Federal transit spending is n’t sufficient to keep pace with the increase in local demand for transit , said Zimmerman - Bergman , although that could change with the reauthorization of the federal transportation bill next year .
On the local level , municipalities whose budgets have taken a hit due to falling property values are struggling to fund transportation needs .
Another obstacle is a bulky permits and approvals process , which becomes increasingly cumbersome the closer a developer gets to a city , and the difficulty this presents for developers .
“ In homebuilding , one has to work years ahead in terms of approvals , ” said Kira McCarron , vice - president of marketing for luxury builder Toll Brothers Inc .
“ So it is n’t possible for any builder to react on a dime in terms of a trend that presents itself today . ”
But some cities , like Denver , that have either streamlined their review process or provided the necessary transportation infrastructure have found productive partnerships with builders eager to get into hybrid development .
San Mateo , California is another example .
A few years ago , that city moved to wean residents off cars and onto trains by allowing housing near its transit hub , which prompted developer Edward Lipkin of EBL&S Development to turn an old department store into what he calls a village .
Station Park Green , slated for completion in 2009 , will have 600 residential units in a mix of rental , condos and townhouses ; retail including a coffee shop and a small grocer and rail access to San Francisco and San Jose .
“ The idea is to eliminate as many of the car - based necessity trips as possible , ” Lipkin said .
For years , Lipkin was a developer of shopping malls in the classic sprawling suburban style .
Then his experience in San Mateo inspired him to reorient his entire business to development along the lines of Station Park Green .
“ That was the opportunity to participate in what we felt was an emerging trend , ” said Lipkin .
“ We just feel it ’s the future of development in the United States .

Transcript of a speech by Charles Goyette at the Ron Paul Revolution March , Capitol Hill , Washington , D.C. , July 12 , 2008
It is good for one to be free , and we would cherish liberty even if she traveled alone , but she does not .
Because Prosperity and Peace are both the companions of Liberty .
War , on the other hand , the spirit of destruction , is the destroyer of Prosperity and Liberty .
Should any wonder , then , that Americans are losing both their freedom and their well - being ?
We gather together as the vanguard of a movement to reclaim our Liberty , Peace , and Prosperity .
And we come here to Washington to be seen in a place the world watches .
Here surrounded by the monuments that evoke a dim recollection of our beginnings , of the time our founding generation was aflame with love of Liberty .
One can almost still hear the now soft whisper of their words that set our American freedom in motion :
" We hold these truths to be self evident … "
" Life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness … "
" … deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed . "
These are the words that gave life to our ideals ; that set free a nation ; that inspired mankind .
" Secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity . "
" We pledge our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honor . "
But there is more to be seen in this government city than the monuments of our noble past .
For here , too , are the halls of the power - seekers , the vote buyers and the permanent government made up of both Republicans and Democrats that perpetuates itself with welfare and warfare .
These are the mausoleums of waste and bankruptcy .
You marched passed such a monument , the 1.6 million square feet of the Department of Energy building on Independence Avenue .
Look back here on your right , and think back to the roots of the present oil shock .
When we spoke , during the lead - up to Bush 's elective war , about the fear premium this adventure would put on the price of oil , about the massive transfer of wealth from the American people to the governments of Vladimir Putin and Hugo Chavez , and to the petroleum sultans , sheiks , shahs , we received a two word answer : " NEVER MIND ! "
And when we talked about the years of saber rattling and the certainty of oil breaking $ 100 , the two wings of the Washington Party answered in one voice : " SHUT UP , " they explained .
Now while you dig in your front pocket to pay $ 4 a gallon or more to be here today , the Department of Energy you passed on your march from the Washington monument is taking 25 billion dollars a year from your back pocket .
And what does it do with your billions ?
Does it explore the remote and dangerous corners of the earth and discover any oil ?
Does it take enormous risks and suffer substantial losses to locate energy ?
Recover it , refine it , transport it to your neighborhood ?
Just how much gas does it put in your tank for its 25 billion dollars ?
Not a drop !
Now John McCain wants to give you a gas tax break for your summer driving , a few cents a gallon to buy your votes with your own money in November .
But in the meantime , he crosses the country , back and forth and to and fro , beating his chest for another NeoCon war that will send oil to 400 or 500 dollars per barrel .
He 'll have you paying $ 15 dollars a gallon at the Superpumper … if they have any gas to sell …
But you 'll save pennies a gallon this summer .
This is the flim flammery we got from George Bush , who bought his popularity with tax rebate checks of a couple hundred dollars each .
How cheaply the people sold their affection .
And how many times over we have paid at the pump and at the grocery store , and in the value of our savings , with the Bush dollar that has lost at least 40 per cent of its buying power since the checks were put in the mail .
Not to mention that the money to cash those checks had to be borrowed from overseas , so that your little children can be debt slaves to the Chinese when they grow up !
Take note of the overseers of this destruction of the dollar , as you pass the Federal Reserve Building on your way back home .
It is a temple befitting the gods of antiquity .
There sit the enablers of the wars of empire , for without them those wars would not be waged .
Right down there , ironically enough , on Constitution Avenue .
All about us are the palaces of the permanent party in Washington , the whited sepulchers of waste : they 've destroyed the dollar and lied to you about caring for the retirement money you 've sent their way over a lifetime .
It is squandered .
It 's gone .
These are the halls and the homes and the haunts of the foreign meddlers , of foreign aid and foreign wars .
At last count , the Pentagon had over 700 bases in 130 countries .
1.4 million people on active duty ; another 1.4 million in reserve capacities .
Military spending of 1 trillion a year !
Just the Department of Defense Budget of 623 billion dollars is more than all the rest of the world 's war spending combined !
And Barack Obama wants to increase the military .
During the Bush years we have invaded two countries ; gave a silent wink and a nod for the invasion of a third .
And now we are on the brink of a yet another NeoCon war , a new war without authorization from the people 's representatives .
" I have n't made up my mind , " Bush said on the eve of the Iraq War .
As though in America , the people no longer rule ?
Does the Constitution say anything about a " decidifyer " who gets to " decidify " these things ?
It is time to say " No More ! "
The president consults with foreign heads of state about future American wars , but has he consulted you ?
This President is spending $ 400 million to foment war with Iran .
Did your congressman tell you in a newsletter , in a townhall , perhaps in the neighborhood , the grocery store ?
In church ?
It is time to say " No More ! "
The permanent party in the palaces of power , and the halls of waste , is out of control .
It is as though the household staff is in mutiny .
They are peeping toms , illegally spying ever more brazenly on their masters ; they waste the household ’s wealth and savings .
They know no boundaries , but run roughshod hither and yon , alarming the neighbors .
The downstairs servants are stealing the silverware and the upstairs help does n't report it because they share in the plunder .
It 's time for the people to turn them all out .
Not to replace them with more of the same , but to send them all packing .
The people must reclaim management of their own affairs :
We must take charge again of our lives : of our money and medicine and education .
We must reclaim our Liberty , our peace and prosperity .
That means no more foreign wars , no more central banks to finance those wars , no more central planners , no more bailouts and billions for the bankers .
No more worthless , irredeemable paper money , no more foreign aid , no more foreign wars .
No more telling the people how to live , or looting us with lies about trust funds that do n't exist .
No more stealing oil , which is cheaper to buy anyway , no more indebting our children with trillions borrowed overseas , no more telling our elderly where they can and cannot buy their medicine , and what the can and cannot do to relieve their pain .
No more .
No more .
No more .
That is lesson from their failures .
" No more . "
That is the message to take back home today .
" It is time to say no more ! "
Join me .
And spread this Revolution in every city and state in America by saying : " No More ! "
In every town and village in the land we will shout : " No More ! "
On every avenue , street , and cul de sac , free people together with one voice : " No More ! "
And finally , a word to acknowledged our great debt to and gratitude for Ron Paul !
For his long hard fight , for the years in Washington he was marginalized and ignored , for all the times he was the lone vote in Congress , even while the leaders of the Permanent Party were laughing at the Constitution and calling it an anachronism .
For not taking taxpayer paid junkets or spending every office dime he could grab , and for not helping himself to the Congressional pension plan .
For his integrity , decade after decade , in public life .
For his uncommon respect for and knowledge of the Constitution ; for a grasp of economics that could have prevented the deluge that approaches now , and that could see us through it and back on the road to prosperity in short order , if only the people had understood .
But most especially for his civility , his tirelessness , and the inspiration he has been to us all here and millions of others with us today in spirit , who , like us , love Liberty , and want to restore her and her companions , Peace and Prosperity !
God bless Ron Paul !
God bless you !
And God bless our Liberty !

The Best of Charles Goyette
PRINCETON , NJ -- A recent USA Today / Gallup poll finds about two in three Americans concerned that John McCain would pursue policies as president that are too similar to what George W. Bush has pursued .
Nearly half -- 49 % -- say they are " very concerned " about this .
McCain faces a challenge in trying to convince voters to allow him to follow an unpopular president of the same party .
Democratic candidate Barack Obama has attempted to link McCain to Bush by saying that electing McCain would effectively lead to a " third Bush term . "
Although McCain remains competitive in head - to - head matchups with Obama , the poll suggests that McCain may have more work to do to distance himself from Bush .
It is clearly a delicate balancing act for McCain , as Bush remains relatively popular with the Republican base .
While only 28 % of Americans approve of the job Bush is doing as president , a majority of Republicans ( 60 % ) still do .
Bush 's approval rating among current McCain supporters is slightly lower , at 55 % .
Bush is deeply unpopular with Democrats ( only 6 % approve ) , and 9 in 10 Democrats say they are concerned that McCain 's policies would be too similar to those of Bush .
But among independents -- a group to which McCain has demonstrated appeal -- most are concerned about McCain - Bush similarities , including nearly half who are very concerned .
Even one in five Republicans are very concerned about the similarities .
A recent CBS News poll asked registered voters what they thought McCain would do -- continue Bush 's policies , change to more conservative policies , or change to less conservative policies .
A plurality of 43 % believe he would continue Bush 's policies , but more expect some change -- either more conservative ( 21 % ) or less conservative ( 28 % ) policies .
Thus , while most voters express concern about McCain being too much like Bush , most do not necessarily expect this to happen .
While most Democrats ( 65 % ) believe that McCain would generally continue Bush 's policies , only 34 % of independents and 20 % of Republicans do .
Independents are about evenly divided as to whether McCain would be more conservative or less conservative than Bush , while nearly half of Republicans think he would be less conservative .
Obama and " Change "
Obama is running as the " change " candidate , and while that would seem to be the advantageous positioning in an election to replace an unpopular incumbent , there is risk in advocating more change than perhaps Americans would be comfortable with .
To the extent that McCain and the Republican Party can paint Obama as looking to make too great a departure from the status quo , they can make McCain seem like a safe alternative .
The USA Today / Gallup poll asked Americans how concerned they are that Obama would go too far in changing policies that Bush has pursued .
About half say they are concerned , including 30 % who are very concerned .
One in three Americans -- predominantly Democrats -- are not concerned at all .
Most Republicans -- who likely will vote for McCain anyway -- are concerned about Obama making too much of a departure from Bush .
Less than half of independents are , including only 22 % who say they are very concerned ( compared with 47 % of independents who are very concerned about McCain being too similar to Bush ) .
Implications
At this point , Americans seem more concerned about not getting enough change than about getting too much with the next president , which works to Obama 's benefit .
But the campaign has barely begun and Republicans will do their best to make the case that Obama is too inexperienced and too liberal to be trusted ( Obama had the highest liberal voting score of any senator in 2007 , according to the National Journal 's annual report ) .
McCain does have enough disagreements with Bush to perhaps make the argument that he will not represent a third Bush term seem credible .
At the same time , on the major issues such as the economy and Iraq , McCain 's and Bush 's positions are essentially the same .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,625 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted June 15 - 19 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
The questions reported here are based on randomly selected half samples of the entire sample , and have a margin of sampling error of ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

The complaint was filed today in Los Angeles Superior Court .
This really sounds like one of the worst cases of phony - baloney studio accounting , not to mention sheer arrogance , in Hollywood history .
Geez , when is Big Media going to stop this larceny ?
For instance , according to the lawsuit , NBC Uni is claiming that , as of the end of fiscal year 2006 , Quincy M.E. has accumulated over $ 66 million in net losses — this after we all know that the 1976 - 1983 series is a classic shown all over the world even to this day .
Through his Beverly Hills attorneys Johnson & Johnson [ UPDATE :
This firm and another are representing me in a class action lawsuit related to a personal matter .
I forgot to disclose that when I wrote this post on a busy news day .
I apologize for the omission . ]
Klugman just gave this statement to me : “ I do n’t want their money .
I want my money .
I ca n’t believe they ’ve collected over $ 250 million dollars and they say they are still in the hole .
I have 28 % of the net and they wo n’t even give me a copy of my contract .
I worked for them for almost 8 years .
I got up at 4 o’clock in the morning .
I would rewrite .
I did a ton of work .
It ’s on every day .
I have n’t gotten a penny for years . ”
Worse , the lawsuit claims that when Klugman asked to see his paperwork with NBC Uni , the network and studio “ have refused to give Plaintiffs a copy of the contract ” .
So on June 21 , 2007 , Klugman ’s attorney wrote a letter to NBC Uni requesting “ a copy of any and all contracts pertaining to Klugman and Quincy M.E. ” On September 26 , 2007 , NBC Uni responded that it ’s “ unable to comply with your request … because it is NBC Universal ’s policy not to provide copies of talent contracts or other confidential documents . ”
The lawsuit notes that , under the terms of the NBC Uni contract , Klugman and his company Sweater Productions are entitled to a “ Participant Share ” of 25 % of all “ net profits ” attributable to Quincy M.E.
But NBC is required to “ properly account ” for the net profits to Sweater / Klugman which has a right to audit the records of NBC Uni if a dispute arises .
On March 5 , 2008 , Klugman ’s attorney gave notice to NBC Uni of Klugman ’s intent to audit the TV series .
His attacks between 2001 and 2002 allegedly shut down the US Army district responsible for protecting Washington , and cleared logs from computers at the Naval Weapons Station Earle in New Jersey that tracks the location and battle - readiness of navy ships .
That last attack knocked out the station 's entire network of 300 computers .
NASA and privately owned computers were also damaged , prosecutors said , putting the total cost of his online activities at $ US900,000 .
At the time of his indictment , US prosecutor Paul McNulty said McKinnon pulled off " the biggest hack of military computers ever - at least ever detected " .
In his defence , McKinnon , known online as SOLO , said he was trying to expose security weaknesses and uncover evidence of UFOs .
" I was a man obsessed , " McKinnon wrote on The Guardian newspaper 's website last year , describing a year spent trying to break into US military systems : eight hours a day at a computer in his girlfriend 's aunt 's house while unkempt , drinking beer and smoking marijuana .
In interviews , he claimed that his hacking uncovered photographic proof of alien spacecraft and the names and ranks of " non-terrestrial officers " .
Prosecutors accuse him of deliberately trying to intimidate the US Government by tearing through its networks .
They pointed to a note written by McKinnon - and left on an army computer - attacking US foreign policy as " akin to government - sponsored terrorism " .
" It was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand - down on September 11 last year , " he wrote .
" I am SOLO .
I will continue to disrupt at the highest levels . "
McKinnon was caught in 2002 after some of the software used in the attacks was traced to his girlfriend 's email account .
The US sought his extradition , a move his lawyer Claire Anderson claimed today was motivated by the Government 's desire to " make an example " of a man who humbled officials in Washington by hacking into their systems using off - the - shelf office software and a dial - up modem .
Aspects of American cyber-security had been shown up as " really shameful , " with some computers not even password - protected , said Graham Cluley , a security consultant with Sophos PLC .
He said the United States appeared to be pursuing McKinnon in an effort to flexing its legal muscle to the hacking community , which has watched the case with interest .
" The overriding message is : you should n't mess with American government and military computers , particularly right after September 11 , " Cluley said .
McKinnon 's lawyers had hoped to hold any trial in Britain , saying he could be dragged before a military tribunal or even end up at the Guantanamo Bay military prison camp in Cuba .
Should McKinnon be extradited , he would face trial in Virginia and New Jersey on eight charges of computer fraud .
Each charge potentially carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and $ US250,000 in fines .
However , US sentencing guidelines would probably recommend a much lighter sentence .

The gaming industry took in $ 18.85 billion during 2007 , a figure that trumps the $ 16 billion in DVD sales earned by the movie industry in that same year , reports Gamespot .
While this is the first year that gaming has eclipsed DVD sales , the industry continues a trend of topping movie theater revenues ( $ 9.6 billion in 2007 ) .
Still , the gaming industry does n't quite trump Hollywood overall .
Between theater revenue , DVD sales and DVD rentals , the movie industry brought in nearly $ 33 billion – a figure that gaming 's single retail avenue simply can't match .

But surely women ’s economic independence is worth it ?
Oy .
Wrong again .
Here Gilbert launches into an exhaustive and rather depressing analysis of how far we ’ve come since the 1970s .
It ’s a long way , baby … if chiefly in terms of the accessibility of appliances .
Seventies luxuries — air conditioners and clothes dryers — are of course the new millennium ’s necessities .
Although more than half of all households were hanging their clothes on a line or schlepping them to a laundromat in 1971 , for instance , by 2001 , the majority of even poor households owned dryers .
And now we all require goodies like cell phones and 900 channels of cable unheard - of 30 years ago — by 2001 , eight out of 10 low - income households owned VCRs / DVD players .
No question , getting moms a paycheck has been very good for the U.S. consumer - electronics market , not to mention fast - food vendors , child - care providers , and — despite all those clothes dryers — the dry- cleaning industry .
However , while the economy benefits , for working - class families with young children , so much of a second income is eaten up by child care and taxes and other costs related to holding down a job that , after purchasing the microwave — now necessary to produce hot meals in the 10 minutes left for food preparation — and the de rigueur DVD player , the second wage earner might as well have stayed at home .
Gilbert concludes , then , that financial need is not the force behind women ’s shift in the past 50 years from work in the home to work in the market­place ; rather , it is the desires of those who have made out like bandits in this new order , the tiny minority ( 3.5 percent in 2003 ) of women who earn $ 75,000 or more .
Members of this occupational elite have created a host of cultural norms by which their far less privileged sisters — who , again , make up the vast majority of working women — feel they must abide .
For Hirsh­man ’s doctors , lawyers , judges , and professors , work has been terrific , so it ’s no wonder they ’ve advocated social change , imposing on society between the 1960s and the mid-1990s “ new expectations about modern life , self - fulfillment , and the joys of work outside the home . ”
They ’ve gotten results : fathers in the U.S. now spend more time with their children and do more of the household tasks than their counterparts did , and Congress and employers both have made market - friendly provisions , such as parental leave , designed to encourage mothers of young children to take up paid employment .
The society that has emerged , in which equality between men and women supersedes equality between social classes , may therefore be seen as “ the triumph of feminism over socialism . ”
Never mind the social costs , we now have an army of consumers and a vast labor pool — what could be more market - friendly ?
Indeed , since the late 1990s , so - called family - friendly policies in Europe have been , as the Oxford sociologist Jane Lewis observes , “ explicitly linked to the promotion of women ’s employment in order to further the economic growth and competition agenda . ”
Women have achieved the freedom to join men on a more or less equal footing in the market­place , which strengthens the notion that the only thing ultimately of value is one ’s ability to turn a buck .
The triumph of feminism , Gilbert reminds us ( echoing those socially conservative men of the left , George Orwell and Christopher Lasch ) , has served the culture of capitalism .
As he sums up the whole darn tangle :
The capitalist ethos underrates the economic value and social utility of domestic labor in family life , particularly during the early years of childhood ; the prevailing expectations of gender feminists place too high a value on the social and psychological satisfactions of work ; and the typical package of family - friendly benefits delivered by the state creates incentives that essentially reinforce the devaluations of motherhood prompted by the capitalist ethos and feminist expectations .
All of which brings us , finally , to Sweden .
( And does n’t a shot of raspberry Absolut sound good at this point ? )
The debate about mothers and work : it always ends — does n’t it ? — with Sweden .
Oh , if America could only be like Sweden — such a humane society , with its free day care for working mothers and its government subsidies of up to $ 11,900 per child per year .
The problem ?
One hates to be Mrs. Red-State Republican Bringdown , but yes … the taxes .
Currently , the top marginal income - tax rate in Sweden is nearly 60 percent ( down from its peak in 1979 of 87 percent ) .
Government spending amounts to more than half of Sweden ’s GDP .
( And it does n’t all go to children , given Sweden ’s low fertility rate . )
On the upside , government spending creates jobs : from 1970 to 1990 , a whopping 75 percent of Swedish jobs created were in the public sector … providing social welfare services … almost all of which were filled by women .
Uh-oh .
In short , as Gilbert points out , because of the 40 percent tax rate on her husband ’s job , a new mother may be forced to take that second , highly taxed job to supplement the family ’s finances ; in other words , she leaves her toddlers behind from eight to five ( in that convenient universal day care ) so she can go take care of other people ’s toddlers or empty the bedpans of elderly strangers .
( As Alan Wolfe has pointed out , “ the Scandinavian welfare states which express so well a sense of obligation to distant strangers , are beginning to make it more difficult to express a sense of obligation to those with whom one shares family ties . ” )

A comment on the previous entry about how builtins are atomic asked a really good question :
Is there actually a guarantee in CPython that they 're atomic , or is that a side - effect of implementation ?
There are two answers , at least in my opinion .
The legalistic answer is that there is no guarantee at all , because there 's nothing in the documentation .
But this is because the CPython documentation does n't talk about concurrency issues at all ; even the thread module documentation does n't really say anything .
In theory you can go from ' the documentation does n't promise anything ' to ' the documentation allows an implementation to do anything if you do n't explicitly lock ' .
However , this is robot logic , not human logic ; the real truth is that threading is not really a core Python feature ( even today it is in the ' optional operating system ' modules section ) , and the documentation reflects that .
I maintain that the practical answer is that it is guaranteed , at least for CPython , despite the lack of explicit documentation to that effect .
Whether legalistic purists like it or not , in practice if you do not document something and then expose a single implementation to people , that implementation 's long standing behavior becomes implicit documentation .
This is especially so if the behavior is quite useful and the alternatives painful .
Or in short : it 's guaranteed because there 's no documentation about it either way and that 's how CPython has always behaved .
And it 's really handy .
And as a pragmatic matter , anything that wants to be compatible with existing CPython threaded code is going to have to mimic this behavior ( given Python 3 K , this is less reassuring than it seems ) .
However , IronPython , Jython , and any other similar projects out there may be not all that interested in supporting existing CPython threaded code ; I suspect that they feel that they have better native threading models that you should use instead .
( Although for what it is worth IronPython does not document any differences in what is and is n't atomic for basic types in their list of differences between IronPython and CPython . )
( This is one of those entries that is going to get me pilloried . )
Barack Obama is recruiting senior staff to a new unit which will combat virulent rumour campaigns on the internet that threaten to cost him votes in the presidential election against John McCain .
The unit is part of a huge expansion of Obama 's campaign team as he shifts from the Democratic nomination race to the campaign for November 's election .
As well as the rumour - mongering problem , units are being set up to deal with other perceived vulnerable points , including off - the - cuff remarks by his wife Michelle .
McCain 's wife , Cindy , questioned Michelle 's patriotism in February after she said : " For the first time in my adult life , I am proud of my country . "
Brooks Jackson , director of the Washington - based FactCheck.org , an independent academic organisation set up in 2003 to monitor the factual accuracy of statements made in elections , said yesterday there had been false rumours on the internet about George Bush and John Kerry in the 2004 election .
" With Obama , it is particularly vicious , " Jackson said .
He added that one of the most persistent is that Obama , a Christian , is " some kind of Muslim Manchurian candidate , planted by Islamic fundamentalists to betray the country and it is very widespread " .
McCain too suffers from rumours on the internet , mainly from former Vietnam veterans disputing his account of his five - and - a - half years in a Hanoi prisoner - of - war camp .
Obama yesterday began a three - week campaign through potential swing states in which he will focus on concerns about job losses , collapsing house prices and soaring petrol costs .
McCain , short of funds compared with Obama , held fund - raising events .
The latest Gallup poll nationwide puts Obama on 46 % against McCain 's 44 % .
CBS has Obama on 48 % and McCain on 42 % .
Obama is ahead in the key swing states of Ohio and Pennsylvania , while McCain leads in Florida .
In Virginia , normally a state Republicans can rely on and Obama is targeting , McCain is only 1 % ahead .
Obama delivered his speech in Raleigh , North Carolina , which he has only an outside chance of taking , but his campaign team said he wants to send a message he is going to compete in all 50 states , not just the swing ones .
Obama paid homage to McCain as an American war hero and acknowledged that the two shared many of the same goals such as tackling climate change .
But Obama said the two had fundamentally different views of how to deal with the economy .
Reflecting Obama 's strategy of tying McCain to the unpopular Bush , Obama said : " For all his talk of independence , the centrepiece of his economic plan amounts to a full - throated endorsement of George Bush 's policies . "
Can mental training improve your intelligence ?
No video game or mental puzzle has convincingly been shown to work .
But now a group of neuropsychologists claims it has found a task that can add points to a person ’s IQ – and the harder you train , they say , the more you gain .
So - called “ fluid intelligence ” , or Gf , is the ability to reason , solve new problems and think in the abstract .
It correlates with professional and educational success and it appears to be largely genetic .
Past attempts to boost
Gf have suggested that , although by training you can achieve great gains on the specific training task itself , those gains do n’t transfer to other tasks .
Now Susanne Jaeggi at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor , US , and her colleagues say that is not true .
Advertisement
They invited 70 healthy adults to participate in a challenging training exercise known as the “ dual n- back ” task .
Daily training
The exercise involves tracking small squares on a screen that pop into a new location every three seconds .
Volunteers have to press a button when the current location is a duplicate of two views earlier .
At the same time , consonants are played through headphones and a button is pressed if the letter is the same as that heard two “ plays ” earlier .
If participants perform well , the interval to be tracked ( n ) increases to three or more stages earlier .
Jaeggi ’s volunteers were trained daily for about 20 minutes for either 8 , 12 , 17 or 19 days ( with weekends off ) .
They were given IQ tests both before and after the training .
The researchers found that the IQ of trained individuals increased significantly more than controls – and that the more training people got , the higher the score .
Small study
“ It definitely challenges the old opinions , ” says Jaeggi .
She thinks their training regimen succeeded where others failed largely because it remained challenging .
Also , because it was tailor - made to the individual , people were never able to go on autopilot .
Not everyone is impressed .
Robert Plomin , at the Institute of Psychiatry in London , says that no serious intelligence researchers consider Gf “ immutable ” , as the paper suggests .
“ There is no contradiction at all between substantial heritability and improvement of performance , ” he says .
“ What is school about ? ”
Plomin says what is more interesting is how much an individual can profit from training .
He complains , however , that the researchers did not really address this in the research , and that the study , with nine subjects in each of four training conditions , is much too small to detect it .

What you are witnessing is the acceleration of a complete systemic breakdown of the US and world financial systems and economies .
It is happening right before your eyes .
It is in your face .
The Scylla and Charibdis of real estate finance , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which are currently in possession of , or have insured , over 5 trillion dollars worth of mortgages , a good portion of which are nothing but toxic waste , have imploded and will now be nationalized in the most egregious example of moral hazard in the history of the world .
As this socialism for the rich transpires , IndyMac Bank has gone up in smoke .
This is the second largest bank failure in US history and the largest such failure in over 23 years .
Adding insult to injury , 10 % to 20 % of the FDIC 's insurance reserves have just gone up in smoke along with IndyMac just as the hundreds , and what may eventually turn out to be thousands , of bank failures that are anticipated get started in earnest .
What does that leave for future failures if only one bank failure wipes out a fifth of the FDIC 's reserves ?
Next up on the chopping block may be Downey , First Federal , Wachovia and Washington Mutual , which are not small fry by any means .
Mattresses and freezers may soon be the savings vehicles of choice for those who can't afford a home safety vault as Depression Era mentality becomes the psychology du jour .
If you keep more than $ 100,000 in any bank account , or if you keep anything of value in a safe deposit box at any type of bank whatsoever , you are simply an idiot .
You should use any cash you now have to pay off debt , including credit cards , car loans and mortgages .
Then your cash becomes someone else 's problem .
Trying to keep loans open so you can pay them with inflated dollars does n't work when your dollars get vaporized by losses suffered by profligate banks or you lose your job due to the implosion of our economy , which , by the way , is a lock .
Better to take money earning one or two percent and apply them to debts bearing much higher rates .
Keep your emergency cash at home .
The excess should be invested in gold and silver of which you take physical possession .
Swiss government bonds denominated in Swiss francs are cheap to buy and can cover your larger blocks of cash if you are sufficiently affluent .
We have told you repeatedly that the Illuminists care only about the suppression of precious metals and the viability of the bond market , which is their source of power , and the current proposed bailout of the twin titans of complete and utter financial death and destruction is the penultimate proof of our assertion .
These titans of disaster will not be reformed , but instead our government plans to give them equity injections in the form of preferred stock to be " owned " by you the taxpayers through your Treasury Department and / or loans through the Fed 's discount window to be supported by US treasuries as collateral .
This is supposedly a temporary arrangement of 18 months , but come on , so were the Fed 's various facilities for the bailout of the bankster fraudsters , which will be extended indefinitely or at least until the system implodes .
The government is not fooling anyone with such foolish drivel and poppycock , as demonstrated by default swaps on US government debt , which more than doubled from 9 to 20 basis points after the announcements by Hanky Panky and Buck - Busting Ben , something which has never happened before in our entire financial history .
Yields on treasuries increased even as people were fleeing the stock markets to buy those treasuries , with the Dow tumbling to as low as 10,827.71 on Tuesday before getting yet another miracle rally from the PPT .
Normally , flight to treasuries drives yields down , but not this time .
Hanky Panky Paulson says these supposedly temporary forms of relief have been set up in advance so he can have a bazooka instead of a squirt gun , thereby giving the market assurance against the collapse of Fannie and Freddie by heading off market panic , but the only bazooka we see is the one being pointed at the US taxpayer who will be taxed and inflated into oblivion as a result .
This is nothing less than doomsday for the US middle class , the final rip - off and destruction of both their retirement plans and real estate through hyperinflation , dollar destruction , and the eventual destruction of the real estate markets when the twin titans of financial devastation finally implode and the taxpayers are left holding the bill .
If they did n't think they needed this relief in earnest , it would not have been forthcoming !
They are only delaying the inevitable .
Who are the winners and the losers in this scenario ?
It should be pretty clear that Scylla 's and Charbdis 's stockholders are the losers , and that eventually their stock will be diluted to mere pennies per share by gargantuan government equity injections as losses mount geometrically , basically rendering Fannie and Freddie stock either worthless or nearly so .
The big winners are obviously the bondholders of Fannie and Freddie debt , who get a nice bailout like the bondholders of Bear Stearns when they should be taking huge losses for under - pricing what should have been obvious and monumental risk in an organization leveraged at anywhere from 60 to 1 to 200 to 1 , which is the type of leverage normally reserved for suicidal madmen and psychopaths .
And who are the bondholders ?
Gee , what a coincidence , as it turns out they are central banks around the world , including those in the US , China and Japan , which each own hundreds of billions in both of the twin titans of financial murder and mayhem .
As we said , all the Illuminists care about is the support and viability of the bond markets .
The stock markets along with 300 million US citizens can drop off into a bottomless pit and into the fires of hell for all they care .
Are n't you just brimming with excitement at the thought of becoming an unwilling " preferred " shareholder in a toxic waste , real estate Ponzi - scheme leveraged at 200 to 1 ?!
And how will the equity injections be funded for this preferred stock purchase , and where will the collateral for the Fed loans come from ?
Why , they will come from " brandy new " treasuries created out of thin air by the US Treasury that will then be handed over to the Fed .
In the case of the equity injections , these treasuries will be immediately monetized in order to boost Fannie 's and Freddie 's capital positions , leading to further and immediate aggravation of what is now already hyperinflation and further undermining the dollar .
And what will happen to all the treasuries that were created out of nothing to serve as collateral for the Fed 's loans to Scylla and Charibdis ?
These treasuries will be monetized to cover losses as they accrue , losses which will occur rapidly and geometrically as our economy and real estate markets implode .
Another possibility is that these treasuries might be exchanged for toxic waste held by the various bankster fraudsters through the Fed 's Term Securities Lending Facility for primary dealers and / or its Term Securities Auction Facility for investment banks and brokerage houses .
Now would n't that be the ultimate in slime - ball financing if the Fed used Fannie 's and Freddie 's collateral as if these treasuries were part of the Fed 's general collateral ?
Hey Congress , better jump on that one - and we mean pronto !
You must not allow these reprobates and sociopaths to steer our country in this direction .
Fannie and Freddie , like the Wall Street bankster fraudsters , must be allowed to fail , and their various shareholders and bondholders must suffer the consequences .
Otherwise , we have only been pretending to have markets that are run on capitalist principles .
What Paulson and Bernanke are proposing is the next step toward an evil , corporatist , fascist system of government which consists primarily of governmental partnerships with elitist transnational conglomerates where moral hazard is the market mantra , a system which would have made Hitler and Mussolini green with envy .
The Illuminati want to consolidate their power by bailing those they want to survive , and by allowing those they want to destroy to fail .
The failures which they allow to happen will be absorbed by surviving elitist companies , consolidating their power into fewer and fewer entities for easier and tighter control over resources and production .
The Illuminati also want a far greater grant and centralization of regulatory power in the Fed , or in any successor organization , which they might create if they decide to kill off the Fed with all the toxic waste from Fannie , Freddie and the Wall Street fraudsters .
Any such replacement organization will be a super entity that makes the Fed look like a paragon of virtue , and the excuse given for its creation will be a cessation to all the corruption , turmoil and abuse of which the owners of the Fed , or of the new super entity , have themselves been the main cause .
This is the Hegelian Dialectic on steroids .
Create the problem and suggest the solution .
And if the solution suggested is not desired by the people , stuff it down their throats anyway but whatever cunning and deceit is necessary in true Machiavellian fashion .
Everyone should listen to Jimmy Roger ’s latest lambasting of the US government and the Fed regarding the Fannie - Freddie bailout and the bank failures .
He is the only source of truth in the fane - stream media .
He is like a breath of fresh air in an arena full of nothing but hot air , and we commend him for boldly speaking the truth .
How much longer he will be allowed to make such television commentaries is hard to say , but the longer the better .
Well , all this excitement has sent gold and silver to much higher levels as we predicted , and now the cartel is back to their old tricks as they clutch their chests and reach for their nitroglycerine pills .
Up go gold and silver as the dollar crashes , and just like clockwork , the yen goes ballistic and oil nosedives .
The liquidity drains are now wide open as the yen has been strengthened since early last Friday by 3 yen per dollar and by 3.5 yen per euro .
Protective derivatives such as stock index puts , yen calls and oil shorts that we have recommended are now doing their stuff again to keep the specs from having to liquidate their metals to meet margin calls on carry trade positions .
Oil has been blasted big time as the Illuminist banks have been forced to give up some of their speculative gains to hit precious metals , which is JOB ONE at the Fed and for the cartel .
It would be interesting to see whether any of these banks acquired a greater short position in oil just before the takedown .
Monday 's sell - off is now giving the dollar some support as is cheaper oil , and the markets are rallying on Tuesday due to the two big drops in oil prices over the past two days as well as huge boosts from the PPT and " massaged " balance sheets that were better than expected for Wells Fargo .
This wo n't last , and the dollar is headed for 67 - 68 after breaking 72 over the past two days .
Support at 72 cannot go on in the face of 1.8 % monthly PPI ( 21.6 % annualized ) , 1.1 % CPI ( 13.2 % annualized ) , nationalizations of Fannie and Freddie and bank failures such as IndyMac , which is just the beginning .
Get ready for some more wild action as the undisputed King of Currencies reigns supreme while economies implode around the world and threats of war and conflict continue to abound .

Primordial black holes are remnants of the Big Bang and they are predicted to be knocking around in our universe right now .
If they were 1012kg or bigger at the time of creation , they have enough mass to have survived constant evaporation from Hawking radiation over the 14 billion years since the beginning of the cosmos .
But what happens when the tiny black hole evaporates so small that it becomes so tightly wrapped around the structure of a fifth dimension ( other than the “ normal ” three spatial dimensions and one time dimension ) ?
Well , the black hole will explosively show itself , much like an elastic band snapping , emitting energy .
These final moments will signify that the primordial black hole has died .
What makes this exciting is that researchers believe they can detect these events as spikes of radio wave emissions and the hunt has already begun …
Publications about primordial black holes have been very popular in recent years .
There is the possibility that these ancient singularities are very common in the Universe , but as they are predicted to be quite small , their effect on local space is n’t likely to be very observable ( unlike younger , super - massive black holes at the centre of galaxies or the stellar black holes remaining after supernovae ) .
However , they could be quite mischievous .
Some primordial black hole antics include kicking around asteroids if they pass through the solar system , blasting through the Earth at high velocity , or even getting stuck inside a planet , slowly eating up material like a planetary parasite .
But say if these big bang relics never come near the Earth and we never see their effect on Earth ( a relief , we can do without a primordial black hole playing billiards with near Earth asteroids or the threat of a mini black hole punching through the planet ! ) ?
How are we ever going to observe these theoretical singularities ?
Now , the ultimate observatory has been realized , but it measures a fairly observable cosmic emission : radio waves .
The Eight - meter - wavelength Transient Array ( ETA ) run by Virginia Tech Departments of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Physics , and the Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute ( PARI ) , is currently taking high cadence radio wave observations and has been doing so for the past few months .
This basic - looking antenna system , in fields in Montgomery County and North Carolina , could receive emissions in the 29 - 47 MHz frequencies , giving researchers a unique opportunity to see primordial black holes as they die .
Interestingly , if their predictions are correct , this could provide evidence for the existence of a fifth dimension , a dimension operating at scales of billionths of a nanometer .
If this exotic emission can be received , and if it is corroborated by both antennae , this could be evidenceÂ of the string theory prediction that there are more dimensions than the four we currently understand .
“ The idea we ’re exploring is that the universe has an imperceptibly small dimension ( about one billionth of a nanometer ) in addition to the four that we know currently .
This extra dimension would be curled up , in a state similar to that of the entire universe at the time of the Big Bang . ” – Michael Kavic , project investigator .
As black holes are wrapped around this predicted fifth dimension , as they slowly evaporate and lose mass , eventually primordial black holes will be so stressed and stretched around the fifth dimension that the black hole will die , blasting out emissions in radio wave frequencies .
“ String theory requires extra dimensions to be a consistent theory .
String theory suggests a minimum of 10 dimensions , but weâ€ ™re only considering models with one extra dimension . ” – Kavic
When the Large Hadron Collider goes online in May , it is hoped that the high energies generated may produce mini- black holes ( amongst other cool things ) where research can be done to look for the string theory extra dimensions .
But the Eight - meter - wavelength Transient Array looking for the death of “ naturally occurring ” primordial black holes is a far less costly endeavour and may achieve the same goal .
Here ’s an article on a theory that there could be 10 dimensions .

We really studied this video with a close eye , because it does not make any sense in a space v. time kind of way .
Here 's the set up , a sleek , long bullet of a radio controlled car powered by nitromethane , attached at the hip by a cable to a central spike and running around a circular track .
Odd certainly , but you can't argue with the results .
You can watch the effect of centripetal force elongate the wire as the speed increases .
We 're totally on board till about till about the 55 second mark — that 's when things just get ridiculous .
And yet the flag waves normally , the bugs fly around at the same speed and there is no evidence of accelerated video shenanigans .
Wow , that 's fast .

“ In the United States of America there is a hidden government about which you know nothing . ”
So begins a revealing television exposé aired by CNN in 1991 .
The hour - long Special Assignment presented the findings of a yearlong CNN investigation into the ultra-secretive Continuity of Government ( COG ) program , commonly referred to as the “ doomsday government ” or the “ shadow government ” .
The COG program was originally designed in the 1950s to ensure the survival of the federal government in the event of a nuclear attack .
The highly secretive emergency plans were substantially upgraded during the 1980s and have become a focus point of the current administration , particularly since the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
The COG program , which until recent years was believed to be reserved for nuclear disasters , was officially activated for the first time during the 9/11 attacks .
The program , according to the most recent reports , was never completely shut down .
Portions of the “ shadow government ” are presumably still operating to this day .
Recent efforts to reform and expand the emergency protocols , according to the best available reports , have been led by Vice President Dick Cheney , who played a major role in the COG program during the Reagan Administration .
The underground program is historically run out of the office of the Vice President through a clandestine agency , identified by CNN as the National Program Office ( NPO ) .
In 1991 , CNN found the Continuity of Government program and National Program Office to be rife with waste , fraud , and abuse .
The CNN report also disclosed the existence of a secret succession plan that would allow individuals outside of government to take positions of power in the event of a national emergency .
According to the traditional legal line of succession , should the President of the United States be killed or incapacitated the Vice President will take his place , followed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives , the President pro tempore of the Senate , the Secretary of State , all the way down to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the most recently added Secretary of Homeland Security .
According to CNN , however , the COG program maintains its own “ top secret ” succession plan , known only to a few select individuals .
Once activated , the alternative succession plan , known officially as the Presidential Successor Support System , or PS3 , would suspend the traditional line of succession and allow a small group of officials to appoint a new government .
CNN revealed the names of several individuals that could assume power should the plan be put into effect .
These included current Vice President Dick Cheney , former White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker , former CIA Director Richard Helms , former ambassador and National Security Council member Jeane Kirkpatrick , former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director James Schlesinger , former Attorney General and National Security Council member Edwin Meese , former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh , and the late former congressman Tip O’Neill .
“ In the event of disaster , ” CNN reported , “ one of them could become president . ”
Critics with knowledge of the program said the secret plans violated the Constitution .
“ When you compare this program with the Constitution , ” one high - level government official said , “ the two do n’t match up . ”
The COG plans , according to this source , “ could put the American system of checks and balances in the deep freeze . ”
William Van Alstyne , a constitutional scholar from Duke University , said the program ’s secrecy undermined its credibility .
“ If no one knows in advance what the line of succession is meant to be , ” he noted , “ then almost by hypothesis no one will have any reason to believe that those who claim to be exercising that authority in fact possess it . ”
T- Mobile USA , Verizon Wireless say they are not participating in NSA phone - records projectBy Heather Forsgren WeaverMay 12 , 2006WASHINGTON — T - Mobile USA Inc. and Verizon Wireless said they did not participate in a data - mining operation run by the National Security Agency that collects phone records and looks for trends that would indicate terrorist activities .
The NSA phone - records operation , first reported by USA Today Thursday , comes on the heels of revelations that telecommunications customer call records are being sold over the Internet .
Telcos , especially mobile - phone carriers , spent the winter assuring the public , federal regulators and Capitol Hill that they do protect customer call records and that those who pretext — pretending to be a customer to obtain call records — should be the targets of any reforms .
Unlike the customer call records scandal , which erupted after a CBS Evening News report in January , the NSA program appears to only concern telephone numbers and not the associated names and addresses , and the wireless location when the call was made or received .
However , many critics complained that crosschecking the phone numbers with other publicly available databases is easy .
It is unclear whether the NSA database makes use of these other publicly available resources .
USA Today said Verizon Communications Inc. was involved in the program but Debra Lewis , spokeswoman for Verizon Wireless , said the wireless carrier is not involved .
T- Mobile USA , which is owned by German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom AG , said it is not participating .
“ T- Mobile is not a participant in any NSA program for warrantless surveillance and acquisition of call records , and T - Mobile has not provided any such access to communications or customer records , ” said Peter Dobrow , T - Mobile USA spokesman .
Cingular Wireless L.L.C. and Sprint Nextel Corp. both declined comment but stressed their commitment to customer privacy .
Cingular is owned by AT&T Inc. and BellSouth Corp .
Both of these companies were mentioned by USA Today as participants in the program .
The only Bell company to not participate is Qwest Communications International Inc .
Qwest does not have its own wireless licenses but resells wireless service using Sprint Nextel CDMA network in Qwest ’s 14 - state territory .
Capitol
Hill was not pleased about the report of the NSA program .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) said he plans to hold a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee , which he chairs , with the telephone companies as the star witnesses .
The revelation of another NSA domestic spying program could complicate matters for General Michael Hayden who next week is scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee for his confirmation hearing to be the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency .
Hayden led the NSA from 1999 to 2005 .
The data mining is believed to have started in the wake of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Hayden is also considered the architect of another program where the NSA listens into phone calls of Americans with suspected terrorist ties without first obtaining a warrant .
This wiretap program was reported by the New York Times in December .
Recently , the Times won a Pulitzer Prize for the story , which it held for more than a year at the White House ’s request .

When the Buddhas of Bamiyan were carved out of the mountainside , the Roman Empire still held sway .
They towered over a rich valley in what is now central Afghanistan , where caravans of traders would stop and rest on the Silk Road as they transported goods between east and west .
For centuries the two huge statues stood guard over Bamiyan .
But in 2001 , just months before they were forced from power , the Taleban dynamited what they considered un -Islamic representations of the human form .
Today all that remains are the recesses where they stood , and the labyrinth of fragile caves surrounding them .
Iconic art Today there is n't even a paved road connecting the valley to Kabul , but yet inside the caves are a reminder of Bamiyan 's past wealth and glory and a new claim to fame that could put the province back on the map .
Inside those caves the steep , narrow steps are crumbling , there are cracks in the mud tunnels carved into the mountainside , and still visible high in the echoing chambers are pieces of Buddhist iconic art which are now thought to be the oldest oil paintings in the world .
Only a few fragments of the ancient paintings remain
Japanese , European and American scientists restoring the cave murals dating back to around 650 AD , discovered oil was used in the paint .
Yoko Taniguchi , one of the Japanese experts working on the caves , told reporters this is the earliest known use of this technique in the history of art .
She said it was previously thought the technique originated in Europe during the Renaissance , eight centuries later .
But wandering through the Buddhist temples carved out of the rock , there is little left of the murals destroyed in the last 30 years of war after surviving for centuries .
A tourist guidebook to Afghanistan written in the 1960s and 70s by Nancy Dupree , a famous traveller who dedicated much of her life to the country , gave an account of the artwork as it was then .
Fragments
" The rest of the hall is elaborately decorated in a varied palette of burnt sienna , green , lapis lazuli blue , and yellow ochre depicting flowers , trees , stylised floral sprays , cornucopias and figures of kneeling worshipers , " she wrote .
" A series of Buddhas dressed in sombre - hued maroon robes and framed with aureoles against an azure background walk on lotus pads set among flowers . "
Most paintings have heads and hands missing
There 's little evidence of this today apart from a few scraps of colour and detail here and there , but there are isolated caves higher up the mountain , impossible to get to without a rope , where some of the best examples still survive .
A combination of the vibration from artillery shells , the Taleban chiselling away the depictions of faces and hands , and looting put paid to most of the paintings .
But there are enough fragments left to give a hint of what it must have been like .
The views from the caves looking out over the valley are stunning and there is another twist to the story of the Buddhas of Bamiyan .
A Buddhist pilgrim wrote around the time the paintings were finished in the mid seventh century of the amazing statues - but he described three .
According to his account , the third reclining Buddha was a 1,000 feet long and lay on the valley floor .
It would be remarkable if it was buried beneath the river sediment and two teams of archaeologists , one from France another from Japan , are in a race to find it .
It sounds like an Indiana Jones film , but there have been many interesting archaeological discoveries in Bamiyan and this beautiful valley may not yet have revealed all its secrets .

Will Johnny Depp Play Tommy Lee in Biopic ?
Well that is exactly what Motley Crue drummeris hoping for .
Lee called actorthe " best actor ever " and wants Depp to portray him in a biopic based on Motley Crue 's memoir The Dirt .
Details of the movie sound like we will get to see the one month marriage Tommy had with Elaine Irwin Bergen and his marriages to Heather Locklear and Pamela Anderson .
He will also bring us into his experience of finding out he has hepatitis C and what it was like going to prison for kicking Pamela while she was holding their son Dylan .
The finer details of the film - such as producer , director and actors , are being worked out now .

From colorful hot dog stands and front - porch grilling to car dealerships and fireworks — once again the people celebrate July 4th .
The media will join the festivities and will air documentaries about the founding of the country , its struggles during the revolutionary war , the adoption of the Constitution and the various leaders that inspired a country to fight for its freedom .
Journalists and pundits shall hold hands and sing their praises to the gods state .
The mainstream , hailing from its intellectually void ivory tower will no doubt offer hosannas to our overlords .
In the meantime , the message of freedom is nowhere to be seen .
Indeed , quite the opposite tends to happen .
What follows are just a few of the July 4th lies and errors that we are supposed to blindly accept :
The military is glorious , its heroes heroic , and our support is patriotic
Freedom is about authority
The police keep us safe and have a duty to protect us
We are better off now than when the war on drugs started decades ago
Continually increasing prices is a product of the market and thus the central bank must control credit and the money supply
With proper reform , government can become efficient , especially if we elect the right leaders
The Constitution gives people rights
The government has been formed by the consent of the governed
Without the state regulating / subsidizing / taxing / prohibiting activity or industry X , said industry or activity would be produced in quantities and / or qualities that are too high or too low ; or would run rampant , cartelize and monopolize the market ; or would not survive in a predatory competitive environment
The more politically democratic things are , the better for everyone
No matter what the cost to the public , protecting the children / our veterans / our senior citizens / our teachers is always the number one priority
The free movement of goods and people destroys jobs and threatens our standard of living
Businesses have no incentives to keep their customers safe ; licenses ensure fair practices
The law may occasionally be wrong , but it should nonetheless be followed always
We must forever give up essential liberties to guarantee safety : it ’s for your own good
The list can go on forever but you get the clue .
What ’s really telling about the so - called Independence Day is that most the reminders about July 4th are related to the state !
You will see , almost without fail , photos of past tyrants , video of the various monuments magnanimously erected in their memory , and audio of their speeches .
News segments and even commercials that use the Fourth of July as a theme will invariable feature the military , the White House , Congress , the Supreme Court , the Washington monument or a close - up of the Constitution — usually the part that says " We the People . "
If July 4th is really about freedom , why is the District of Criminals the center of attention ?
You see , we live in a bizarro world where might makes right and government aggression is the apotheosis of liberty .
Our rights are relative and whatever freedoms we have left are a vote and a signature away from being eradicated .
I ask :
What rights ?
What freedoms ?
Today we celebrate nothing .
Get over your patriotism - inspired nationalistic jingoism already .
Instead , celebrate the market , not the politicians and their bureaucratic - regulatory army of destruction .

US 'has nuclear hit list '
The Bush administration has reportedly ordered the Pentagon to prepare contingency plans for attacking seven countries with nuclear weapons .
Quoting a secret Pentagon report , the Los Angeles Times newspaper names China , Russia , Iraq , North Korea , Iran , Libya and Syria as potential targets .
I can imagine what these countries are going to be saying at the UN
Joseph Cirincione
nuclear arms expert Furthermore , the military have apparently been directed to build smaller nuclear weapons for battlefield use .
The Pentagon has declined to comment on the report which analysts have described as " dynamite " .
According to the paper , the report lists three situations in which the weapons could be used .
These include " retaliation for attack with nuclear , biological or chemical weapons " and " against targets able to withstand non-nuclear attack " .
The third category - " in the event of surprising military developments " - is described by the BBC's Washington correspondent , Paul Reynolds , as a " catch - all " clause .
The paper says the report was presented by the Pentagon to members of Congress on Friday .
It is quoted as saying the Pentagon should be ready to use nuclear weapons in an Arab - Israeli conflict , a war between China and Taiwan and an attack by North Korea on the South .
As for Russia , the report says that it is only listed in view of its own large nuclear arsenal and it is not viewed as an enemy .
' Taboo lifted '
Defence analysts told the Los Angeles Times that the secret report appeared to mark the first time an official list of target countries had come to light .
" I can imagine what these countries are going to be saying at the UN , " said Joseph Cirincione , a nuclear arms expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington .
Dr Strangelove is clearly still alive in the Pentagon
John Isaacs
arms control campaigner
The report clearly referred to nuclear arms as a " tool for fighting a war , rather than deterring them " , he added .
Anti-nuclear campaigners pointed out that the reported instruction to build new tactical nuclear weapons indicated that the administration of George W Bush was more willing to lift the old taboo on using nuclear weapons except as a last resort .
" This is very , very dangerous talk , " said John Isaacs , president of the Council for a Livable World .
" Dr Strangelove is clearly still alive in the Pentagon , " he commented , referring to a 1964 feature film about a nightmare nuclear conflict between the US and the Soviet Union .
Our correspondent recalls that the US made a veiled threat to Iraq during the Gulf War that it could respond with nuclear weapons to an attack by Baghdad using chemical or biological weapons .
FedEx delivers hefty pot package to wrong place
200 - pound mix - up tips off police , who pose as deliverymen , bust recipient
BALTIMORE - FedEx prides itself on reliability .
But a mistaken delivery tipped off police to a 200 - pound shipment of marijuana that someone tried to send from Pembroke Pines , Florida to Baltimore via the shipping company .
Police tell The ( Baltimore )
Sun they learned about the shipment when it was delivered Tuesday to the wrong resident .
Authorities posed as FedEx employees and arrested the shipment 's intended recipient , 30 - year - old Richard Gwatidzo .
Officials say he was charged Thursday with possession of a large quantity of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute along with other drug related charges .
Police say they also seized eight other FedEx boxes with nearly 400 pounds of the drug .
Authorities are trying to determine the sender 's identity .
A recent collaborative study between Google , the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , and IBM offers new insight into how many people surfing the web are doing so safely .
According to the report , a clear majority of users ( some 59 percent ) are using the latest version of their preferred Internet browser — but that still leaves 40.1 percent who are n't .
That 's a troublingly high number for anyone working in IT security , given that virtually all ( 89.4 percent ) of the vulnerabilities reported in 2007 were remote exploits .
Not all of these exploits specifically targeted the web browser , but it 's become the target of choice for an increasingly large percentage of all attacks .
Proper browser security is therefore of paramount concern .
The group performed its analysis using Google 's database of user information ( nonpersonally - identifiable information , mind you ) .
The information in question was gathered between January 2007 and June 2008 , and represents some 18 months of browser data .
Both minor and major patch versions were considered , as was the date when new patches were actually released .
Data was compiled separately for each of the browsers that were tracked , and multiple visits from any given machine were counted only once per day .
This particular analysis is focused on how often end - users apply browser patches , not on market share , but the authors do mention the figures they saw in passing , indicated in the chart below .
According to the study , " The absolute worldwide user counts were derived from the global Internet user count of 1,408 billion users . "
The browser labels in the table refer specifically to IE7 , Firefox 2 , Safari 3 , and Opera 9 — IE6 , Firefox 3 , and Opera 8 were not included .
Data source : Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
The percentile breakdowns for the number of surfers using the latest major version of the browser in question was quite interesting .
IE7 is the oldest browser — it was released on October 18 , 2006 — but only 52.5 percent of the people browsing the ' Net with IE were using IE7 .
The vast majority of that other 47.5 percent are presumably using IE6 , despite Microsoft 's repeated and emphatic pleas to upgrade .
Firefox and Opera both have extremely high upgrade uptake — 92.2 percent of Firefox users are now using version 2 ( remember , no Firefox 3 data here ) , while 90.1 percent of Opera users were using Opera 9 .
Safari falls between the two groups with 70.2 percent of all Safari users currently running Safari 3 .
The percentage of people using the most secure version of their specific browser is also shown below , and represented by a snapshot of Google data from the first week of this past June .
Here we see that the availability of minor updates does not necessarily mean users will quickly adopt them .
Firefox fares the best , with its one - click upgrade system , but 16.7 percent of users are still behind when it comes to point updates .
Data source : Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
Patching up the holes
The group of researchers includes several of their own suggestions for improving browser security .
Firefox and Opera are both credited for including an auto - update feature , but the team notes that " Firefox ’s auto - update was found to be way more effective than Opera 's manual update download reminder strategy . "
How effective ?
Way more effective .
Auto - updates are , however , a Very Good Thing , and the group recommends the feature be included in all browsers .
On the corporate side of things , the study recommends that businesses adopt URL Filters , or filters designed to prevent company employees from even touching websites carrying payloads of malicious content .
The final recommendation is that the software industry adopt the same type of labeling system currently used by ... the food industry .
Under such a system , web browsers would be dated with a " Best before " label , and would automatically flag the user when the browser " expired . "
Such warnings would not prevent the browser from functioning , but might take the form of a " days since expiration " figure and a message stating that the customer had missed a certain number of patches .
Auto - updates seem both more effective and more practical , but those warnings might prompt some users to upgrade who might otherwise avoid doing so .
Barack Obama has finally made his long - awaited pilgrimage to Israel , a rite of passage that no aspiring American politician , let alone a presidential candidate , can afford to miss or ignore .
There ( or rather here ) , Obama uttered all the politically - correct words that Israeli leaders and especially Israel - firsters back home would want to hear .
He called the creation of Israel in Palestine in 1948 a “ miracle , ” utterly ignoring the near obliteration of Palestine and expulsion to the four corners of the world of the vast bulk of its indigenous Christian and Muslim inhabitants .
The presidential hopeful told Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that “ I have come to communicate to you my fervent support for Israel . ”
In Sderot , in southern Israel , Obama was quoted as saying the following : “ If somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night , I would do everything in my power to stop that , and would expect Israelis to do the same thing . ”
Of course , he mentioned absolutely nothing about the Israeli campaign of murder and terror against Gaza , particularly the year - long harsh blockade of the coastal enclave ’s estimated 1.5 million inhabitants , which has killed and maimed thousands of innocent men , women and children whose only “ crime ” is that they had dared elect a government the Bush administration and Israel did n’t like .
Predictably , Obama lashed out at Iran , saying that “ a situation in which Iran was capable of making nuclear weapons would be “ game - changing ” and would have repercussions across the world .
Again , he utterly and totally ignored Israel ’s estimated 300 nuclear warheads , as if even alluding to this well - known fact was an earth - shaking taboo .
Obama is not ignorant of the facts in the Middle East .
He is well - aware of the evil nature of the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the equally criminal treatment meted out to the Palestinian people .
He also knows well that true and just peace with the Palestinians is the last item on Israel ’s agenda as evidenced from the unmitigated Jewish settlement expansion in the West Bank , especially in occupied Arab East Jerusalem .
Nonetheless , Obama is also meticulously conscious of the whoring theatre of American politics where political correctness always exceeds and overrides moral rightness .
He knows that the nearly complete Jewish domination of the “ media discourse ” in America leaves him with only two choices :
Either he be conscientious , in which case he would most probably lose ; or play the political prostitution game quite skillfully , and have a fair chance of winning .
Obama has obviously opted to adopt the later choice .
It is of course true that the sole reason behind Obama ’s visit to Israel , a country that got the US involved in two wars in the Middle East and is now hell - bent trying to get the Bush Administration to wage a third war , this time on Iran , has more to do with his efforts to impress American Jewish voters , especially American Zionist leaders , than with showing solidarity with “ Sderot ” or underscoring his commitment to peace in the Middle East .
But this is only partially true .
There are far more Hispanic voters in the US than Jewish voters , but Obama has made no pilgrimage to Mexico as he has to Israel .
Similarly , there are probably at least as many American Muslim voters as there are Jewish voters , who unlike the Jews are expected to overwhelmingly vote for Obama , given their conspicuously nightmarish experience with the Bush administration , especially its witch - hunting campaign against American Muslims .
Yet we have seen Obama display a virtually phobic reaction toward everything and anything Islamic , from refusing to be photographed with two hejab - wearing supporters recently to him completely disavowing his childhood Islamic heritage as if the religion of Islam , which gave the world so much in terms of civilization and culture , were something to be ashamed of .
This probably explains why Obama has carefully avoided visiting the Haram al Sharif esplanade in East Jerusalem , one of the world ’s most splendid sites , lest he be caught inadvertently showing signs of respect to the holy place or shaking hands with a Muslim scholar .
Then his political opponents back home would rather enthusiastically seize “ the golden opportunity ” of having finally found the ultimate “ proof ” that Obama is in fact a “ crypto - follower of Osama bin Laden . ”
After all , Obama ’s last name and Osama ’s first have 80 % similarity !!!
Well , anything could work in a country that can be so easily mesmerized by spin doctors and misled to the abyss by organized mendacity .
Yes , it is the spin doctors , the professional liars , that Obama is worried about , I would say much more than he is about Jewish voters .
This is why he probably does n’t want to give them any chances , even at the expense of whatever moral credentials he might have .
I know that the hardcore Jewish leadership in America does n’t really like or trust Obama , mainly because in the tone of his voice they detect a propensity to refuse total submission to Jewish power .
This is the reason that their support of the black candidate is shrouded with more than a thin façade of hypocrisy and disingenuousness .
But why would the “ omnipotent lobby ” not unmask its doubts and lack of certitude about Obama and switch support to Senator McCain , who is with Israel , heart and soul ?
Well , because they are worried that in case Obama won the race , they lobby would probably fall out of favor with the next master of the White House .
And that would be very bad for Israel .
Hence , their uttered slogan is “ we must not allow this Negro to outsmart or outmaneuver us . ”
Surely , American Zionism and its powerful lobby , which effectively controls American politics and policies , is fond of Obama ’s tongue .
But they are not so sure about Obama ’s mind and heart .
So , far Obama has done a remarkable job hiding whatever discrepancy there might be between his tongue and his conscience .
This is what irks Israel ’s firsters most .
Well , let us hope that Obama will be the next President of the United States .
At least if he ca n’t stand up to Israel , whose former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was rumored to have said “ We , the Jews , control America and the Americans know it , ” he , at the very least , would be the lesser of the two evils , since a McCain ’s presidency would mean another four years of George W. Bush ’s policies .

The Real Reason the Government Wo n't Debate
Medical Cannabis and Industrial Hemp Re-legalization An Open Letter to All Americans
By R. William Davis Documented Evidence of a Secret Business and Political Alliance
Between the U.S. " Establishment " and the Nazis -
Before , During and After World War II - up to the Present .
PREFACE
Before the Gatewood Galbraith for Governor Campaign in 1991 , few Kentuckians knew that the plant that the federal government had demonized for over 50 years as " Marijuana - Assassin of Youth , " was , in fact , Cannabis Hemp , the most traded commodity in the world until the mid-1800s , and our state 's number one crop , industry , and most important source of revenue , for over 150 years .
Today , thanks to the efforts of pioneer hemp researchers and public advocates such as Galbraith , Jack Fraizer , Jack Herer , Chris Conrad , Ed Rosenthal , Don Wirtshafter and others , the federal government 's unjustifiable suppression of our state 's right to develop our most valuable and versatile natural resource , is facing increasing opposition from an informed public .
Hemp is now recognized as the number one agriculturally renewable raw material in the world , and perhaps the only crop / industry which can guarantee us industrial and economic independence from the trans-national corporations .
" Shadow of the Swastika " is a follow - up to my earlier work , " Cannabis Hemp : the Invisible Prohibition Revealed , " which I wrote and published in support of the Galbraith Campaign .
Since publication of that booklet , there has been growing public acceptance of the evidence that Marijuana Prohibition was created in 1937 , not to protect society from the " evils of the drug Marijuana , " as the Federal government claimed , but as an act of deliberate economic and industrial sabotage against the re-emerging Industrial Hemp Industry .
Previous investigations by hemp researchers have been limited to the suppression of free - market competition from the hemp industry , and focused on the activities of three prominent members of America 's corporate , industrial and banking establishment during the mid- to late - 1930s :
WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST , the newspaper and magazine tycoon .
The expected rebirth of cannabis hemp as a less expensive source of pulp for paper meant his millions of acres of prime timberland , and investment in wood pulp papermaking equipment , would soon be worth much less .
In the 1920s , about the same time as the equipment was developed to economically mass - produce raw hemp into pulp and fiber for paper , he began the " Reefer Madness " hoax in his newspaper and magazine publications .
ANDREW MELLON , founder of the Gulf Oil Corporation .
He knew that cannabis hemp was an alternative industrial raw material for the production of thousands of products , including fuel and plastics , which , if allowed to compete in the free - market , would threaten the future profits of the oil companies .
As Secretary of the Treasury he created the Federal Bureau of Narcotics , and appointed his own future nephew - in - law , Harry Anslinger , as director .
Anslinger would later use the sensational , and totally fabricated , articles published by Hearst , to push the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 through Congress , which successfully destroyed the rebirth of the cannabis hemp industry .
A prominent member of one Congressional subcommittee who voted in favor of this bill was Joseph Guffey of Pennsylvania , an oil tycoon and former business partner of Andrew Mellon in the Spindletop oil fields in Texas .
THE DU PONT CHEMICAL CORPORATION ,
which owned the patents on synthetic petrochemicals and industrial processes that promised billions of dollars in future profits from the sale of wood pulp paper , lead additives for gasoline , synthetic fibers and plastics , if hemp could be suppressed .
At the time , du Pont family influence in both government and the private sector was unmatched , according to historians and journalists .
This publication , however , reveals documented historical evidence that the suppression of the hemp industry was only one key part of a much larger conspiracy in the 1930s , not only by the three corporate interests named above , but by many others , as well .
Congressional records , FBI reports and investigations by the Justice Department , during the 1930s and 1940s , have already documented evidence of this wider plot .
A list of the corporations named include Du Pont , Standard Oil , and General Motors , all of which were proven to be conspiring with Nazi industrial cartels to eliminate competition world - wide and divide among themselves the Earth 's industrial resources and commercial markets , for profitable exploitation .
This conspiracy succeeded .
It is now obvious that this lack of serious competition in the industrial raw materials market caused our present - and totally contrived - addiction to petrochemicals .
Its success is directly responsible for the most troubling problems we now face in the 1990s ; serious damage to our environment , concentration of economic and political power into fewer and fewer hands , and the weakening of the rights of individuals and states to determine their own futures .
It is more and more evident that , given the historical record , the structure of the New World Order is being built upon the Foundation of Marijuana Prohibition , and only the relegalization of free - market hemp competition can save us .

INTRODUCTION
To clearly understand the circumstances which existed during the 1930s and 1940s , and are the subject of this booklet , it would be helpful to first put the hemp / petrochemical conflict into historical perspective .
The events which took place in the years leading up to World War II were a continuation of a struggle between agricultural and industrial interests that began before the American Revolution , a struggle which has yet to be decided , even today .
AGRICULTURE VS .
INDUSTRY
The historical record , at least as it has been presented to us in the public school system , is that the Civil War was fought to end slavery .
This is not the whole story .
The truth of the matter is that it was also a clash between Northern industrialists and Southern agriculturists , over control of the expansion into the newly opened West .
In 1845 , Abraham Lincoln wrote , " I hold it a paramount duty of us in the free states due to the union of the states , and perhaps to liberty itself , to let the slavery of other states alone . " ( 1 )
Concerning the Western territories , he said " The whole Nation is interested that the best use shall be made of these territories .
We want them for homes and free white people .
This they cannot be , to any considerable extent , if slavery be planted within them . " ( 2 )
Lincoln was caught in the middle between the Northern industrialists and the Southern agriculturists , who both wanted to dominate Western expansion because of the wealth it offered .
The industrialists knew that the agriculturists depended on slavery because cotton , upon which Southern wealth was based , was very labor intensive and required the inexpensive labor that slavery provided .
They knew that if the Western lands were declared " free states " then the Southern agriculturists would be unable to compete , and would be forced to leave Western expansion , and its potential profits , to the Northern industrialists .
Quoting " The Irony of Democracy , " by Thomas R. Dye and T. Harmon Zeigler ,
" The importance of the Civil War for America 's elite structure was the commanding position that the new industrial capitalists won during the course of the struggle .
. . .
The economic transformation of the United States from an agricultural to an industrial nation reached the crescendo of a revolution in the second half of the nineteenth century .
" Civil War profits compounded the capital of the industrialists and placed them in a position to dominate the economic life of the nation .
Moreover , when the Southern planters were removed from the national scene , the government in Washington became the exclusive domain of the new industrial leaders . " ( 3 )
The Northern industrialists used this increased capital to build the system of transcontinental railways , linking the Northeast with both the South and West .
The labor for this undertaking was from the Northeastern Establishment 's own source of cheap labor - recently freed slaves and poor immigrants from Europe and China - who suffered under living conditions which were often little better than those which existed under the Slave System just a few years before .
It was during the years between the Civil War and the beginning of the Twentieth Century that the Northern industrialists altered the role of the American government .
Originally established by the Revolution to protect and preserve the lives , property and freedoms of all Americans from repressive government , it was transformed into an agency to protect the economic future of Northern industrialists .
" [ T ]he industrial elites , " according to Dye and Zeigler , " saw no objection to legislation if it furthered their success in business .
Unrestricted competition might prove who was the fittest , but as an added precaution to insure that the industrial capitalists themselves emerged as the fittest , these new elites also insisted upon government subsidies , patents , tariffs , loans , and massive giveaways of land and other natural resources . " ( 4 )
The struggle between Western farmers and the railroads owned by the Northern industrialists is a good example .
To protect their interests , citizens created " the Grange , " an organization which helped to enact state laws regulating the " ruthless aggression " of the railroads .
In 1877 , these laws were upheld by the Supreme Court in the Munn v. Illinois decision .
But , a few years later , Justice Stephen A. Field changed the role , and the very definition , of the corporation .
He gave a new interpretation to the Fourteenth Amendment that actually gave corporations legal status as citizens . . . as artificial persons . ( 5 )
It was not long after this change in the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment that John D. Rockefeller , the father of the modern - day corporation , created the great Standard Oil Corporation which , by the late 1880s , gained control over 90 % of all the oil refineries in America . ( 6 )
The roots of 20th Century American politics can best be illustrated by the 1896 Presidential Election , won by Republican William McKinley by a landslide .
The McKinley campaign was directed by Marcus Alonzo Hanna of Standard Oil and raised a $ 16,000,000 campaign fund from wealthy fellow industrialists , ( an amount that was unmatched in Presidential campaigns until the 1960s ) .
The major theme of the campaign , and one that would echo far into the future , was " what 's good for business is good for the country . " ( 7 )
This emerging political and judicial misuse of power in America was feared by Thomas Jefferson who , in 1787 , wrote , " I think our governments will remain virtuous for many centuries ; as long as they remain chiefly agricultural ; and this will be as long as there shall be vacant lands in any part of America .
When they get piled upon one another in large cities as in Europe they will become corrupt as in Europe . " ( 8 )
It is important to remember that the American Revolution was a clash between the agriculturists in the colonies , and the British industrialists who controlled the government in England .
Almost 100 years later the Civil War was fought as a continuation of the same basic struggle , but with the victory going back to the industrialists .
This began the erosion of the American government " of the people , for the people and by the people . "
The buying of the 1896 Presidential Election , by Hanna of Standard Oil and the Northern industrial interests , was the next important step on the long road to the American government " of the corporation , for the corporation and by the corporation . "
A few years later , World War I would forge an even closer relationship between corporations and government in the United States , as well as around the world .
Anthony Sampson , in his book " The Arms Bazaar , " notes that " the American companies , led by US Steel and du Pont , were transformed by war orders .
US Steel , which had absorbed Carnegie 's old steel company , had made average annual profits in the four pre-war years of $ 105 million , while in the four war years they were $ 240 million ; and du Pont 's average profit went up from $ 6 million to $ 58 million .
. . .
" Certainly the arms companies had become much richer through the war , and there were widespread suspicions that they were actually trying to prolong it . " ( 9 )
The bottom line is , of course , victory or profit , and in what proportions ?
To what lengths would this nation 's top industrial leaders go to secure their share of the profits before and during the next " war to end all war ? "

U.S. CORPORATIONS AND THE NAZIS
" A clique of U.S. industrialists is hell - bent to bring a fascist state to supplant our democratic government and is working closely with the fascist regime in Germany and Italy .
I have had plenty of opportunity in my post in Berlin to witness how close some of our American ruling families are to the Nazi regime .
. . .
" Certain American industrialists had a great deal to do with bringing fascist regimes into being in both Germany and Italy .
They extended aid to help Fascism occupy the seat of power , and they are helping to keep it there . "
- William E. Dodd , U.S. Ambassador to Germany , 1937 .
(1 )
A large volume of documentary evidence exists that reveals that many of the richest , most powerful men in the United States , and the giant corporations they controlled , were secretly allied with the Nazis , both before and during World War II , even after war was declared between Germany and America .
This alliance began with U.S. corporate investment during the reconstruction of post - World War I Germany in the 1920s and , years later , included financial , industrial and military aid to the Nazis .
On the pages which follow we will review which prominent Americans and corporations were involved , what aid and comfort they gave our nation 's enemies - treasonable offenses during time of war , and investigations into these matters which produced evidence of a US / Nazi corporate conspiracy to bring a fascist state to America , and eliminate competition in the industrial raw materials market in order to force world - wide dependance on oil - based petrochemicals .
WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST
Hearst , who was so concerned about the American public 's health and safety on the matter of marijuana use , apparently had no such fears when it came to Hitler and the Nazis .
According to journalist George Seldes :
" . . .
Hitler had the support of the most widely circulated magazine in history , ' Readers Digest , ' as well as nineteen big -city newspapers and one of the three great American news agencies , the $ 220 - million Hearst press empire . " . . .
William Randolph Hearst , Sr. , . . . was the lord of all the press lords in the United States .
The millions who read the Hearst newspapers and magazines and saw Hearst newsreels in the nation 's moviehouses had their minds poisoned by Hitler propaganda .
" It was . . . disclosed first to President Roosevelt [ by Ambassador Dodd ] almost on the day it happened , in September 1934 , and it is detailed in the book ' Ambassador Dodd 's Diary , ' published in 1941 , and again in libel - proof documents on file in the courts of the state of New York .
William E. Dodd , professor of history [ at the University of Chicago ] , told me about the Hearst sell - out . . .
" According to Ambassador Dodd , Hearst came to take the waters at Bad Nauheim in September 1934 , and Dodd somehow learned immediately that Hitler had sent two of his most trusted Nazi propagandists , Hanfstangel and Rosenberg , to ask Hearst how Nazism could present a better image in the United States .
When Hearst went to Berlin later in the month , he was taken to see Hitler . "
Seldes reports that a $ 400,000 a year deal was struck between Hearst and Hitler , and signed by Doctor Joseph Goebbels , the Nazi propaganda minister .
" Hearst , " continues Seldes , " completely changed the editorial policy of his nineteen daily newspapers the same month he got the money . "
In the court documents filed on behalf of Dan Gillmor , publisher of a magazine named " Friday , " in response to a lawsuit by Hearst , under item 61 , he states : " Promptly after this said visit with Adolf Hitler and the making of said arrangements .
. . said plaintiff , William Randolph Hearst , instructed all Hearst press correspondents in Germany , including those of INS [ Hearst 's International News Service ] to report happenings in Germany only in a friendly ' manner .
All of such correspondents reporting happenings in Germany accurately and without friendliness , sympathy and bias for the actions of the then German government , were transferred elsewhere , discharged , or forced to resign .
. . . "
In the late 1930s , Seldes recounts , when " several sedition indictments [ were brought by ] the Department of Justice . . . against a score or two of Americans , the defendants included an unusually large minority of newspaper men and women , most of them Hearst employees . " ( 2 )
ANDREW MELLON
" Thurman Arnold , as assistant district attorney of the United States , his assistant , Norman Littell , and several Congressional investigations , have produced incontrovertible evidence that some of our biggest monopolies entered into secret agreements with the Nazi cartels and divided the world up among them , " states Seldes in his book , " Facts and Fascism , " published in 1943 .
" Most notorious of all was Alcoa , the Mellon - Davis - Duke monopoly which is largely responsible for the fact America did not have the aluminum with which to build airplanes before and after Pearl Harbor , while Germany had an unlimited supply . " ( 3 )
Alcoa sabotage of American war production had already cost the U.S. " 10,000 fighters or 1,665 bombers , " according to Congressman Pierce of Oregon speaking in May 1941 , because of " the effort to protect Alcoa 's monopolistic position . . . "
" If America loses this war , " said Secretary of the Interior [ Harold ]
Ickes , June 26 , 1941 , " it can thank the Aluminum Corporation of America . "
" By its cartel agreement with I.G. Farben , controlled by Hitler , " writes Seldes , " Alcoa sabotaged the aluminum program of the U.S. air force .
The Truman Committee [ on National Defense , chaired by then - Senator Harry S. Truman in 1942 ] heard testimony that Alcoa 's representative , A.H. Bunker , $ 1 - a - year head of the aluminum section of O.P.M. , prevented work on our $ 600,000,000 aluminum expansion program . " ( 4 )
DU PONT AND GENERAL MOTORS
General Motors is included here because , by 1929 , the Du Pont corporation had acquired controlling interest in , and had interlocking directorships with , General Motors .
Irenee du Pont , " the most imposing and powerful member of the clan , " according to biographer and historian Charles Higham , " was obsessed with Hitler 's principles . "
" He keenly followed the career of the future Fuhrer in the 1920s , and on September 7 , 1926 , in a speech to the American Chemical Society , he advocated a race of supermen , to be achieved by injecting special drugs into them in boyhood to make their characters to order . "
Higham 's book on this subject , " Trading with the Enemy : An Expose of the Nazi- American Money Plot 1933 - 1949 , " is highly recommended .
Du Pont 's anti-Semitism " matched that of Hitler " and , in 1933 , the Du Ponts " began financing native fascist groups in America . . . " one of which Higham identifies as the American Liberty League : " a Nazi organization whipping up hatred of blacks and Jews , " and the " love of Hitler .
" Financed . . . to the tune of $ 500,000 the first year , the Liberty League had a lavish thirty - one - room office in New York , branches in twenty - six colleges , and fifteen subsidiary organizations nationwide that distributed fifty million copies of its Nazi pamphlets .
. . .
" The Du Ponts ' fascistic behavior was seen in 1936 , when Irenee du Pont used General Motors money to finance the notorious Black Legion .
This terrorist organization had as its purpose the prevention of automobile workers from unionizing .
The members wore hoods and black robes , with skulls and crossbones .
They fire - bombed union meetings , murdered union organizers , often by beating them to death , and dedicated their lives to destroying Jews and communists .
They linked to the Ku Klux Klan . . . .
It was brought out that at least fifty people , many of them blacks , had been butchered by the Legion . " ( 5 )
Du Pont support of Hitler extended into the very heart of the Nazi war machine as well , according to Higham , and several other researchers : " General Motors , under the control of the Du Pont family of Delaware , played a part in collaboration " with the Nazis .
" Between 1932 and 1939 , bosses of General Motors poured $ 30 million into I.G. Farben plants . . . "
Further , Higham informs us that by " the mid-1930s , General Motors was committed to full - scale production of trucks , armored cars , and tanks in Nazi Germany . " ( 6 )
Researchers Morton Mintz and Jerry S. Cohen , in their book , " Power Inc. , " describe the Du Pont - GM - Nazi relationship in these terms :
" . . .
In 1929 , [ Du Pont - controlled ] GM acquired the largest automobile company in Germany , Adam Opel , A.G.
This predestined the subsidiary to become important to the Nazi war effort .
In a heavily documented study presented to the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly in February 1974 , Bradford C. Snell , an assistant subcommittee counsel , wrote : " ' GM 's participation in Germany 's preparation for war began in 1935 .
That year its
Opel subsidiary cooperated with the Reich in locating a new heavy truck facility at Brandenburg , which military officials advised would be less vulnerable to enemy air attacks .
During the succeeding years , GM supplied the Wehrmact with Opel " Blitz " trucks from the Brandenburg complex .
For these and other contributions to [ the Nazis ] wartime preparations , GM 's chief executive for overseas operations [ James Mooney ] was awarded the Order of the German Eagle ( first class ) by Adolf Hitler . ' "
Du Pont - GM Nazi collaboration , according to Snell , included the participation of Standard Oil of New Jersey [ now Exxon ] in one , very important arrangement .
GM and Standard Oil of New Jersey formed a joint subsidiary with the giant Nazi chemical cartel , I.G. Farben , named Ethyl G.m.b.H. [ now Ethyl , Inc. ] which , according to Snell : " provided the mechanized German armies with synthetic tetraethyl fuel [ leaded gas ] .
During 1936 - 39 , at the urgent request of Nazi officials who realized that Germany 's scarce petroleum reserves would not satisfy war demands , GM and Exxon joined with German chemical interests in the erection of the lead - tetraethyl plants .
According to captured German records , these facilities contributed substantially to the German war effort : ' The fact that since the beginning of the war we could produce lead - tetraethyl is entirely due to the circumstances that , shortly before , the Americans [ Du Pont , GM and Standard Oil ] had presented us with the production plants complete with experimental knowledge .
Without lead - tetraethyl the present method of warfare would be unthinkable . ' " ( 7 )
At about the same time the Du Ponts were serving the Nazi cause in Germany , they were involved in a Fascist plot to overthrow the United States government .
" Along with friends of the Morgan Bank and General Motors , " in early 1934 , writes Higham , " certain Du Pont backers financed a coup d'etat that would overthrow the President with the aid of a $ 3 million - funded army of terrorists . . . "
The object was to force Roosevelt " to take orders from businessmen as part of a fascist government or face the alternative of imprisonment and execution . . . "
Higham reports that " Du Pont men allegedly held an urgent series of meetings with the Morgans , " to choose who would lead this " bizarre conspiracy . "
" They finally settled on one of the most popular soldiers in America , General Smedly Butler of Pennsylvania . "
Butler was approached by " fascist attorney " Gerald MacGuire ( an official of the American Legion ) , who attempted to recruit Butler into the role of an American Hitler .
" Butler was horrified , " but played along with MacGuire until , a short time later , he notified the White House of the plot .
Roosevelt considered having " the leaders of the houses of Morgan and Du Pont " arrested , but feared that " it would create an unthinkable national crisis in the midst of a depression and perhaps another Wall Street crash . "
Roosevelt decided the best way to defuse the plot was to expose it , and leaked the story to the press .
" The newspapers ran the story of the attempted coup on the front page , but generally ridiculed it as absurd and preposterous . "
But an investigation by the Congressional Committee on Un- American Activities - 74th Congress , first session , House of Representatives , Investigation of Nazi and other propaganda - was begun later that same year .
" It was four years , " continues Higham , " before the committee dared to publish its report in a white paper that was marked for ' restricted circulation . '
They were forced to admit that ' certain persons made an attempt to establish a fascist organization in this country . . .
[ The ] committee was able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler . '
This admission that the entire plan was deadly in intent was not accompanied by the imprisonment of anybody .
Further investigations disclosed that over a million people had been guaranteed to join the scheme and that the arms and munitions necessary would have been supplied by Remington , a Du Pont subsidiary . " ( 8 )
The names of important individuals and groups involved in the conspiracy were suppressed by the committee , but later revealed by Seldes , Philadelphia Record reporter Paul French , and Jules Archer , author of the book , " The Plot to Seize the White House . "
Included were John W. Davis ( attorney for the J.P. Morgan banking group ) , Robert Sterling Clark ( Wall Street broker and heir to the Singer sewing machine fortune ) , William Doyle ( American Legion official ) , and the American Liberty League ( backed by executives from J.P. Morgan and Co. , Rockefeller interests , E.F. Hutton , and Du Pont - controlled General Motors ) . ( 9 )
THE US / NAZI CARTEL AGREEMENT
" On November 23 , 1937 , " states Higham , " representatives of General Motors held a secret meeting in Boston with Baron Manfred von Killinger , who was . . . in charge of West Coast espionage [ for the Nazis ] , and Baron von Tipplekirsch , Nazi consul general and Gestapo leader in Boston .
This group signed a joint agreement showing total commitment to the Nazi cause for the indefinite future .
. . . " ( 10 )
Seldes describes the plotters as " the great owners and rulers of America who planned world domination through political and military Fascism " including " several leading American industrialists , members of the Congress of the United States , and representatives of large business and political organizations . . . "
He obtained the text of the agreement , and published it in his newsletter , " In Fact , " on July 13 , 1942 .
The plan " goes much further than the mere cartel conspiracies of Big Business of both countries , " writes Seldes , " because it has political clauses and points to a bigger conspiracy of money and politicians such as helped betray Norway and France and other lands to the Nazi machine .
The most powerful fortress in America is the production monopolies , but its betrayal would involve , as it did in France , the participation of some of the most powerful figures of the political as well as the industrial world . " ( 11 )
STANDARD OIL OF NEW JERSEY ( Now Exxon )
" On February 27 , 1942 , " according to Higham , " Arnold , with documents stuffed under his arms , . . . strode into the lion 's den of Standard at 30 Rockefeller Plaza .
Just behind him were Secretary of the Navy Franklin Knox and Secretary of the Army Henry L. Stimson . "
They confronted Standard official William Farish and " Arnold sharply laid down his charges " that " by continuing to favor Hitler in rubber deal and patent arrangements , " Standard Oil " had acted against the interests of the American government . . . suggested a fine of $ 1.5 million and a consent decree whereby Standard would turn over for the duration all the patents " in question .
" Farish rejected the proposal on the spot .
He pointed out that Standard " was also selling the U.S. a " high percentage " of the fuel being used by the Army , Navy , and Air Force " making it possible for America to win the war .
Where would America be without it ? "
Blackmail ?
Yes , says Higham .
And effective .
Arnold was finally reduced to asking the oil company official " to what Standard Oil would agree .
After all , there had to be at least token punishment .
. . .
Arnold , Stimson , and Knox soon realized they had no power to compare with that of Standard . "
The price Standard Oil " agreed " to pay for its crime ?
A modest fine of a few thousand dollars divided up among ten defendants .
" Farish paid $ 1,000 , or a quarter of one week 's salary , for having betrayed America . "
In New Jersey , charges of " criminal conspiracy with the enemy " were filed against Standard , then " dropped in return for Standard releasing its patents and paying the modest fine . "
But Arnold , and his ally , Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes , were n't finished with Standard Oil just yet .
They approached Senator Truman , chairman of the Senate Special Committee Investigating the National Defense Program .
" With great enthusiasm Give 'em Hell Harry embarked on a series of hearings in March 1942 , in order to disclose the truth about Standard . "
Between the 26th and the 28th of March , 1942 , Arnold " produced documents showing that Standard and Farben in Germany had literally carved up the world markets , with oil and chemical monopolies all over the map , " according to Higham . ( 12 )
Mintz and Cohen describe the confrontation :
" Four months after the United States entered World War II , the Justice Department obtained an indictment of Exxon and its principal officers for having made arrangements , starting in the late 1920s with I.G. Farben involving patent sharing and division of world markets .
Jersey Standard agreed not to develop processes for the manufacture of synthetic rubber ; in exchange , Farben agreed not to compete in the American petroleum market .
After war broke out in Europe , but before the attack on Pearl Harbor , executives of Standard Oil and Farben , at a meeting in Holland , established a ' modus vivendi ' for continuing the arrangements in event of war between the United States and Germany - although the arrangements interfered with the ability of the United States to make synthetic rubber desperately needed after it entered the war in December 1941 .
Rather than face a criminal trial , Exxon and the indicted executives entered no -contest pleas - the legal equivalent of guilty pleas - and were fined the minor sums which were the maximum amounts permitted by law .
A few days later , on March 26 , 1942 , the Senate Special Committee Investigating the National Defense Program held a hearing at which Thurman Arnold , chief of the Antitrust Division , put into the record documents on which the [ criminal ] indictment had been based , including a memo from a Standard Oil official on the ' modus vivendi ' agreed to in Holland .
After the hearing , the committee chairman , Harry S. Truman , characterized the arrangements as treasonable . " ( 13 )
Another source book on this subject of US / Nazi corporate activities is " The Secret War Against the Jews , " by Mark Aarons and John Loftus .
Here is their version of the events :
" Before the war Standard of New Jersey had forged a synthetic oil and rubber cartel with the Nazi- controlled I.G. Farben , " which " worked well until the United States joined the war in 1941 .
. . .
Next to the Rockefellers , I.G. Farben owned the largest share of stock in Standard Oil of New Jersey .
Among other things , Standard had provided Farben with its synthetic rubber patents and technical knowledge , while Farben had kept its patents to itself , under strict instructions from the Nazi government . "
Evidence which Thurman Arnold turned over to the Truman Committee , which Truman would declare " treasonous , " included " Standard 's 1939 letter renewing its agreement , which made it clear that the Rockefellers ' company was prepared to work with the Nazis whether their own government was at war with the Third Reich or not .
Truman 's Senate Committee on the National Defense was outraged and began to probe into the whole scandalous arrangement , much to the discomfort of John D. Rockefeller , Jr. Suddenly , however , the whole matter was dropped .
" There was a reason for Rockefeller 's escape : blackmail .
According to the former intelligence officers we interviewed on this point , the blackmail was simple and powerful : The Dulles brothers [ John Foster , later Secretary of State , and Allen , later director of the CIA ] had one of their clients threaten to interrupt the U.S. oil supply during wartime . "
When confronted by Arnold on the Standard - Farben arrangement " Standard executives made it clear that the entire U.S. war effort was fueled by their oil and it could be stopped .
. . .
The American government had no choice but to go along if it wanted to win the war . " ( 14 )
July 13 , 1944 , Ralph W. Gallagher , attorney for Standard Oil , filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government 's seizure of the contested patents .
" On November 7 , 1945 , Judge Charles E. Wyzanski gave his verdict , " according to Higham .
" He decided that the government had been entitled to seize the patents .
Gallagher appealed .
On September 22 , 1947 , Judge Charles Clark delivered the final word on the subject .
He said , ' Standard Oil can be considered an enemy national in view of its relationships with I.G. Farben after the United States and Germany had become active enemies . '
The appeal was denied . " ( 15 )
One aspect of this Standard - I.G. Farben relationship , revealed in testimony during the Patents Committee hearings , chaired by Senator Homer T. Bone in May 1942 , is of interest to those who seek direct evidence of a conspiracy by big oil companies to suppress development of synthetic substitutes to petrochemical products such as industrial chemicals , aircraft lubricants and fuel , all of which can be made from hemp :
" On May 6th , John R. Jacobs , Jr. , of the Attorney General 's department , testified that Standard had interfered with the American explosives industry by blocking the use of a method of producing synthetic ammonia .
As a result of its deals with Farben , the United States had been unable to get the use of this vital process even after Pearl Harbor .
Also , the United States had been restricted in techniques of producing hydrogen from natural gas and from obtaining paraflow , a product used for airplane lubrication at high altitudes .
. . . "
On August 7th , " Texas oil operator C.R. Starnes appeared to testify that Standard had blocked him at every turn in his efforts to produce synthetic rubber after Pearl Harbor . . . . "
On August 12th , " John R. Jacobs reappeared in an Army private 's uniform ( he had been inducted the day before ) to bring up another disagreeable matter : Standard had also , in league with Farben , restricted production of methanol , a wood alcohol that was sometimes used as motor fuel . " ( 16 )
The restriction against methanol production apparently did not apply to the Nazis , however .
" As late as April 1943 , " Higham reveals , " General Motors in Stockholm [ Sweden ] was reported as trading with the enemy .
. . .
Further documents show that , as with Ford , repairs on German army trucks and conversion from gasoline to wood - gasoline production were being handled by GM in Switzerland . " ( 17 )
The use of hemp as a source of methanol was known to the Nazis , revealed in the pamphlet " The Humorous Hemp Primer , " published in Berlin , also in 1943 .
This document , recently re-published in the 1995 edition of " Hemp and the Marijuana Conspiracy : The Emperor Wears No Clothes , " by veteran hemp conspiracy researcher Jack Herer , states that :
" Crops should not only provide food in large quantities , they can provide raw materials for industry .
. . .
Among such raw materials of especially high value is hemp . . .
" The woody part of this large plant is not to be thrown out , since it can easily be used for surface coatings for the finest floors .
It also provides paper and cardboard , building materials and wall paneling .
Further processing will even produce wood sugar and wood gas .
. . .
" Anyone who grows hemp today need not fear a lack of a market , because hemp , as useful as it is , will be purchased in unlimited amounts . " ( 18 )
The Nazis obviously considered hemp a vital war material that could be used to produce methanol , or " wood gas , " at the same time , in 1943 , that Du Pont - controlled General Motors in Switzerland was " converting from gasoline to wood - gasoline production . "
This , taken into consideration along with the earlier statement that Standard Oil - I.G. Farben had " restricted production of methanol " and the GM - Standard Oil - I.G. Farben joint venture , Ethyl , Inc. , whose profitability depended on the production of lead - tetraethyl for oil - based petrochemical gasoline - in direct competition with the alternative methanol , or " wood gas , " certainly opens new avenues of investigation into the existence of a conspiracy against hemp as an alternative , and competing , industrial raw material , by these very same corporations which sold America out to the Nazis for profit and control of world resources and markets .
" Just after Pearl Harbor , " writes Seldes , " the Assistant Attorney General , Mr. Thurman Arnold , issued a sensational report of the sabotage of the national [ war production ] program , the first report naming the practices which were later to be referred to as the treason of big business in wartime .
Said Mr. Arnold :
" Looking back over 10 months of defense effort we can now see how much it has been hampered by the attitude of powerful basic industries who have feared to expand their production because expansion would endanger their future control of industry .
" Anti -trust investigations during the past year have shown that there is not an organized basic industry in the United States which has not been restricting production by some device or other in order to avoid what they call ' ruinous overproduction after the war ' . " ( 19 )
By " ruinous overproduction , " of course , they meant free - market competition .
So , to question the existence of an industrial conspiracy against competition , during the 1930s and 1940s , is pointless .
It has long been totally documented by volumes of evidence , available in the public record .
And among this list of convicted corporate conspirators are murderers , racists , pro-Nazi collaborators , blackmailers and American Fascists who plotted at least one armed take - over of the U.S. government .
And the list is not yet complete .
THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY
Henry Ford , writes Higham , " admired Hitler from the beginning , when the future Fuhrer was a struggling and obscure fanatic .
He shared with Hitler a fanatical hatred of Jews . "
" Ford 's book ' The International Jew ' was issued in 1927 .
A virulent anti-Semitic tract , it was still being distributed in Latin America and the Arab countries as late as 1945 .
Hitler admired the book and it influenced him deeply .
Visitors to Hitler 's headquarters at the Brown House in Munich noticed a large photograph of Henry Ford hanging in his office .
Stacked high on the table outside were copies of Ford 's book .
As early as 1923 , " when Hitler heard that Ford was planning to run for President , he " told an interviewer from the ' Chicago - Tribune , ' ' I wish that I could send some of my shock troops to Chicago and other big American cities to help ' . "
As late as 1940 , Ford Motor Company " refused to build aircraft engines for England and instead built supplies of the 5 - ton military trucks that were the backbone of German army transportation . " ( 20 )
The Ford Motor Company was also aware of the potential of hemp as an alternative industrial resource , devoting many years research to the subject .
In a 1989 ABC Radio broadcast , Hugh Downs reported that in the 1930s , " the Ford Motor Company also saw a future in biomass fuels .
Ford operated a successful biomass conversion plant that included hemp at their Iron Mountain facility in Michigan .
Ford engineers extracted methanol , charcoal fuel , tar , pitch , ethyl acetate , and creosote - all fundamental ingredients for modern industry , and now supplied by oil - related industries .
. . .
Henry Ford 's experiments with methanol promised cheap , readily - available fuel . " ( 21 )
As reported in " Popular Mechanics " in December , 1941 , Ford 's research represented " an industrial revolution in progress . . . a revolution in materials that will affect every home . " ( 22 )
So , it is possible , even likely , that Ford and General Motors conversion " from gasoline to wood - gasoline production " for Nazi Germany , as earlier reported by Higham , involved at least some consideration of hemp as a resource , if not actual production of " wood - gas " from hemp .
After all , Ford had already committed several years and significant research dollars to the subject .
The implication of methanol fuel patents , hemp industry research and production facilities , all in the hands of this cabal of Nazi- allied American corporations , during a proven period of anti-competition conspiracies , and wartime blackmail against the U.S. government , should provide additional support for the hemp conspiracy theories .
The fact is that Nazi Germany recognized hemp as a vital war material - one which , just before America 's entrance into World War II , was positioned to compete in the free - market against the products controlled by the Pro-Nazi American corporations .
Unrestricted expansion of United States industrial hemp production threatened not only the profits of these treasonous corporations , but the degree of their control over America 's production of vital war materials .
This view of hemp , not as a " dangerous drug " but as a vital war material , was acknowledged by the Kentucky Legislature a little over 100 years before the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor .
In 1841 , according to Professor James F. Hopkins , author of " A History of the Hemp Industry in Kentucky , " published by the University of Kentucky Press in 1951 :
" When the farmers of Woodford County [ KY ] assembled in October , 1841 , to consider a program of hemp production for the navy , they only went as far as to express an opinion that the government should employ a rope spinner in Kentucky for the purpose of converting the fiber into yarns , which could be transported much more cheaply and safely than the bulky raw material .
The Committee on Agriculture of the Kentucky House of Representatives inquired into the matter early in 1842 . . .
" Both houses of the General Assembly sent to the Senators and Congressmen from Kentucky a request that they use their ' best exertions ' to have established in the state one or more agencies for the inspection and manufacture of hemp for the navy .
A select committee of Congress , appointed to consider the resolutions from Kentucky , reported three resolutions of its own : that the navy be directed to construct a factory at Louisville ' for the purpose of depositing and manufacturing . . . such hempen fabrics of domestic water - rotted hemp as the public service may require ' ; that inspectors be appointed to test the fiber that might be offered for sale ; and that , after due notice to the public , purchase of the necessary amount of fiber be made at the factory .
The Committee contended that its plan would build up during peacetime a source of hemp which would be vitally important in case of war , encourage American agriculture and manufactures , and decrease the unfavorable balance of trade . " ( 23 )
[ NOTE : For many years we Kentuckians have had a good deal of our heritage and history buried beneath a thick layer of propaganda from a source of power and control in this country which knows neither honor nor justice .
Now , we are learning the truth .
Our history as a state built upon the foundation of a long - and dishonestly - outlawed industry endures . ]
INTERNATIONAL TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH
Even after Pearl Harbor , ITT was working for the Nazis , reports Higham : " . . . the German army , navy , and air force contracted with ITT for the manufacture of switchboards , telephones , alarm gongs , buoys , air raid warning devices , radar equipment , and thirty thousand fuses per month for artillery shells used to kill British and American troops . "
ITT also " supplied ingredients for the rocket bombs that fell on London , " and other devices as well , without which " it would have been impossible for the German air force to kill American and British troops , for the German army to fight the Allies in Africa , Italy , France , and Germany , for England to have been bombed , or for Allied ships to have been attacked at sea . " ( 24 )
In 1938 , " following a series of meetings with Luftwaffe chief Herman Goring , [ ITT founder and chairman Sosthenes ]
Behn encouraged ITT 's Lorenz subsidiary to purchase 28 percent of the Focke - Wulf firm , manufacturer of the bombers that were to sink so many Allied ships during the war , " according to researcher and author Jim Hougan . ( 25 )
Anthony Sampson , in " The Sovereign State of ITT , " reports on what is perhaps the most bizarre aspect of the US / Nazi corporate partnership , war reparations :
" . . .
ITT now presents itself as the innocent victim of the Second World War , and has been handsomely recompensed for its injuries .
In 1967 , nearly thirty years after the events , ITT actually managed to obtain $ 27 million in compensation from the American government , for war damage to Focke - Wulf plants - on the basis that they were American property bombed by Allied bombers . " ( 26 )
The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission was responsible for this payment to ITT , and other U.S. corporations as well .
Bradford Snell reports that " After the cessation of hostilities , GM and Ford demanded reparations from the U.S. Government for wartime damages sustained by their Axis facilities as a result of Allied bombing .
By 1967 GM had collected more than $ 33 million in reparations and Federal tax benefits for damages to its warplane and motor vehicle properties in formerly Axis territories . . .
Ford received a little less than $ 1 million , primarily as a result of damages sustained by its military truck complex at Cologne . " ( 27 )
ALLEN DULLES : ARCHITECT OF THE US - NAZI NETWORK
Contemporary history records Allen Dulles as one of America 's top spymasters , from his early days in the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) in World War II , to his position as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) in the 1950s and early 1960s ( until President John F. Kennedy fired him over the Bay of Pigs disaster in 1961 ) , and finally to his membership on the controversial Warren Commission , which investigated President Kennedy 's assassination .
Until recently , his pivotal role in promoting a U.S. corporate relationship with the Nazis was little known .
Loftus and Aarons describe the post - World War I role of Allen , and his brother , John Foster , in the following terms :
" We first turn to Dulles 's creation of international finance networks for the benefit of the Nazis .
In the beginning , moving money into the Third Reich was quite legal .
Lawyers saw to that .
And Allen and his brother John Foster were not just any lawyers .
They were international finance specialists for the powerful Wall Street law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell .
. . .
" The Dulles brothers were the ones who convinced American businessmen to avoid U.S. government regulation by investing in Germany .
It began with the Versailles Treaty , in which they played no small role .
After World War I the defeated German government promised to pay war reparations to the Allies in gold , but Germany had no gold .
It had to borrow the gold from Sullivan & Cromwell 's clients in the United States .
Nearly 70 percent of the money that flowed into Germany during the 1930s came from investors in the United States , many of them Sullivan & Cromwell clients .
. .
" Foster Dulles , as a member of the board of I.G. Farben , seems to have had little difficulty in getting along with whoever was in charge .
Some of our sources insist that both Dulles brothers made substantial but indirect contributions to the Nazi party as the price of continued influence inside the new German order . . . . " ( 28 )

THE NEW WORLD ( DIS ) ORDER
" The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself .
That , in essence , is fascism - ownership of government by an individual , by a group , or by any other controlling power .
" Among us today a concentration of private power without equal in history is growing . "
- President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ( 1 )
As mentioned earlier , the secret U.S. / Nazi corporate alliance during World War II was the result of substantial American investment in post - World War I Germany .
In order to protect these investments , and the accumulating profits , the U.S. multinational corporations remained an important part of the Nazi war machine until the final defeat of Germany in 1945 .
What effect did the end of World War II have on this faction of American Nazi collaborators ?
In this section we will review the evidence , much of it from recently de-classified documents , that this pro-Nazi faction , rather than facing charges of high treason , became an integral part of the United States national security apparatus , extending its fascist influence in both foreign and domestic policies and , in effect , creating what has been referred to as America 's " Invisible Government . "
The excuse , of course , was Communism .
THE BUGGING OF WALL STREET
Aarons and Loftus ' research , which documents the Dulles brothers ' pro-Nazi activities , did not go unnoticed .
" Before his death , former Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg granted one of the authors an interview .
Justice Goldberg had served in U.S. intelligence during World War II .
Although he said little in public , he had collected information on the Dulles boys ' activities over the years .
His verdict was blunt .
' The Dulles brothers were traitors . '
They had betrayed their country , by giving aid and comfort to the enemy in time of war . " ( 2 )
Much of what is now known about the activities of the Dulles brothers and other American Nazi collaborators in banking and industry came as a result of a top - secret joint U.S. - British intelligence program known as the Ultra Project .
" Prior to the United States ' entry into the war , " write Loftus and Aarons , " Roosevelt permitted British intelligence to wiretap American targets .
" According to our sources in the intelligence community , the area of coverage included a good bit of the New York financial district , several floors of Rockefeller Plaza , part of the RCA Building , two prominent clubs , and various shipping firms .
. . .
" The wiretap unit reported to Sir William Stephenson , a Canadian electronics genius better known by his code name , ' Intrepid . '
From his headquarters in the Rockefeller building , Stephenson 's job was to identify U.S. companies that were aiding the Nazis . " ( 3 ) " Several months before the United States declared war , " continue Loftus and Aarons , " Bill Donovan invited Allen Dulles to head up the New York branch of the Office of the Coordinator of Information ( COI ) , President Roosevelt 's new intelligence agency and the precursor to the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) .
Its primary mission was to collect information against the Nazis and their collaborators .
In other words , Dulles was asked to inform on his own clients in New York . . . . "
" Roosevelt had approved his selection as head of the COI Manhattan branch because he wanted Dulles where the British wiretappers could keep an eye on him .
. . .
" One floor below Dulles was Stephenson 's wiretap shop .
Inside Dulles 's operation was one of Roosevelt 's spies , Arthur Goldberg . . . " who , " confirmed . . . that Dulles 's appointment was a setup .
. . .
" Roosevelt was giving Dulles enough rope to hang himself .
From Stephenson 's Manhattan wiretaps , it is known that Dulles was continuing to work with his German business clients , who wanted to remove Hitler and install a puppet of their own who would make peace with the West while forging an alliance against Stalin .
It was to be a kinder , gentler Third Reich , favorably disposed to American financial interests .
. . . ( 4 ) " The wiretap evidence against Dulles originally was collected by a special section of Operation Safehaven , the U.S. Treasury Department 's effort to trace the movement of stolen Nazi booty towards the end of the war .
Roosevelt and Treasury Secretary Henry Morganthau had set up Dulles by giving him the one assignment - intelligence chief in Switzerland - where he would be most tempted to aid his German clients with their money laundering . "
Roosevelt had one thing in mind : " The sudden release of the Safehaven intercepts would force a public outcry to bring treason charges against those British and American businessmen who aided the enemy in time of war . "
Among the targets were Allen Dulles , Henry Ford , and other U.S. industrialists . ( 5 )
The plan failed , however , due to Dulles being " tipped off . . . that he was under surveillance " in time to cover his tracks .
One possible source of the leak was Vice President Henry Wallace , " who constantly shared information with his brother - in - law , the Swiss minister in Washington during the war . "
" Wallace , " the authors reveal , " gave many details of his secret meetings with Roosevelt to the Swiss diplomat . "
The problem was that , at the time , the Nazis " had recruited the head of the Swiss secret service . "
It is , perhaps , no coincidence that Roosevelt dropped Wallace during the 1944 election , choosing instead Senator Harry S. Truman as his new running mate . ( 6 )
THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY
" After the Nazis ' 1943 defeat at Stalingrad , " write Loftus and Aarons , " various Nazi businessmen realized they were on the losing side and made plans to evacuate their wealth .
The Peron government in Argentina was receiving the Nazi flight capital with open arms , and Dulles helped it hide the money .
. . .
" The Guinness Book of Records lists the missing Reichsbank treasure [ estimated at $ 2.5 billion dollars ] as the greatest unsolved bank robbery in history .
Where did it go ? . . . .
" According to our source , the bulk of the treasure was simply shipped a very short distance across Austria and through the Brenner Pass into Italy .
Dulles 's contacts were waiting at the Vatican .
The German - Vatican connection was how Allen Dulles and the Nazi industrialists planned to get away with it . . . . " ( 7 )
The effort was successful , according to the authors , who state that the " vast bulk of the wealth of the Nazi empire " which " disappeared before the end of World War II " reappeared " within a decade in the hands of the same men who financed Hitler 's war against the Jews .
Allen Dulles 's clients were not defeated , only inconvenienced . "
The authors identify two of Dulles 's accomplices as James Jesus Angleton and his father , Hugh Angleton .
The Angletons were members of X - 2 , the OSS counterintelligence branch in Italy , in 1943 .
Like Dulles , Hugh Angleton was financially involved with Axis powers .
He was the European representative for National Cash Register in Italy before the war and business associate of Dulles .
When World War II broke out , the authors write ,
" . . .
Angleton was crushed financially as all his investments were in enemy hands .
" Like Dulles 's clients , he wanted his money back .
Like Dulles , Hugh offered his services to the OSS . "
With high - placed contacts in Mussolini's Interior Ministry , Hugh was accepted and " promoted rapidly in U.S. intelligence .
He became second in command to Colonel Clifton Carter , the OSS commander in Italy at the end of World War II . " ( 8 )
Perhaps the most controversial information which is now emerging with the release of recently declassified documents concerning World War II , is the role of the Vatican , both in its pre-war German investments , and its role in helping Nazi war criminals escape justice after the war .
Concerning the Vatican - German investments , Loftus and Aarons are quite clear :
" That the Vatican encouraged such investments and even donated money to Hitler himself cannot be denied .
A German nun , Sister Pascalina , was present at its creation .
In the early 1920s she was the housekeeper for Archbishop of the Vatican - Nazi connection . . .
Eugenio Pacelli , then the papal nuncio in Munich .
Sister Pascalina vividly recalls receiving Adolf Hitler late one night and watching the archbishop give Hitler a large amount of Church money . "
In addition , Eugenio Pacelli
" later convinced the Vatican to invest millions of dollars in the rising German economy , money from the Vatican 's land settlement that ended the Pope 's claim of sovereignty over territory outside the walls of Vatican City .
It was Pacelli who negotiated the Concordat with Germany and then had to deal with the consequences of his own mistakes when he became pope on the eve of World War II .
" The Vatican and the Dulles brothers had the same problem .
Once their money was in Hitler 's hands , how would they get it back ? "
The authors interviewed " a former colonel in U.S. Military Intelligence who specialized in tracing enemy assets .
He claimed that only a tiny portion of the Reichbank 's gold ingots actually reached the Vatican Bank , while the rest was held in cooperative banks in Belgium , Liechtenstein , and especially Switzerland . "
It was only necessary to transfer the paperwork on the gold , not the gold itself .
Since , by that time , Dulles knew his telegraph communications were being monitored by the British wiretap operation in New York , he instead used couriers to " ensure absolute secrecy in moving the foreign currency and the ownership documents out of Switzerland . . . special agents of the Vatican who had diplomatic immunity to move back and forth across both Nazi and Allied lines . . . . " ( 9 )
" . . . .
The Vatican 's eminence grise for Balkan intelligence , the Bosnian - Croat priest Krunoslav Draganovic , was involved in transporting large quantities of Nazi booty , especially gold bullion , from Austria to the safety of the Holy See with the help of the Dulles - Angleton clique in Rome .
Some of the booty was transported in truck convoys run by British troops .
Other shipments were carried in U.S. Army jeeps provided to Father Draganovic so that he could conduct pastoral visits ' on behalf of the Vatican .
" Another ardent Nazi propagandist and agent , Slovenian bishop Gregory Rozman , was sent to Bern with the help of Dulles 's friends in U.S. intelligence .
Declassified U.S. intelligence files confirm that Bishop Rozman was suspected of trying to arrange the transfer of huge quantities of Nazi - controlled gold and Western currency that had been discreetly secreted in Swiss banks during the war .
For a few months the Allies prevented Rozman from gaining access to this treasure , but then the way was mysteriously cleared .
In fact , the Dulles - Vatican connection had fixed it , and before too long the bishop obtained the loot for his Nazi friends , who were hiding in Argentina .
" Such instances turned out to be only the tip of the iceberg .
It has long been acknowledged that it was Allen Dulles who tipped off General Patton about the buried German treasure that lay in the path of the U.S. Third Army .
Patton explicitly urged General Eisenhower to conceal as much of the gold as possible , but his advice was refused .
" Our sources claim that Dulles and his colleagues exerted a great deal of influence to ensure that Western investments in Nazi Germany were not seized by the Allies as reparations for the Jews .
After all , much of ' Hitler 's Gold ' had originally belonged to the bankers in London and New York .
The . . . captured Nazi loot went underground .
. . .
" In the cause of anticommunism , and to retrieve its own investments in Germany , the Vatican agreed to become part of Dulles 's smuggling window , through which the Nazis and their treasure could be moved to safety . " ( 10 )
On April 12th , 1945 , Roosevelt died , and Truman became President .
May 7th , Nazi Germany surrendered after the suicide of Adolf Hitler .
September 2nd , Japan surrendered .
World War II finally ended , but at the cost of more than 35,000,000 lives , over half that amount civilians .
The death toll for the United States was 294,000 . ( 11 )
A PLEDGE BETRAYED
" Dulles and some of his friends volunteered for postwar service with the government not out of patriotism but of necessity , " according to Loftus and Aarons .
" They had to be in positions of power to suppress the evidence of their own dealings with the Nazis .
The Safehaven investigation was quickly stripped from Treasury . . . and turned over to the State Department .
There Dulles 's friends shredded the index to the interlocking corporations and blocked further investigations .
" Dulles had this goal in mind :
Not a single American businessman was ever going to be convicted of treason for helping the Nazis .
None ever was , despite the evidence .
According to one of our sources in the intelligence community , the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps had two large ' Civilian Internment Centers ' in Occupied Germany , code named ' Ashcan ' and ' Dustbin . '
The CIC had identified and captured a large number of U.S. citizens who had stayed in Germany and aided the Third Reich all through World War II .
The evidence of their treason was overwhelming .
The captured German records were horribly incriminating .
" Yet Victor Wohreheide , the young Justice Department attorney responsible for preparing the treason trials , suddenly ordered the prisoners ' release .
All of the Nazi collaborators were allowed to return to the United States and reclaim their citizenship .
At the same time , another Justice Department attorney , O. John Rogge , who dared to make a speech about Nazi collaborators in the United States was quickly fired .
However , the attorney who buried the treason cases was later promoted to special assistant attorney general .
" Dulles and his clients had won .
The proof is in the bottom line .
Forty years after World War II , Fortune magazine published a list of the hundred richest men in the world .
There were no Jews on the list .
The great fortunes of the Rothschilds and Warburgs had been diminished to insignificance by the Depression , the Nazis , and World War II .
" Near the top of the list were several multibillionaires who had been prominent members of Hitler 's inner circle .
A few even had served time in Allied prisons as Nazi war criminals , but they were all released quickly .
The bottom line is that the Nazi businessmen survived the war with their fortunes intact and rebuilt their industrial empires to become the richest men in the world .
Dulles 's clients got away with it .
President Roosevelt 's dream of putting the Nazis ' moneymen on trial died with him . "
England also failed to see justice done , according to the authors : " The British authorities in Germany ordered the U.S. Army to release all of the VIP British Nazis and hand over the evidence against them .
Even before Roosevelt 's death , Churchill had already begun to withdraw from his commitment to prosecute Nazis . "
The reason ? "
Too many British industries might be seized as Nazi fronts .
Too many upper - class collaborators might have to be prosecuted .
The Germans were defeated , and the Soviets were now the enemy .
" Funding for British war crimes investigations suddenly dried up .
Nazi bankers such as Herman Abs were released from prison to work as economic advisers in the British zone of Germany .
The history of British ' efforts ' to punish Nazis after the war is aptly summarized in Tom Bower 's book , ' The Pledge betrayed ' . . . .
" The pattern was repeated all over the remnants of the Third Reich .
Despite direct orders from President Truman and General Eisenhower , I.G. Farben , the citadel of the Nazi industrialists , was never dismantled .
Dulles 's clients demanded , and received , Allied compensation for bomb damage to their factories in Germany .
Only a few of the top Nazis were executed .
Most of the rest were released from prison within a few years .
Others , . . . would go virtually unpunished .
No one ever investigated the Nazi sympathizers in Western intelligence who had made it all possible . " ( 12 )
As we have seen , the American industrialists who did business with the Nazis were in no way inconvenienced by war crimes trials , and even received compensation for damages to their Nazi war plants .
Some Nazi industrialists were charged and convicted by the Nuremberg war crimes trials but , in their book , " The American Establishment , " authors Leonard and Mark Silk observe that in the late 1940s " the United States and its leaders faced an agonizing moral problem in coming to terms with those German industrialists who had willingly done business with the Nazis and who were now just as willing to do business with the Americans in the reconstruction of Germany .
The problem was dramatized when those German industrialists who had been convicted of war crimes at Nuremberg were all released from Landsberg prison in early 1951 , their sentences commuted by the American High Commissioner [ of German Occupation ] , John J. McCloy .
" . . . .
Whatever the motivation , " the authors continue , " the blanket release of the convicted industrialists was taken within Germany - and by them - as a sign that businessmen were not to be seriously blamed for their involvement in matters for which others were hanged or suffered long imprisonment . " ( 13 )
The motivation for the mass release of imprisoned Nazi war criminals is described in the book , " The New Germany and the Old Nazis , " by T.H. Tetens , an expert in German affairs .
Tetens observes that in " 1950 , when Washington showed its eagerness to create a new German army of 500,000 men , the SS [ at that time reorganized into a neo - Nazi front group called HIAG , which stands for ' mutual assistance , ' a so - called veterans organization ] , together with the old Wehrmacht officers , started an all - out campaign for the immediate release of all war criminals .
It was a superbly organized blackmail action , enjoying wide support from the public , from all parties , and carried toward success by Dr. Adenauer 's astute maneuverings .
" The Chancellor suggested an inconspicuous way to solve the problem with ' parole , ' ' sick leave , ' and other roundabout methods .
The more the U.S. High Commission in Germany showed leniency , however , the stronger the pressure became : either ' all so - called war criminals are released or there will be no German army . '
American diplomats followed Dr. Adenauer 's plan to feed the nationalistic monster piecemeal .
Every few days we quietly released one or two more from prison - the Krupps , the I.G. Farben directors , and dozens of former Wehrmacht Generals .
On friendly advice from Washington , the British and the French , extremely reluctant , had to follow suit .
When the supply dried up , there remained behind bars only the SS , the mass murderers from Dachau , Belsen , and Buchenwald , and the toughs from the Waffen SS who had massacred American , British , and Canadian prisoners of war .
This put High Commissioner John McCloy in a most embarrassing position .
. . . "
Tetens explains how Chancellor Adenauer helped High Commissioner McCloy and the U.S. State Department avoid this embarrassment : Adenauer " suggested the formation of a review board , with three German members sitting in and having equal voice in making recommendations .
The whole procedure was to be shrouded in secrecy , and it was decided that the names of those released should not be revealed to the public .
In this way the last few hundred ' poor devils , ' those SS mass killers and sadists , were quietly set free within two or three years . " ( 14 )
Christopher Simpson , in his extensively documented book on the subject of U.S. recruitment of Nazis , " Blowback , " goes into more detail of the backgrounds of those released :
" The beneficiaries of this act included , for example , all of the convicted concentration camp doctors ; all of the top judges who had administered the Nazis ' ' special courts ' " and dozens of similar cases .
In addition , " McCloy 's clemency decisions for the Landsberg inmates set in motion a much broader process that eventually freed hundreds of other convicted Nazi war criminals over the next five years .
. . .
By the winter of 1950 - 1951 the most senior levels of the U.S. government had decided to abrogate their wartime pledge to bring Nazi war criminals to justice .
. . . in the interests of preserving West German military support for American leadership in the cold war .
While nazism and Hitler 's inner circle continued to be publicly condemned throughout the West , the actual investigation and prosecution of specific Nazi crimes came to a standstill . " ( 15 )
One case merits special attention : Sepp Dietrich , " the organizer of the Fuehrer 's bodyguard .
Dietrich carried out Hitler 's personal murder assignments " and , Tetens continues , " was in charge of the liquidation of the Jewish population in the city of Kharkov .
During the Battle of the Bulge his troops committed the Malmedy massacre , killing more than 600 military and civilian prisoners , among them 115 American G.I.s .
He was sentenced to death , and the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment .
In 1955 he was one of the last poor devils ' quietly released from prison and greeted by the Bonn government with the homecoming pay of 6,000 marks . " ( 16 )
In a " New York Times " article published February 1 , 1951 , one prominent American expressed support for the reduction of sentences for those responsible for the mass murder of the 600 unarmed prisoners of war at Malmedy , describing the decision as " extremely wise . "
The American was Senator Joseph McCarthy , Republican from Wisconsin .
Tetens observes that , despite the wide - spread fear by " the French , the British , and the smaller European countries " of a re-militarized Germany , " the outbreak of the Korean War ( June 1950 ) brought a total change .
The provisions which banned all military and veterans ' organizations lost all their meaning and were no longer enforced .
Western Germany was allowed by the Allies to set up its own General Staff , camouflaged under the name Blank Office .
Supported by Bonn and tolerated by the United States , a nation - wide network was created to reactivate the experienced officers and the man power of the old Wehrmacht .
The short period of 1950 - 51 must be marked as the time when Hitler 's old officers , SS leaders , and [ Nazi ] party functionaries returned to power and influence . " ( 17 )
Tetens ' comment that the Nazi's return to power in Germany was " tolerated by the United States " was a historical understatement .
By the time Tetens ' book was published in 1961 , hundreds of convicted Nazi war criminals had already been smuggled out of Germany to avoid prosecution at the war crimes trials at Nuremberg , recruited by , and on the payroll of several U.S. government agencies , including the Army CIC , the OSS , and the Office of Policy Coordination within the State Department .
Over the past fifty years , it is now documented , these Americanized fugitive Nazi war criminals have been involved in , and in many cases in charge of , many U.S. government covert operations -- international weapons smuggling , drug cartels , Central American death squads , right wing anti-communist dictatorships , LSD mind control experiments -- the Republican National Committee 's Ethnic Heritage Councils , and the Presidential campaigns of Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan , and George Bush .
THE GEHLEN ORGANIZATION
Probably the most influential Nazi to come to work for the United States intelligence agencies during the Cold War was named Gehlen .
" Reinhard Gehlen , " writes author Christopher Simpson , " Hitler 's most senior military intelligence officer on the eastern front , had begun planning his surrender to the United States at least as early as the fall of 1944 . "
Of " several hundred " high - ranking Nazi officers who switched sides at the end of World War II , Gehlen " proved to be the most important of them all .
" In early March 1945 Gehlen and a small group of his most senior officers carefully microfilmed the vast holdings on the USSR in the . . . military intelligence section of the German army 's general staff .
They packed the film in watertight steel drums and secretly buried it in remote mountain meadows scattered through the Austrian Alps .
Then , on May 22 , 1945 , Gehlen and his top aides surrendered to an American Counter - intelligence Corps [ CIC ] team . " ( 18 )
According to Tetens : " . . . [ Gehlen ] immediately asked for an interview with the commanding officer . . . " and offered the United States " his intelligence staff , spy apparatus , and the priceless files for future service . "
Gehlen was sent to Washington and his offer was taken .
" The Pentagon - Gehlen agreement , " states Tetens , " in practice guaranteed the continuation of the all - important Abwehr division of the German General Staff .
Hundreds of German army and SS officers were quietly released from internment camps and joined Gehlen 's headquarters in the Spessart Mountains in central Germany .
When the staff had grown to three thousand men , the Bureau Gehlen opened a closely guarded twenty - five - acre compound near Pullach , south of Munich , operating under the innocent name of the South German Industrial Development Organization .
. . .
" Within a few years the Gehlen apparatus had grown by leaps and bounds .
In the early fifties it was estimated that the organization employed up to 4,000 intelligence specialists in Germany , mainly former army and SS officers , and that more than 4,000 V - men ( undercover agents ) were active throughout the Soviet - bloc countries .
Gehlen 's spy network stretches from Korea to Cairo , from Siberia to Santiago de Chile .
. . .
When the Federal Republic [ of West Germany ] became a sovereign state in 1955 , the Bureau Gehlen was openly recognized as the official intelligence arm of the Bonn government . " ( 19 )
How important was the Gehlen Org , as it became known , to the history of the Cold War ?
Simpson 's research documents that it was perhaps the most significant element of all :
" . . . .
The Org became the most important eyes and ears for U.S. intelligence inside the closed societies of the Soviet bloc .
' In 1946 [ U.S. ] intelligence files on the Soviet Union were virtually empty , ' says Harry Rositzke , the CIA 's former chief of espionage inside the Soviet Union . '. . . .
Rositzke worked closely with Gehlen during the formative years of the CIA and credits Gehlen 's organization with playing a " primary role " in filling the empty file folders during that period .
. . .'
" ' Gehlen had to make his money by creating a threat that we were afraid of , ' says Victor Marchetti , formerly the CIA 's chief analyst of Soviet strategic war plans and capabilities , ' so we would give him more money to tell us about it . '
He continues : ' In my opinion , the Gehlen Organization provided nothing worthwhile for the understanding or estimating Soviet military or political capabilities in Eastern Europe or anywhere else . '
Employing Gehlen was 'a waste of time , money , and effort , except that maybe he had some CI [ counter - intelligence ] value , because practically everybody in his organization was sucking off both tits . ' " ( 20 )
By ' sucking off both tits ' Marchetti is referring to the fact that Gehlen 's elaborate operation was penetrated by Soviet spies at the very time it was our most important source of intelligence upon which the Cold War was based .
In fact , the Communists had infiltrated Nazi intelligence long before Gehlen switched sides .
TRIPLE CROSS
" In each generation , " write Aarons and Loftus , " Soviet intelligence created ' anti-Communist ' emigre front groups , ostensibly to foment revolution and topple Bolshevism .
The front groups attracted support from the West .
Considerable financial assistance was supplied and close ties forged with various Western intelligence services .
This enabled the Communist double agents running the front groups to co-opt the legitimate emigre opposition , splinter their leadership and provoke them into premature and poorly organized rebellions which were easily defeated .
More importantly , the false front groups were a vehicle for long - term Soviet penetration of Western society .
. . . "
The authors identify one of these groups as the Narodny Trudovoi Soyuz ( NTS ) , or the People 's Labour Alliance .
The NTS represented itself as a group of anti-communist " moles " inside the Kremlin and , in the 1920s , recruited a Communist agent named Prince Anton Vasilevich Turkel .
Turkel , who actually worked for Soviet Military intelligence ( GRU ) , went on to penetrate French , Japanese , Italian , British , German , and even the Vatican intelligence services before the end of World War II .
" After World War II , Turkel worked for West German intelligence ( the Gehlen Org ) , collaborated with many of the spy services of NATO , including the American Military Intelligence Service ( MIS - for offensive intelligence ) , the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps ( CIC - for defensive purposes ) , the ultra-secret State Department Office of Policy Co-ordination and the Central Intelligence Agency . . . " ( 21 )
" Just before World War II began , " according to the authors , " an Austrian Jew named Richard Kauder created a secret intelligence network , code named MAX . "
Kauder , using the name of [ Max ] Klatt - Turkel 's intelligence chief [ " Unholy Trinity , " Aarons and Loftus , p. 166 ] - " worked exclusively for Admiral Wilhelm Canaris , the German spy chief who collaborated with the Vatican and the British to topple Hitler during the war [ the group known as the Black Orchestra ] . "
The Nazis thought the Max network was made up of " so - called Fascist Jews " who " were willing to spy against the Soviet Union , not for the glory of the Third Reich but to save themselves and their families from the concentration camps . "
The Max network was supposed to have had " the only communication link to a secret network of ' White ' Russian Fascists inside the Kremlin [ Turkel 's NTS ] , who had supposedly infiltrated Stalin 's military headquarters prior to World War II . "
But , the authors continue , " the Max network was not made up of Fascist Jews .
They were , in fact , Communist Jews who risked their lives inside the heart of the Third Reich 's intelligence service . "
The Max network actually misled the Nazis , feeding them false intelligence on the capabilities and intentions of the Soviet Union , leading " the Nazi divisions into a series of death traps on the Eastern front . "
The Max double - agents were responsible for the Nazis defeats at Stalingrad , " the giant battle of Kursk where Hitler 's tank divisions were slaughtered .
The final sting , " continue the authors , " was to mislead Germany into believing that the Red army was on the verge of collapse in 1944 , when in fact the Soviets were preparing for the most massive onslaught of the war .
" It would not be an exaggeration to say that the ' Fascist Jews ' of the Max network did more to defeat the German army than all the Western intelligence services combined .
Seventy percent of all Hitler 's divisions were destroyed on the Eastern front , largely as a result of the misleading intelligence supplied by Max . " ( 22 )
When Gehlen was recruited by the United States , Allen Dulles ordered the ex-Nazi spymaster to " revive the Max network . "
Gehlen already had plans to do just that , intending " to make Turkel 's Max network the centerpiece of his new West German intelligence agency .
As soon as a Republican president was elected in the United States , Dulles intended to take over the CIA and make Gehlen and Turkel the heart of his anti-Soviet network .
The Soviets , of course , were delighted as they watched Dulles and Gehlen attempt to plant a Communist spy ring in the heart of Western intelligence .
. . .
" . . .
[ E]ventually , in 1956 , the Allies decided that the whole thing had been a giant Soviet - controlled operation .
Dozens of operations , hundreds of agents , thousands of innocent civilians had been betrayed .
. . . " . . .
[ T ] hree years after Dulles became head of CIA in 1953 , his pet ' Fascist , ' Turkel , broadcast the CIA codes to start the Hungarian uprising prematurely .
Thousands of innocent Hungarians rushed on to the streets of Budapest to start the revolution .
Instead of American paratroopers dropping supplies , they found Soviet tanks waiting in the suburbs . "
By 1959 , the collapse of Dulles 's spy network was almost total : " U.S. Military Intelligence admitted to the National Security Council that it did not have a single network of couriers or safe houses left in Communist territory , apart from East Germany .
Dulles 's Nazi ' freedom fighters ' had sold him out . " ( 23 )
COLD WARRIORS
It was Harry Rositze who best described the attitude of the United States military - intelligence establishment after the end of World War II : " Any bastard as long as he was anti-Communist . "
Rositze , the " former head of secret operations inside the USSR " for the CIA , was correct . ( 24 )
We have seen that many Nazis - including those who committed atrocities - returned to positions of power and influence inside Germany after the war .
Unknown until fairly recently was the extent of Nazi recruitment by U.S. intelligence agencies and political organizations , in the 1940s and 1950s .
Perhaps the most publicized program of Nazi recruitment is that of Project Paperclip , which involved the collection of Nazi rocket scientists and facilities , all of which were later incorporated into the U.S. Space Program .
Klaus Barbie 's employment by the U.S. State Department in the 1940s is another well - known incident .
Barbie , head of the Gestapo in Lyons , France , was known as the " Butcher of Lyons " and was sought by the French Government for atrocities committed against French Resistance fighters captured by the Nazis .
Barbie was recruited as a U.S. intelligence " asset " in 1947 by one branch of the State Department 's Counter - intelligence Corps ( CIC ) , while another branch , the Operation Selection Board , a joint U.S. / British project , was trying to put him in prison for war crimes .
Eventually , according to Aarons and Loftus , " Barbie 's employment ( and protection ) by the Americans began to reach French newspapers and politicians at least as early as 1948 .
They , in turn brought increasing pressure on the U.S. government through publicity and eventually through official notes requesting Barbie 's extradition from Germany .
That , in the final analysis , is why the CIC chose to provide Barbie with a new identity and safe passage to Argentina in 1951 , while thousands of other ex-Nazis who had been ' of interest ' to the CIC at one time or another have simply lived out their lives in Germany .
If the CIC had dumped Barbie when the French government began requesting his extradition , he would have had plenty of compromising things to say about the CIC . . . " ( 25 )
But when Barbie was eventually captured by Bolivian authorities in the early 1980s , and returned to France to face charges of war crimes , the U.S. government was forced to conduct an investigation into the Barbie affair .
The official position ? " . . . [ T ] his investigation concluded that the United States had indeed protected Barbie in Europe and engineered his escape but that Barbie was the only such Nazi who had been assisted in this fashion . " ( 26 )
As documented previously , this statement was false .
Hundreds , perhaps thousands , of Nazis were employed by the several U.S. agencies , from the CIC to the CIA , and used in covert operations overseas , as our first line of defense against Communism .
Others , equally as guilty of wartime atrocities , were brought into the United States for domestic political purposes .
This aspect of the U.S. - Nazi connection is well - documented , and deserves closer attention by the mainstream press .
One of the first researchers to reveal the connections between the U.S. government and the Nazis , was a lady named Mae Brussell of Carmel , California .
Her career as a conspiracy researcher and host of the weekly radio program " World Watchers International " began with the Kennedy assassination .
" In ferreting out every morsel from the Warren Report , " writes Jonathan Vankin , author of the book " Conspiracies , Cover-ups and Crimes , " " supplementing her research with untold amounts of reading from the ' New York Times ' to ' Soldier of Fortune , ' Brussell discovered not merely a conspiracy of a few renegade CIA agents , Mafiosi , and Castro haters behind Kennedy 's death , but a vast , invisible institutional structure layered into the very fabric of the U.S. political system .
" Comprising the government within a government were not just spies , gangsters , and Cubans , but Nazis .
Mae found that many of the commission witnesses -- whose testimony established Oswald as a lone nut ' -- had never even spoken to Oswald , or knew him only slightly .
The bulk of them were White Russian emigres living in Dallas .
Extreme in their anti-Communism , they were often affiliated with groups set up by the SS in World War II -- Eastern European ethnic armies used by the Nazis to carry out their dirtiest work .
" Brussell also discovered an episode from history rarely reported in the media , and not often taught in universities .
Those same collaborationist groups were absorbed by United States intelligence agencies .
They hooked up with the spy net of German General Reinhard Gehlen , Hitler 's Eastern Front espionage chief . "
" ' This is a story of how key Nazis . . . anticipated military disaster and laid plans to transplant nazism , intact but disguised , in havens in the West , ' wrote Mae Brussell in 1983 .
She did n't author too many articles , but this one , ' The Nazi Connection to the John F. Kennedy Assassination ' ( in ' The Rebel , ' a short - lived political magazine published by ' Hustler ' impresario Larry Flynt ) , was definitive , albeit convoluted .
" ' It is a story that climaxes in Dallas on November 22 , 1963 , when John Kennedy was struck down , ' Brussell 's article continued .
' And it is a story with an aftermath -- America 's slide to the brink of Fascism . ' "
Mae Brussell quit broadcasting her radio show in Spring of 1988 , after receiving a death threat from a " man who is said to have identified himself as ' a fascist and proud of it . ' "
The last project she worked on , before her death from cancer on October 3 , 1988 , writes the author , " was a study of Satanic cults -- within the U.S. military .
The hidden fascist oligarchy had progressed far beyond the need for patsies like Oswald .
They were now able , Brussell asserted , to hypnotically program assassins .
" Satanic cults are the state of the art in brainwashing .
With drugs , sex , and violence , they strip any semblance of moral thought .
They are perfect for use in creating killers .
The United States military , Brussell found , was using them . " ( 27 )

RICHARD MILHOUSE NIXON
In this section we will explore the Nazi connections of Richard Nixon .
To do so we must return to the years just after the end of World War II and , of course , a man named Dulles .
The irony of Nixon 's political career ending with a cover - up can only be appreciated with the knowledge that this turbulent career also began with one .
Loftus and Aarons state that :
" According to several of our sources among the ' old spies , ' Richard Nixon 's political career began in 1945 , when he was the navy officer temporarily assigned to review . . . captured Nazi documents . "
The documents in question revealed the wartime record of Karl Blessing , " former Reichsbank officer and then head of the Nazi oil cartel , Kontinentale Ol A.G. ' Konti ' was in partnership with Dulles 's principal Nazi client , I.G. Farben .
Both companies had despicable records regarding their treatment of Jews during the Holocaust .
After the war Dulles not only ' lost ' Blessings Nazi party records , but he helped peddle a false biography in the ever - gullible ' New York Times . ' "
The authors ' sources reveal that not only did Dulles help cover up his Nazi client 's record , he " personally vouched for Blessing as an anti-Nazi in order to protect continued control of German oil interests in the Middle East .
Blessing 's Konti was the Nazi link to Iben Saud [ King of Saudi Arabia ] and Aramco [ the Arabian - American Oil Company ] .
If Blessing went down , he could have taken a lot of people with him , including Allen Dulles .
The cover - up worked , except that U.S. Naval Intelligence scrutinized a set of the captured Konti records . "
According to the " old spies , " Allen Dulles made a deal with the young navy officer who was reviewing the Konti files - Richard Nixon .
Nixon would help Dulles bury the Konti files .
In return , Allen Dulles " arranged to finance [ Nixon 's ] first congressional campaign against Jerry Voorhis . " ( 1 )
Dulles 's support for Nixon paid off in 1947 when , as the freshman congressman from California , he " saved John Foster Dulles considerable embarrassment by privately pointing out that confidential government files showed that one of Foster 's foundation employees , Alger Hiss , was allegedly a Communist .
The Dulles brothers took Nixon under their wing and escorted him on a tour of Fascist ' freedom fighter ' operations in Germany , apparently in anticipation that the young congressman would be useful after Dewey became president . "
[ He would be useful anyway , despite the fact that incumbent President Truman won reelection in 1948 , defeating Dewey . ] ( 2 )
After Truman 's victory , write the authors , " Nixon became Allen Dulles 's mouthpiece in Congress .
Both he and Senator Joseph McCarthy received volumes of classified information to support the charge that the Truman administration was filled with ' pinkos . '
When McCarthy went too far in his Communist investigations , it was Nixon who worked with his next - door neighbor , CIA director Bedell Smith , to steer the investigations away from the intelligence community .
" The CIA was grateful for Nixon 's assistance , but did not know the reason for it .
Dulles had been recruiting Nazis under the cover of the State Department 's Office of Policy Coordination , whose chief , Frank Wisner , had systematically recruited the Eastern European emigre networks that had worked first for the SS , then the British , and finally Dulles .
" The CIA did not know it , but Dulles was bringing them to the United States less for intelligence purposes than for political advantage .
The Nazis ' job quickly became to get out the vote for the Republicans .
One Israeli intelligence officer joked that when Dulles used the phrase ' Never Again , ' he was not talking about the Holocaust but about Dewey 's narrow loss to Truman .
In the eyes of the Israelis , Allen Dulles was the demon who infected Western intelligence with Nazi recruits .
" In preparation for the 1952 Eisenhower - Nixon campaign , the Republicans formed an Ethnic Division , which , to put it bluntly , recruited the ' displaced Fascists ' who arrived in the United States after World War II .
Like similar migrant organizations in several Western countries , the Ethnic Division attracted a significant number of Central and Eastern European Nazis , who had been recruited by the SS as political and police leaders during the Holocaust .
These Fascist emigres supported the Eisenhower - Nixon ' liberation ' policy as the quickest means of getting back into power in their former homelands and made a significant contribution ' in its first operation ( 1951/1952 ) . ' "
The authors point out that " over the years the Democrats had acquired one or two Nazis of their own , such as Tscherim Soobzokov , a former member of the Caucasian SS who worked as a party boss in New Jersey .
But in 90 percent of the cases , the members of Hitler 's political organization went to the Republicans .
In fact , from the very beginning , the word had been put around among Eastern European Nazis that Dulles and Nixon were the men to see , especially if you were a rich Fascist . . . " ( 3 )
This relationship between Richard Nixon and the Nazis developed because both he and Allen Dulles " blamed Governor Dewey 's razor - thin loss to Truman in the 1948 presidential election on the Jewish vote .
When [ Nixon ] became Eisenhower 's vice president in 1952 , Nixon was determined to build his own ethnic base .
" Vice President Nixon 's secret political war of Nazis against Jews in American politics was never investigated at the time .
The foreign language - speaking Croatian and other Fascist emigre groups had a ready - made network for contacting and mobilizing the Eastern European ethnic bloc .
There is a very high correlation between CIA domestic subsidies to Fascist ' freedom fighters ' during the 1950s and the leadership of the Republican party 's ethnic campaign groups .
The motive for under - the - table financing was clear : Nixon used Nazis to offset the Jewish vote for the Democrats .
" In 1952 Nixon had formed an Ethnic Division within the Republican National Committee .
' Displaced Fascists , hoping to be returned to power by an Eisenhower - Nixon " liberation " policy signed on ' with the committee .
In 1953 , when Republicans were in office , the immigration laws were changed to admit Nazis , even members of the SS .
They flooded into the country .
Nixon himself oversaw the new immigration program .
As vice president , he even received Eastern European Fascists in the White House .
After a long , long journey , the Croatian Nazis had found a new home in the United States , where they reestablished their networks .
" In 1968 Nixon promised that if he won the presidential election , he would create a permanent ethnic council within the Republican party .
Previously the Ethnic Division was allowed to surface only during presidential campaigns .
Nixon 's promise was carried out after the 1972 election , during [ George ] Bush 's tenure as chairman of the Republican National Committee .
The Croatian Ustashis became an integral part of the campaign structure of Republican politics , along with several other Fascist organizations . " ( 4 )
The authors describe Nixon 's pro-Nazi activities in no uncertain terms : " Nixon himself personally recruited ex-Nazis for his 1968 presidential campaign .
Moreover , Vice President Nixon became the point man for the Eisenhower administration on covert operations and personally supervised Allen Dulles 's projects while Ike was ill in 1956 and 1957 . " ( 5 )
One of the Nazis recruited by candidate Nixon was Laszlo Pasztor , described by Aarons and Loftus as " the founding chair of Nixon 's Republican Heritage Groups council " who , " during World War II . . . was a diplomat in Berlin representing the Arrow Cross government of Nazi Hungary , which supervised the extermination of the Jewish population .
" [ A ] fter Nixon won [ the 1968 Presidential Election ] , he approved Pasztor 's appointment as chief organizer of the ethnic council .
Not surprisingly , Pasztor 's ' choices for filling emigre slots as the council was being formed included various Nazi collaborationist organizations . '
The former Fascists were coming out of the closet in droves .
" The policy of the Nixon White House was an ' open door ' for emigre Fascists , and through the door came such guests as Ivan Docheff , head of the Bulgarian National Front and chairman of the American Friends of the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations ( ABN ) .
. . . an organization dominated by war criminals and fugitive Fascists .
Yet Nixon welcomed them with open arms and even had Docheff to breakfast for a prayer meeting to celebrate Captive Nations Week . "
( 6 ) " During Nixon 's ' Four More Years ' campaign in 1971 - 1972 , Laszlo Pasztor again played a key role in marshaling the ethnic vote .
No longer a marginal player on the fringes , now he held a key position as the Republican National Committee 's nationalities director .
. . .
" The Republican leadership cannot claim ignorance as a defense .
[ Syndicated Columnist Jack ]
Anderson 's famous expose of Nixon 's Nazis appeared in ' The Washington Post ' at the same time as the November 1971 convention .
Among those mentioned was Laszlo Pasztor , ' the industrious head of the GOP ethnic groups , [ who ] was never asked about his wartime activities in Hungary by the four GOP officials who interviewed him for his job . '
It was too embarrassing for Nixon to admit that Pasztor had been a ranking member of a Fascist government at war with the United States . " . . . .
It is one thing to promote obscure Eastern European Fascist movements in the Republican party .
It is quite another to let the German Nazis have a major influence .
After 1953 , the Republican administration changed the rules , and even members of the Waffen SS could immigrate to the United States as long as they claimed only to have fought the Communists on the Eastern Front . " ( 7 )
The Republican / Nixon attraction to Nazism was also observed by Robert J. Groden and Harrison Edward Livingstone , authors of the book , " High Treason , " dealing with the Kennedy A
June 19 , 2008  -- Sen. Barack Obama 's decision to forgo public financing for his presidential campaign clears the way for him to outspend Sen.
John McCain by 3 - to - 1 or substantially more in the general election , a financial edge that dramatically rewrites the playbooks for both candidates .
With the possibility of spending perhaps $ 500 million just in the final two months of the campaign , Obama will be the first major - party candidate to enjoy a spending edge in the general election in more than 30 years .
The comparison with the consistently cash - strapped McCain campaign could hardly be more stark .
" It 'll be like George Steinbrenner 's Yankees in the '90s — an All - Star at every position — against the '90s Kansas City Royals , barely able to meet their payroll , " said Chris Lehane , a Democratic consultant who worked for Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004 .
Though Obama risks a short - term political backlash by seeming to go back on his word , Democratic and Republican strategists say most campaigns would take such a hit in exchange for the unprecedented cash advantage he 'll derive .
McCain said Thursday he will accept public financing , meaning he 'll be limited to spending only $ 84.1 million in the critical window between the Republican National Convention and Election Day .
He 'll be forced to lean more heavily on the Republican National Committee and outside groups that he cannot legally coordinate spending decisions with .
In that same time period , Obama will continue to be free to raise and spend unlimited amounts — with advertising specialists and party insiders projecting that he will bring in hundreds of millions of dollars , utilizing and expanding on the most efficient fundraising operation in American political history .
" He 's going to be able to raise almost unimaginable amount of money , " said Tad Devine , a Democratic strategist who was a top adviser in the Gore and Kerry campaigns .
" This is an incredible advantage for him and his campaign .
He 'll be able to dictate the terms of this election . "
" This is bigger than Obama being ahead in the polls , " Devine continued .
" This means he can be the aggressor . "
Some party strategists say Obama could use his immense cash advantage to run a national ad campaign akin to marketing drives run by companies like McDonald 's and Nike , while simultaneously engaging in targeted , state - level organizing that could leave McCain on the defensive in states that have rarely been competitive in years past .
On Thursday , Obama released his first ad since wrapping up the Democratic nomination , and it hints at the potential scope of ad buys to come .
His message will run in 18 states , including perennial Republican strongholds Alaska , Montana , North Carolina , and North Dakota , as well as classic swing states Florida , Michigan , Ohio and Pennsylvania .
" If the ad buy looks like this in October , this election 's over , " said Ken Goldstein , director of the Wisconsin Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
" He 's competing in red states , and he does n't even feel he needs to advertise in blue states . "
Obama 's decision could also hasten the end of the post - Watergate campaign - financing system that has leveled presidential playing fields for more than three decades .
Both major - party candidates have opted into the public campaign - finance system since it was put into place in time for the 1976 elections .
The system — which relies on money from taxpayer check - offs selected by fewer than 10 percent of tax filers — has been widely criticized in recent years , and both McCain and Obama have expressed interest in making revisions .
" When at least one candidate is n't taking money at all , and 90 percent of taxpayers are n't paying into the system , you know something 's wrong with the system , " said Massie Ritsch , a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics , which tracks political spending .
Bob Bauer , the Obama campaign 's general counsel , told reporters in Washington Thursday that Obama would push to update the system in time for the 2012 elections .
" That architecture has to be revamped , " Bauer said .
" There are … measures to do just that for both the primary and the general that I think will restore its viability as a vehicle — make it attractive — and bring candidates back to public funding beginning in the 2012 presidential election . "
Obama has already shattered monthly campaign fund - raising records , and is on pace to obliterate all previous markers .
He has raised more than $ 250 million just through the end of April for his primary campaign .
With nearly half of his money coming from donors who 've given less than $ 200 , he can tap most of his 1.5 million donors repeatedly before they reach the maximum of $ 2,300 each .
That 's not even counting the pool of Hillary Clinton donors available to him now that she has left the race .
Obama 's spending could reach a saturation point :
Even corporate giants know there 's such a thing as too much messaging to throw at consumers .
Both candidates will get wide press coverage throughout the campaign , and such " free media " can be just as important in an election 's outcome .
The McCain campaign is hoping Obama 's decision will tarnish his image as a reformer .
Obama committed publicly to pursuing an agreement with McCain that would involve both of them taking public dollars , only to abandon it less than two weeks after he became the presumptive Democratic nominee , with Clinton 's exit .
" This election is about a lot of things but it 's also about trust .
It 's also about whether you can take people 's word , " McCain said Thursday in Iowa .
The candidates ' spending does n't tell the whole story , since other organizations chip in .
Republicans will be able to compete financially through the auspices of the RNC — which has done a far better job raising money than its Democratic counterpart — and outside groups , which played a major role in 2004 and are already spending this year .
But , Goldstein said , a critical difference will be that the Obama campaign will have full control of its resources , while the McCain campaign will have to lean on outside groups with which it cannot , by law , discuss strategy or messaging .
" It not only gives him tons of money , more importantly , it gives him tons of control , " Goldstein said .
" Obama can freeze the race .
It can put so much money up there that it spends McCain into oblivion . "
Devine said that Kerry 's decision to accept public funds in 2004 was " one of the biggest mistakes we made " in the campaign .
Kerry had to make his money last five weeks longer than President Bush did , because of the timing of the two conventions , and Kerry was not advertising on television at all when the Swift boat attacks began in August .
With Obama already up in the polls — and the likelihood of a big Election Day for Democrats nationwide — the financial edge could be the last piece Obama needs , Lehane said .
" The resource advantage on top of the current trends is a potential game - changer , " he said .
" This is a completely different paradigm from the way presidential campaigns have been run over the last 20 or 25 years . "

The Jackass Story
For all of you who occasionally have a really bad day when you just need to
take it out on someone :
Do n't take that bad day out on someone you know , take
it out on someone you * do n 't* know !
Now get this .
I was sitting at my desk , when I remembered a phone call I had to make .
I
found the number and dialed it .
A man answered nicely saying , " Hello ? "
I politely said , " This is Patrick Hanifin and could I please speak to Robin
Carter ? "
Suddenly the phone was slammed down on me !
I could n't believe that anyone
could be that rude .
I tracked down Robin 's correct number and called her .
She had transposed the last two digits incorrectly .
After I hung up with
Robin , I spotted the wrong number still lying there on my desk .
I decided to
call it again .
When the same person once more answered , I yelled , " You 're a jackass ! " and
hung up .
Next to his phone number I wrote the word " jackass , " and put it in
my desk drawer .
Every couple of weeks , when I was paying bills , or had a
really bad day , I 'd call him up .
He 'd answer , and I 'd yell , " You 're a jackass ! "
It would always cheer me up .
Later in the year the Phone Company introduced caller ID .
This was a real
disappointment for me , I would have to stop calling the jackass .
Then one day I had an idea .
I dialed his number , then heard his voice say ,
" Hello . " I made up a name .
" Hi . This is the sales office of the Telephone
Company and I 'm just calling to see if you 're familiar with our caller ID
program ? "
He went , " No ! " and slammed the phone down .
I quickly called him back and said , " That 's because you 're a jackass ! "
The reason I took the time to tell you this story , is to show you how if there 's
ever anything really bothering you , you can do something about it .
Just dial
823-4863 .
The old lady at the mall really took her time pulling out of the parking space .
I did n't think she was ever going to leave .
Finally , her car began to move and she started to very slowly back out of the
slot .
I backed up a little more to give her plenty of room to pull out .
" Great , "
I thought , she 's finally leaving .
All of a sudden this black Camaro comes flying
up the parking isle in the wrong direction and pulls into her space .
I started honking my horn and yelling , " You ca n't just do that , Buddy .
I was
here first ! "
The guy climbed out of his Camaro completely ignoring me .
He
walked toward the mall as if he did n't even hear me .
I thought to myself , " This
guy 's a jackass .
There sure a lot of jackasses in this world . "
I noticed he had a " For Sale " sign in the back window of his car .
I wrote down
the number .
Then I hunted for another place to park .
A couple of days later , I 'm at home sitting at my desk .
I had just gotten off
the phone after calling 823-4863 and yelling , " You 're a jackass ! " ( It 's really
easy to call him now since I have his number on speed dial . )
I noticed the
phone number of the guy with the black Camaro lying on my desk and thought
I 'd better call this guy , too .
After a couple rings someone answered the phone and said , " Hello . "
I said , " Is this the man with the black Camaro for sale ? "
" Yes , it is . "
" Can you tell me where I can see it ? "
" Yes , I live at 1802 West 34th street .
It 's a yellow house and the car 's
parked right out front . "
I said , " What 's your name ? "
" My name is Don Hansen . "
" When 's a good time to catch you , Don ? "
" I 'm home in the evenings . "
" Listen Don , can I tell you something ? "
" Yes . "
" Don , you 're a jackass ! "
And I slammed the phone down .
After I hung up I added Don Hansen 's number to my speed dialer .
For a while
things seemed to be going better for me .
Now when I had a problem I had two
jackasses to call .
Then , after several months of calling the jackasses and
hanging up on them , it just was n't as enjoyable as it used to be .
I gave the
problem some serious thought and came up with a solution :
First , I had my phone dial Jackass # 1 .
A man answered nicely saying , " Hello . "
I yelled " You 're a jackass ! " but I did n't hang up .
The jackass said , " Are you still there ? "
I said , " Yeah . "
He said , " Stop calling me . "
I said , " No . "
He said , " What 's you name , pal ? "
I said , " Don Hansen . "
He said , " Where do you live ? "
" 1802 West 34th Street .
It 's a yellow house and my black Camaro 's parked
out front . "
" I 'm coming over right now , Don .
You 'd better start saying your prayers . "
" Yeah , like I 'm really scared , Jackass ! " and I hung up .
Then I called Jackass # 2 .
He answered , " Hello . "
I said , " Hello , Jackass ! "
He said , " If I ever find out who you are ... "
" You 'll what ? "
" I 'll kick your butt . "
" Well , here 's your chance .
I 'm coming over right now Jackass ! "
And I hung up .
Then I picked up the phone and called the police .
I told them I was at 1802
West 34th Street and that I was going to kill my gay lover as soon as he got
home .
Another quick call to Channel 13 about the gang war going on down W. 34th
Street .
After that , I climbed into my car and headed over to 34th Street to
watch the whole thing .
Glorious watching two Jackasses kicking the crap out
of each other in front of six squad cars and a police helicopter was one of the
greatest experiences of my life !
The moral ?
Be nice to people on the phone and wait your turn !
Since then , the prices of oil and gasoline have just kept rising .
Over the last three months , the average retail price of unleaded regular gasoline was $ 3.75 a gallon , nearly 65 cents higher than the average price in the first quarter of the year , according to the Oil Price Information Service .
The research group has estimated that Americans are now spending $ 1.6 billion a day on gasoline , which would make July the first month ever when the American gasoline bill would top $ 50 billion .
Tom Kloza , the group ’s chief oil analyst , predicted that a barrel of oil would reach $ 155 by August and that retail prices for gasoline would rise to $ 4.25 to $ 4.50 a gallon for unleaded regular .
“ The firecrackers are going off in the oil market and it will burn the U.S. consumers this holiday weekend , ” Mr. Kloza said .
He added that truckers stood to suffer most , noting that diesel prices rose 13 cents a gallon Wednesday afternoon in response to the Energy Department report .
“ Diesel is the bullet with the most acceleration at the moment , ” he said .
“ You are going to see a lot of bankruptcies in the trucking business . ”
Pushing up the price of crude are any number of factors , including continued instability in Nigeria , a partial strike at Venezuela ’s state oil company and reports that Israel is considering an attack on Iran .
Yet another reason for oil ’s price climb came with the Energy Department ’s weekly statistical bulletin , which showed that crude oil stocks had slipped by nearly 2 million barrels to below 300 million barrels .
Analysts say that level is psychologically important because crude oil stocks as recently as last year were above 350 million barrels .
The inventory level was the lowest since January , and below what most analysts had expected .
The crude oil inventory figure was 54 million barrels below a year ago , and nearly 22 million barrels below the five - year average , according to tabulations by Barclays Capital .
There was also some modestly good news in the report .
Gasoline inventories rose 2.1 million barrels to 210.9 million barrels , an indication that gasoline demand is slackening a bit as drivers car - pool , buy more efficient cars , and use more mass transit when it is available .
On 8 May , Mexico's top policeman , Edgar Millan , was shot dead outside his home in Mexico City .
It is the equivalent of killing the head of the Metropolitan Police in London , or the director of the FBI in the US .
Two other senior officers were then killed in the space of two days , the murders blamed on Mexico 's powerful drug gangs .
The BBC News website looks at the violence and its impact in Mexico and also in the neighbouring US : Acting police chief Edgar Millan was shot nine times at his home
The seriousness of the current violence in Mexico was thrown into stark relief this week when at least three high - ranking officers crossed into the US to seek political asylum because of the threats they had been facing from the drug cartels .
Seeking political asylum is , of course , usually associated with individuals fleeing persecution from governments and their forces of law and order , but in Mexico it seems it is the forces of law and order that are being persecuted .
In recent weeks , at least six senior police chiefs have been murdered .
The most prominent murder was that of Mr Millan , the acting head of Mexico 's Federal Police Force ( PFP ) .
At least one gunman was able to get into Mr Millan 's home garage in Mexico City and wait for him .
When he arrived , he was shot nine times .
The holes in the walls of his house at 132 Camelia Street show many bullets were fired .
It means not even the head of the 22,000 - strong Federal Police Force is safe .
Retaliation ?
Mexican President Felipe Calderon , who attended Mr Millan 's funeral , has spoken about " taking the streets back " from the cartels .
President Felipe Calderon has taken steps to try to curb the violence
An extra 3,000 or so army troops and federal police have been sent to the Pacific state of Sinaloa in another attempt by the government to stop the violence .
Police sources believe it was the Sinaloa cartel which organised Mr Millan 's killing .
They may even have hired a serving federal police officer to carry out the attack .
An officer suspected of being involved is among those who have been arrested .
But why shoot Edgar Millan in the first place ?
No one knows exactly .
He had been heading a force that had arrested dozens of members of the Sinaloa cartel .
One of its leaders , Alfredo Beltran Leyva , was taken into custody in January .
That might have been motive enough for a cartel retaliation .
Dangerous elements
But there are other theories that are more calculating on the part of the cartels and so more chilling .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement According to George Friedman , an intelligence analyst for the Stratfor group : " The Sinaloa cartel struck in Mexico City not only to kill troublesome officials , but also to pose a problem for the Mexican government by increasing areas requiring forces , thereby requiring the government to consider splitting its forces . "
Sophisticated stuff for what are effectively gangs of well - armed drug smugglers .
Mr Calderon has sent about 30,000 troops and federal forces to areas across Mexico to try to curb the violence .
Splitting that deployment by creating more pockets of unrest would serve the cartels well .
The cartels ' most dangerous elements include former army special forces troops who are collectively known as the Zetas .
They , more than most , would understand the importance of diluting an enemy 's capabilities .
Cartel cash Shooting police officers and soldiers is not a new tactic .
In Ciudad Juarez , which borders the US city of El Paso , 12 police officers have been killed so far this year .
The police are targeted in part because they try to disrupt the cartels ' activities .
But , in some cases , it is because they themselves have been colluding with the gangs .
In March , soldiers in the northern state of Tamaulipas caught six local police chiefs at a petrol station sporting luxury watches and carrying envelopes stuffed with money .
Few doubt it was cartel cash .
Their illicit drugs trade to the US is said to be worth $ 20 bn ( £ 10 bn ) - a lot of money to buy off bad cops .
On a much grander scale , the entire police force of Tijuana last year had their guns taken away because of suspicions some of those guns were being used for cartel business .
The guns were later returned .
Cross - border impact
Some optimists have suggested the cartels may finally be on the defensive - working together , partly out of desperation , to try to counter the government clampdown .
Smugglers have used tunnels to move drugs and guns across the border
There has been evidence of cartel co-operation in the past , but usually only to confront other cartels , not to gang up on the country 's army and federal police .
And no -one is yet seriously suggesting that the Gulf cartel , the Sinaloa cartel , the Arellano Felix cartel and all the others have come to some sort of expedient understanding in a last - gasp attempt to save their operations .
Another theory is that the recent spate of shootings of officers may just be coincidence in a random selection of score - settling .
For example , one officer to die recently had his name on a hit list found on a police memorial several months ago .
Wherever the truth lies , it 's rattling Washington .
" We are shocked by the escalating violence against Mexican law enforcement officials , " said US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack .
He called the recent attacks " a brutal reaction to President Calderon 's determination to fight organised crime " .
These are not just soothing neighbourly words unmatched by actions .
The US is now deeply involved in the fight against the cartels .
Illicit guns Operation Gunrunner , organised by the US Bureau for Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( the ATF ) , is just one initiative currently in place between the two countries .
I do n't think that generally the American public has any sense of the level of violence that occurs on the border
Jayson Ahern
US Customs and Border Protection Its aim is to block the smuggled arms trade between the US and Mexico .
Fully 95 % of all guns being used by the cartels in Mexico originate in US gun shops .
Many gun shop owners have been arrested , accused of being complicit in the trade .
Wittingly or unwittingly , Americans , it seems , are arming something approaching a war on their southern border .
" It 's almost like a military fight , " says Jayson Ahern , the deputy commissioner of the US Customs and Border Protection .
" I do n't think that generally the American public has any sense of the level of violence that occurs on the border . "
The violence has already spilled into the US .
Seven front - line border agents were killed last year and two so far this year .
Some of that is the result of attacks by people - smugglers , but those same routes used to sneak in illegal migrants are also used by the cartels .
Ruthless pursuit President George W Bush has requested $ 550 m ( £ 225 m ) to fight drug crime in Mexico .
Congress is currently considering the proposal .
Mr Bush has asked the US Congress for cash to fight Mexican drug crime
It is not just to protect police officers and soldiers - civilians are being killed too .
Some 1,100 people - about nine a day - have been killed in Mexico so far this year in drug - related violence .
Not all were police officers or cartel members .
Since 2006 , just two and a half years , more than 6,000 people have died .
For comparison , in Iraq , the combined total of American and British military personnel deaths is around 4,200 since 2003 .
" We have to come together to confront this evil , we Mexicans have to definitively and categorically say ' That 's enough ! ' , " Mr Calderon said .
But it does n't appear to be enough for the cartels .
Their ruthless pursuit of illicit drugs profits means anyone , in uniform or out , can end up as an addition to Mexico 's escalating tally of violent statistics .

Reading some of the excerpts from " The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder " by Bugliosi , he seems to think bush should be tried for murder ...
[ snip ]
" If Bush were impeached , convicted in the Senate , and removed from office , he 'd still be a free man , still be able to wake up in the morning with his cup of coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice and read the morning paper , still travel widely and lead a life of privilege , still belong to his country club and get standing ovations whenever he chose to speak to the Republican faithful .
This , for being responsible for over 100,000 horrible deaths ?*
For anyone interested in true justice , impeachment alone would be a joke for what Bush did . "
Prosecution
Darn , what is the right thing to do ?
You got to get him / them , but which is the best way ?
My head hurts , how do you guys stay sane ?
Wow , Kucinich is really covering the " election fraud " .
Proud for you too Brad .

Kucinich is to be commended for doing this , but this will likely go no where , in part , because it 's Kucinich doing it .
The useless and worthless pro-war , pro-corporate Bush - ass eating Dems run as far away from Kucinich as they possibly can .
So there you go .
If it were the Traitor of the House Pelosi doing this , then this would be a different story but it 's Kucinich .
And it was John Conyers who said on DemocracyNow !
that he had the Constitution in one hand and a watch in the other , and there 's no time for impeachment .
And he said all that garbage months ago .
So since there supposedly was n't time months ago , why would there be time now ?
The Dems would say that they can't have the " distraction " of impeachment and that they have to focus on Obama and " winning the White House " and that the nation can't endure a divisive impeachment process .
That 's what the Dems are likely to puke out once again , if they say anything .
I have n't seen anything from the Bush State Media ( corporate media ) on this .
Kucinich is what a Dem is supposed to be like .
Unfortunately , this is just another flash in the pan .
I suppose the koolaid drinkers will get all excited about it and be jumping up and down with grandiose expectations and wishful - thinking as they usually do ( only to later be disappointed time and time again ) , but in the big picture it 's likely to be meaningless .
Also , Kucinich introduced Articles of Impeachment for Cheney in April 2007 and we see where that went : no where .

I agree it will probably not go anywhere , but what Kucinich is doing " looks " good to me , and to the rest of the world I would think .
At least it is being acknowledged OUT LOUD and on record .
The silence was deafening and that is misunderstood as not caring .

Back at the beginning of this decade Kucinich relied on a cointelpro spook named Carol Rosin to write up a peace in space bill .
The draft included the word chemtrails .
Unfortunately , the draft also included the phrase extra-terrestrial space weapons .
Back then it was fairly obvious that specific aircraft were creating artificial cloud cover .
Now all these years later , we have seen only two newscasts give an objective few minutes to this story .
{ KSLA News12 Louisiana and KNBC News4 Los Angeles} Paid trolls are all over the internet .
Paid trolls like Carol Rosin with ties to the nazi Werner Von Braun unfortunately end up drafting these kind of bills .
Beware of the bait and switch .
Go over that bill or whatever with a fine toothed comb .

To everyone that does n't " know " what to do next .
You need to look inside yourselves and ask yourself , do you believe in the United States Constitution , and Freedom , or do n't you ?
There is where you will find your answer .
Do n't be swayed by anyone saying this will amount to nothing .
Stop being a child , think for yourselves , grow up and see the corruption and do something about it .
DO you want to live free or do you want the same old crap to drudge on ?
Do n't even be swayed by me .
You got to decide yourselves .
Freedom or same old shit ?
Screw what everyone says .
Answer that to your own heart and mind .
Then , Grow some balls of steel , Kucinich has !

Phil # 18 :
You need to look inside yourselves and ask yourself , do you believe in the United States Constitution , and Freedom , or do n't you ?
There is where you will find your answer .
Do n't be swayed by anyone saying this will amount to nothing .
Your message is misdirected in my view .
Other than a few people on here who have tried to smear Kucinich , I think most people on here support him as I have .
Your message should be directed to the scum in congress , particularly the Bush - enablers in congress .
I said this would likely amount to nothing , just like the April 2007 Cheney Articles of Impeachment which have essentially gone nowhere and which Kucinich brought up .
One can wish otherwise but wishing does n't make it so .
I have wished since 2000 that the Dems would be an opposition party and not a Bush - enabling party .
The Dems have been part of all this so they are not likely to impeach two of their " own " people ( Bush / Cheney ) and the two people they have been enabling and complicit with .
The Dems would implicate themselves in any impeachment hearings .
That 's , in part , why it 's not likely to go anywhere .
But many people refuse to see this because they have this unrealistic vision of what they think the Dems still are today as opposed to what they really are .
And those who are trying to make excuses for the useless Dems --- who are in power in the majority --- by saying there 's not time for impeachment or that it will be a " distraction " clearly do not believe in the US Constitution , otherwise they would not speak or write such drivel .
When I saw Traitor / speaker of the House Pelosi all snuggled up with GWB right after she became speaker , I knew she had no intention whatsoever for impeachment .
It confirmed for me that she was serious --- as I thought she was --- when she said " impeachment is off the table " well before the 2006 " election . "
I think most people here believe in the US Constitution .
But it 's many / most of the scum in congress who obviously do n't give a damn about it or the oath they took to uphold the Constitution and they have allowed it to be trashed by the Bush regime AND themselves for corporate greed , wealth and power , among other things .
And Scott McClellan can tell the congress everything he knows when he shows up for the hearing and nothing likely will happen with that either .
The Dems will say at the end of the hearing : " Well , thank you for coming .
It 's all been very informative and enlightening .
Meeting stands adjourned . "
( Translation :
We do n't plan to do anything about any of this stuff because we 've been in on much of it ) .
End of story .

Congressman Dennis Kucinich has outlined the failures of our President , Vice President and his Agents who abused the power entrusted to them by the people of the United States and violated their oath of office .
It is time for every concerned citizen to contact the House Judiciary Committee and express their desire for this issue to be put to a vote to move forward with the impeachment process .
George Bush and Dick Cheney must answer for their mismanagement and intentional abuse of power .
If top US AIR Force Officers must step down for their failures , the Commander - in - Chief must certainly answer for his failings .
The Law is for everyone and it is time for King George to abdicate his throne since he seems to think that he is above the law ; and that obviously includes his VP .
The country and the world are aware of these facts and they are waiting to see whether or not we , as a country , are serious about our leadership role in the world through our example .
Failure of the system to properly answer these facts through suppression of a motion to move to immediate impeachment hearings constitutes approval of the President and Vice President 's actions and constitutes a breach of Justice .
Unaccountability and suppression of the facts in the face of overwhelming evidence contained in 35 Articles of Impeachment is something to which I 'm sure Alberto Gonzalez would grant his approval to even if it was in contempt of Congress .
This is about right and wrong , accountability and its consequences .

Chris # 27
Thank you for the " nice to hear from you , Erma " comment .
I agree with you .
And I 've not said a word about not trying .
I 've already commended Kucinich for doing this .
My complaint is that the congress --- I 'm not talking about Kucinich whom most of the Dems run away from as fast as they can --- never has tried since 2000 to impeach these fraudulent White House occupants and international war criminals .
That was my point .
These Bush - enabling scum in congress ( not Kucinich ) do things for show and theatre ( which is all it amounts to in the end ) for the television cameras and to try to fool their gullible supporters by speaking little timid words of so - called " opposition " on camera ( especially during an " election " cycle ) , then they turn right around and vote " yes " to enable GWB once again !
And I 've already written my opinion of why " impeachment is off the table " in my last comment .
The hearing with McClellan will likely be just for show and theatre as per usual .
No consequences have come out of any hearings since the Dems became the majority in power .
Oh , they have subpoenaed a few people ( for show ) and those people essentially said " Fuk you " and refused to show up and there have been no consequences to that .
If you or I said that and refused to show up , there would most assuredly be consequences .
That 's why I say it 's all for show and theatre .
Oh , they 've had umpteen hearings , but for what ?
Show , theatre , BS .
But I 've never said they should not seriously and legitimately try ( versus pretending to try ) to impeach .
I just do n't see it happening .
I just do n't see anyone other than the small group ( about 20 ) that supported Kucinich with the Cheney impeachment articles supporting this either .
Wexler has already co-sponsored but he was a co-sponsor for the Cheney articles .
I 'm a realist when it comes to politics which pisses some people off because they like to engage in false hope and wishful - thinking .
With the Bush Crime Family in power creating a dictatorship ?!
I do n't engage in wishful - thinking whatsoever when it comes to this stuff because I 've seen over and over and over ( especially since 2000 ) that it 's a waste of time to do so and only leads to disappointment repeatedly .

Well I was going to respond here but I can't really add anything that Erma has n't already eloquently stated , So I will ditto Erma and I agree 100 % .
Myself today I called Kucinich 's office and thanked him profusely .
Called traitor Pelosi 's office and cussed her out .
Called and sent Emails to both of my local Congress critters .
Have told everyone that I have met today about Kucinich 's patriotic stand .
and finally protested for a couple hours in 100 degree heat in front of the local courthouse .
Everything will be for zip because we only have about 2 - 3 Congressmen out of 535 that are worth a damn and not clearly bought and paid for by Big Oil and the lobbyist for the top 2 % .

Outside a few other weak Congressional attempts , this despicable regime has been unchallenged outside last years attempt by Kucinich to impeach cheney .
yeh we know who 's interests the majority in Congress represent and i suspect Mr. Kucinich has a clue as well .

I spoke with a close friend of mine tonight and he said he told the client he saw today about Kucinich and what Kucinich had done .
His client had never heard of Kucinich ( did n't have a clue who is was so my friend had to first explain who Kucinich was ) and then his client showed no interest at all in the impeachment thing .
My friend told me that his client is as sheep as they come .

To those that want to thank Kucinich , STOP .
He politely asked the public to STOP doing that .
His website has been attacked and they can't handle it .
DoS / DDoS attacks Instead of cussing out Pelosi , why not instead put forth the questions I asked earlier in this thread ?
Something I learned from Brad is that anger is n't going to be taken seriously .
The House Judiciary Committee is as good a place as any to start .
( though I am no expert here ) Erma , I understand your frustration .
But I think we have all had enough doom and gloom , it 's got to be a positive message sent , to whoever you send it .

My earlier comment had nothing whatsoever to do with sending any message to anyone outside this blog .
" Doom and gloom ? " " Defeatist ? "
Oh , here we go .
Oh yes why not , drag out the " Doom and gloom " and " Defeatist " propaganda .
I 've heard this propaganda / spin since 2000 mainly from the loony wishful - thinking Dem koolaid drinkers who jump up and down with premature ejaculation celebration every single time there 's some little flash in the pan that happens politically .
They start celebrating ( prematurely ) because they are convinced that whatever is happening at the time is what they 've been waiting for .
Then what ?
What they were previously jumping up and down about with their premature celebration just dies ( because the useless Dems are not about to do anything when it comes to Bush / Cheney ) .
I 've been called " Doom and gloom " and " Defeatist " since 2000 .
It just rolls off my back .
I tell it like it is which some people can't stand to hear because it collides with their grandiose wishful - thinking .
I could cook up a nicey - nice , " up , " " positive " wishful - thinking , pie - in - the - sky scenario of how Traitor Pelosi and others are going to immediately begin impeachment hearings and the entire Bush Crime Family will end up in prison tomorrow .
You 'll see .
No question about it .
But I can't do that because I know that 's bull shit .
I know that 's not the reality .
Nothing is going to happen to these people and you can call that " doom and gloom " and " defeatist " all you want ... go ahead and live with your illusions and delusions .
The Dems are not going to impeach two of their " own " people .
They are not going to impeach the very people they have been enabling since 2000 and have been complicit with because they would implicate themselves in any impeachment hearings .
Why can people not understand this ?
Why is that so difficult for you to understand ?
Answer : Because you do n't want to .
You do n't want to accept the reality that the Dems are not who and what you think they are and want them to be .
They work for the Bush regime and have since 2000 .
An article from this morning : Jonathan Turley : Democrats are protecting Bush from impeachment : scholar Law professor and constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley says that America 's founders " would have been astonished by the absolute passivity , if not the collusion , of the Democrats in protecting President [ sic ]

Phil , I re-read your lecture to people of what people must " Be " ...
We can change this problem , but not if we keep thinking we are powerless before we even start to fight .
In that respect , be respectful , but be stern , Be diligent , Be effective , Be honorable , Be honest .
Frankly , I think most people on here are intelligent enough to figure this stuff out on their own , if they want to contact these Traitors in congress .
From my experience since 2000 , I have found that it does not matter one bit how one approaches these scum in congress or how one says it .
I have tried the little delicate wet - doily ass - eating approach .
That did nothing .
After while , I started getting pissed off and I let them know that .
That did nothing either .
Because they do n't care what " we " think .
So people can write , phone , fax , e-mail or visit the Bush - enabling scum in congress --- and get arrested ?... like Cindy Sheehan did in John Conyers ' office --- and refer to these Traitors as " Your Worship " and " Your Honorable " and " Your Excellency " and all this other ass - eating nonsense , but unless you are the head of Bechtel , Halliburton , or some other military - industrial complex corporation or some other type of corporation , they wo n't give a damn what you or I think .
Period .
Which is why things have only gotten worse since 2000 despite We The People 's efforts to contact them and let them know what " we " think .
This fraud in the White House has a popularity rating of --- last time I heard --- less than 20 % .
And the status quo continues regardless of that .
If the Bush - enabling scum in congress truly cared what We The People think / thought ( based on the less than 20 % who support this fraud ) , the status quo would NOT continue .
And despite We The People contacting these Traitors in congress since 2000 it 's only gotten worse with every passing day since .
Because they do n't care what " we " think .
The congress listens to the corporations and the war industry .
Not " We The People . "
We do not matter to the " Bourgeois Elite " / Establishment .
Oh , they will occasionally ( for show ) throw some pabulum / window dressing stuff at us to give the impression they 're working for us .
This is no longer a government of " We The People . "
Those days ended in 2000 , if not before .
This is a government " Of , By and For the Corporations " and that 's who these useless and worthless Traitors to the US Constitution listen to and work for .
And this is another reason why " impeachment is off the table " and will remain " off the table . "

The basic argument is :
Under the house rules Pelosi is required to recuse herself on the issue of impeachment since she had previously undisclosed knowledge of some of Bush 's crimes and thus has reason to see that they are not made public .

And then she said , " Exactly what have the Dems done since 2000 other than raising the minimum wage a tad ? "
I then said " well they helped put Alito and Roberts on the bench and other right - wing scum . "
She continued on by saying " The only argument the koolaid drinkers have is the Supreme Court argument but then we see whom the Dems helped to put on the Supreme Court ( Alito and Roberts ) by not filibustering like they said they would .

Martyn Gilleard wrote of " blowing up mosques " , police discovered Neo - Nazi Martyn Gilleard has been found guilty of making bombs for a far - right terrorist campaign , after having previously admitted downloading thousands of images of child sexual abuse .
Police initially searched Gilleard 's flat in Goole , East Yorkshire , in connection with child pornography offences .
But once inside the 31 - year - old 's home , they discovered not just evidence of a paedophile , but the equipment of a potential terrorist as well .
Officers found machetes , swords , bullets , gunpowder and racist literature .
Most sinister of all were four home - made nail bombs stashed under his bed .
He wrote of starting a " racial war " and murdering Muslims , but Martyn Gilleard boasted that he was no " barstool nationalist " .
' Distressing images '
And a jury has decided he truly did want to put his white supremacist views into action .
At the opening of his trial at Leeds Crown Court , Gilleard admitted 10 counts of child pornography offences .
Officers had discovered more than 39,000 indecent images of children on his computer .
After sentencing , Ch Insp Chris Kelk , of Humberside Police , said : " The images include some of the most disturbing my team and I have ever seen and by admitting his crimes it has prevented the images being seen by jury members . "
Ch Insp Kelk commended his team for their professionalism despite the " distressing nature " of the images .
Jurors considering the terror charges did not learn of this until they delivered their verdict .
' Potentially lethal ' Gilleard , a forklift truck driver from Goole , East Yorkshire , admitted to police and the court that he had held racist views .
At the time of his arrest he was a paid - up member of the National Front , the White Nationalist Party and the British People 's Party - all opposed to multiculturalism .
I am so sick and tired of hearing nationalists talk of killing Muslims , of blowing up mosques , of fighting back , only to see these acts of resistance fail to appear

In pictures : An arsenal of hate His computer password was Martyn1488 - the 14 , according to prosecutor Andrew Edis QC , being a reference to the far - right 's " 14 words " slogan , " We must secure the existence of our race and the future for white children . "
The 88 , Mr Edis added , represented the eighth letter of the alphabet - an abbreviation for " Heil Hitler " .
But Gilleard was not simply a passive crank , the court was told .
In a notebook recovered by police , Gilleard wrote that the " time has come to stop the talk and start to act " .
" Unless we the British right stop talking of racial war and take steps to make it happen , we will never get back that which has been stolen from us , " he added .
" I am so sick and tired of hearing nationalists talk of killing Muslims , of blowing up mosques , of fighting back , only to see these acts of resistance fail to appear . "
In another note , he wrote that he wanted to see " reds " - left - wing activists - attacked with " lightning strikes " and " home - made grenades " .
His comments were a chilling echo of far - right nail bomber David Copeland , jailed for life for murder after attacks targeting London 's gay community and ethnic minorities in 1999 .

By the time police raided his flat , Mr Edis said , Gilleard 's preparations for this impending conflict had already been well under way .
Officers had discovered the four nail bombs under a bed along with " potentially lethal bladed weapons " , 34 bullets for a .22 calibre firearm , and printouts from the internet about committing acts of terrorism , Mr Edis told the court .
These had included instructions on how to make a bomb and how to poison someone , he added .
Gilleard had already pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to possessing 34 cartridges of ammunition without holding a firearms certificate .
Offensive weapon
But he denied that he had intended to hurt anyone with the nail bombs , arguing in court that he had only assembled them to give himself something to do .
When asked why he made the devices , he said : " I 'd had a couple of cans .
I was just sat around bored . "
The jury , however , decided that he had more sinister purposes in mind .
After the raid on Wednesday 31 October 2007 , Gilleard fled to the home of his half - brother in Dundee , Tayside .
Police caught up with him after a three - day manhunt .
He said Nazism appealed because of the way the Nazis " rebuilt " Germany Detectives who interviewed his work colleagues were told that he had expressed racist views to them .
The police also recovered a high - visibility jacket belonging to Gilleard that had been daubed with a hand - drawn swastika .
Born on 15 July 1976 in York , Martyn Paul Gilleard had a complicated upbringing .
At the time of his birth his mother had two older children by her ex-husband .
He became the adopted son of his mother 's new partner after she remarried in 1978 .
He left school at 16 with GCSEs in history , English language and literature , but failed to complete a course at Northallerton College .
In 2000 he began working for Howarth Timber in Breighton , East Yorkshire , as a forklift truck driver .
In 2002 - the same year he was fined £ 25 for possession of an offensive weapon - his partner gave birth to a son , but the couple split in 2006 .
A prison cell , not the racial conflict of which he dreamed , now awaits him .

What are these ?
Use simple prose
Do n't shoot for literary elegance .
Use simple , straightforward prose .
Keep your sentences and paragraphs short .
Use familiar words .
We 'll make fun of you if you use big words where simple words will do .
These issues are deep and difficult enough without your having to muddy them up with pretentious or verbose language .
Do n't write using prose you would n't use in conversation .
If you would n't say it , do n't write it .
If your paper sounds as if it were written a third - grade audience , then you 've probably achieved the right sort of clarity .
It 's OK to show a draft of your paper to your friends and get their comments and advice .
In fact , I encourage you to do this .
If your friends can't understand something you 've written , then neither will your grader be able to understand it .
Read your paper out loud .
This is an excellent way to tell whether it 's easy to read and understand .
As you read your paper , keep saying to yourself :
" Does this really make sense ? " " That 's not at all clear ! "
" That sounds pretentious . "
" What does that mean ? "
" What 's the connection between this sentence and the previous one ? "
" Does this sentence do anything more than repeat what I just said ? " and so on .
Presenting and assessing the views of others
If you plan to discuss the views of Philosopher X , begin by isolating his arguments or central assumptions .
Then ask yourself :
Are the arguments good ones ?
Are X's assumptions clearly stated ?
Are they plausible ?
Are they reasonable starting - points for X's argument , or ought he have provided some independent argument for them ?
Keep in mind that philosophy demands a high level of precision .
It 's not good enough for you merely to get the general idea of somebody else 's position or argument .
You have to get it exactly right .
( In this respect , philosophy is more like a science than the other humanities . )
Hence , when you discuss the views or arguments of Philosopher X , it 's important that you establish that X really does say what you think he says .
If you do n't explain what you take Philosopher X's view to be , your reader cannot judge whether the criticism you offer of X is a good criticism , or whether it is simply based on your misunderstanding or misinterpretation of X's views .
At least half of the work in philosophy is making sure that you 've got your opponent 's position right .
Do n't think of this as an annoying preliminary to doing the real philosophy .
This is part of the real philosophical work .
When a passage from a text is particularly useful in supporting your interpretation of some philosopher 's views , it may be helpful to quote the passage directly .
( Be sure to specify where the passage can be found . )
However , direct quotations should be used sparingly .
It is seldom necessary to quote more than a few sentences .
Often it will be more appropriate to paraphrase what X says , rather than to quote him directly .
When you are paraphrasing what somebody else said , be sure to say so .
( And here too , cite the pages you 're referring to . )
Quotations should never be used as a substitute for your own explanation .
When you do quote an author , always explain what the quotation says in your own words .
If the quoted passage contains an argument , reconstruct the argument in more explicit , straightforward terms .
If the quoted passage contains a central claim or assumption , give examples to illustrate the author 's point , and , if necessary , distinguish the author 's claim from other claims with which it might be confused .
Philosophers sometimes do say outrageous things , but if the view you 're attributing to a philosopher seems to be obviously crazy , then you should think hard about whether he really does say what you think he says .
Use your imagination .
Try to figure out what reasonable position the philosopher could have had in mind , and direct your arguments against that .
It is pointless to argue against a position so ridiculous that no one ever believed it in the first place , and that can be refuted effortlessly .
It is permissible for you to discuss a view you think a philosopher might have held , or should have held , though you can't find any evidence of that view in the text .
When you do this , though , you should explicitly say so .
Say something like , " Philosopher X does n't explicitly say that P , but it seems to me that he might have believed it , because ... "
You do n't want to summarize any more of a philosopher 's views than is necessary .
Do n't try to say everything you know about X's views .
You have to go on to offer your own philosophical contribution .
Only summarize those parts of X's views that are directly relevant to what you 're going to go on to do .

An offshore oil platform is seen in the Gulf of Mexico in a file photo .
REUTERS / Jessica Rinaldi
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A top U.S. Democratic senator said in a newspaper interview published Wednesday that he would consider supporting opening up new areas for offshore oil and gas drilling .
“ I ’m open to drilling and responsible production , ” Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin told The Wall Street Journal , adding that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could also support the move .
However , Durbin said his support for opening new areas to drilling was contingent on setting requirements that oil and gas companies begin production within a specified time frame on acreage they have leased from the government .
The spike in oil prices to record highs above $ 145 per barrel has prompted calls for the U.S. government to allow energy producers to explore for oil and gas off the East and West Coasts and in the eastern region of the Gulf of Mexico .
Those areas are currently off limits to exploration .
Republicans say their efforts to open up new regions for exploration have been stymied by Democrats .
Democrats say energy companies are producing oil and gas from only about a quarter of the 91.5 million acres currently leased from the government .
The Software Architecture Group at the Hasso - Plattner - Institut ( who have produced a great online Seaside tutorial and associated book ) have recently been involved in using Etoys in the classroom .
They kindly sent us this report about the experience of two of their members when introducing Squeak and Etoys to high school students .
Pupils of the “ Hermann - von - Helmholtz - Gymnasium ” ( high school ) in Potsdam , Germany learned about Etoys and the basic principles of programming in a four - day workshop .
Under the supervision of two student tutors of the Software Architecture Group at the Hasso - Plattner - Institut ( Robert Krahn and Michael Perscheid ) , the 14 - to 16 - year - old pupils have implemented their own ideas and games in very short time using Etoys .
All of them had no or little prior experience with computers and programming .
On March 25 , the workshop started with an introduction to the subject matter .
The tutors introduced themselves and provided a first look at Squeak and Etoys .
Afterwards , Robert and Michael presented brief tutorials in which the pupils participated .
The first tutorial involved drawing a car and letting it drive along a road according to some small scripts .
The second tutorial dealt with implementing the Lunar Lander game .
For increased fun , the pupils were encouraged to be creative , resulting in a wide variety of car and rocket designs .
In the course of implementing the car and lunar lander games , the pupils also faced the problems of adequately modelling physical phenomena , such as gravity , in which process they were guided by the tutors .
At the end of the first day , all workshop participants had grown accustomed to the development environment and were well prepared for their own projects .
The second day started with a brief introduction to object orientation , which put the knowledge and experience gathered during the first day in a broader and theoretically founded context .
Over the following two days , the pupils worked on their own Etoys projects .
The tutors had given some hints as to what kinds of games could be implemented , but the pupils came up with ideas of their own as well .
Many beautiful and creative results were produced .
Robert and Michael were always available for individually attending to the pupils .
On the final day , participants were asked to present their projects in 10 - minute short presentations .
Michael gave a brief introduction to presentation techniques , so that the pupils were well prepared for this .
Everyone proudly presented their achievements .
Although none of the participants had prior knowledge in computer science , they achieved astounding results in short time .
As a gift , all participants were given a CD containing all projects and the Etoys environment .

Several national restaurant chains were shuttered on Tuesday , possibly offering an early taste of what ’s in store this year for businesses that depend on free - spending consumers whose budgets are now being squeezed .
The parent company of Bennigan ’s , an Irish - themed bar and grill with about 200 sites across the country , filed for bankruptcy , a move that will put hundreds of employees out of work and leave many landlords with empty retail space during a painful time in the real estate market .
A sister brand , Steak & Ale , will also close .
Franchise units of Bennigan ’s will remain open for now , a spokeswoman , Leah Templeton , wrote in an e-mail message .
The restaurants are the latest casualties in the so - called casual dining sector , considered a cut above fast food .
Soaring food costs and a surfeit of locations have hurt the companies ’ bottom lines just as Americans are choosing to take more meals at home .

61 - year - old librarian threatened with arrest at McCain town hall for holding sign
When Republican presidential candidate John McCan held a town hall meeting in Denver on July 7 , 61 - year - old librarian Carol Kreck showed up in the plaza outside holding a sign reading " McCain=Bush . "
She was asked by security to leave and then told by a police officer that she would be charged with trespassing on city property if she did not give up her sign .
When Kreck refused , she was ticketed , escorted off the premises , and threatened with arrest if she tried to return .
" Why is that offensive ? " Kreck said of her sign .
" Why would Republicans who voted for Bush find it offensive ? "

My last post on OMeta# focused on what it is and the vision I have for its future .
Briefly , OMeta is a new language that makes it easier to design programming languages in an object - oriented fashion using very few lines of quite readable code .
OMeta# is my attempt to support OMeta on the .NET runtime .
My main strategy has been to base its design off of Alessandro Warth ’s JavaScript implementation of OMeta / JS .
This post gets into the specifics of how I ’ve done this so far , but my hope is that you might see some places where the design could use improvement and that you might be encouraged to leave a comment so that it could get better .
High Level Design
At its core , OMeta has a very simple design .
The highest level of abstraction is a grammar .
Here is a calculator grammar in the current implementation of OMeta# :
ometa Calculator <: Parser {
Digit = Super ( ( Digit ) ) :d -> { d.ToDigit( ) } ,
Number = Number:n Digit:d -> { n.As< int >() * 10 + d.As< int >( ) }
Digit ,
AddExpr = AddExpr:x '+' MulExpr:y -> { x.As< int >( ) + y. As< int >( ) }
AddExpr:x '-' MulExpr:y -> { x.As< int >() - y. As< int >( ) }
MulExpr ,
MulExpr = MulExpr:x '*' PrimExpr:y -> { x.As< int >() * y. As< int >( ) }
MulExpr:x '/' PrimExpr:y -> { x.As< int >( ) / y. As< int >( ) }
PrimExpr ,
PrimExpr = '(' Expr:x ' ) ' -> { x }
Number ,
Expr = AddExpr
}
A grammar is composed of rules ( which are sometimes referred to as “ productions ” ) .
Both the grammar itself and the rules have the same form :
Going into the rule is a list of things of the input type ( here they ’re represented by red circles ) and coming out on the right is a list of things of the destination type ( represented by purple triangles ) .
As you can see from the diagram , the output list can have lists inside of it .
In the calculator grammar , the circles are individual characters and the output is a single integer .
As an implementer of OMeta , you have to make several design choices .
One of the first is how to represent grammars .
Since OMeta is object - oriented , I decided that it made sense to represent grammars as a .NET class ( a.k.a . “ Type ” ) .
Grammars contain rules ; the obvious choice for implementing rules is to use a method .
This especially makes sense because rules can refer to rules in their base grammar .
For example , the above calculator grammar has a rule called “ Digit ” which captures a single numeric digit .
The “ Digit ” rule applies the “ Digit ” rule in its base grammar ( Parser ) that simply captures a digit character .
It does this by applying the special “ Super ” rule which will use the base grammar to apply the rule that is specified by an argument .
Since rules are implemented as methods and rules can “ override ” their definition from their base grammar , it made sense to make rule methods “ virtual . ”
Another important decision is how to represent data going into and out of a rule application .
An easy choice is to represent the data in a List < T > .
This works out well except for the small detail that lists can contain other lists .
This nested list idea has been around for at least 50 years in LISP and languages derived from it ( like Scheme ) .
Since it has worked out fairly well in those languages , I stole the idea of a LISP - like list in my OMetaList < TInput > class which is a list of other lists with a special case that makes lists of length 1 equivalent to the element itself .
These decisions get us started , but a problem comes up if you try to implement the factorial function using recursion in an OMeta grammar :
ometa Factorial {
Fact 0 -> { 1 } ,
Fact :n ?( n. As< int >() >
0 ) Fact ( ( n. As< int >() - 1 ) ) : m -> { n.As< int >() * m. As< int >( ) }
}
If you look carefully at this grammar , you ’ll see that it only says two things :
If the next element of input matches a 0 , return 1
If the next element of input is something greater than zero , store its value to “ n ” and then apply the “ Fact ” rule supplying it with the value of “ n - 1 ” and capture that result to “ m ” .
Finally , return “ n * m ” .
What might not be obvious at first is that any time you store something to a variable using an expression like “ :n ” , the value stored must be of the destination type ( e.g. a triangle in the diagram ) .
This makes us need to update our mental model for how OMeta works .
We need a place to store rule “ arguments ” which are already in the destination type .
One way of doing this is to create an argument stack that is separate from the rest of the input .
Additionally , we ’ll need a place to store grammar - local variables as well as a place to remember previous results of rule applications for performance reasons .
This gives us a much more complete picture of what really occurs :
When a rule needs to consume input , it will first attempt to grab pop an item from the argument stack .
If the stack is empty , then next element from the input list can be read .
I decided to store all of these details into a single class which I call an OMetaStream < TInput > which internally uses an OMetaList < TInput > for input data and an OMetaList < HostExpression > for storing the argument stack .
The arguments are actually stored in an OMetaProxyStream < TInput > which inherits from OMetaStream < TInput > , but this is just an implementation detail .
With the major data structures out of the way , one important choice remaining is how to handle going down the wrong path .
If you look at the calculator grammar , you ’ll see that the “ AddExpr ” rule can be of the form “ x + y ” , or “ x - y ” , or a “ MulExpr ” .
How does OMeta know which one to take ?
It makes a prioritized choice by trying each of the alternatives in the order specified .
If it discovers that it has gone down the wrong path ( e.g. the next item from the input is a “ - “ instead of a “ + ” ) , it needs to backtrack and reset itself to the condition it was in before the bad choice and then try the next option .
There are two obvious ways of doing this .
The first approach is to leverage runtime support by using exceptions .
This is exactly what OMeta / JS does .
Using exceptions has an advantage of making the generated code simpler because there is no explicit code to “ unwind the stack ” in case you go down a bad path .
Although it makes the code easier to read , I decided against using exceptions and instead chose to use methods that return a boolean value to indicate if they succeeded .
I did this for two important reasons :
. NET does a bit of extra work when an exception is thrown ( e.g. getting a stack trace ) .
Therefore , throwing an exception has a non-trivial performance penalty .
Rules have prioritized choice .
This means that failing a single choice does n’t imply that the whole rule fails .
Failing can be a very common occurrence ( it ’s not exceptional ) and this makes it very performance sensitive .
Here ’s a small glimpse of what the generated code looks like for attempting to apply the “ AddExpr ” rule :
OMetaList < HostExpression > x ;
OMetaStream < char > addExprOut ;
if (! MetaRules .
Apply ( AddExpr , inputStream2 , out x , out addExprOut ) )
{
return MetaRules .
Fail ( out result2 , out modified Stream2 ) ;
}
In this case , AddExpr is the name of the rule which is implemented as a method .
Data is read from the “ inputStream2 ” which is an OMetaStream ( where the red circles are characters ) .
The resulting list is saved to the “ x ” variable and the modified stream is stored in “ addExprOut ” .
In order to make back - tracking easier , OMetaStreams are mostly immutable , which means that they ca n’t change .
Instead of updating the stream itself , you get a fresh copy of the stream that contains what the result would be .
If you need to back track , you can simply ignore the rule application output .
As a side benefit , it makes it slightly easier to debug since you do n’t have to worry about the mutations that could otherwise occur .
Parasitic ?
OMeta ’s creator likes to refer to OMeta as a “ parasitic language ” because it does n’t exist on its own .
It always lives on top of a “ host language . ”
This makes an implementation usually defined in terms of its host language .
That ’s why there is “ OMeta / JS ” which uses JavaScript as a host language .
Although my ultimate goal for OMeta# is to have the host language be any .NET language , I decided to use C# as my first host language .
One of the first issues that came up was trying to recognize what exactly is C# code .
As you can see from examples in my last post , my first attempt was to pick a really ugly pattern that would n’t occur in normal use .
I picked two consecutive @ signs as in :
@@ /*This is C#*/ @@
It worked out well , but it had the downside that it was , well … incredibly ugly .
I have since written a rudimentary C# recognizer written in OMeta# itself that is aware of strings and comments .
The upside is that the syntax looks a little nicer :
{ /*This is C#*/ }
Using C# as the host language had several implications .
The most challenging was working with C# ’s static type system .
This was both a blessing and a curse .
On the one hand , I had to constantly think about where the data came from and where it was going .
This forced me to actually understand the overall design better .
On the other hand , I had to spend so much time thinking about it .
Late - bound systems with dynamic typing such as Smalltalk and JavaScript remove the need for people to spend so much time doing this .
I ’m optimistic that over time a lot of the stronger annoyances will go away .
For example , the current syntax forces type identification as in :
-> { n.As< int >() * 10 + d.As< int >( ) }
Where , OMeta / JS can just say :
-> { n * 10 + d }
I ’m not exactly sure how to do this yet .
My initial guess is that I might be able to write some sort of type inference algorithm ( preferably written in OMeta# ) that could do a reasonable job .
My current ideas are tied too closely with the specific host language and would require a bit of work to port them to other host languages like Visual Basic .
Another approach is to implement one or more helper classes that could enable duck typing ( e.g. if it looks like a certain type , walks like that type , and quacks like the type , it ’s probably that type ) .
Being able to have strong static typing internally while having a very clean syntax would be ideal ( e.g. sort of like the C# 3.0 “ var ” keyword ) .
Static typing is usually harder to achieve , but if you can do it well , you get many benefits .
C# designer Anders Hejlsberg said it well in a recent interview :
“ I do n’t see a lot of downsides to static typing other than the fact that it may not be practical to put in place , and it is harder to put in place and therefore takes longer for us to get there with static typing , but once you do have static typing .
I mean , gosh , you know , like hey – the compiler is going to report the errors before the space shuttle flies instead of whilst it ’s flying , that ’s a good thing ! ”
Another issue that came up was properly handling inheritance .
It makes sense to use “ virtual ” methods for rules , but this also requires you to emit the “ override ” directive to avoid warnings .
Another warning cropped up from my use of the “ base ” keyword in the many delegates that makes it convenient from a code emission perspective , but frustrating from a verifiable security perspective .
Both of these warning are being left for a latter phase .
Compiler issues were only one factor .
The other significant piece was aesthetics .
A notable number of rules yield specific lists as their result .
C# does n’t quite have a good , clean way of expressing an OMetaList ( that is , a list of lists ) .
In order to get around this , I created the “ Sugar ” helper class which makes it slightly easier to write these lists .
It ’s still far from perfect .
Instead of having a nice way for expressing lists like that OMeta / JS :
-> [ ' add ' , x , y ]
You have to do this instead :
-> { Sugar .
Cons ( " add " , x , y ) }
This annoyance can probably be fixed by tricking the C# recognizer to act as if C# had a nice implicit way of expressing an OMetaList and then re-writing the expression to use the Sugar class .
Beyond C# , there is the “ meta ” “ host language ” which is the .NET common language runtime itself .
For code to play nice on it , it should abide by the .NET framework design guidelines which dictate naming conventions and general practices .
This had a parasitic effect in that it led me to name my rules after the naming guidelines for methods ( e.g. they must be PascalCased ) .
Thus , in OMeta# there is the “ Digit ” rule instead of the “ digit ” rule .
OMeta / JS opts to prefix metarule method names with an underscore to make them not collide with other rules .
I also wanted to hide metarules so that people would have to try harder to do the wrong thing ; the best I could come up with to convey this idea was to implement them using an explicit interface exposed via a property ( e.g. instead of “ _apply ” , I have “ MetaRules .
Apply ” ) .
Being a Contextual Packrat
The last intriguing thing about OMeta is exactly how it implements parsing .
It uses a technique called a Parsing Expression Grammar ( PEG ) that Bryan Ford introduced in 2004 .
It ’s just a fancy way to say you support the following features : ( The table comes from the OMeta paper .
I ’ve also included how OMeta# implements them to prove its legitimacy ) :
expression meaning OMeta# Function e 1 e 2 sequencing Seq
e 1 e 2 prioritized choice MetaRules.Or
e* zero or more repetitions MetaRules .
Many e+ one or more repetitions ( not essential ) MetaRules .
Many1 ~e negation MetaRules .
Not
< p > production application
MetaRules .
Apply ' x ' matches the character x Exactly
The most interesting aspect to me is the prioritized choice .
This is in contrast to “ Context - Free Grammars ” ( CFGs ) which are the traditional way of defining parsers .
To highlight the difference , consider parsing this line of C/ C++ code :
if ( condition1 ) if ( condition2 ) Statement1 ( ) ; else Statement2 ( ) ;
Is it the same as :
if ( condition1 ) { if ( condition2 ) { Statement1 ( ) ; } else { Statement2 ( ) ; } }
… or is it :
if ( condition1 ) { if ( condition2 ) { Statement1 ( ) ; } } else { Statement2 ( ) ; }
This is the classic “ dangling else ” problem .
Context Free Grammars usually have this problem because they are free of any context when they are parsing ( surprise ! ) .
In these situations , you often have to rely on something besides the grammar itself to resolve these ambiguities .
Parsing Expression Grammars do n’t have this type of problem because you specify explicitly which one to try first .
The prioritized choice therefore avoids ambiguity .
In order to make the performance relatively in line with the size of the input , a technique of “ memoization ” is used .
This means the parser remembers what it has done previously ; it does this as a space - time tradeoff .
Keeping all those previous values have given them the reputation of being a “ packrat ” parser .
Let ’s say you have
AddExpr = AddExpr:x '+' MulExpr:y -> { x.As< int >( ) + y. As< int >( ) }
AddExpr:x '-' MulExpr:y -> { x.As< int >() - y. As< int >( ) }
MulExpr
and you try the first choice ( AddExpr: x ‘+’ MulExpr:y ) , but you get to where you ’re expecting a “ + ” and it is n’t there .
You ’ll notice that the second choice ( AddExpr: x ’-‘ MulExpr:y ) repeats the first part ( namely AddExpr : x ) .
Instead of re-evaluating it , you can just retrieve the stored value that you remembered , or rather memoized .
Well , it ’s almost that simple .
Note that the definition of an add expression ( AddExpr ) is left - recursive .
This means that the left side is defined in terms of itself .
A naïve implementation of the parser would try to evaluate “ AddExpr ” by applying the first choice which started with a AddExpr which would then cause it to try to apply AddExpr again and eventually cause a stack overflow .
It ’s not a trivial problem to fix .
In fact , the paper that introduced Parsing Expression Grammars said that left - recursion should be avoided since you can rewrite the rule to avoid left - recursion .
This is unfortunate guidance because the rewritten rule sometimes loses the clarity that the left - recursive version of the rule had .
At the start of this year , a paper came out showing a very clever trick that makes left recursion possible .
Say that we ’re parsing the expression “ 1+2+3 ” using the “ AddExpr . ”
At the start of the expression we look at our memoization table to see if we have a precomputed value for “ AddExpr ” .
Since it is our first time , we wo n’t find anything .
The first part of the trick is to immediately store the result of “ Fail ” as the memoized result for AddExpr when starting at offset 0 .
We do this before we attempt to apply the rule .
When the parser uses recursion and finds itself again asking for the value of “ AddExpr ” at position 0 , it will find a result of “ fail ” and thus fail that choice .
It will then continue down to “ MulExpr ” where it will eventually match “ 1 ” .
The second part of the trick is to treat this value of “ 1 ” for “ AddExpr ” at position 0 as a “ seed parse . ”
The parser will then attempt to “ grow the seed ” by starting over at the beginning of the input stream , but this time it will remember its previous successful match .
This will cause it to match “ 1+2 ” for AddExpr and then start over again by growing the seed to finally match “ 1+2+3 . ”
In hindsight , it ’s a very simple idea .
However , I say that only after some serious debugging time where I kept finding problems in my poor implementation .
Alas , the entire algorithm is implemented in only a few lines of code in the “ MetaRules .
Apply ” function in OMetaBase.cs .
So there you have it , you now know all of the interesting ideas in OMeta# .
Where is This Going ?
OMeta# is a hobby project that ’s been a labor of love for me .
You might have already guessed that if you noticed that most check - ins occur late at night or on the weekends .
It ’s been slow , but it ’s coming together .
Probably the most exciting highlight in the development came when I got enough of OMeta# working that I could rewrite parts of itself in OMeta# .
This has the benefit of being cool from a meta self - reproducing level , but it ’s also a bonus because the code becomes much more readable and introspective .
For example , compare the C# recognizer that I wrote by hand to the OMeta# grammar version that implements the same idea .
This approach of writing more of OMeta# in OMeta# will continue .
It ’s my hope that as much as possible will be written in itself .
A significant next step would be to rewrite the code generator as an OMeta# grammar .
This is n’t a new design idea .
Each subsequent version of Smalltalk has been bootstrapped by its previous version .
I ’ll be the first to point out that there are a lot of rough edges to my current implementation .
If you look around the source code , you ’ll see several comments labeled “ // HACK ” where I admit a hacked version of an idea .
One of the most glaring problems is that debugging is annoyingly difficult .
I have n’t yet implemented an optimizer for the generated code which causes a lot of unnecessary metarule applications .
The second annoyance is that just stepping into so many methods that fail often takes a long time .
Over time , I hope to add better hints to get more traditional error messages that you get from good compilers so that you do n’t have to step through the generated code to debug a grammar .
As mentioned earlier , the language recognizer could use some work to make the syntax cleaner as well inferring types so that grammar writers do n’t have to explicitly declare them .
I have confidence that the work that would go into a good C# host language implementation would directly port to other languages such as Visual Basic .
There ’s also a great need cross pollination with other projects such as the Dynamic Language Runtime ( DLR ) which has already tackled some of the issues that OMeta# will face .
Additionally , languages such as F# have similar data structures already built - in that OMeta uses .
Boo and Nemerle have interesting extensibility points which could provide some good ideas .
The problem for me is that there is so many different places to look .
It ’d be great if you know these languages ( or others ) and could tell me via a comment or better yet , by sending code of how they could help OMeta# .
As of right now , I plan on keeping the core functionality in C# rather than rewriting everything in another language or by using the DLR .
The main reason is that C# is wide - spread in availability , both on .NET as well as on Mono .
A second reason is that I would like to keep the outside dependencies on OMeta# as small as possible .
OMeta is a beautiful in the same sense that mathematics can have a simple beauty .
LISP has been referred to by some as “ The Most Important Idea in Computer Science ” largely because its core ideas could be expressed on a half page of the LISP 1.5 manual ( page 13 to be exact ) .
This elegance is similar to mathematics of Maxwell ’s Equations describing electromagnetism .
It ’s my hope that I wo n’t mess up the implementation to the point where this elegant beauty is lost .
Currently it ’s way too ugly .
I see some of the rough edges , but I ’m sure you can help me discover others along with how to fix them .
If this post sounds too complicated , it ’s not you , it ’s me .
Let me know if something does n’t make sense and I ’ll try to provide clarification .
If you ’re interested in OMeta# , I highly encourage you to download the latest version of the source code from CodePlex and step through the unit test runner to see things get built up .
If you can , keep notes of all the places where you see me doing something and let me know about them either through comments or via email .
In addition , I also highly recommend experimenting Alessandro Warth ’s great OMeta / JS implementation via your web browser .
Happy OMeta-ing !
DONETSK , Ukraine ( CNN ) --
A frail Irene Famulak clutched her brother on the airport tarmac , her arm wrapped around him in a tight embrace , tears streaming down their faces .
It was the first time since 1942 they had seen each other , when she was 17 and he was just 7 .
Siblings Wssewolod Galezkij and Irene Famulak were separated in 1942 when Nazis took her to a labor camp .

That was the night the invading Nazis came to take her away from her Ukrainian home .
" I remember it well because I kissed him good - bye , and he pushed me away , " she said of her brother .
" I asked , ' Why did you do that ? '
And he said that he does n't like kisses . "
" The Nazis told my mother that I was being taken to work in a German labor camp for six months .
But it was , of course , much longer .
I was there for years . "
Both siblings survived the Holocaust and grew up on different sides of the Iron Curtain , not knowing the fate of the other .
But after 66 years apart , Famulak , 83 , was reunited with her long lost 73 - year - old brother , Wssewolod Galezkij .
They held each other close this time , cherishing the moment .
Watch siblings hug for first time in seven decades »
" I do n't believe anyone has ever known such happiness .
Now , I truly believe I can die satisfied , " Galezkij said .
Famulak made the long journey to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , after being contacted by the American Red Cross .
The organization told her they had located her only surviving sibling .
Famulak said she spent World War II in a labor camp in Munich , Germany , working in the kitchens .
She had been taken to the camp with her older sister .
When it was liberated in 1945 , Famulak stayed in Germany for several years , eventually emigrating to the United States in 1956 .
She never saw her parents again after that day in 1942 when Nazis separated her from her family .
She and her brother still have no idea what happened to their mother and father .
Some of their siblings lived through the war , but later died ; others , they never heard from again after being separated .
But her younger brother never gave up hope of tracking his sister down .
He , too , was sent to a German labor camp , but after the war , he moved back to Ukraine , then a republic of the Soviet Union .

Under Soviet leader Josef Stalin , information on lost relatives was kept sealed , and Galezkij said it was n't until reforms in the late 1980s , followed by the Soviet collapse , that he started making progress in finding his sister .
Even then , it took him more than 17 years to locate her in the United States .
He broke down in tears as he spoke of his overwhelming happiness at finding her .
" When the Red Cross told me they had found her in America , it was such a joy , " he said , sobbing .
In fact , he had to be taken to the hospital because he was so overcome when he first learned she was alive .
At this week 's reunion , there was a doctor on hand at the airport as a precaution .
Back in the United States , there were tears , too .
Linda Klein , the director of the American Red Cross Holocaust and War Victims Tracing Center , said the volunteer who helped the siblings find each other got caught up in the emotion herself .
" When I showed her the picture , she stood there and wept , " Klein said .
" She was beside herself . "
Klein 's group has reunited 1,500 families since it began work in 1990 .
She said the former Soviet Union released records in 1989 of concentration camps it liberated , greatly helping organizers find information on Holocaust victims .
The organization has 100 volunteers -- a third of them Holocaust survivors , Klein said .
The group also helps families find information about their loved ones who died during the Holocaust .
They have brought together more than 50 families this year .
All of their work is free .
She says it 's often like " looking for a needle in a haystack . "
" We 're playing beat the clock right now , " she said , adding , " It 's about families that one day they were together and then they were apart . "
" When a connection is made , there are just smiles all around . "
That was the case for this family in Ukraine .
Years of trauma , of separation , of not knowing what happened to loved ones , have been replaced by celebration .
In a picturesque orchard overlooking rolling fields , Galezkij , his wife and their neighbors laid out a feast for his American sister .
As the vodka flowed , he told her how he had survived for a lifetime without her .
" He says he always thought he 'd see me someday .
He dreamt lots about me , " Famulak said , as she sat next to her brother .
" And he wrote a song for me .
When he went to sleep , he sang every night and cried . "
With that , Galezkij , weakened by illness and age , burst into song .
But this time , he sang the words with pure joy .

Healthcare issues have been at the forefront of the race for the White House in 2008 .
Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama and John McCain have all proposed different plans to fix our system .
In this series we will discuss the pros and cons of each plan .
Read Why John McCain's Health Care Plan Will Work .
Does John McCain's " straight talk express " really deliver a quality program to the American people ?
Simple Economics
McCain 's ideas are playing with fishy economics .
His vision promotes competition , under the premise that competition will reduce costs .
His plan hopes that these costs would be reduced enough to make insurance affordable to Americans with a history of major diseases , like cancer .
This would hardly be the case .
Competition may make some prices more affordable , but it does absolutely nothing when it comes to helping Americans with bad medical histories get coverage .
The Senator 's plan does nothing to give coverage to the people that actually need it .
There is no negative for companies who deny claims .
The current , privatized system has a lot of competition and reform is still one of the main issues .
Competition does not equal success .
The initiative also allows for people to seek treatment outside of state lines .
This would also allow insures to move their operations to states in which consumer protection laws are weak .
Not Universal
McCain 's vision is about as far away as you can get from universal .
The Senator 's plan does nothing to reduce the ranks of the uninsured , and will not help the 47 million Americans currently living without insurance .
The McCain initiative would dislodge state regulations .
Regulations that would be dislodged include :
ER Care
Diabetes Care
Mental Health Parity
Off - Label Prescription Drug Use
Chiropractors
Final Word
John McCain 's vision does not seem to be in the best interest of the American people .
It seems to rehash an old plan by George W. Bush that already has failed .
It has long been conservative politics to deny universal coverage because , those who are dealing with a lack of care , are n't really a key demographic to conservatives .
Pick up any newspaper today in Britain or elsewhere in Europe , switch on the TV or tune in to any radio station , and you 're very likely to get the impression that " our societies " - if not western civilisation in its entirety - face an imminent Islamic threat , on a par with the old dangers of fascism .
Since the terrorist bombings of New York , Madrid and London , the " fundamentalist peril " has become part of the air we breathe .
It has become a rhetorical crutch for everyone from rightwing bigots to opportunistic politicians and repenting " former extremists " , each with their own agenda .
Today we live amid an explosion of discourse and imagery around Islam and Muslims .
Sparked by al - Qaida 's lunatic atrocities , it has since fed on the politics of fear and suspicion .
The victims have included objectivity , balance , and the ability to judge issues calmly and rationally .
Flawed material is endlessly reproduced and recycled , so it is little wonder that the public 's understanding of Islam and the complex political problems of the Muslim world are limited at best .
Years of peddled fear and demonisation have had severe consequences : a widening of ignorance and bigotry , deepening mistrust between individuals and communities , and the resurrection of the pernicious language of racism and fanaticism - as journalist Peter Oborne illustrated in his Channel 4 Dispatches documentary earlier this week .
It is probably no exaggeration to say that Islam is now the religion closest to Europe and remotest from it .
Islam is no longer an alien , distant religion .
It is now woven into the very fabric of European society .
Muslims are the largest of the continent 's minorities .
Yet their physical proximity does not appear to have made them more familiar or better understood .
If anything , to most European eyes they seem stranger , more distant , more ambiguous than ever .
The much hyped Islamic threat is one of the greatest lies of our time .
The " Muslim world " - though no such bloc really exists - is politically fragmented and economically impoverished .
It is reeling under the weight of crises and a long colonial legacy .
Militarily , it is of scant significance .
It is laughable that we should be discussing the Islamic threat when in the past seven years alone two Muslim countries have come under direct military occupation , ending hopes that the world had firmly closed this chapter of history decades ago .
I suspect many military experts must struggle to keep a straight face every time the subject of the " Islamic threat " is broached .
They know that strategic threats are not founded on mere anxieties , imagination and illusions , but on concrete military and political facts .
This is not to play down the seriousness of the dangers presented by al - Qaida and other violent groups .
But these constitute a security problem to be dealt with through the intelligence and security services .
Whatever its braggadocio , al - Qaida does not amount to a strategic military threat , let alone a menace to " western civilisation " .
The security risks posed by al - Qaida , moreover , face Muslims and non-Muslims alike .
After all , al - Qaida has perpetrated more atrocities in Muslim countries than western capitals .
Attacks in Casablanca , Bali , Riyadh , Algiers , Tunisia , Istanbul and Iraq have outnumbered those in New York , Madrid and London .
In the fog of the so - called war on terror , al - Qaida , terrorism , extremism and Islamism - the list of - isms goes on - have been employed as potent weapons in a range of battles .
They have been deployed to demonise vulnerable minorities - their community groups and their leaders , mosques and faith schools .
They have been adopted to eat away at civil liberties .
And they have been exploited to target mainstream Islamist political parties .
Turkey 's ruling Justice and Development party ; the Muslim Brotherhood - the largest opposition in the Egyptian parliament ; and Anwar Ibrahim 's People 's Justice party in Malaysia , are among the movements cast in one terrifying category labelled " Islamism " , alongside al - Qaida .
The huge differences are wilfully ignored to justify this strategy of unrelenting confrontation .
The consequences have been devastating for social stability and community coexistence , as well as for relations between the " Muslim world " and the " west " - something which , ironically , has been recognised by President Bush recently .
Political expediency and scaremongering has seen the propagation of the idea of a grave Islamist threat to the status of orthodoxy .
But however easy it might be to surrender to this fiction , it remains just that : a myth fabricated by a few , exploited by a few , and consumed by many .
No matter how widely circulated , or endlessly regurgitated , a myth remains a myth .
· Soumaya Ghannoushi will join John Esposito , Alastair Crooke , Martin Bright and Robert Leiken to debate " The Islamic threat : myth or reality ? " at IslamExpo in London tomorrow .
The expo runs from today until Monday at Olympia in Kensington

( LifeWire ) --
When a 24 - year - old woman who called herself " 90 DayJane " launched a blog in February announcing she would write about her life and feelings for three months and then commit suicide , 150,000 readers flocked to the site .
Some came to offer help , some to delight in the drama .
Others speculated it was all a hoax .
Stacey Kim says blogging helps her cope with being a widow and a single mom to twins Riley , left , and Madeleine .
Few , however , questioned why she would share her deepest thoughts and feelings with strangers online .
In the age of cyber - voyeurism , the better question might be :
Why would n't she ?
Overeating , alcoholism , depression -- name the problem and you 'll find someone 's personal blog on the subject .
Roughly 12 million Americans have blogs , according to polls by the Pew Internet and American Life Project in 2006 , and many seem to use them as a form of group therapy .
A 2005 survey by Digital Marketing Services for AOL.com a found nearly half of the 600 people polled derived therapeutic benefits from personal blogging .
' Instant support system '
For Stacey Kim , a 36 - year - old book editor who lives in the Boston suburb of Arlington , Massachusetts , emotional blogging has become a reflex .
On April 11 , 2007 , Kim curled up next to her husband and held him as he succumbed to a long battle with pancreatic cancer .
The next morning , she went online to post about the experience .
" It cemented the reality that he was gone , " Kim says .
" I got hundreds of comments back that were all so loving and supportive .
It gave me a really tangible sense of community . "
She blogs about life as the widowed mother of 22 - month - old twins at snickollet.blogspot.com .
" Right after he died , people kept asking if I was in therapy , " says Kim , " and I 'd say , ' No , but I have a blog . ' "
Writing long has been considered a therapeutic outlet for people facing problems .
A 2003 British Psychological Society study of 36 people suggested that writing about emotions could even speed the healing of physical wounds :
Researchers found that small wounds healed more quickly in those who wrote about traumatic personal events than in those who wrote about mundane activities .
But it 's the public nature of blogs that creates the sense of support .
Reading someone else 's blog can be surprisingly beneficial , says MightyGirl.net blogger Margaret Mason , 32 .
She reads about other women 's experiences with everything from in - laws to apartment - hunting at blogs like SuburbanBliss.
net and SuperHeroDesigns.com .
" Blogging can create an instant support system , especially at a time when you might not have the energy or resources to seek out people who 've shared your experiences , " says Mason , author of " No One Cares What You Had For Lunch , " a book on keeping a blog interesting .
A way to be heard
John Suler , a psychology professor at Rider University in New Jersey , has studied the overlap of psychology and cyberspace .
Blog audiences are usually small , he says , but " going public with one 's thoughts and experiences can be a self - affirming process . "
He and other experts say blogging should n't replace face - to - face counseling -- although it can complement sessions when a patient shares their writing with the therapist .
" Some psychologists take special interest in any activities that their clients may undertake online , " Suler says , " because such activities often reveal a lot about how they express their identity and relate to other people . "
Kim did start psychotherapy , but kept blogging .
" My therapist will give me little assignments and I 'll blog about them , " she says .
" If I come home ( after a session ) and write about it , it solidifies it . "
One Chicago licensed social worker and therapist in her 50s encourages patients to release bottled emotions through blogging .
Leah , who asked that her last name not be used because of the nature of her profession , started EveryoneNeedsTherapy.blogspot.com to share professional insights .
Soon , however , she was talking about her own feelings -- and her husband told her it seemed to lift her mood .
" It 's a form of group therapy , " says Leah .
" Not only can you express your feelings , but you can get comments , and that creates a dialogue . "
Blogging about personal matters seems to be more of a feminine pursuit .
In the 2004 study " Effects of Age and Gender on Blogging , " researchers examined more than 37,000 blogs on blogger.com .
Their conclusion :
Male bloggers tend to write about politics , technology and money ; women are more likely to blog about their private lives and use an intimate style of writing .
This does n't surprise Patricia Wallace , author of " The Psychology of the Internet . "
" Women tend to self - disclose more online in general , " says the senior director at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth .
" Women far outnumber men in certain blogging worlds in which feelings are shared , such as cancer blogs . "
Permanent marks
The only problem , some bloggers find , is that many posts become passé -- yet they 're on the Web forever .
" The Internet takes momentary thoughts and freezes them in amber as if they 're permanent , " says Scheherazade Mason , a career counselor and sailing coach at Bowdoin College in Maine .
She stopped posting her deepest thoughts , but calls the experience positive .
" Through my first blog , I learned to be braver , " Mason says .
" I learned that my weakness was also likable .
In real life , you try to show only strength and to hide your weaknesses , but I exposed everything . "
90 DayJane also said she learned important things .
After seven days , she announced the blog was an art project and she was n't planning to kill herself .
" I wanted this blog to be about personal discovery and truth , " she wrote in her final post .
" But the correspondences I have received have taught me more about those qualities than I could ever express .
90 DayJane ... has changed my perspective as a human being . "

I 've got a theory - an untested , unprovable theory - that the more interesting your life is at any given point , the less lurid and spectacular your dreams will be .
Think of it as a balancing procedure carried out by the brain to stop you getting bored to death .
If your waking life is mundane , it 'll inject some thrills into your night - time imaginings to maintain a healthy overall fun quotient .
So if you work in a cardboard box factory , and your job is to stare at the side of each box as it passes along a conveyor belt , to ensure they 're all uniform and boxy enough - and you do this all day , every day , until your mind grows so dissociated and numb you can scarcely tell where the cardboard ends and your body begins - when your daily routine is THAT dull , chances are you 'll spend each night dreaming you 're the Emperor of Pluto , wrestling a 6ft green jaguar during a meteor storm in the desert just outside Vegas .
All well and good in the world of dreams .
But if you continue to believe you 're the Emperor of Pluto after you 've woken up , and you go into work and start knocking the boxes around with a homemade sceptre while screaming about your birthright , you 're in trouble .
I mention this because recently I 've found myself bumping into people - intelligent , level - headed people - who are sincerely prepared to entertain the notion that there might be something in some of the less lurid 9/11 conspiracy theories doing the rounds .
They mumble about the " controlled demolition " of WTC 7 ( oft referred to as " the third tower " ) , or posit the notion that the Bush administration knew 9/11 was coming and let it happen anyway .
I mean , you never know , right ?
Right ?
And did I tell you I'm the Emperor of Pluto ?
The glaring problem - and it's glaring in 6,000 watt neon , so vivid and intense you can see it from space with your eyes glued shut - is that with any 9/11 conspiracy theory you care to babble can be summed up in one word : paperwork .
Imagine the paperwork .
Imagine the level of planning , recruitment , coordination , control , and unbelievable nerve required to pull off a conspiracy of that magnitude .
Really picture it in detail .
At the very least you 're talking about hiring hundreds of civil servants cold - hearted enough to turn a blind eye to the murder of thousands of their fellow countrymen .
If you were dealing with faultless , emotionless robots - maybe .
But this almighty conspiracy was presumably hatched and executed by fallible humans .
And if there 's one thing we know about humans , it 's that our inherent unreliability will always derail the simplest of schemes .
It 's hard enough to successfully operate a video shop with a staff of three , for Christ 's sake , let alone slaughter thousands and convince the world someone else was to blame .
That 's just one broad objection to all the bullshit theories .
But try suggesting it to someone in the midst of a 9/11 fairytale reverie , and they 'll pull a face and say , " Yeah , but ... " and start banging on about some easily misinterpreted detail that " makes you think " ( when it does n't ) or " contradicts the official story " ( when you misinterpret it ) .
Like nutbag creationists , they fixate on thinly spread , cherry - picked nuggets of " evidence " and ignore the thundering mass of data pointing the other way .
And when repeatedly pressed on that one , basic , overall point - that a conspiracy this huge would be impossible to pull off - they huff and whine and claim that unless you 've sat through every nanosecond of Loose Change ( the conspiracy flick du jour ) and personally refuted every one of its carefully spun " findings " before their very eyes , using a spirit level and calculator , you have no right to an opinion on the subject .
Oh yeah ?
So if my four - year - old nephew tells me there 's a magic leprechaun in the garden I have to spend a week meticulously peering underneath each individual blade of grass before I can tell him he 's wrong , do I ?
Look hard enough , and dementedly enough , and you can find " proof " that Kevin Bacon was responsible for 9/11 - or the 1987 Zeebrugge ferry disaster , come to that .
It 'd certainly make for a more interesting story , which is precisely why several thousand well - meaning people would go out of their way to believe it .
Throughout my twenties I earnestly believed Oliver Stone 's account of the JFK assassination .
Partly because of the compelling ( albeit wildly selective ) way the " evidence " was blended with fiction in his 1991 movie - but mainly because I WANTED to believe it .
Believing it made me feel important .
Embrace a conspiracy theory and suddenly you 're part of a gang sharing privileged information ; your sense of power and dignity rises a smidgen and this troublesome world makes more sense , for a time .
You 've seen through the matrix !
At last you 're alive !
You ARE the Emperor of Pluto after all !
Except - ahem - you 're only deluding yourself , your majesty .
Because to believe the " system " is trying to control you is to believe it considers you worth controlling in the first place .
The reality - that " the man " is scarcely competent enough to control his own bowels , and does n't give a toss about you anyway - is depressing and emasculating ; just another day in the cardboard box factory .
And that 's no place for an imaginary emperor , now , is it ?
Body piercing in places other than the ear often leads to complications like infections , swelling and bleeding , a new study shows .
The data , compiled in Britain by the Health Protection Agency and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , show that 25 percent of piercings in body areas other than the earlobe lead to complications , with one in 100 piercings resulting in a hospital admission .
More than 10,000 people ages 16 and older took part in the survey , which was published online today by the British Medical Journal .
A 2002 study of American college students also reported a high rate of complications , with 17 percent of students complaining of problems , including bleeding and infection .
Nipple piercing appeared to be the most risky , with a 21 percent rate of bleeding or injury .
About 10 percent of the adult population in Britain has a non-earlobe body piercing .
Prevalence estimates in the United States are harder to come by , but the 2002 report , published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings , found that 51 percent of the college students surveyed had some sort of piercing , not counting pierced earlobes among the women .
In that study , 38 percent of male students had pierced ears , either in the lobe or elsewhere , whereas 4 percent had pierced tongues and 3 percent had pierced nipples .
Among female students , pierced earlobes were n’t counted , but 29 percent had piercings elsewhere on their ears .
Another 16 percent had pierced tongues , 6 percent had pierced nipples and 32 percent had pierced navels .
In the British study , 16 - year - olds with piercings were also more likely to suffer from complications , with almost a third reporting problems and 15 percent seeking professional help .
Although most piercings were performed in specialist piercing shops , the researchers noted that a “ worrying ” 9 percent of tongue piercings were performed by nonspecialists .
In every anatomical site , including the tongue and genital areas , the study authors said they found a number of people who had performed the piercing themselves or had it done by a friend or relative .
The most common problems with piercings were swelling , infection and bleeding .
Almost half of tongue piercings resulted in complications in the British survey .
The growing popularity of body piercings could “ place a significant burden on health services for many years , ” the researchers said .
Since I put up these pictures here at the beginning of February 2007 , the story of the Portugese barn full of classic and not - so - classic cars seems to have taken on a life of its own .
The interwebs have been abuzz with theories and somebody has even gone to the trouble of making up a story about it .
Classic car lovers , treasure hunters and auction houses have all somehow contacted intuh .
net in an effort to find out more .
In order to stem the flow of e-mails and even telephone calls : here 's all I know .
At the end of January 2007 , I stumbled upon a Portugese web forum with a thread that contained a large number of pictures of old cars left in a barn , somewhere in Portugal .
The picture files themselves were hosted on the web site of a Portugese classic car dealer , but were taken down after only a few days .
I thought it would be a shame not to have them online , so I rescued them from my browser cache and put them up here , on intuh .net .
For all those who have been eagerly sending round e-mails about ' a New York man ' having bought ' a piece of land in Portugal ' for ' next to nothing ' , that happened to have this treasure - filled barn on it : I 'm pretty much convinced that 's an urban myth .
A much more credible story can be found here .

Striking similarities between the brains of gay men and straight women have been discovered by neuroscientists , offering fresh evidence that sexual orientation is hardwired into our neural circuitry .
Scans reveal homosexual men and heterosexual women have symmetrical brains , with the right and left hemispheres almost exactly the same size .
Conversely , lesbians and straight men have asymmetrical brains , with the right hemisphere significantly larger than the left .
Scientists at the prestigious Stockholm Brain Institute in Sweden also found certain brain circuits linked to emotional responses were the same in gay men and straight women .
The findings , published tomorrow in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , suggest the biological factors that influence sexual orientation - such as exposure to testosterone in the womb - may also shape the brain 's anatomy .
The study , led by the neurobiologist Ivanka Savic , builds on previous research that has identified differences in spatial and verbal abilities related to sex and sexual orientation .
Tests have found gay men and straight women fare better at certain language tasks , while heterosexual men and lesbians tend to have better spatial awareness .
Savic and her colleague Per Linström took MRI brain scans of 90 volunteers who were divided into four groups of similar ages according to whether they were male , female , heterosexual or homosexual .
The scans showed the right side of the brain in heterosexual men was typically 2 % larger than the left .
Lesbians showed a similar asymmetry , with the right hand side of the brain 1 % larger than the left .
Scans on homosexual men and heterosexual women revealed both sides of the brain were the same size .
The results could explain a University of London study earlier this year that found gay men and straight women share a poor sense of direction compared with heterosexual men , and were more likely to navigate using landmarks alone .
The right hand side of the brain dominates spatial capabilities , so may be slightly more developed in heterosexual men and lesbians .
An earlier study by the same team found gay men and straight women outperformed lesbians and straight men at tasks designed to test verbal fluency .
Savic 's team has yet to confirm whether the differences in brain shape are responsible for sexual orientation , or are a consequence of it .
To find out , they have begun another study to investigate brain symmetry in newborn babies , to see if it can be used to predict their future sexual orientation .
" These differences might be laid down during brain development in the womb , or they could happen after birth , though it could very likely be a combination of the two , " said Savic .
In another series of tests , Savic and Lindström used a technique called positron emission tomography ( PET ) to look at brain wiring in a smaller group of volunteers .
They found heterosexual women and gay men shared brain circuitry linking a region called the amygdala , which plays a key role in emotional responses , to other parts of the brain .
The research is part of a larger effort to identify differences between the male and female brain , in the hope they will shed light on why some mental disorders affect men and women differently .
For example , major depressive disorders are far more common and persistent in women , while autism is around four times more common in boys than girls .
" There 's a well known uneven sex distribution in the number of psychiatric disorders and trying to understand sex differences , and differences in orientation , may give you a hint of the mechanism underlying these diseases , " said Savic .
EXCLUSIVE :
Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton has scrubbed all negative ads from her campaign Web site and YouTube page , leaving visitors with only the warm and fuzzy moments from her bid for the presidency .
Gone are the attack ads accusing Sen. Barack Obama of insulting Pennsylvanians , ducking debates and making misleading assertions about gas prices .
In their place are some of the campaign ’s best and most positive ads and multiple “ Hillary I Know ” testimonials that have a shelf life should the former first lady ever run again .
The whitewashing took place quietly in the past few days as Mr. Obama cut his former rival a check to help relieve her campaign debt and as the Clinton family moved to fully embrace Mr. Obama as the presumptive Democratic nominee .
“ She ’s no longer campaigning for president , ” said Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee .
“ She ’s focused on her work in the Senate , campaigning for Senator Obama and other Democrats . ”
Mr. Elleithee said the videos probably are archived .
Also missing are the dozens of speeches and hundreds of press releases running back to Mrs. Clinton ’s January 2007 campaign announcement .
Many offered reporters details about important endorsements or the scripts of TV ads , but dozens were dedicated to countering the senator from Illinois .
“ Misleading attack : Sen. Obama flubs in Ohio , ” one release read .
Another blared , in capital letters , “ NAFTA - gate : False denials from the Obama campaign . ”
Also gone are campaign memos , such as Mark Penn ’s Feb . 2
“ Hillary is the Democrat to beat McCain , ” or the May 19 missive by Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson complaining that Mr. Obama was about to declare that he had won a majority of delegates : “ Mission Accomplished ?
Not so fast . ”
The only releases left at HillaryClinton.com are a statement about the death of NBC ’s Tim Russert and the text of Mrs. Clinton ’s June 9 speech suspending her campaign after Mr. Obama earned enough delegates to lock up the nomination .
The separate “ Fact Hub ” Web site that rebuked the Obama campaign has gone dead , along with “ Attack Timeline ” that detailed every nasty remark by Mr. Obama or his surrogates during the long primary battle .
By contrast , the Obama Fact Check page on his campaign site still offers rebuttals to Clinton attacks dating back to its creation in fall 2007 .
HillaryHub , a site showcasing positive press coverage , also has been removed .
The Hillary TV page that once featured fundraising appeals and dozens of ads — including those with Bill Clinton on a treadmill and the former first couple in a “ Sopranos ” spoof — now offers just five videos .
In one , she heartily endorses Mr. Obama ’s candidacy .
In another , she thanks supporters and tells them , “ I could not have made this part of the journey without you . ”
The site still has her Pennsylvania spot titled “ Scranton , ” which features black and white photos of Mrs. Clinton as a girl , and the “ Dreams ” ad in which the senator from New York shows photographs of her parents , talks about the values they instilled in her and promises , “ I carry with me not just their dreams but the dreams of people like them all across our country . ”
The final video shows Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton meeting the campaign ’s 1 millionth supporter .
Several upbeat videos also have vanished from the site and YouTube page .
Voters trying to view the Chelsea Clinton Mother ’s Day tribute are directed to an error page that informs them : “ We ’ve recently updated our site and we welcome you to explore the new content from the navigation above . ”
Although cleaning up a campaign site for the sake of party unity is n’t unusual , the YouTube scrubbing is .
Other failed White House hopefuls have left their free campaign “ channels ” — created before last summer ’s YouTube debates — intact , and ads for Republican Fred Thompson and Democrat Joseph R. Biden Jr. are still posted .
But the Clinton YouTube page is missing hundreds of videos , positive and negative alike .
Her victory speeches , a showcase of enthusiastic young volunteers and her pledges to keep fighting through the primary season are history .
Yet nothing is ever truly gone in the YouTube age because Internet surfers have spliced , diced and saved every campaign ad of the cycle .
Cable networks still can replay the ads , but any blogger who tries to link to the Clinton versions will get an error message : “ We ’re sorry , this video is no longer available . ”
Still intact on the Hillary Hub YouTube page are remnants of some of the nastier moments of the campaign , including Mr. Wolfson ’s insistence that he would not accept Mr. Obama ’s delegate math unless the Florida and Michigan votes were fully counted , and a Clinton surrogate in North Carolina responding to Mr. Obama ’s comments about “ bitter ” rural Americans .
Also on that page is a clip called , “ Confronted w/ facts Obama experiences technical difficulties , ” that shows a news report critical of Mr. Obama on the health care issue .
The HillaryClinton.com page is no longer funded by the presidential campaign , and a new disclaimer notes that “ Friends of Hillary , ” Mrs. Clinton ’s Senate re-election committee , is paying for the site .
She is not up for re-election until 2012 .
Mrs. Clinton will be fundraising for Democratic candidates until the November election using her HillPAC political action committee .
Its Web site , HillPac.com , was reactivated this week .

Brain - imaging study proves that it's hard to part with the things we own .
Once we 've bought something , it can take an even higher price to make us let it go .
Punchstock
Have you ever felt your heart wrench when selling your beaten - up old car , or offered up a formerly prized possession to the voracious hordes on eBay with a hint of sadness ?
If so , you have experienced the ' endowment effect ' – in which people value a something more once they possess it .
Exactly why this happens is not known .
It could be because humans overvalue the positive and ignore the negative associations , or it could be that the thought of losing something is just too much to bear .
Now , psychologists led by Brian Knutson at Stanford University in Palo Alto , California , have imaged the brain as it struggles with this effect — and have shown that parting with our possessions really does hurt1 .
Fear of loss
“ Selling something you like is painful , ” says Scott Rick , who studies emotional responses at the University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , and is co-author of the paper , published in the journal Neuron .
Their findings suggest that the endowment effect is due to simple anxiety over losing our possessions , rather than any tendency to overvalue it .
Knutson ’s team recreated the endowment effect in the lab .
They gave each of their 24 right - handed subjects a gift of two out of six desirable electrical items , and $ 60 in cash .
Volunteers were then presented with a picture of one of the six items , and asked to think either about buying the item or selling it .
Four seconds later , they were told a price for the item , and then four seconds later they were given a further four seconds to choose whether to sell or buy the item at that price , depending on whether they were being tested on willingness to buy or sell .
The endowment effect is alive and well , Knutson and his colleagues found .
“ We might only pay $ 35 for an iPod nano , but we wo n’t sell it for less than $ 70 , ” says Rick .

Money on the brain
The tests were run in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner , tracking certain areas of the brain known to be associated with buying and selling .
If the reason for the endowment effect came from the products being overvalued by their owners , Knutson ’s team expected to see a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbus change during the test .
It did n’t , “ whether buying or selling , the activation in the nucleus accumbus looked the same ” , says Rick .
But others part of the brain , the insula , which has a role in the experience of pain , and the greater mesial prefrontal cortex became activated when the subjects contemplated selling one of their items .
If they had ranked that item as one they particularly liked , the change in the insula was greater .
According to this research , this is because of loss aversion , says Rick .
“ It is not because people are overplaying the positive [ aspects of a possession ] . ”
Rather , we just become attached to objects we own — so much so that it takes a lot to convince us to part with them .
The International Red Cross “ warned that the abuse constituted war crimes , placing the highest officials in the U.S. Government in jeopardy of being prosecuted . ”

Mr Dwyer , a New Yorker who enlisted after the September 11 terrorist attacks , got married just before leaving for Iraq .
His unit , a squadron of the 7th Cavalry Regiment , was in the vanguard of the initial US thrust and involved in fighting almost every day for the first three weeks .
About a quarter of the deaths occurred in Iraq
The US army has said the number of suicides in the military last year was the highest since records began , with 115 recorded .
The year saw increased violence in Iraq and Afghanistan , and about a quarter of the suicides happened in Iraq .
The extension of deployments from 12 to 15 months added to the strain on soldiers serving abroad .
Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama called the figures a tragic reminder of the costs of the Iraq war .
The figure of 115 deaths in 2007 represents an increase of almost 13 % over the number for 2006 , an army source told the Associated Press .
A military official acknowledged that the wars were having an effect .
" Mainly it is the long time and multiple deployments away from home , the exposure to really terrifying and horrifying things , the easy availability of loaded weapons , and , of course , it 's very , very busy right now , " said Col Elspeth Ritchie .

In order to pass their political driving test , successful politicians need to be masters of one tricky manoeuvre in particular - the U - turn .
The candidates have shifted their positions on a number of policies
The contenders in this year 's US presidential election are no exceptions - both John McCain and Barack Obama have engaged in some nifty repositioning .
Mr McCain 's U - turns have mostly increased his appeal to the Republican Party 's base , placing him on a rightward trajectory .
Barack Obama has been performing a more traditional manoeuvre : running to the left during the primaries , when party activists need to be wooed , then shifting to the centre once the nomination is clinched .
Flip - flopping politicians will always attract charges of hypocrisy and opportunism : it may be worth it if it helps them win over undecided voters in the middle , but when the goal is to shore up their political base , the benefits are much less clear .
Here are some examples .
JOHN MCCAIN
Having long been a member of his party 's more moderate wing on a number of issues , Mr McCain began adopting more right - wing positions during the primary campaign .
Immigration Last year , Mr McCain was one of the key backers of President Bush 's plan for " comprehensive immigration reform " , which would have created " paths to citizenship " for illegal immigrants , while investing more money in border security .
The plan was very unpopular with the Republican rank - and - file , and Senate Republicans succeeded in blocking the scheme .
During the primaries , Mr McCain announced that his immigration focus would be on securing America 's borders , rather than on giving illegal immigrants the chance to become US citizens .
" I understand why you would call it a , quote , shift , " McCain told reporters in November 2007 .
" I say it is a lesson learned about what the American people 's priorities are .
And their priority is to secure the borders . "
Christian right Another McCain , quote , shift was in his relationship with the religious right of his party .
During his 2000 bid for the Republican nomination , relations between Mr McCain and Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell were notoriously fractious .
The Arizona senator memorably described Mr Falwell and fellow members of the religious right as " agents of intolerance " .
But in 2006 , ahead of his second presidential run , Mr McCain delivered the commencement address at Mr Falwell 's Liberty University , after which he attended a small private party hosted by his former political adversary .
Interrogation rules
More recently , Mr McCain angered his former allies in the political centre by supporting a bill exempting the CIA from following the same rules on interrogation as the US Army .
Guantanamo Mr McCain was one of the most prominent Republican voices opposed to the Bush administration 's detention policy in Guantanamo Bay .
But when the Supreme Court recently ruled that Guantanamo detainees should have access to US courts , Mr McCain described it as " one of the worst decisions in the history of the country " .
Oil drilling Since sewing up the Republican nomination in March , Mr McCain - one of only a few prominent Republicans to accept the argument that human activity is causing climate change - has dropped his previous objection to lifting the ban on oil exploration off the coast of the US .
BARACK OBAMA
Since clinching the Democratic nomination , Barack Obama has also been making headlines for his policy shifts .
Campaign finance
Last month he announced that he would be rejecting public financing for his campaign , and would instead rely on private donations .
The McCain camp accused Mr Obama of " going back on his word " , although Mr Obama insisted that he had never made a promise to stay in the public finance system .
Surveillance programme Mr Obama also raised eyebrows when he announced that he would not be opposing a bill going through Congress giving immunity to telephone companies involved in the Bush administration 's controversial warrantless wiretap programme .
His decision angered many of his supporters on the left , who accused him of going back on his 2007 pledge " to support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies " .
Gun control
When the Supreme Court decided to overturn Washington DC 's handgun ban , Mr Obama declared that the ruling " provide [d ] much - needed guidance " , despite having previously argued ( in a written answer that he says was drafted by an aide and which he had not approved ) that the ban was constitutional .
Iraq Withdrawing troops from Iraq has long been one of the central planks of Mr Obama 's campaign , and was something that set him apart from other Democratic candidates running for the party 's presidential nomination .
Since his campaign began , however , conditions in Iraq have changed , violence has reduced , and some commentators have suggested that Mr Obama 's position is out of date .
Mr Obama himself has announced that he plans to visit Iraq , where he will make " a thorough assessment " which could lead him to " refine " his policy .
Some critics have seized on this as an indication that Mr Obama is laying the groundwork for a change in position .
Free trade Mr Obama recently hinted to Fortune magazine that his strong anti-free trade rhetoric during the primaries may not be reflected in his actual trade policy should he become president .
His remarks are a neat summation of the pressures and temptations that lead politicians to shift their positions during the process of running for office .
" Sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified , " he said .
" Politicians are always guilty of that , and I do n't exempt myself . "

What are these ?
Keeping hundreds of millions of sheets of paper on file is n't easy , so the IRS had an application built to computerize their records .
It 'd scan paper tax returns into a WORM ( Write Once , Read Many ) drive system and record lookup data in a database .
That way they could filter by any fields they recorded in the database and access a scanned image of the tax return for any further information using a simple app , which sure beat the old method of data retrieval — digging through boxes , incurring huge wait times .
The nice thing about the old method , though , was that it generally worked .
The new system was full of bugs , in addition to several other irritating issues .
On Bobby 's first day he was put in front of the application , and right off the bat it looked amateurish .
Form elements not lined up properly , buttons not always the same size , inconsistent menus — not broken , but certainly not professional looking .
His boss , Boris , explained some of the finer features in a dry , humorless , low monotone .
" Now , as you can see heeere , " his boss mumbled , " this is pretty exciiiting . "
Boris would linger on certain syllables presumably in an effort to sound more boring .
His tone made Ben Stein sound like Freddie Mercury .
" Allll we have to do is click a feeew buttons annnnd ... "
Meanwhile he was typing some text into the fields to perform a lookup .
" And affffter a few short minnnnnutes ... "
Bobby was briefly impressed — Boris had made a joke !
Not a particularly funny one , granted , but certainly worth a polite chuckle ... except - wait a minute .
This is actually taking several minutes , Bobby realized .
And in Boris 's company , each passing minute felt like ten .
Boris whiled away the minutes describing some of his hobbies — toy piano tuning , model taxidermy , palindromatic haiku composition — each somehow more boring than the last .
After an eternity ( nine minutes ) of struggling to keep his eyes open and subtle closed - mouth yawning , an error message popped up .
" Ohhh , fidddddlesticks , " mumbled Boris in lifeless anger .
As Bobby would eventually learn , the database 's average response time for tax form searches was in the realm of 8 - 10 minutes .
That was if you were fortunate , though — it'd often just time out .
Although Bobby wanted to help , he was n't allowed to lay a finger on the database .
He was only authorized to edit the frontend code .
So to start off he gathered whatever information he could — the hardware ( Pyramid Minicomputer running four 150 Mhz processors ) and the software ( AT&T Unix and Informix DB server ) .
He looked through the code and made a few UI improvements , and it did n't take long for him to locate the biggest bottleneck — the database .
After getting in touch with the DBAs , Bobby was granted read - only ODBC access .
Bobby kept making tweaks and little optimizations , constantly running SELECT queries , but could n't get them to run any faster than six minutes .
He dug through ODBC settings , hoping to find something ... anything that he could change to improve performance , but judging by the crazy , arcane settings already set up , many had tried the same thing and failed .
Bobby had spent several hours and not gotten far from where he started .
Wanting something to show for the time spent , he threw together a quick " Please Wait " dialog box with an animated hourglass to give the bored operators something to watch while they waited for the data to come back .
Several days later , Bobby had a stroke of luck .
One of the higher - ups had caught wind of his UI changes and wanted a demonstration .
When the topic of speed came up , Bobby mentioned that he'd found the bottleneck and suggested he get full access .
It should n't be a problem since he worked under constant supervision anyway .
" I do n't think that 'll be an issue , " he said with a smile .
" Can you do it right now ? "
Bobby hesitated , then gave a weak " ... sure . "
He flushed a little red , concerned that he was wrong and he 'd embarrass himself in front of everyone .
A DBA was called to the room , who opened up a console window and turned Bobby loose .
Of course , it 's highly unorthodox for someone to be given absolute access to one of the IRS 's production databases , but no one wanted to question the big cheese .
The DBA watched Bobby like a hawk .
Bobby swallowed the lump in his throat , tried to ignore the seven sets of eyes on him , and typed some simple queries in an attempt to isolate the problem .
In short :
Indexes : none
Primary keys : none
Rows : ~ 2 M per table , four or more joins per query
Processor speed : 150 Mhz
Bobby fired off a few commands to create indexes on fields that he knew were frequently queried .
The DBA 's stare intensified .
Bobby felt more nervous , hoping that it would all work ok .
And after verifying that queries were still being profiled , he ran a SELECT query .
It took 0.22 seconds .
Crap , he thought .
There 's no way it could 've run that fast .
I must 've totally destroyed the production database .
Wiping sweat off his forehead , he ran the query again , this time to verify the results .
And the results were correct .
With each query he ran his smile grew larger , as did the rest of the room 's collective disbelief .
The " Please Wait " window would appear and hide so quickly that no one could even see it .
They tried to chart the difference , but what 's the point ?
8 - 12 minutes versus 0.35 seconds average ?
Management did all but break out the pom-poms and do cartwheels throughout the office .
The operators were so ecstatic that they actually threw him a party .
As for us US taxpayers , we benefited as well since we 're getting taxed faster !

ISR Issue 59 , MayJune 2008 1968
The year that shook the world Year of revolutionary hope
This article is based on a speech JOEL GEIER , associate editor of the ISR , gave at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign on March 26 , 2008 .
1968 WAS a year of revolutionary hope .
Most of the time people have little hope .
They accept or adapt to existing conditions around them , even miserable ones .
They feel powerless ; they do n’t think they can change things .
Most of the time revolutionaries are a small , marginalized minority , considered unrealistic and utopian .
Revolution is seen as being impossible ; people , we are told , are too apathetic or ignorant — they ’ll never fight back .
The working class has been bought off , it ’s fat and contented ; so forget it , relax , enjoy your own life , that ’s the best you can hope for .
And then suddenly , unexpectedly , out of nowhere there are huge explosions from below , in which millions of people heroically engage in radical struggles that totally transform the world , politics , and themselves .
They reach for revolutionary solutions to the oppressive conditions they live under , and large numbers of them come to revolutionary consciousness .
In this country , for example , tens of thousands of people thought of themselves as revolutionaries in the late 1960s .
By 1970 , 3 million Americans , according to public opinion polls , believed that a revolution was necessary in the United States .
A majority of young Blacks identified with the Black Panther Party .
We ’re told those things ca n’t happen in the United States — that millions of people could never consider themselves to be revolutionaries — but they did .
Large numbers of people wanted not just any change ; they wanted a sweeping radical , revolutionary socialist change .
They did n’t just want to elect somebody different ; they wanted to do away with rulers and ruled .
They wanted to do away with rich and poor , with bankers and bosses .
They wanted to run their own lives , in what was called participatory democracy .
Participatory democracy was the idea that we should have the right to make the most important decisions that affect our lives , and that we should determine the conditions under which we live .
And the key word of 1968 was liberation — national liberation , Black liberation , and women ’s liberation .
As the French put it , “ with the eating comes the appetite . ”
As people began to see that there could be change , new movements that had not previously existed , like the women ’s and gay movement arose .
People began to speak of new needs , new demands , that “ all of us want to change .
We want an end to our oppression .
We want an end to our exploitation .
We want to run things .
We want power to the people .
We want popular power .
We want workers ’ control . ”
Those ideas of the revolutionary socialist movement , which had been marginalized for a generation and have been marginalized for a generation again , became popular ideas for millions of people in 1968 , and they spread everywhere .
I remember one of the slogans we used to chant on demonstrations .
“ London , Paris , Rome , Berlin , we will fight , we will win . ”
Every place in Europe exploded , both sides of the Iron Curtain , in Poland and in Czechoslovakia ; in Western Europe , in Italy and Spain ; in Asia , in India and Pakistan ; and in Latin America , in Mexico , Argentina , and elsewhere .
Millions of people throughout the world burst into struggle .
The global nature of the uprising raised the horizons of movement activists , turned us into internationalists , and made us aware that we were allied to , and part of , the struggle for liberation everywhere , that we were the American arm of an international revolutionary socialist movement .
Because of time limitations I have to limit my remarks to two key places — the United States and France , and what occurred that led to the enormous radicalization in those countries .
In the 1960s the radicalization started inside the United States .
It began with the sit-ins of the civil rights movement in the South in February of 1960 .
And by 1968 the radical movement in the United States was probably larger , and more active , than in practically any other country in the world .
It was n’t going to remain so ; after 1968 huge revolutionary movements were going to appear everywhere , but going into 1968 it was the United States that was a center of world radicalism .
It ’s hard to believe that today given how conservative American conditions are now , but that radicalization was essentially based upon two things — the Vietnam War and the resistance to it , and the Black liberation movement .
Let ’s just start with the Tet Offensive , which is what opened up the huge international radicalization .
During the Tet Offensive , which began on January 31 , 1968 , 100,000 National Liberation Front ( NLF ) troops entered Saigon and all the provincial capitals in a battle for the cities of Vietnam .
Huge numbers of Vietnamese people were aware of this ; they had to provide support for the entry of 100,000 troops into the cities .
Yet not one person told the Americans , who were totally unaware of the immanent attack .
It was an enormous shock .
It was very clear that the NLF had the overwhelming support of the Vietnamese people against an American invasion .
The U.S. had been at war for three years , and there had been the usual promises of “ successful surges ” where the politicians and the media said there ’s a light at the end of the tunnel , the corner has been turned , that the United States is winning the war .
After Tet , it became clear to the American population that the United States could not possibly win this war .
The war , however , went on for another seven years .
The Tet Offensive led to the massive shift in public opinion against the war , and out of that , the growth of the U.S. antiwar movement that already existed as a network of groups active on an almost daily basis in virtually every college , church , union , neighborhood , and in the army itself .
There were later huge antiwar protests — involving half a million , a million people , demonstrating against the war .
The already existing antiwar movement rapidly radicalized as a result of the Tet Offensive .
It came to understand that the war was not a result of mistakes , which is what many people originally believed , or of government lies ; the war was a consistent part and logical outcome of American foreign policy .
Activists now understood that the United States was the occupying power , the colonial power in Vietnam , and that the resistance to the U.S. occupation on the part of the Vietnamese was legitimate ; that this was an unjust colonial war on the part of the United States and a just war for national liberation on the part of the Vietnamese , no matter who was leading them .
Whether it was the Communist Party leading them or not , they had the right to independence and self - determination .
That ’s something that became accepted throughout the antiwar movement in this country .
By the way , this still is not accepted today in terms of Iraq — that the Iraqi people have a right to resist occupation ; that occupation is not liberation ; that the Iraqi people , no matter what their politics , have the right to their own self - determination ; that they have just as much right to this as the American people do .
There began to be identification on the part of the antiwar movement with the victims of the occupation , with the Vietnamese .
At demonstrations people were no longer just singing , “ Give peace a chance , ” but were now chanting , “ The NLF will win . ” Internationalism began to overcome American nationalism .
Activists began to recognize that so - called national interests were the interests of our rulers , not of the American people .
There was identification with the victims of American imperialism , and the idea that we want them , the other side , to win .
Our government is the enemy , not the people over there .
They have a right to their independence .
That radicalized a whole generation in this country , the idea that every nation has a right to liberation , to self - determination to run its own affairs without some “ humanitarian ” intervention .
( Invasions are always presented as being humanitarian . )
Not that we are invading Iraq for oil ; no , we ’re there to bring democracy , or prevent civil war , or some other high - sounding imperialist party line that is presented to the American people to keep them passive and confused so the government can continue this war .
The mass opposition to the war , and the impact of the nature of the war they were fighting provided the context for a soldiers ’ revolt inside the American army .
It is difficult for people to understand that there was more opposition inside the American army to the war than there was on the college campuses .
Most history books are written as if this was just a student movement , and hide the rebellion of the American soldiers .
An organized and critically important opposition to the war existed inside the U.S Army .
The head - fixing industry cannot tell you the truth , they cannot tell you that American troops were violently against the war and the officers that tried to lead them into battle , that within a few years of the Tet Offensive , a quarter of all the American troops in Vietnam deserted or went AWOL , that those that stayed refused to engage in combat ; that they mutinied , and killed their officers in what was called “ fragging . ”
A quarter of all the officers killed in Vietnam were killed by their own troops .
There was an immense radicalization of the American army .
There were dozens of antiwar groups and 300 underground antiwar newspapers inside the army .
And those newspapers presented a radical and socialist analysis of the war .
This is from the Ft. Lewis Free Press : “ In Vietnam the lifers , the brass , are the enemy , not the enemy , ” or this from the Fort Ord Right - on Post : “ We recognize the enemy .
It ’s the capitalists who see only profit .
They control the military who send us off to die . ”
The American army collapsed in the three years after the Tet Offensive .
The troops could no longer be used as a fighting force ; they had to be brought home .
These three forces — the resistance of the Vietnamese , a mass antiwar movement , and a revolt inside the army — eventually ended the war in Vietnam .
Tet also had enormous impact internationally .
The rest of the world became aware that the United States could not effectively act as world policeman — it was bogged down in Vietnam .
No longer did the fear of American military force act as a decisive factor to maintain the status quo .
The stability of existing institutions of Washington ’s allies and clients were now called into question .
People were no longer intimidated .
The coming victory of the Vietnamese gave people throughout the world courage and hope .
If the people of Vietnam , a very poor , economically underdeveloped country could defeat the U.S. , then others could as well — if they had the courage , determination , patience , and organization of the Vietnamese .
Before getting into the French situation , I just want to discuss the other aspect of the radicalization here at home , and that is the impact of the Black liberation struggle on everyone in this country .
It is the struggle for Black liberation that was the dynamic , the motor force of the whole radicalization of the 1960s ; of the radical student movement , of the antiwar movement , and the movements that were to follow among women , gays , and other oppressed national groups .
It was the mass base for change in this country , in the struggle , first for civil rights and then for Black liberation that changed everything that went on in the politics of the 1960s .
The struggle for civil rights started off as a nonviolent direct action movement and by 1965 it had won the end of legal segregation in the South , the end of segregation in public accommodations and in the schools , and the right to vote .
It had been successful , but the South was now like the North .
It was like the North and northern racism , the institutionalized racism of all the institutions of American society , of employment , housing , and schools still remained .
Northern liberalism was seen for what it was .
And that was one of the things that radicalized people during Vietnam — the war was not conducted by right - wing Republicans , but by Kennedy and Johnson and the liberal Democrats .
The notion that the election of a liberal Democrat would end the war was hardly realistic .
The liberals were the people running the war .
Similarly in terms of what was going on in the civil rights movement ; when it shifted to the North , it shifted to northern cities that were run by liberal Democratic Party mayors .
These cities were totally segregated not by law but de facto , by custom , and Blacks there faced enormous police brutality and deep poverty .
This led , starting in 1965 , to a series of ghetto uprisings — from 1965 to 1966 to 1967 to 1968 .
Every year , every summer , was called the “ long hot summer , ” because there were hundreds of uprisings in the Black working - class ghettos .
Hundreds of thousands of people took part in them .
Tens of thousands of people were arrested by the police in these uprisings .
This is the only country that had hundreds of urban uprisings against oppression in the 1960s .
These rebellions radicalized the Black ghettos , leading to the call for Black power and for Black liberation .
They led to the creation of large numbers of revolutionaries inside the ghettos — of people who thought you needed a revolution in this country to end racism .
This radicalization led Martin Luther King , Jr. to reexamine his political strategy , and to shift dramatically to the left .
He came out against the war in Vietnam at his famous April 1967 speech at Riverside Church in New York and he began to take part in organizing poor people and workers , saying that there could be no equality without economic equality .
King was killed in Memphis , Tenn. , where he was supporting a sanitation workers ’ strike .
One - hundred twenty - five ghetto uprisings took place in the days after he was murdered ; 73,000 National Guard and army troops were called out to put them down — the largest use of military force in the United States since the Civil War .
King ’s death plus the ghetto uprisings shifted the movement from nonviolence to the creation of revolutionary organization inside the Black community , the most important of which was the League of Revolutionary Black Workers in Detroit , and , on a national basis , the Black Panther Party ( BPP ) .
Hundreds of thousands of young Blacks identified with the BPP .
Tens of thousands joined it in the next year or two , making it the first sizable revolutionary organization in this country since the start of the Cold War .
The BPP had an enormous impact on radicals — convincing them that they should be doing something similar .
The idea behind the BPP , however , was for a Third World revolution ; that Blacks inside the United States represented a colony , and that the Panthers were part of the Third World liberation movement .
The most important book on the left in 1967 was Régis Debray ’s Revolution in the Revolution ?
that tried to sum up Che Guevara ’s strategy , which was about guerrilla warfare based on the peasantry ; that you really can’t have an urban working - class revolution .
All the people inside the cities , including the workers , it argued , are totally contaminated and corrupted by city life , and the only revolution that can occur is through peasant guerrilla bases , foci , which will eventually take the cities .
All of this was to change in May of 1968 with what occurred in Paris .
It did not just transform the French Left , it altered the international Left everywhere , including in the United States , where the 1960s student New Left finally had to confront the reality of class struggle .
Paris was not a planned revolt .
It was a sudden , spontaneous explosion — which was started by students .
It spread to young workers , and from young workers it spread to the working class as a whole .
It began as a typical 1960s student struggle .
After the Tet Offensive , students at Nanterre University outside of Paris , called demonstrations in support of the Vietnamese at various American targets in Paris , including the American Express office .
It led to confrontations and clashes with the police .
The police arrested a few students .
Protests erupted demanding their release .
The students called for days of struggle at Nanterre University .
The head of the university shut the university down ; the action then shifted to the Sorbonne University in Paris itself .
When it did , the head of the university there , in typical 1960s fashion , called in the CRS — the widely hated and brutal French riot police .
At the Sorbonne , the police came in and started arresting and beating everyone in sight .
The ferocity of the police attack created mass support for the radical students and their demands .
The students then called for a student strike on May 6 , 1968 .
The riot police were brought in again .
They fought with the students ; 422 students were arrested .
There were lots of casualties .
But what made this different from other student demonstrations up until then , was that the students , under socialist leadership , fought back and 345 police were injured .
The confrontations had begun in October 1967 at Le Mans , where young workers from Renault and Schneider battled with the police , followed in January 1968 at Saviem Truck in Caen , with violent clashes between young workers and the police , and finally in March at Redon where similar fighting took place .
The day after the student strike , 30,000 students in Paris went into the streets chanting , “ Power is in the streets ” and singing the Internationale , the anthem of the socialist movement .
Public opinion shifted sharply in favor of the students .
The middle class in Paris was shocked by the police brutality against middle - class students that they had witnessed in the Latin Quarter and they became supportive of the students .
The attitude of workers was somewhat different .
They were totally impressed by the fact that students , even middle - class students , had fought back , that it was possible to fight back and perhaps win , as the students seemed to have the authorities over a barrel .
Young workers started to pour into the Latin Quarter to take part in these demonstrations .
A few days later all of the radical groups at the Sorbonne held a joint meeting and decided to call for a mass demonstration demanding the release of everyone who had been arrested .
“ Free our comrades ” was the main slogan , and it led to a demonstration on Friday , May 10 .
Tens of thousands marched through the Latin Quarter .
The riot police were brought out again .
In the clashes with the police , the students started to set up barricades , to show their determination not to retreat on their demands .
The setting up of barricades is part of the French revolutionary tradition , and a historic link to the heroic fight of Parisian workers in 1871 , known as the Paris Commune .
You set up barricades to hold off and fight the police … barricades made up of cars , trucks , trees — anything .
Fifty barricades were built in the Latin Quarter , which the demonstrators renamed , The Quarter of the Heroic Vietnamese Fighters .
The street cobblestones were broken up to throw at the police .
May 10 was the Night of the Barricades , of huge fighting between the police and students and young workers , and it had a wonderful impact , because the radio stations broadcasted it live to millions of people who heard what was actually going on .
It shocked the entire country , so much so that the next day , on Saturday morning , the trade unions called for a one - day general strike and mass demonstration on Monday , May 13 , in support of the students .
It was the largest demonstration in Paris since the liberation from the Nazis , as a million people took to the streets to defend the students against the police .
The trade unions under the leadership of the Communist Party were chanting , “ De Gaulle , goodbye ” ( he was the president of France ) , “ Ten years is enough , ” and the students were chanting “ All power to the workers , ” an omen of what was to come .
This general strike and mass demonstration on May 13 marked the transition from a student uprising to a working - class revolt .
The next day in Nantes , at the Sud Aviation factory , where weekly symbolic strikes of fifteen minutes to protest the cut in hours and wages had been going on for months , young workers under Trotskyist and anarchist influence , refused to return to work after the fifteen - minute stoppage , and marched through the factory .
They were feeling confident as a result of the biggest working - class demonstration since the liberation of France .
They marched through the factory , gathering support , and then they rounded up the managers , locked them up , while 2,000 workers barricaded themselves inside the factory .
So , a factory occupation was detonated by the militancy of the student struggle .
The next day at the Renault plant in Cleón the young workers did the exact same thing .
They did so because this was a backward factory .
Only a few of them had come out at the Monday demonstration .
They felt ashamed and they thought they had to make up for their poor behavior , so they took all the factory managers , locked them up , and barricaded the factory .
The next day the strike spread to all of the Renault plants , six in total .
That night the main Renault plant at Boulogne - Billancourt , the largest factory in France , employing 35,000 people ; the most militant , the most important factory in France — was occupied .
The Communist Party ( CP ) attempted to stop the Boulogne - Billancourt occupation .
The radical young workers , under the leadership of militants from the Trotskyist Lutte Ouvrière ( Workers ’ Fight ) and the Maoists , pushed it through and the CP decided it was better to try to put itself at the head of the occupation than to continue opposition to it .
The CP at that time was the main left - wing political group .
It was a mass organization and controlled the leadership of many of the key trade unions .
The occupation of Boulogne - Billancourt was the turning point , the signal for the occupations to become general .
The strike wave and factory occupations spread in the next few days to all of the important industrial plants in auto , steel , electric , chemical , and so on , first to all of the large factories , and the following week to all the small factories ; then it spread to the offices , to the banks , to white - collar workers , to teachers , and so on .
By the end of the following week 10 million people were out on strike and were occupying workplaces , in what was the largest general strike , the largest factory occupation , in history — and it was to go on until the middle of June .
The strikes led to a dramatic rise in working - class confidence and consciousness .
The first night of the occupation of the Renault factory at Boulogne - Billancourt , the workers put up a large banner over the factory .
It said , “ For higher wages and better pensions . ”
The second day they took it down and they put up a new sign over the factory , which raised the traditional left - wing slogan , “ For a Socialist Party - Communist Party - trade union government . ”
The third day they took it down and they put up another banner over the factory and it said , “ For workers ’ control of production . ”
In three days they had gone from higher wages to we should be running the show .
There was this enormous leap in revolutionary consciousness .
For the first time in twenty years , the working class was back as a revolutionary factor in politics , producing an enormous shift inside the Left ; not just in France , but also in the United States and every place else .
The idea revived that revolution is not just something that can happen in the Third World ; it can also happen in the advanced capitalist industrialized countries , but only as a working - class socialist revolution .
The radical Left began to argue that what was necessary was the organization of the working class for revolution .
And by the way , some of it went even beyond factory occupations .
In a number of towns , in Nantes , Caen , St. Nazaire , and a few other places , the workers took over and ran things .
In a few workplaces they continued production under workers ’ control , in other places they took over the towns ; that is , roadblocks were erected into the town , prices were put under housewives ’ committees , and everything was occupied ; the teachers ran day care centers for kids , and that sort of thing .
But for the most part its feature was the factory occupations , which went on for three weeks .
After about ten days the trade unions negotiated a deal with the government .
They came back with a proposal raising wages 10 percent for better paid workers and 35 percent for the most poorly paid workers , with all sorts of other concessions .
It was turned down in all the factories — booed down , voted down .
The occupations went on , but the Communist Party and the trade unions it controlled were able to take this , what was the largest general strike in world history and the largest factory occupation , and break it up into a series of local strikes , and to shift it into a call for support for the Left in parliamentary and congressional elections .
The way to win was not to keep on occupying the factories , they argued , but was to vote for the Left in the elections , and bring communist ministers into a coalition government .
And so the Communist Party leadership was successful after a period of some weeks in , as I said , breaking the general strike up into a bunch of small local strikes , and then winding down each occupation , one by one .
They demoralized and manipulated workers in one plant to end their occupation by telling them that other factories were going back to work — because they wanted people back to work before the elections actually took place .
The truth of the matter was this strike went as far as it could possibly go so long as it was spontaneous and leaderless .
There was no alternative leadership to the trade unions and the Communist Party .
It went as far as it could and then it was over .
The general strike , factory occupations , and emergence of a large revolutionary Left opened up the question for the first time since the start of the Cold War of creating revolutionary parties .
It is difficult for people today to fathom what the working - class Left was like then , because communist parties have pretty much disappeared as mass forces with the collapse Stalinism , but at that point in time the French CP was a mass party and the main Left group .
As the French put it , you could do nothing without the Communist Party , and you could do nothing with the Communist Party .
You could not make a revolution without the Communist Party , and you could n’t make a revolution with them .
The betrayal of the movement by the CP opened up an enormous new space to the left of the communist and social - democratic parties throughout the world .
It raised the whole question of organization .
Until 1968 , there was an enormous hostility to revolutionary organizations within the New Left .
By the way , I did n’t really go through it , but many of the factory takeovers were due to the initiative of individuals and groups from small revolutionary organizations : Maoists , anarchists , and Trotskyists , or MAT as they were called in France .
At the beginning of 1968 , there was no revolutionary group in France that had more than 300 to 400 people .
All of the groups were small , but people who belonged to them started many of the occupations .
But you had a mass Communist Party of over 300,000 people .
There was nothing else on the left big enough to counter it .
Most people were hostile to revolutionary organization for reasons that are very similar to those that hold the Left back today .
Middle - class liberals , social democrats , and anarchists say that revolutionary parties are mired in original sin , that they are by nature hierarchical , elitist , antidemocratic , and authoritarian — and that anyway there is no need for organization .
As soon as the May events took place those ideas lost their mass appeal as their weaknesses became apparent .
They were totally ineffective in producing revolutionary change , and serious militants quickly understood that you needed an alternative leadership to the Communist Party and , even more , a revolutionary organization capable of replacing the factory owners and their existing state , with its police , courts , and army .
The strength and power of the working class is based upon its role in production , its collective nature , its collective actions , collective struggle , collective decision - making , which requires serious collective organization .
If you were going to be successful , you needed a working - class , revolutionary party .
There was a rush to join revolutionary organizations in France , in the U.S. , in every country .
In this country , some of it was exceedingly primitive .
The broad left - wing organization Students for a Democratic Society , which finally started to move from social democratic and New Left hostility to theory and revolutionary ideas , was destroyed by it own leadership , which broke up into competing groups of self - proclaimed Maoist “ vanguards , ” all of whom were trying to smash and grab SDS for people for their own little sects .
But there was throughout the world a rush to try and fill this organizational vacuum on the left , because it was accepted that revolution was possible in the advanced world .
For the next seven years there was a mass working - class upsurge in many countries and prerevolutionary situations in parts of southern Europe , and South America .
These struggles raised questions in people ’s minds about how do we actually win .
How do we take power ?
You ca n’t win with some threadbare ideas replacing revolutionary theory .
You ca n’t win without organization .
How are you going to do that ?
For the next seven years there was an enormous struggle .
There was an international working - class upsurge in many countries , with strikes , wildcat strikes , rank - and - file groups inside unions , factory occupations , workers ’ councils , even workers ’ control in some places .
In two places the struggle reached its highest point — in Chile in 1973 and in Portugal in 1974 and 1975 .
In both places working - class revolutions developed but were eventually defeated .
Since the defeat of the revolutionary wave that began in 1968 and ran until 1975 , we have had thirty years of reaction .
One of the things that you ’re told today is do n’t be too radical , but the weakness of the Left of the 1960s was that it was not revolutionary enough , that it did not go all the way .
When you engage in radical struggle , if you do n’t win , there ’s going to be an attempt to take everything back , and there was .
In Chile and in Argentina , defeat led to military dictatorships , to the police going into the factories taking out the working - class vanguard and killing them to intimidate and destroy the workers ’ movement .
It other places it did n’t go that far , but what we got here and internationally were thirty years of reaction — of the free market , of neoliberalism , and of sharply increased inequality .
We have had thirty years of an employers ’ offensive , and all the reactionary politics tied up with it — opposition to abortion , to women ’s liberation , to a woman ’s right to control her body ; and an attempt to push back all the gains of the civil rights movement , a union - busting attack on workers ’ organizations and living standards .
A million Black men are in jail today , mostly on nonviolent drug charges .
In terms of the criminal justice system things are more racist than they were under Jim Crow segregation .
Wages have not risen ( in real terms ) since 1973 .
Students have it worse than when I went to school .
The rulers of this country were able to win — and have introduced their entire reactionary program .
For thirty years we ’ve had to put up with it , but now things are starting to open up because they have another defeated war and they have an economic crisis on their hands that is the biggest thing in fifty to sixty years and they know it .
This is not just a recession we are entering ; but an enormous financial meltdown , and with it a crisis of the international capitalist system .
Years like 1968 come ; 1968 was not the only revolutionary year .
There was 1917 .
There was 1919 .
There was 1936 .
Those years come .
The question is whether people are prepared for them ; whether they are prepared for when the conditions for an explosion exist — and I will tell you I think the conditions for an explosion exist in this country .
Lots of people think that everything is screwed up — everything .
They do n’t think that there ’s anything they can do about it , they do n’t know how you can change it , but they think that things are terrible , because they are terrible for them .
Millions of people are losing their homes ; millions of people will lose their jobs .
As I said , there has n’t been a wage increase in this country since 1973 , even though the economy has tripled in size .
The rich , the employers , have gotten everything .
The possibility for an explosion exists .
That does n’t mean it ’s going to occur for some period of time .
Yet for the first time in years you can see a thoroughgoing repudiation of the Right , and the promises that Clinton and Obama make are to appeal to the change in consciousness , the shift to the left , among working people .
People are starting to have expectations that things will change .
They hope that .
We will see what happens when the Democrats come into power and how they actually handle the war and a serious recession , and what happens to peoples ’ expectations , whether they go further , whether they radicalize more .
We do n’t know when an explosion will come , but eventually an explosion will come .
In conditions that are miserable , where people are oppressed and exploited , there will be resistance .
They will fight back , particularly when they think there ’s any chance whatsoever of there being some success .
And the question for all of us is , are we going to be ready for it ?
All of us are called upon to make a decision .
There ’s nobody who can liberate you but yourself .
The first thing you have to do is liberate yourself ; liberate your mind .
Decide that you will not put up with injustice , oppression , exploitation , and war , that you ’re not going to go quietly being processed to put up with all they want you to accept .
You have to know who you are , and which side are you on .
The second thing you have to know is that you cannot liberate yourself by yourself ; you can only do it with other people .
There ’s no way to end your own oppression and exploitation without collective action , collective struggle , joining with other people to change this world .
And so all of you have to start thinking through what that means ; how you ’re going to educate and train yourself to be effective movement organizers , to raise your own and other peoples ’ consciousness , to create the sort of effective organization and leadership that can lead to a successful liberation .
The lessons of 1968 are that we should be preparing now for the future explosion by building revolutionary working - class politics , leadership , and organization .
Americans are driving about the same number of miles as in 2005 , when the USA had 8 million fewer people , according to a USA TODAY analysis of Federal Highway Administration data .
EATING UP THE MILES EATING UP THE MILES JOIN THE DISCUSSION JOIN THE DISCUSSION
The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline is rising fast .
How has the price affected you ?
Join the discussion at USA TODAY 's Fuel Forum to swap stories and money - saving tips with fellow readers .
CALCULATE YOUR GAS COSTS CALCULATE YOUR GAS COSTS Drivers cut back by 30B miles Americans drove 22 billion fewer miles from November through April than during the same period in 2006 - 07 , the biggest such drop since the Iranian revolution led to gasoline supply shortages in 1979 - 80 .
The numbers released Wednesday may reflect more than a temporary attitude change in consumers toward high gas prices , Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said .
Previously , she said , " people might change their pattern for a short period of time , but it almost always bounced back very quickly .
We 're not seeing that now . "
The decline in total miles traveled , though only 1 % , means that many drivers are cutting back far more because the number of drivers and vehicles grows by 1 % to 2 % a year .
Americans are driving about the same number of miles as in 2005 , when the USA had 8 million fewer people , according to a USA TODAY analysis of Federal Highway Administration data .
The declines are sharpest on rural roads , indicating that people are cutting back on long - distance and vacation trips .
FUEL FORUM : How have gas prices affected your driving habits ?
" It 's not a blip , " said Marilyn Brown , professor of energy policy at Georgia Tech , citing data showing surging transit ridership , dropping sales of sport-utility vehicles and sharply increased demand for gas - efficient vehicles .
" I think the difference between now and 1979 , when prices were comparable when you adjust for inflation , is there 's a sense of sustained pain .
There 's a sense that the era of cheap energy is a thing of the past . "
Among potential impacts of Americans driving less : • Drivers might notice " some reduction " in traffic congestion , said Tim Lomax of the Texas Transportation Institute .
" But over several months , the typical commuter will adjust their driving patterns , " he said .
" If they normally leave at 6 a.m. , they might find they 're getting to work without congestion , so they 'll say , ' I 'm going to spend an extra 15 minutes sleeping or reading the paper and leave at 6:15 . '
You get enough people doing that and you 're back to congestion . "
• Housing patterns could change as more people buy houses closer to work or find jobs closer to home , Lomax said .
" We might not be seeing so much of that right now since so many people are upside down on home loans because of the mortgage crisis , " he said .
• A shift in the way the nation pays for roads , bridges and transit .
As people drive less , the federal Highway Trust Fund — derived from gasoline and diesel taxes — is receiving billions less , Peters said .
She 's promoting tolling and making drivers pay more during peak hours .
David Snyder , 40 , an engineer in Internet operations at Turner Broadcasting in Atlanta , is moving from suburban Alpharetta to a new project near downtown .
" It costs more than $ 60 a week in gas , and that 's not including parking , " Snyder says of his current costs .
" That 's this week .
It might be $ 75 by next week . "

PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - With a record volume of international takeovers of U.S. companies , it almost appears America itself is up for sale .
The weak dollar and slumping stock prices of U.S. companies has created a window of opportunity for international buyers to snatch up American icons such as beer brewer Anheuser - Busch Cos Inc BUD.N and the landmark Chrysler Building in New York .
“ The dollar has depreciated so much that America is on the sale rack , ” said Sung Won Sohn , a professor of economics at California State University .
“ America has such an appetite for foreign goods -- Chinese imports and oil -- that U.S. dollars have gone overseas .
Now , many Americans are n’t happy that foreign companies are buying pieces of America with the money we gave them in the first place , ” Sohn said .
In the second quarter , acquisitions of U.S. companies by international buyers totaled $ 124.3 billion , marking the highest total for any second quarter on record and jumping 23 percent over the year - earlier quarter , according to research firm Dealogic .
International takeovers represented 22 percent of all U.S. merger activity in the first half of the year , up from 17 percent in the first half of 2007 , according to research firm Dealogic .
InBev NV's INTB .BR deal to acquire Anheuser - Busch for $ 52 billion gave Belgium the distinction of being the most active foreign buyer of U.S. assets in the first half of this year , followed by Spain and Canada , Dealogic said .
The Anheuser - Busch deal ranked as the second - biggest cross - border acquisition of a U.S. company in history , following Vodafone Group Plc's VOD.L $ 60.3 billion acquisition of AirTouch Communications in 1999 , according to Thomson Reuters .
Other U.S. assets recently falling into international hands include Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc BRL.N , which agreed to be acquired by Israel 's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.OTEVA.TA , the world 's largest generic drug company , for $ 7.46 billion ; and eye care company Alcon Inc ACL.
N which is being bought by Switzerland 's Novartis AG NOVN .VX for about $ 27.7 billion .

MORE THAN JUST A WEAK DOLLAR
Although some investment bankers and analyst pin the spike in cross - border activity to the weak dollar , others contend that strategy and the desire to expand globally were the motivators behind many of these recent corporate deals .
“ Strategic buyers do n’t wake up in the morning and say : ‘ This currency is cheap .
I ’m going to go do a deal . ’
They do a deal because it ’s strategic and makes sense , ” said Herald Ritch , president and co-chief executive officer of investment bank Sagent Advisers .
“ There ’s no question that , on the margin , currency levels tend to influence decisions , but strategic deals get done because they fit a company ’s strategy , ” Ritch said .
European companies have been the most active buyers of U.S. assets , with 314 deals so far this year , compared with 117 deals by Asian acquirers , and 33 by African and Middle Eastern buyers , according to Thomson Reuters .
“ Europe and the U.S. dominate deal activity globally , so it makes sense that deals between those areas would predominate , ” Ritch said .
Although some investment bankers view the second quarter ’s record pace of U.S. takeovers as an anomaly , Sohn said the 13 - percent depreciation of the dollar against major currencies over the past 18 months should fuel more acquisitions .
“ There are trillions of dollars overseas that have to be put to work .
This is just the tip of the iceberg , ” Sohn said .

Just remember that you 're standing on a planet that 's evolving
While still controversial in some areas , evolution seems pretty well established .
And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour ,
The speed of the earth 's revolution is once per day ( duh ) but at the equator the circumference of the earth is 25,000 miles so that makes the speed just over 1,000 miles per hour .
However , by the time you get as far north as the UK ( Eric Idle 's country ) the speed is actually less than 700 miles per hour .
The 900 figure might be good enough for our purposes .
That 's orbiting at nineteen miles a second , so it 's reckoned ,
The earth orbits the sun at 29 km / second and there is roughly a 3:2 ratio between kilometers and miles so 19 miles per second is pretty close .
A sun that is the source of all our power .
This may be a bit of hyperbole .
The sun is responsible for all wind and solar power and because our weather depends on the sun we would include hydroelectric power as well .
Oil and coal formed as a result of sun-driven processes on earth so that 's okay .
But this particular sun did not create uranium so it could be argued that it does n't supply all of our power .
IMHO .
The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see
Are moving at a million miles a day
The sun ( and therefore the earth and at least all the stars that you can see with the naked eye ) are moving through the galaxy at 225 km / sec .
This comes out to more than 6 million miles per day .
In an outer spiral arm , at forty thousand miles an hour ,
We are indeed in an outer spiral arm of the galaxy .
If we were moving at a million miles per day that would come out to 40,000 miles an hour .
If the number is closer to 6 million miles per day that makes it close to 250,000 MPH .
Of the galaxy we call the ' Milky Way ' .
Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars .
While there have been some estimates that are a bit higher than 100 billion stars , this is still a pretty good estimate .
It 's a hundred thousand light years side to side .
Give or take 20,000 light years , this is close to the current estimate .
It bulges in the middle , sixteen thousand light years thick ,
Estimates vary quite a bit but 10 - 30 thousand light years is at least one estimate for the middle of the galaxy
But out by us , it 's just three thousand light years wide .
And in the outer arms it is anywhere from 1 to 10 thousand light years wide .
We 're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point .
A very good estimate .
We go 'round every two hundred million years ,
Rounding down to the nearest hundred million , this will do nicely .
And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
Millions of billions would be quite a lot .
Some estimates are in excess of 1 trillion galaxies but that 's only thousands of billions .
But we are n't done counting yet .
In this amazing and expanding universe .
And probably expanding at a faster rate than before .
The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
In all of the directions it can whiz
We have pretty solid proof of that these days
As fast as it can go , at the speed of light , you know ,
But matter cannot generally move at the speed of light so the speed of the expansion is somewhat less .
On the other hand , there was a time in the early universe where it seems it did expand at a speed greater than the speed of light .
Twelve million miles a minute , and that 's the fastest speed there is .
The speed of light is about 186,000 miles per second or just a bit shy of 12 million miles a minute .
There are claims for things that can go faster but it is still speculation .
So remember , when you 're feeling very small and insecure ,
How amazingly unlikely is your birth ,
The human genome project has found 30,000 genes .
It would take only 33 genes to make every living person unique .
And pray that there 's intelligent life somewhere up in space ,
Hence my membership in Team SETI .
' Cause there 's bugger all down here on Earth .
An unassailable truth .

North Indians take pride in violating law : Delhi Lt Governor
February 07 , 2008 16:47 IST
As Raj Thackeray 's anti-North Indian statements have snowballed into a major controversy , Delhi Lieutenant Governor Tejendra Khanna on Thursday raised eyebrows when he said the people of north and west India take pride in violating the law .
" In this region , the situation is such that commonly it is a matter of pride to violate the law .
The behaviour pattern in South India is such that the people naturally stay within the limits of the law , " he said while addressing a function to launch the Delhi Police 's Traffic Patrol Scheme .
He remarked that there is much better compliance of law in South India and that too without any external pressure .
" It is a specialty of North and West India that the people feel a sense of honour and pride in violating the law and boasting that no action has been taken against them , " Khanna said .
He added that as Lt Governor of the capital , he has decided that efforts will be made to ensure that the citizens of Delhi treat law with respect and have a sense of fear towards overstepping its limits .
" Fear does not mean that there will be any high - handedness .
But if the people overstep the limits , then the law enforcement agencies should not remain mute spectators and will have to take effective action , " Khanna said .
" In taking such action , as Lt Governor , I will be completely with you , " he said .
" It is a cultural issue .
Therefore , I said that people themselves should improve their behaviour so as to keep themselves within the limits of law .
Being responsible citizens , they should have a feeling to do their duty .
That 's what I believe , " Khanna said when asked about his comments .
The Lt Governor was recently in the eye of a storm over reportedly proposing that it be made mandatory for Delhi residents to carry photo ID cards and also revalidation of driving licences issued by other states .
He later stated that he had never said ID proof would be made mandatory and that his message had been misunderstood .
On the issue of driving licences , he said the proposal was among several ideas being thought of to improve the traffic situation in the capital .
" In a recent meeting with traffic officials , we came to know that many major carriageways are either encroached by roadside vendors or illegal parking of vehicles .
Now , we have decided to make the major carriageways completely free at any cost , " Khanna said .
Referring to the problem of violation of traffic rules in the city , he said , " The Ambassador of Denmark , who met me two to four days before the arrival of Denmark Prime Minister , also spoke about the bad situation of traffic in the city and said the system can improve to a certain extent simply if the car drivers start driving in their lanes . "
Khanna launched a motorcycle traffic patrol scheme for checking traffic violations such as overtaking from the left side , zig - zag driving and unauthorised parkings .
He said 321 two - wheeler traffic controllers under the scheme will regulate commuters , beggars , hawkers and jay walkers to maintain discipline at bus stands and red lights .
Last Tuesday night , after Vermont , Rhode Island , Ohio , and Texas gave John S. McCain the delegates he needed to clinch his party ’s Presidential nomination , good - fellowship reigned — among Republicans , that is .
“ Senator McCain has run an honorable campaign , because he ’s an honorable man , ” McCain ’s last serious intraparty rival said .
McCain returned the compliment : “ I want to commend , again , my friend Governor Mike Huckabee . ”
McCain does not always use the word “ friend ” in a friendly spirit ; this time , though , he sounded perfectly amiable .
The celestial choirs were a little more muffled the next day , in the White House Rose Garden .
President Bush , offering the nominee - elect his ( somewhat superfluous ) endorsement , referred to McCain as “ my friend ” and himself as “ your friend . ”
McCain , for his part , abjured the “ f ” word .
He did say that he looked forward to their campaigning together , “ in keeping with the President ’s heavy schedule . ”
In the eight minutes that remained of the ceremony , the candidate contrived to mention the President ’s schedule four more times , always stressing how very busy it must be .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
Despite the manifold signs of a perfect Democratic storm this year , McCain is in an enviable position .
He can get some sleep .
He can raise some money .
He can watch with interest as Hillary Clinton spends her millions trying to dismember Barack Obama and Obama spends his trying to keep his limbs attached .
Meanwhile , he can continue to tack between the two ideological and stylistic identities that have got him where he is today — the rebel and the regular , the Rooseveltian ( Theodore ) and the Reaganite , the “ maverick ” and the “ conservative ” — without veering so far to one side that he forfeits the advantages of the other .
Over the years , McCain has performed this delicate task with some success , pairing up positions like Noah bringing animals aboard the ark .
He plumped for lobbying reform but has lobbyists running his campaign .
He opposed enacting Bush ’s tax cuts for the rich but supports extending them indefinitely .
He supported a “ patients ’ bill of rights ” but refuses to treat health care as itself a right .
He voted against banning same - sex marriage in the Constitution but favors banning it state by state .
He once disdained the likes of the Reverend Jerry Falwell ( who blamed AIDS on God ’s alleged hatred of a “ society that tolerates homosexuals ” ) but now embraces the likes of Pastor John Hagee ( who called the Roman Catholic Church “ the great whore ” ) .
He was for starting the Iraq war but against the way it was being fought ; now he ’s for the way it ’s being fought but against discussing whether it should have been started .
There is at least one question , however , to which two answers wo n’t do .
“ WITH MCCAIN ATOP TICKET , TALK SHIFTS TO SPOT NO. 2 , ” the Times headlined the day after Spot No. 1 was definitively filled .
According to the accompanying story , McCain has no Vice - Presidential short list and no process for making one , “ merely a process to find a process . ”
Nevertheless , the paper assembled a list of its own , based , one assumes , partly on conversations with persons in the know .
At the top : Governors Tim Pawlenty , of Minnesota ; Charlie Crist , of Florida ; Jon Huntsman , Jr. , of Utah ; and Mark Sanford , of South Carolina .
The “ mentioned as well ” category included three former governors : Tom Ridge , of Pennsylvania , and two of McCain ’s vanquished primary opponents , Mitt Romney , of Massachusetts , and Huckabee , of Arkansas .
What shines through this list of names is the banality of the calculations behind it .
All are off - the - shelf conservatives , ranging from the socially mild ( Crist ) to the fiscally rabid ( Sanford , who labels himself “ a right - wing nut ” ) .
All are white males .
All , as governors or ex-governors , compensate for McCain ’s dearth of administrative experience .
Several might help move some battleground state from purple to red .
None would disturb the peace — emphatically including the peace of the Democratic Party , if it ever regains it .
This space is usually devoted to pristine moral reasoning , but , hell , it ’s an election year .
Let ’s get down and dirty .
If McCain really wants to have it all — to refurbish his maverick image without having to flip - flop on the panderings that have tarnished it ; to galvanize the attention of the press , the nation , and the world ; to make a bold play for the center without seriously alienating “ the base ” — then he can avail himself of a highly interesting option : Condoleezza Rice .
To deal first with the obvious : Rice may be “ only ” the second woman and the second African - American to be Secretary of State , but she is indisputably the highest - ranking black female official ever to have served in any branch of the United States government .
Her nomination to a constitutional executive office would cost McCain the votes of his party ’s hardened racists and incorrigible misogynists .
They are surely fewer in number , though , than the people who would like to participate in breaking the glass ceiling of race or gender but , given the choice , would rather do so in a more timid way , and / or without abandoning their party .
And with Rice on the ticket the Republicans could attack Clinton or Obama with far less restraint .
By choosing Rice , McCain would shackle himself anew to Bush ’s Iraq war .
But it ’s hard to see how those chains could get much tighter than he has already made them .
Rice would fit nicely into McCain ’s view of the war as worth fighting but , until Donald Rumsfeld ’s exit from the Pentagon , fought clumsily .
And it would be fairly easy to establish a story line that would cast Rice as having been less Bush ’s enabler than a loyal subordinate who nevertheless pushed gently from within for a more reasonable , more diplomatic approach .
Rice is already fourth in line for the Presidency , and getting bumped up three places would be a shorter leap than any of the three Presidential candidates propose to make .
It ’s true that her record in office has been one of failure , from downgrading terrorism as a priority before 9/11 to ignoring the Israel - Palestine problem until ( almost certainly ) too late .
But this does not seem to have done much damage to her popularity .
In a Washington Post - ABC News poll taken when opposition to the Iraq war was approaching its height , she enjoyed a “ favorable - unfavorable ” rating of nearly two to one .
The conservative rank and file likes her .
Though she once described herself as “ mildly pro-choice , ” she is agile enough to complete the journey to mildly pro-life .
And she is a preacher ’s daughter .
Choosing Rice would be a trick .
Her failures would be buried in an avalanche of positive publicity for a personal story as yet only vaguely known to the broad public .
( One of the little girls who died in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing was her playmate ?
We did n’t know that !)
But the trick would not be an entirely cynical one .
Her ascension , though nowhere near as momentous a breakthrough as the election of Obama or Clinton , would be a breakthrough all the same .
In this connection , a kind word for George W. Bush may be in order .
By appointing first Colin Powell and then Rice to the most senior job in the Cabinet , a job of global scope , Bush changed the way millions of white Americans think about black public officials .
This may turn out to the most positive legacy of his benighted Presidency . ♦
Google has released protobufs .
Think of protobufs as doing for ASN.1 what XML did for SGML .
That is , it 's a simpler format for exchanging binary data that mere mortals may be able to use .
Libraries are available for C++ , Java , an Python ; and the format is well - documented for anyone else who wants to work in some other language .
According to Google ,
Protocol buffers have many advantages over XML for serializing structured data .
Protocol buffers : are simpler
are 3 to 10 times smaller
are 20 to 100 times faster
are less ambiguous
generate data access classes that are easier to use programmatically
For example , let 's say you want to model a person with a name and an email .
In XML , you need to do : < person > < name > John Doe</ name > < email>jdoe@example.com </email > </ person > while the corresponding protocol buffer message definition ( in protocol buffer text format ) is : person { name = " John Doe " email = " jdoe@example.com " }
In binary format , this message would probably be 28 bytes long and take around 100 - 200 nanoseconds to parse .
The XML version is at least 69 bytes ( if you remove whitespace ) and would take around 5,000 - 10,000 nanoseconds to parse .
Also , manipulating a protocol buffer is much easier : cout << " Name : " << person.name ( ) << endl ;
cout << " E-mail : " << person.email ( ) << endl ;
Whereas with XML you would have to do something like : cout << " Name : "
<< person.getElementsByTagName( " name " ) ->item(0 ) ->innerText ( )
<< endl ;
cout << " E-mail : "
<< person.getElementsByTagName( " email " ) ->item(0 ) ->innerText ( )
<< endl ;
However , protocol buffers are not always a better solution than XML – for instance , protocol buffers would not be a good way to model a text - based document with markup ( e.g. HTML ) , since you cannot easily interleave structure with text .
In addition , XML is human - readable and human - editable ; protocol buffers , at least in their native format , are not .
XML is also – to some extent – self - describing .
A protocol buffer is only meaningful if you have the message definition ( the .proto file ) .
I think Google is overstating the downsides of XML here .
They make the common mistake of conflating a horrible API ( DOM ) with XML itself .
In a sane API , you 'd just do something like this :
< xsl:template match=' person '> < xsl:value - of select = " name " /> < xsl:text /> </ xsl:text > < xsl:value - of select = " email " /> < xsl:template >
This would look even simpler in XQuery or E4X , but I do n't have enough practice with those languages to type them with reasonable confidence before my morning coffee .
Still , maybe this binary format can give the people who really need ( or who think they need ) a binary format for efficiency or other reasons their own sandbox , so they can stop peeing in ours .
Protobufs do show one lesson learned from experience : they mirror XML 's must - ignore semantics .
It is possible to put extra fields in a protobuf and not break every downstream consumer that does n't know about those fields .
That 's a rare quality in a binary format .
One question I have is what does it mean for a protobuf to be malformed ?
How easy is it to detect a corrupt byte stream ?
What will happen if someone deliberately attempts to feed bad data to a protobuf consumer ?
Protobufs are clearly designed with the idea in mind of taking bytes off the wire or from disk and shoving them into memory .
This technique has been incredibly dangerous in the past , and led to incredibly brittle software .
Whether the protobuf libraries are actually doing that or not , I 'm not sure .
However although I do see wire format documentation on Google 's site , I do n't see an actual BNF grammar anywhere and that makes me nervous .
A good rule of thumb for any wire format or file format ( and protobufs are really both ) is that consumers must be prepared for absolutely any byte stream as input , whether it's what they expect or not .
Any byte stream that does not satisfy the grammar must be detected and rejected .
Any byte stream that does satisfy the grammar must be acceptable .
Never trust external input to a program without verification .
Anything less is insecure and dangerous .
I do note that there C++ examples return error codes rather than throwing exceptions on parse failure , which smells bad to this java programmer , but maybe that 's just C++.
The real question in my mind is whether protobufs have any hope of working over the public Internet .
Schema - dependent , opaque binary formats work a lot better behind the firewall where one group writes the software to both produce and consume the data , than over the heterogenous world of the Internet where you have little idea who 's reading your data or why .
In that world , self - describing text makes all the difference , efficiency be damned .
High oil prices
The leaders of the G7 have been howling about high oil prices .
They have been to Jeddah to beg OPEC to produce more oil .
They have tried to blame speculators for bidding the price up .
They do seem to understand that prices are high owing to a growing imbalance between supply and demand at the price they would like to pay .
But they have done nothing to try and solve this unfolding crisis apart from fiddle while Rome burns .
The only part of this equation they can control is demand .
It is therefore imperative that action is taken to curb demand for oil within the G7 - now !
But no .
Rather than show any form of leadership the favored course of action by all is to allow the market , via price , to ration oil supplies between countries and within countries - and then quite amazingly to complain about the high price their common policy has produced .
The G7 policy of allowing the market and high oil prices to ration supplies is working .
G7 oil consumption appears to have peaked at 1681 million tonnes in 2005 .
It is unlikely this figure will ever be surpassed ( though it was exceeded in the 1970s and 1980s ) .
It is therefore the conscious decision of the G7 leaders to progressively deny poor people access to oil and to energy in general .
The creation of a new impoverished underclass within and without the G7 / OECD will have dire consequences for our society .
This is the outcome of G7 policy and the leaders must bear responsibility for these consequences as they unfold .
More equitable means of rationing oil supplies are available , but these options have thus far been spurned by the leaders of the G7 .
Energy poverty
Many who have followed this debate for a number of years have wondered how the peak oil story may unfold .
The early chapters are now written as electricity bills , natural gas bills , heating oil bills , gasoline bills and food bills all rise , the disposable income of lower income groups is being squeezed .
For many I imagine this may already mean selling that car , turning down the heating , eating less meat .
All this of course is sensible and good conservation .
But we are likely already in sight of many going cold and hungry in winter time .
And we are already witnessing rioting by groups who 's livelihood is threatened by rising fuel prices .
I fully expect to see widespread strike action within the public service workers in Europe this year or next , where strong and reasoned Trade 's Unions still exist .
With the squeeze on discretionary spending comes pain for a number of business sectors - leisure , airlines , airports , pubs , restaurants and retail to name but a few .
Unemployment will inevitably start to rise - and how will the newly unemployed cope with those rising energy bills ?
This is just the beginning of a Long Emergency that the G7 leaders meeting this week in Hokkaido fail to understand and are doing absolutely nothing to prevent .
Starving millions
There are a number of different reasons for food prices escalating around the world .
But two of the most important ones are converting food to liquid fuel and high energy input prices to farming .
The G7 leaders , the OECD and their affiliates are to blame for this .
They alone have the power to change the policies that have led to this point .
The G7 ( 8 ) summit
The summit has three main themes :
The World economy
Environment and Climate Change
Development and Africa
Reading the Japanese guidance on how to solve these issues leaves me with a sense of despair .
Discussion will include the sustainable growth of world economy , trade and investment , protection of intellectual property rights and energy and natural resources .
Japan aims to bring a specific outcome including the measures regarding rising oil prices and toward further liberalization of trade and investment .
It seems thinking is still very much focussed on growth and liberal markets .
These objectives may well help Japan continue to secure their share of global resources but they certainly will not reduce energy prices and work towards a more equitable distribution of resources .
Solutions
There are no simple and painless solutions to the greatest crisis ever faced by industrial civilisation .
The road to sustainability must start somewhere but I very much doubt that the path will start in Hokkaido .
Here are a few pointers as to what I see as the urgent actions required to address the early years of this crisis :
Recognise and publish the enormous problems associated with the future decline of fossil fuel production so that the population understands the reasons behind actions being taken ( immediate )
Introduce and enforce lower speed limits , uniform throughout the OECD ( immediate )
Introduce regulations on vehicle engine size and efficiency , uniform throughout the OECD ( phased introduction from 2009 )
Ban the inefficient production of liquid fuel from food throughout the temperate latitudes of the OECD ( effective 2009 )
Introduce regulations on the efficiency of electrical power generating plant ( phased introduction from 2009 )
Abandon plans for carbon capture and storage unless this is in context of miscible gas flooding of old oil fields leading to enhanced oil recovery ( EOR )
Abandon all plans for expansion of fossil fuel based transportation and power generation .
This is a list of emergency actions required to reduce demand for oil and energy immediately .
The voluntary reduction in demand should lower prices , reduce inflationary pressures and provide a few years breathing space .
This must then give way to a structured long term plan for reconstruction of power generation systems and transportation networks built upon sustainable electricity .

â€ œStates Rightsâ€ is an Anti-Libertarian Concept
By Steve Kubby
The concept of â€œFEDERALISMâ€ is properly used to describe a system of government in which sovereignty is constitutionally divided between the federal government and the states .
In contrast , the term â€ œSTATESâ€™ RIGHTSâ€ is a fraudulent and profoundly ANTI - Libertarian concept that has no other purpose but to deceive and rob us of our natural , inalienable , inseparable , non-transferable rights as human beings .
The Ninth Amendment says : â€ œThe numeration in the Constitution , of certain RIGHTS , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the PEOPLE .
In other words , just because the Constitution doesnâ€™t mention a particular right , that doesnâ€™t mean we donâ€™t have that right â€ ” and those RIGHTS are retained by the PEOPLE , not the State or the Federal Government .
The Tenth Amendment says : â€ œThe POWERS not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people.â€ 
States and governments have POWERS , but not RIGHTS .
Only people can have rights .
The US Constitution and Bill of Rights were conceived and written to limit government , not allow it to usurp our rights through some insipid oxymoron like â€ œStatesâ€ ™ Rights.â€ 

Mercury in vaccines causes autism
Advertisement
Children of the current generation receive 24 mandatory vaccinations .
A generation ago , only 10 or less were called for .
Through vaccinations , children receive 400 x the amount of mercury deemed safe by the FDA .
The Hep B routinely given to newborns contains so much mercury preservative that it would normally only be considered safe under standard medical guidelines to give to a 275 pound adult .
Why is this going on ?
Politics and corruption .
In the White House , in Congress , in the FDA , in the medical establishment and in the pharmaceutical industry .
Simple guidelines :
It is NOT the law that you must vaccinate your children ( no matter what the doctor or schools tell you ) , and you can sign a form to make your child exempt .
The law states that schools must accept your children under 1 of 3 possible exemptions , depending on your state :
1. Religious - Vaccines are against your religion , no matter what religion your practice .
You do not need to list a religion .
2. Philosophical -
You do n't believe in vaccines , you do n't think they 're safe , you do n't think they 've been tested enough , etc .
3. Medical - Your child has an autoimmune disease or had a negative reaction to a vaccine in the past .
Under such conditions it is dangerous to vaccinate a child and it states in the vaccine insert not to vaccinate under these circumstances , but doctors and nurses are NOT taught this so you must be firm !
Vaccinations are a school policy , NOT the LAW .
If you choose not to vaccinate , the law is on your side .
Yusuf Islam won a libel damages case in 2005
Musician Cat Stevens - now known as Yusuf Islam - has won libel damages over articles suggesting he refused to talk to women not wearing a veil .
The stories also claimed that the singer - a Muslim convert - would only speak to women other than his wife through a third party .
His lawyer told The High Court in London that " Mr Islam has never had difficulties working with women " .
The World Entertainment News Network agency has already apologised .
' False impression '
Its article , entitled " Yusuf Islam ignores bare - headed women " , was distributed to its subscribers including Contactmusic.com , read by more than two million people per month , which also published an apology on its website .
Mr Islam 's laywer , Adam Tudor , told the court the allegations had caused the singer " considerable embarrassment and distress " .
He said that the defendants now accepted that the claims were " entirely false " and had " created an utterly false impression of attitude to women "
" In his normal life , women feature among some of the most influential people in Mr Islam 's team . "
Mr Tudor added that the story " cast serious aspersions , quite wrongly , on his religious faith , which is of the utmost importance to him " .
WENN and Contactmusic.com also agreed to pay the singer 's legal costs , while the damages have been donated to his charity Small Kindness .
The musician , who converted to Islam in 1977 , was not in court .
In 2005 , Mr Islam won substantial libel damages from The Sun and Sunday Times after they falsely claimed he supported terrorism .
' Elizabeth ' was raped by 10 UN peacekeepers in Ivory Coast Children as young as six are being sexually abused by peacekeepers and aid workers , says a leading UK charity .
Children in post - conflict areas are being abused by the very people drafted into such zones to help look after them , says Save the Children .
After research in Ivory Coast , southern Sudan and Haiti , the charity proposed an international watchdog be set up .
Save the Children said it had sacked three workers for breaching its codes , and called on others to do the same .
The three men were all dismissed in the past year for having had sex with girls aged 17 - which the charity said was a sackable offence even though not illegal .
The victims are suffering sexual exploitation and abuse in silence
Heather Kerr
Save the Children
The UN has said it welcomes the charity 's report , which it will study closely .
Save the Children says the most shocking aspect of child sex abuse is that most of it goes unreported and unpunished , with children too scared to speak out .
No support A 13 - year - old girl , " Elizabeth " described to the BBC how 10 UN peacekeepers gang - raped her in a field near her Ivory Coast home .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" They grabbed me and threw me to the ground and they forced themselves on me ...
I tried to escape but there were 10 of them and I could do nothing , " she said .
" I was terrified .
Then they just left me there bleeding . "
No action has been taken against the soldiers .
The report also found that aid workers have been sexually abusing boys and girls .
" In recent years , some important commitments have been made by the UN , the wider international community and by humanitarian and aid agencies to act on this problem , " said Save the Children UK chief executive Jasmine Whitbread .
" However , all humanitarian and peacekeeping agencies working in emergency situations , including Save the Children UK , must own up to the fact that they are vulnerable to this problem and tackle it head on . "
UN SEXUAL ABUSE SCANDALS 2003 - Nepalese troops accused of sexual abuse while serving in DR Congo .

Heather Kerr , Save the Children 's Ivory Coast country director , says little is being done to support the victims .

Save the Children says the international community has promised a policy of zero - tolerance to child sexual abuse , but that this is not being followed up by action on the ground .
A UN spokesman , Nick Birnback , said that it was impossible to ensure " zero incidents " within an organisation that has up to 200,000 personnel serving around the world .
" What we can do is get across a message of zero tolerance , which for us means zero complacency when credible allegations are raised and zero impunity when we find that there has been malfeasance that 's occurred , " he told the BBC .

THE SHADOW OUT OF TIME
by H. P. LOVECRAFT
Chapter 1 [ edit ]
AFTER twenty - two years of nightmare and terror , saved only by a desperate conviction of the mythical source of certain impressions , I am unwilling to vouch for the truth of that which I think I found in Western Australia on the night of 17 - 18 July 1935 .
There is reason to hope that my experience was wholly or partly an hallucination — for which , indeed , abundant causes existed .
And yet , its realism was so hideous that I sometimes find hope impossible .
If the thing did happen , then man must be prepared to accept notions of the cosmos , and of his own place in the seething vortex of time , whose merest mention is paralysing .
He must , too , be placed on guard against a specific , lurking peril which , though it will never engulf the whole race , may impose monstrous and unguessable horrors upon certain venturesome members of it .
It is for this latter reason that I urge , with all the force of my being , final abandonment of all the attempts at unearthing those fragments of unknown , primordial masonry which my expedition set out to investigate .
Assuming that I was sane and awake , my experience on that night was such as has befallen no man before .
It was , moreover , a frightful confirmation of all I had sought to dismiss as myth and dream .
Mercifully there is no proof , for in my fright I lost the awesome object which would — if real and brought out of that noxious abyss — have formed irrefutable evidence .
When I came upon the horror I was alone — and I have up to now told no one about it .
I could not stop the others from digging in its direction , but chance and the shifting sand have so far saved them from finding it .
Now I must formulate some definite statement — not only for the sake of my own mental balance , but to warn such others as may read it seriously .
These pages — much in whose earlier parts will be familiar to close readers of the general and scientific press — are written in the cabin of the ship that is bringing me home .
I shall give them to my son , Professor Wingate Peaslee of Miskatonic University — the only member of my family who stuck to me after my queer amnesia of long ago , and the man best informed on the inner facts of my case .
Of all living persons , he is least likely to ridicule what I shall tell of that fateful night .
I did not enlighten him orally before sailing , because I think he had better have the revelation in written form .
Reading and re-reading at leisure will leave with him a more convincing picture than my confused tongue could hope to convey .
He can do anything that he thinks best with this account — showing it , with suitable comment , in any quarters where it will be likely to accomplish good .
It is for the sake of such readers as are unfamiliar with the earlier phases of my case that I am prefacing the revelation itself with a fairly ample summary of its background .
My name is Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee , and those who recall the newspaper tales of a generation back — or the letters and articles in psychological journals six or seven years ago — will know who and what I am .
The press was filled with the details of my strange amnesia in 1908 - 13 , and much was made of the traditions of horror , madness , and witchcraft which lurked behind the ancient Massachusetts town then and now forming my place of residence .
Yet I would have it known that there is nothing whatever of the mad or sinister in my heredity and early life .
This is a highly important fact in view of the shadow which fell so suddenly upon me from outside sources .
It may be that centuries of dark brooding had given to crumbling , whisper - haunted Arkham a peculiar vulnerability as regards such shadows — though even this seems doubtful in the light of those other cases which I later came to study .
But the chief point is that my own ancestry and background are altogether normal .
What came , came from somewhere else — where I even now hesitate to assert in plain words .
I am the son of Jonathan and Hannah ( Wingate ) Peaslee , both of wholesome old Haverhill stock .
I was born and reared in Haverhill — at the old homestead in Boardman Street near Golden Hill — and did not go to Arkham till I entered Miskatonic University as instructor of political economy in 1895 .
For thirteen years more my life ran smoothly and happily .
I married Alice Keezar of Haverhill in 1896 , and my three children , Robert , Wingate and Hannah were born in 1898 , 1900 , and 1903 , respectively .
In 1898 I became an associate professor , and in 1902 a full professor .
At no time had I the least interest in either occultism or abnormal psychology .
It was on Thursday , 14 May 1908 , that the queer amnesia came .
The thing was quite sudden , though later I realized that certain brief , glimmering visions of several hours previous — chaotic visions which disturbed me greatly because they were so unprecedented — must have formed premonitory symptoms .
My head was aching , and I had a singular feeling — altogether new to me — that some one else was trying to get possession of my thoughts .
The collapse occurred about 10.20 A.M. , while I was conducting a class in Political Economy VI — history and present tendencies of economics — for juniors and a few sophomores .
I began to see strange shapes before my eyes , and to feel that I was in a grotesque room other than the classroom .
My thoughts and speech wandered from my subject , and the students saw that something was gravely amiss .
Then I slumped down , unconscious , in my chair , in a stupor from which no one could arouse me .
Nor did my rightful faculties again look out upon the daylight of our normal world for five years , four months , and thirteen days .
It is , of course , from others that I have learned what followed .
I showed no sign of consciousness for sixteen and a half hours though removed to my home at 27 Crane Street , and given the best of medical attention .
At 3 A.M. 15 May my eyes opened and I began to speak , but before long the doctor and my family were thoroughly frightened by the trend of my expression and language .
It was clear that I had no remembrance of my identity and my past , though for some reason I seemed anxious to conceal this lack of knowledge .
My eyes glazed strangely at the persons around me , and the flections of my facial muscles were altogether unfamiliar .
Even my speech seemed awkward and foreign .
I used my vocal organs clumsily and gropingly , and my diction had a curiously stilted quality , as if I had laboriously learned the English language from books .
The pronunciation was barbarously alien , whilst the idiom seemed to include both scraps of curious archaism and expressions of a wholly incomprehensible cast .
Of the latter , one in particular was very potently — even terrifiedly — recalled by the youngest of the physicians twenty years afterward .
For at that late period such a phrase began to have an actual currency — first in England and then in the United States — and though of much complexity and indisputable newness , it reproduced in every least particular the mystifying words of the strange Arkham patient of 1908 .
Physical strength returned at once , although I required an odd amount of re-education in the use of my hands , legs , and bodily apparatus in general .
Because of this and other handicaps inherent in the mnemonic lapse , I was for some time kept under strict medical care .
When I saw that my attempts to conceal the lapse had failed , I admitted it openly , and became eager for information of all sorts .
Indeed , it seemed to the doctors that I lost interest in my proper personality as soon as I found the case of amnesia accepted as a natural thing .
They noticed that my chief efforts were to master certain points in history , science , art , language , and folklore — some of them tremendously abstruse , and some childishly simple — which remained , very oddly in many cases , outside my consciousness .
At the same time they noticed that I had an inexplicable command of many almost unknown sorts of knowledge — a command which I seemed to wish to hide rather than display .
I would inadvertently refer , with casual assurance , to specific events in dim ages outside of the range of accepted history — passing off such references as a jest when I saw the surprise they created .
And I had a way of speaking of the future which two or three times caused actual fright .
These uncanny flashes soon ceased to appear , though some observers laid their vanishment more to a certain furtive caution on my part than to any waning of the strange knowledge behind them .
Indeed , I seemed anomalously avid to absorb the speech , customs , and perspectives of the age around me ; as if I were a studious traveller from a far , foreign land .
As soon as permitted , I haunted the college library at all hours ; and shortly began to arrange for those odd travels , and special courses at American and European Universities , which evoked so much comment during the next few years .
I did not at any time suffer from a lack of learned contacts , for my case had a mild celebrity among the psychologists of the period .
I was lectured upon as a typical example of secondary personality — even though I seemed to puzzle the lecturers now and then with some bizarre symptoms or some queer trace of carefully veiled mockery .
Of real friendliness , however , I encountered little .
Something in my aspect and speech seemed to excite vague fears and aversions in every one I met , as if I were a being infinitely removed from all that is normal and healthful .
This idea of a black , hidden horror connected with incalculable gulfs of some sort of distance was oddly widespread and persistent .
My own family formed no exception .
From the moment of my strange waking my wife had regarded me with extreme horror and loathing , vowing that I was some utter alien usurping the body of her husband .
In 1910 she obtained a legal divorce , nor would she ever consent to see me even after my return to normality in 1913 .
These feelings were shared by my elder son and my small daughter , neither of whom I have ever seen since .
Only my second son , Wingate , seemed able to conquer the terror and repulsion which my change aroused .
He indeed felt that I was a stranger , but though only eight years old held fast to a faith that my proper self would return .
When it did return he sought me out , and the courts gave me his custody .
In succeeding years he helped me with the studies to which I was driven , and today , at thirty - five , he is a professor of psychology at Miskatonic .
But I do not wonder at the horror caused — for certainly , the mind , voice , and facial expression of the being that awakened on 15 May 1908 , were not those of Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee .
I will not attempt to tell much of my life from 1908 to 1913 , since readers may glean the outward essentials — as I largely had to do — from files of old newspapers and scientific journals .
I was given charge of my funds , and spent them slowly and on the whole wisely , in travel and in study at various centres of learning .
My travels , however , were singular in the extreme , involving long visits to remote and desolate places .
In 1909 I spent a month in the Himalayas , and in 1911 roused much attention through a camel trip into the unknown deserts of Arabia .
What happened on those journeys I have never been able to learn .
During the summer of 1912 I chartered a ship and sailed in the Arctic , north of Spitzbergen , afterward showing signs of disappointment .
Later in that year I spent weeks — alone beyond the limits of previous or subsequent exploration in the vast limestone cavern systems of western Virginia — black labyrinths so complex that no retracing of my steps could even be considered .
My sojourns at the universities were marked by abnormally rapid assimilation , as if the secondary personality had an intelligence enormously superior to my own .
I have found , also , that my rate of reading and solitary study was phenomenal .
I could master every detail of a book merely by glancing over it as fast as I could turn the leaves ; while my skill at interpreting complex figures in an instant was veritably awesome .
At times there appeared almost ugly reports of my power to influence the thoughts and acts of others , though I seemed to have taken care to minimize displays of this faculty .
Other ugly reports concerned my intimacy with leaders of occultist groups , and scholars suspected of connection with nameless bands of abhorrent elder - world hierophants .
These rumours , though never proved at the time , were doubtless stimulated by the known tenor of some of my reading — for the consultation of rare books at libraries cannot be effected secretly .
There is tangible proof — in the form of marginal notes — that I went minutely through such things as the Comte d'Erlette 's Cultes des Goules , Ludvig Prinn 's De Vermis Mysteriis , the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt , the surviving fragments of the puzzling Book of Eibon , and the dreaded Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred .
Then , too , it is undeniable that a fresh and evil wave of underground cult activity set in about the time of my odd mutation .
In the summer of 1913 I began to display signs of ennui and flagging interest , and to hint to various associates that a change might soon be expected in me .
I spoke of returning memories of my earlier life — though most auditors judged me insincere , since all the recollections I gave were casual , and such as might have been learned from my old private papers .
About the middle of August I returned to Arkham and re-opened my long - closed house in Crane Street .
Here I installed a mechanism of the most curious aspect , constructed piecemeal by different makers of scientific apparatus in Europe and America , and guarded carefully from the sight of any one intelligent enough to analyse it .
Those who did see it — a workman , a servant , and the new housekeeper — say that it was a queer mixture of rods , wheels , and mirrors , though only about two feet tall , one foot wide , and one foot thick .
The central mirror was circular and convex .
All this is borne out by such makers of parts as can be located .
On the evening of Friday , 26 September , I dismissed the housekeeper and the maid until noon of the next day .
Lights burned in the house till late , and a lean , dark , curiously foreign - looking man called in an automobile .
It was about one A.M. that the lights were last seen .
At 2.15 A.M. a policeman observed the place in darkness , but the stranger 's motor still at the curb .
By 4 o'clock the motor was certainly gone .
It was at 6 o'clock that a hesitant , foreign voice on the telephone asked Dr Wilson to call at my house and bring me out of a peculiar faint .
This call — a long - distance one — was later traced to a public booth in the North Station in Boston , but no sign of the lean foreigner was ever unearthed .
When the doctor reached my house he found me unconscious in the sitting room — in an easy - chair with a table drawn up before it .
On the polished top were scratches showing where some heavy object had rested .
The queer machine was gone , nor was anything afterward heard of it .
Undoubtedly the dark , lean foreigner had taken it away .
In the library grate were abundant ashes , evidently left from the burning of the every remaining scrap of paper on which I had written since the advent of the amnesia .
Dr Wilson found my breathing very peculiar , but after a hypodermic injection it became more regular .
At 11.15 A.M. , 27 September , I stirred vigorously , and my hitherto masklike face began to show signs of expression .
Dr Wilson remarked that the expression was not that of my secondary personality , but seemed much like that of my normal self .
About 11.30 I muttered some very curious syllables — syllables which seemed unrelated to any human speech .
I appeared , too , to struggle against something .
Then , just after noon — the housekeeper and the maid having meanwhile returned — I began to mutter in English :
" — of the orthodox economists of that period , Jevons typifies the prevailing trend toward scientific correlation .
His attempt to link the commercial cycle of prosperity and depression with the physical cycle of the solar spots forms perhaps the apex of — "
Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee had come back — a spirit in whose time scale it was still Thursday morning in 1908 , with the economics class gazing up at the battered desk on the platform .
Chapter 2 [ edit ]
MY reabsorption into normal life was a painful and difficult process .
The loss of over five years creates more complications than can be imagined , and in my case there were countless matters to be adjusted .
What I heard of my actions since 1908 astonished and disturbed me , but I tried to view the matter as philosophically as I could .
At last , regaining custody of my second son , Wingate , I settled down with him in the Crane Street house and endeavoured to resume my teaching — my old professorship having been kindly offered me by the college .
I began work with the February , 1914 , term , and kept at it just a year .
By that time I realized how badly my experience had shaken me .
Though perfectly sane — I hoped — and with no flaw in my original personality , I had not the nervous energy of the old days .
Vague dreams and queer ideas continually haunted me , and when the outbreak of the World War turned my mind to history I found myself thinking of periods and events in the oddest possible fashion .
My conception of time — my ability to distinguish between consecutiveness and simultaneousness — seemed subtly disordered so that I formed chimerical notions about living in one age and casting one 's mind all over eternity for knowledge of past and future ages .
The war gave me strange impressions of remembering some of its far - off consequences — as if I knew how it was coming out and could look back upon it in the light of future information .
All such quasi-memories were attended with much pain , and with a feeling that some artificial psychological barrier was set against them .
When I diffidently hinted to others about my impressions I met with varied responses .
Some persons looked uncomfortably at me , but men in the mathematics department spoke of new developments in those theories of relativity — then discussed only in learned circles — which were later to become so famous .
Dr. Albert Einstein , they said , was rapidly reducing time to the status of a mere dimension .
But the dreams and disturbed feelings gained on me , so that I had to drop my regular work in 1915 .
Certainly the impressions were taking an annoying shape — giving me the persistent notion that my amnesia had formed some unholy sort of exchange ; that the secondary personality had indeed had suffered displacement .
Thus I was driven to vague and frightful speculations concerning the whereabouts of my true self during the years that another had held my body .
The curious knowledge and strange conduct of my body 's late tenant troubled me more and more as I learned further details from persons , papers , and magazines .
Queernesses that had baffled others seemed to harmonize terribly with some background of black knowledge which festered in the chasms of my subconscious .
I began to search feverishly for every scrap of information bearing on the studies and travels of that other one during the dark years .
Not all of my troubles were as semi-abstract as this .
There were the dreams — and these seemed to grow in vividness and concreteness .
Knowing how most would regard them , I seldom mentioned them to anyone but my son or certain trusted psychologists , but eventually I commenced a scientific study of other cases in order to see how typical or nontypical such visions might be among amnesia victims .
My results , aided by psychologists , historians , anthropologists , and mental specialists of wide experience , and by a study that included all records of split personalities from the days of daemonic - possession legends to the medically realistic present , at first bothered me more than they consoled me .
I soon found that my dreams had , indeed , no counterpart in the overwhelming bulk of true amnesia cases .
There remained , however , a tiny residue of accounts which for years baffled and shocked me with their parallelism to my own experience .
Some of them were bits of ancient folklore ; others were case histories in the annals of medicine ; one or two were anecdotes obscurely buried in standard histories .
It thus appeared that , while my special kind of affliction was prodigiously rare , instances of it had occurred at long intervals ever since the beginning of men's annals .
Some centuries might contain one , two , or three cases , others none — or at least none whose record survived .
The essence was always the same — a person of keen thoughtfulness seized a strange secondary life and leading for a greater or lesser period an utterly alien existence typified at first by vocal and bodily awkwardness , and later by a wholesale acquisition of scientific , historic , artistic , and anthropologic knowledge ; an acquisition carried on with feverish zest and with a wholly abnormal absorptive power .
Then a sudden return of rightful consciousness , intermittently plagued ever after with vague unplaceable dreams suggesting fragments of some hideous memory elaborately blotted out .
And the close resemblance of those nightmares to my own — even in some of the smallest particulars — left no doubt in my mind of their significantly typical nature .
One or two of the cases had an added ring of faint , blasphemous familiarity , as if I had heard of them before through some cosmic channel too morbid and frightful to contemplate .
In three instances there was specific mention of such an unknown machine as had been in my house before the second change .
Another thing that worried me during my investigation was the somewhat greater frequency of cases where a brief , elusive glimpse of the typical nightmares was afforded to persons not visited with well - defined amnesia .
These persons were largely of mediocre mind or less — some so primitive that they could scarcely be thought of as vehicles for abnormal scholarship and preternatural mental acquisitions .
For a second they would be fired with alien force — then a backward lapse , and a thin , swift - fading memory of unhuman horrors .
There had been at least three such cases during the past half century — one only fifteen years before .
Had something been groping blindly through time from some unsuspected abyss in Nature ?
Were these faint cases monstrous , sinister experiments of a kind and authorship utterly beyond sane belief ?
Such were a few of the formless speculations of my weaker hours — fancies abetted by myths which my studies uncovered .
For I could not doubt but that certain persistent legends of immemorial antiquity , apparently unknown to the victims and physicians connected with recent amnesia cases , formed a striking and awesome elaboration of memory lapses such as mine .
Of the nature of the dreams and impressions which were growing so clamorous I still almost fear to speak .
They seemed to savor of madness , and at times I believed I was indeed going mad .
Was there a special type of delusion afflicting those who had suffered lapses of memory ?
Conceivably , the efforts of the subconscious mind to fill up a perplexing blank with pseudo - memories might give rise to strange imaginative vagaries .
This indeed — though an alternative folklore theory finally seemed to me more plausible — was the belief of many of the alienists who helped me in my search for parallel cases , and who shared my puzzlement at the exact resemblances sometimes discovered .
They did not call the condition true insanity , but classed it rather among neurotic disorders .
My course in trying to track down and analyze it , instead of vainly seeking to dismiss or forget it , they heartily endorsed as correct according to the best psychological principles .
I especially valued the advice of such physicians as had studied me during my possession by the other personality .
My first disturbances were not visual at all , but concerned the more abstract matters which I have mentioned .
There was , too , a feeling of profound and inexplicable horror concerning myself .
I developed a queer fear of seeing my own form , as if my eyes would find it something utterly alien and inconceivably abhorrent .
When I did glance down and behold the familiar human shape in quiet grey or blue clothing , I always felt a curious relief , though in order to gain this relief I had to conquer an infinite dread .
I shunned mirrors as much as possible , and was always shaved at the barber's .
It was a long time before I correlated any of these disappointed feelings with the fleeting , visual impressions which began to develop .
The first such correlation had to do with the odd sensation of an external , artificial restraint on my memory .
I felt that the snatches of sight I experienced had a profound and terrible meaning , and a frightful connexion with myself , but that some purposeful influence held me from grasping that meaning and that connexion .
Then came that queerness about the element of time , and with it desperate efforts to place the fragmentary dream - glimpses in the chronological and spatial pattern .
The glimpses themselves were at first merely strange rather than horrible .
I would seem to be in an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groinings were well - nigh lost in the shadows overhead .
In whatever time or place the scene might be , the principle of the arch was known as fully and used as extensively as by the Romans .
There were colossal , round windows and high , arched doors , and pedestals or tables each as tall as the height of an ordinary room .
Vast shelves of dark wood lined the walls , holding what seemed to be volumes of immense size with strange hieroglyphs on their backs .
The exposed stonework held curious carvings , always in curvilinear mathematical designs , and there were chiselled inscriptions in the same characters that the huge books bore .
The dark granite masonry was of a monstrous megalithic type , with lines of convex - topped blocks fitting the concave - bottomed courses which rested upon them .
There were no chairs , but the tops of the vast pedestals were littered with books , papers , and what seemed to be writing materials — oddly figured jars of a purplish metal , and rods with stained tips .
Tall as the pedestals were , I seemed at times able to view them from above .
On some of them were great globes of luminous crystal serving as lamps , and inexplicable machines formed of vitreous tubes and metal rods .
The windows were glazed , and latticed with stout - looking bars .
Though I dared not approach and peer out them , I could see from where I was the waving tops of singular fern - like growths .
The floor was of massive octagonal flagstones , while rugs and hangings were entirely lacking .
Later I had visions of sweeping through Cyclopean corridors of stone , and up and down gigantic inclined planes of the same monstrous masonry .
There were no stairs anywhere , nor was any passageway less than thirty feet wide .
Some of the structures through which I floated must have towered in the sky for thousands of feet .
There were multiple levels of black vaults below , and never - opened trap - doors , sealed down with metal bands and holding dim suggestions of some special peril .
I seemed to be a prisoner , and horror hung broodingly over everything I saw .
I felt that the mocking curvilinear hieroglyphs on the walls would blast my soul with their message were I not guarded by a merciful ignorance .
Still later my dreams included vistas from the great round windows , and from the titanic flat roof , with its curious gardens , wide barren area , and high , scalloped parapet of stone , to which the topmost of the inclined planes led .
There were , almost endless leagues of giant buildings , each in its garden , and ranged along paved roads fully 200 feet wide .
They differed greatly in aspect , but few were less than 500 feet square or a thousand feet high .
Many seemed so limitless that they must have had a frontage of several thousand feet , while some shot up to mountainous altitudes in the grey , steamy heavens .
They seemed to be mainly of stone or concrete , and most of them embodied the oddly curvilinear type of masonry noticeable in the building that held me .
Roofs were flat and garden - covered , and tended to have scalloped parapets .
Sometimes there were terraces and higher levels , and wide , cleared spaces amidst the gardens .
The great roads held hints of motion , but in the earlier visions I could not resolve this impression into details .
In certain places I beheld enormous dark cylindrical towers which climbed far above any of the other structures .
These appeared to be of a totally unique nature and shewed signs of prodigious age and dilapidation .
They were built of a bizarre type of square - cut basalt masonry , and tapered slightly toward their rounded tops .
Nowhere in any of them could the least traces of windows or other apertures save huge doors be found .
I noticed also some lower buildings — all crumbling with the weathering of aeons — which resembled these dark , cylindrical towers in basic architecture .
Around all these aberrant piles of square - cut masonry there hovered an inexplicable aura of menace and concentrated fear , like that bred by the sealed trap - doors .
The omnipresent gardens were almost terrifying in their strangeness , with bizarre and unfamiliar forms of vegetation nodding over broad paths lined with curiously carven monoliths .
Abnormally vast fern - like growths predominated — some green , and some of a ghastly , fungoid pallor .
Among them rose great spectral things resembling calamites , whose bamboo - like trunks towered to fabulous heights .
Then there were tufted forms like fabulous cycads , and grotesque dark - green shrubs and trees of coniferous aspect .
Flowers were small , colourless , and unrecognizable , blooming in geometrical beds and at large among the greenery .
In a few of the terrace and roof - top gardens were larger and more blossoms of most offensive contours and seeming to suggest artificial breeding .
Fungi of inconceivable size , outlines , and colours speckled the scene in patterns bespeaking some unknown but well - established horticultural tradition .
In the larger gardens on the ground there seemed to be some attempt to preserve the irregularities of Nature , but on the roofs there was more selectiveness , and more evidences of the topiary art .
The skies were almost always moist and cloudy , and sometimes I would seem to witness tremendous rains .
Once in a while , though , there would be glimpses of the sun — which looked abnormally large — and of the moon , whose markings held a touch of difference from the normal that I could never quite fathom .
When — very rarely — the night sky was clear to any extent , I beheld constellations which were nearly beyond recognition .
Known outlines were sometimes approximated , but seldom duplicated ; and from the position of the few groups I could recognize , I felt I must be in the earth 's southern hemisphere , near the Tropic of Capricorn .
The far horizon was always steamy and indistinct , but I could see that great jungles of unknown tree - ferns , calamites , lepidodendra , and sigillaria lay outside the city , their fantastic frondage waving mockingly in the shifting vapours .
Now and then there would be suggestions of motion in the sky , but these my early visions never resolved .
By the autumn of 1914 I began to have infrequent dreams of strange floatings over the city and through the regions around it .
I saw interminable roads through forests of fearsome growths with mottled , fluted , and banded trunks , and past other cities as strange as the one which persistently haunted me .
I saw monstrous constructions of black or iridescent tone in glades and clearings where perpetual twilight reigned , and traversed long causeways over swamps so dark that I could tell but little of their moist , towering vegetation .
Once I saw an area of countless miles strewn with age - blasted basaltic ruins whose architecture had been like that of the few windowless , round - topped towers in the haunting city .
And once I saw the sea — a boundless , steamy expanse beyond the colossal stone piers of an enormous town of domes and arches .
Great shapeless suggestions of shadow moved over it , and here and there its surface was vexed with anomalous spoutings .
Chapter 3 [ edit ]
AS I have said , it was not immediately that these wild visions began to hold their terrifying quality .
Certainly , many persons have dreamed intrinsically stranger things — things compounded of unrelated scraps of daily life , pictures , and reading , and arranged in fantastically novel forms by the unchecked caprices of sleep .
For some time I accepted the visions as natural , even though I had never before been an extravagant dreamer .
Many of the vague anomalies , I argued , must have come from trivial sources too numerous to track down ; while others seemed to reflect a common text book knowledge of the plants and other conditions of the primitive world of a hundred and fifty million years ago — the world of the Permian or Triassic age .
In the course of some months , however , the element of terror did figure with accumulating force .
This was when the dreams began so unfailingly to have the aspect of memories , and when my mind began to link them with my growing abstract disturbances — the feeling of mnemonic restraint , the curious impressions regarding time , and sense of a loathsome exchange with my secondary personality of 1908 - 13 , and , considerably later , the inexplicable loathing of my own person .
As certain definite details began to enter the dreams , their horror increased a thousandfold — until by October , 1915 , I felt I must do something .
It was then that I began an intensive study of other cases of amnesia and visions , feeling that I might thereby objectivise my trouble and shake clear of its emotional grip .
However , as before mentioned , the result was at first almost exactly opposite .
It disturbed me vastly to find that my dreams had been so closely duplicated ; especially since some of the accounts were too early to admit of any geological knowledge — and therefore of any idea of primitive landscapes — on the subjects ' part .
What is more , many of these accounts supplied very horrible details and explanations in connexion with the visions of great buildings and jungle gardens — and other things .
The actual sights and vague impressions were bad enough , but what was hinted or asserted by some of the other dreamers savored of madness and blasphemy .
Worst of all , my own pseudo - memory was aroused to wilder dreams and hints of coming revelations .
And yet most doctors deemed my course , on the whole , an advisable one .
I studied psychology systematically , and under the prevailing stimulus my son Wingate did the same — his studies leading eventually to his present professorship .
In 1917 and 1918 I took special courses at Miskatonic .
Meanwhile , my examination of medical , historical , and anthropological records became indefatigable , involving travels to distant libraries , and finally including even a reading of the hideous books of forbidden elder lore in which my secondary personality had been so disturbingly interested .
Some of the latter were the actual copies I had consulted in my altered state , and I was greatly disturbed by certain marginal notations and ostensible corrections of the hideous text in a script and idiom which somehow seemed oddly unhuman .
These markings were mostly in the respective languages of the various books , all of which the writer seemed to know with equal , though obviously academic , facility .
One note appended to von Junzt 's Unaussprechlichen Kulten , however , was alarmingly otherwise .
It consisted of certain curvilinear hieroglyphs in the same ink as that of the German corrections , but following no recognized human pattern .
And these hieroglyphs were closely and unmistakably akin to the characters constantly met with in my dreams — characters whose meaning I would sometimes momentarily fancy I knew , or was just on the brink of recalling .
To complete my black confusion , my librarians assured me that , in view of previous examinations and records of consultation of the volumes in question , all of these notations must have been made by myself in my secondary state .
This despite the fact that I was and still am ignorant of three of the languages involved .
Piecing together the scattered records , ancient and modern , anthropological and medical , I found a fairly consistent mixture of myth and hallucination whose scope and wildness left me utterly dazed .
Only one thing consoled me , the fact that the myths were of such early existence .
What lost knowledge could have brought pictures of the Palaeozoic or Mesozoic landscape into these primitive fables , I could not even guess ; but the pictures had been there .
Thus , a basis existed for the formation of a fixed type of delusion .
Cases of amnesia no doubt created the general myth pattern — but afterward the fanciful accretions of the myths must have reacted on amnesia sufferers and coloured their pseudo - memories .
I myself had read and heard all the early tales during my memory lapse — my quest had amply proved that .
Was it not natural , then , for my subsequent dreams and emotional impressions to become coloured and moulded by what my memory subtly held over from my secondary state ?
A few of the myths had significant connexions with other cloudy legends of the pre-human world , especially those Hindu tales involving stupefying gulfs of time and forming part of the lore of modern theosophists .
Primal myth and modern delusion joined in their assumption that mankind is only one — perhaps the least — of the highly evolved and dominant races of this planet 's long and largely unknown career .
Things of inconceivable shape , they implied , had reared towers to the sky and delved into every secret of Nature before the first amphibian forbear of man had crawled out of the hot sea 300 million years ago .
Some had come down from the stars ; a few were as old as the cosmos itself , others had arisen swiftly from terrene germs as far behind the first germs of our life - cycle as those germs are behind ourselves .
Spans of thousands of millions of years , and linkages to other galaxies and universes , were freely spoken of .
Indeed , there was no such thing as time in its humanly accepted sense .
But most of the tales and impressions concerned a relatively late race , of a queer and intricate shape , resembling no life - form known to science , which had lived till only fifty million years before the advent of man .
This , they indicated , was the greatest race of all because it alone had conquered the secret of time .
It had learned all things that ever were known or ever would be known on the earth , through the power of its keener minds to project themselves into the past and future , even through gulfs of millions of years , and study the lore of every age .
From the accomplishments of this race arose all legends of prophets , including those in human mythology .
In its vast libraries were volumes of texts and pictures holding the whole of earth 's annals — histories and descriptions of every species that had ever been or that ever would be , with full records of their arts , their achievements , their languages , and their psychologies .
With this aeon-embracing knowledge , the Great Race chose from every era and life - form such thoughts , arts , and processes as might suit its own nature and situation .
Knowledge of the past , secured through a kind of mind - casting outside the recognized senses , was harder to glean than knowledge of the future .
In the latter case the course was easier and more material .
With suitable mechanical aid a mind would project itself forward in time , feeling its dim , extra-sensory way till it approached the desired period .
Then , after preliminary trials , it would seize on the best discoverable representative of the highest of that period 's life - forms .
It would enter the organism 's brain and set up therein its own vibrations , while the displaced mind would strike back to the period of the displacer , remaining in the latter 's body till a reverse process was set up .
The projected mind , in the body of the organism of the future , would then pose as a member of the race whose outward form it wore , learning as quickly as possible all that could be learned of the chosen age and its massed information and techniques .
Meanwhile the displaced mind , thrown back to the displacer 's age and body , would be carefully guarded .
It would be kept from harming the body it occupied , and would be drained of all its knowledge by trained questioners .
Often it could be questioned in its own language , when previous quests into the future had brought back records of that language .
If the mind came from a body whose language the Great Race could not physically reproduce , clever machines would be made , on which the alien speech could be played as on a musical instrument .
The Great Race 's members were immense rugose cones ten feet high , and with head and other organs attached to foot - thick , distensible limbs spreading from the apexes .
They spoke by the clicking or scraping of huge paws or claws attached to the end of two of their four limbs , and walked by the expansion and contraction of a viscous layer attached to their vast , ten - foot bases .
When the captive mind 's amazement and resentment had worn off , and when — assuming that it came from a body vastly different from the Great Race 's — it had lost its horror at its unfamiliar temporary form , it was permitted to study its new environment and experience a wonder and wisdom approximating that of its displacer .
With suitable precautions , and in exchange for suitable services , it was allowed to rove all over the habitable world in titan airships or on the huge boatlike atomic - engined vehicles which traversed the great roads , and to delve freely into the libraries containing the records of the planet 's past and future .
This reconciled many captive minds to their lot ; since none were other than keen , and to such minds the unveiling of hidden mysteries of earth - closed chapters of inconceivable pasts and dizzying vortices of future time which include the years ahead of their own natural ages — forms always , despite the abysmal horrors often unveiled , the supreme experience of life .
Now and then certain captives were permitted to meet other captive minds seized from the future — to exchange thoughts with consciousnesses living a hundred or a thousand or a million years before or after their own ages .
And all were urged to write copiously in their own languages of themselves and their respective periods ; such documents to be filed in the great central archives .
It may be added that there was one special type of captive whose privileges were far greater than those of the majority .
These were the dying permanent exiles , whose bodies in the future had been seized by keen - minded members of the Great Race who , faced with death , sought to escape mental extinction .
Such melancholy exiles were not as common as might be expected , since the longevity of the Great Race lessened its love of life — especially among those superior minds capable of projection .
From cases of the permanent projection of elder minds arose many of those lasting changes of personality noticed in later history — including mankind's .
As for the ordinary cases of exploration — when the displacing mind had learned what it wished in the future , it would build an apparatus like that which had started its flight and reverse the process of projection .
Once more it would be in its own body in its own age , while the lately captive mind would return to that body of the future to which it properly belonged .
Only when one or the other of the bodies had died during the exchange was this restoration impossible .
In such cases , of course , the exploring mind had — like those of the death - escapers — to live out an alien - bodied life in the future ; or else the captive mind — like the dying permanent exiles — had to end its days in the form and past age of the Great Race .
This fate was least horrible when the captive mind was also of the Great Race — a not infrequent occurrence , since in all its periods that race was intensely concerned with its own future .
The number of dying permanent exiles of the Great Race was very slight — largely because of the tremendous penalties attached to displacements of future Great Race minds by the moribund .
Through projection , arrangements were made to inflict these penalties on the offending minds in their new future bodies — and sometimes forced re-exchanges were effected .
Complex cases of the displacement of exploring or already captive minds by minds in various regions of the past had been known and carefully rectified .
In every age since the discovery of mind projection , a minute but well - recognised element of the population consisted of Great Race minds from past ages , sojourning for a longer or shorter while .
When a captive mind of alien origin was returned to its own body in the future , it was purged by an intricate mechanical hypnosis of all it had learned in the Great Race 's age — this because of certain troublesome consequences inherent in the general carrying forward of knowledge in large quantities .
The few existing instances of clear transmission had caused , and would cause at known future times , great disasters .
And it was largely in consequence of two cases of this kind — said the old myths — that mankind had learned what it had concerning the Great Race .
Of all things surviving physically and directly from that aeon - distant world , there remained only certain ruins of great stones in far places and under the sea , and parts of the text of the frightful Pnakotic Manuscripts .
Thus the returning mind reached its own age with only the faintest and most fragmentary visions of what it had undergone since its seizure .
All memories that could be eradicated were eradicated , so that in most cases only a dream - shadowed blank stretched back to the time of the first exchange .
Some minds recalled more than others , and the chance joining of memories had at rare times brought hints of the forbidden past to future ages .
There probably never was a time when groups or cults did not secretly cherish certain of these hints .
In the Necronomicon the presence of such a cult among human beings was suggested — a cult that sometimes gave aid to minds voyaging down the aeons from the days of the Great Race .
And , meanwhile , the Great Race itself waxed well - nigh omniscient , and turned to the task of setting up exchanges with the minds of other planets , and of exploring their pasts and futures .
It sought likewise to fathom the past years and origin of that black , aeon - dead orb in far space whence its own mental heritage had come — for the mind of the Great Race was older than its bodily form .
The beings of a dying elder world , wise with the ultimate secrets , had looked ahead for a new world and species wherein they might have long life ; and had sent their minds en masse into that future race best adapted to house them — the cone - shaped beings that peopled our earth a billion years ago .
Thus the Great Race came to be , while the myriad minds sent backward were left to die in the horror of strange shapes .
Later the race would again face death , yet would live through another forward migration of its best minds into the bodies of others who had a longer physical span ahead of them .
Such was the background of intertwined legend and hallucination .
When , around 1920 , I had my researches in coherent shape , I felt a slight lessening of the tension which their earlier stages had increased .
After all , and in spite of the fancies prompted by blind emotions , were not most of my phenomena readily explainable ?
Any chance might have turned my mind to dark studies during the amnesia — and then I read the forbidden legends and met the members of ancient and ill - regarded cults .
That , plainly , supplied the material for the dreams and disturbed feelings which came after the return of memory .
As for the marginal notes in dream - hieroglyphs and languages unknown to me , but laid at my door by librarians — I might easily have picked up a smattering of the tongues during my secondary state , while the hieroglyphs were doubtless coined by my fancy from descriptions in old legends , and afterward woven into my dreams .
I tried to verify certain points through conversation with known cult leaders , but never succeeded in establishing the right connexions .
At times the parallelism of so many cases in so many distant ages continued to worry me as it had at first , but on the other hand I reflected that the excitant folklore was undoubtedly more universal in the past than in the present .
Probably all the other victims whose cases were like mine had had a long and familiar knowledge of the tales I had learned only when in my secondary state .
When these victims had lost their memory , they had associated themselves with the creatures of their household myths — the fabulous invaders supposed to displace men's minds — and had thus embarked upon quests for knowledge which they thought they could take back to a fancied , non -human past .
Then , when their memory returned , they reversed the associative process and thought of themselves as the former captive minds instead of as the displacers .
Hence the dreams and pseudo - memories following the conventional myth pattern .
Despite the seeming cumbrousness of these explanations , they came finally to supersede all others in my mind — largely because of the greater weakness of any rival theory .
And a substantial number of eminent psychologists and anthropologists gradually agreed with me .
The more I reflected , the more convincing did my reasoning seem ; till in the end I had a really effective bulwark against the visions and impressions which still assailed me .
Suppose I did see strange things at night ?
These were only what I had heard and read of .
Suppose I did have odd loathings and perspectives and pseudo - memories ?
These , too , were only echoes of myths absorbed in my secondary state .
Nothing that I might dream , nothing that I might feel , could be of any actual significance .
Fortified by this philosophy , I greatly improved in nervous equilibrium , even though the visions — rather than the abstract impressions — steadily became more frequent and more disturbingly detailed .
In 1922 I felt able to undertake regular work again , and put my newly gained knowledge to practical use by accepting an instructorship in psychology at the university .
My old chair of political economy had long been adequately filled — besides which , methods of teaching economics had changed greatly since my heyday .
My son was at this time just entering on the post - graduate studies leading to his present professorship , and we worked together a great deal .
Chapter 4 [ edit ]
I CONTINUED , however , to keep a careful record of the outré dreams which crowded upon me so thickly and vividly .
Such a record , I argued , was of genuine value as a psychological document .
The glimpses still seemed damnably like memories , though I fought off this impression with a goodly measure of success .
In writing , I treated the phantasmata as things seen ; but at all other times I brushed them aside like any gossamer illusions of the night .
I had never mentioned such matters in common conversation ; though reports of them , filtering out as such things will , had aroused sundry rumors regarding my mental health .
It is amusing to reflect that these rumors were confined wholly to laymen , without a single champion among physicians or psychologists .
Of my visions after 1914 I will here mention only a few , since fuller accounts and records are at the disposal of the serious student .
It is evident that with time the curious inhibitions somewhat waned , for the scope of my visions vastly increased .
They have never , though , become other than disjointed fragments seemingly without clear motivation .
Within the dreams I seemed gradually to acquire a greater and greater freedom of wandering .
I floated through many strange buildings of stone , going from one to the other along mammoth underground passages which seemed to form the common avenues of transit .
Sometimes I encountered those gigantic sealed trap - doors in the lowest level , around which such an aura of fear and forbiddenness clung .
I saw tremendously tessellated pools , and rooms of curious and inexplicable utensils of myriad sorts .
Then there were colossal caverns of intricate machinery whose outlines and purpose were wholly strange to me , and whose sound manifested itself only after many years of dreaming .
I may here remark that sight and sound are the only senses I have ever exercised in the visionary world .
The real horror began in May , 1915 , when I first saw the living things .
This was before my studies had taught me what , in view of the myths and case histories , to expect .
As mental barriers wore down , I beheld great masses of thin vapour in various parts of the building and in the streets below .
These steadily grew more solid and distinct , till at last I could trace their monstrous outlines with uncomfortable ease .
They seemed to be enormous , iridescent cones , about ten feet high and ten feet wide at the base , and made up of some ridgy , scaly , semi-elastic matter .
From their apexes projected four flexible , cylindrical members , each a foot thick , and of a ridgy substance like that of the cones themselves .
These members were sometimes contracted almost to nothing , and sometimes extended to any distance up to about ten feet .
Terminating two of them were enormous claws or nippers .
At the end of a third were four red , trumpetlike appendages .
The fourth terminated in an irregular yellowish globe some two feet in diameter and having three great dark eyes ranged along its central circumference .
Surmounting this head were four slender grey stalks bearing flower - like appendages , whilst from its nether side dangled eight greenish antennae or tentacles .
The great base of the central cone was fringed with a rubbery , grey substance which moved the whole entity through expansion and contraction .
Their actions , though harmless , horrified me even more than their appearance — for it is not wholesome to watch monstrous objects doing what one had known only human beings to do .
These objects moved intelligently about the great rooms , getting books from the shelves and taking them to the great tables , or vice versa , and sometimes writing diligently with a peculiar rod gripped in the greenish head tentacles .
The huge nippers were used in carrying books and in conversation - speech consisting of a kind of clicking and scraping .
The objects had no clothing , but wore satchels or knapsacks suspended from the top of the conical trunk .
They commonly carried their head and its supporting member at the level of the cone top , although it was frequently raised or lowered .
The other three great members tended to rest downward at the sides of the cone , contracted to about five feet each when not in use .
From their rate of reading , writing , and operating their machines — those on the tables seemed somehow connected with thought — I concluded that their intelligence was enormously greater than man's .
Afterward I saw them everywhere ; swarming in all the great chambers and corridors , tending monstrous machines in vaulted crypts , and racing along the vast roads in gigantic , boat - shaped cars .
I ceased to be afraid of them , for they seemed to form supremely natural parts of their environment .
Individual differences amongst them began to be manifest , and a few appeared to be under some kind of restraint .
These latter , though shewing no physical variation , had a diversity of gestures and habits which marked them off not only from the majority , but very largely from one another .
They wrote a great deal in what seemed to my cloudy vision a vast variety of characters — never the typical curvilinear hieroglyphs of the majority .
A few , I fancied , used our own familiar alphabet .
Most of them worked much more slowly than the general mass of the entities .
All this time my own part in the dreams seemed to be that of a disembodied consciousness with a range of vision wider than the normal , floating freely about , yet confined to the ordinary avenues and speeds of travel .
Not until August , 1915 , did any suggestions of bodily existence begin to harass me .
I say harass , because the first phase was a purely abstract , though infinitely terrible , association of my previously noted body loathing with the scenes of my visions .
For a while my chief concern during dreams was to avoid looking down at myself , and I recall how grateful I was for the total absence of large mirrors in the strange rooms .
I was mightily troubled by the fact that I always saw the great tables — whose height could not be under ten feet — from a level not below that of their surfaces .
And then the morbid temptation to look down at myself became greater and greater , till one night I could not resist it .
At first my downward glance revealed nothing whatever .
A moment later I perceived that this was because my head lay at the end of a flexible neck of enormous length .
Retracting this neck and gazing down very sharply , I saw the scaly , rugose , iridescent bulk of a vast cone ten feet tall and ten feet wide at the base .
That was when I waked half of Arkham with my screaming as I plunged madly up from the abyss of sleep .
Only after weeks of hideous repetition did I grow half - reconciled to these visions of myself in monstrous form .
In the dreams I now moved bodily among the other unknown entities , reading terrible books from the endless shelves and writing for hours at the great tables with a stylus managed by the green tentacles that hung down from my head .
Snatches of what I read and wrote would linger in my memory .
There were horrible annals of other worlds and other universes , and of stirrings of formless life outside of all universes .
There were records of strange orders of beings which had peopled the world in forgotten pasts , and frightful chronicles of grotesque - bodied intelligences which would people it millions of years after the death of the last human being .
I learned of chapters in human history whose existence no scholar of today has ever suspected .
Most of these writings were in the language of the hieroglyphs ; which I studied in a queer way with the aid of droning machines , and which was evidently an agglutinative speech with root systems utterly unlike any found in human languages .
Other volumes were in other unknown tongues learned in the same queer way .
A very few were in languages I knew .
Extremely clever pictures , both inserted in the records and forming separate collections , aided me immensely .
And all the time I seemed to be setting down a history of my own age in English .
On waking , I could recall only minute and meaningless scraps of the unknown tongues which my dream - self had mastered , though whole phrases of the history stayed with me .
I learned — even before my waking self had studied the parallel cases or the old myths from which the dreams doubtless sprang — that the entities around me were of the world 's greatest race , which had conquered time and had sent exploring minds into every age .
I knew , too , that I had been snatched from my age while another used my body in that age , and that a few of the other strange forms housed similarly captured minds .
I seemed to talk , in some odd language of claw clickings , with exiled intellects from every corner of the solar system .
There was a mind from the planet we know as Venus , which would live incalculable epochs to come , and one from an outer moon of Jupiter six million years in the past .
Of earthly minds there were some from the winged , star - headed , half - vegetable race of palaeogean Antarctica ; one from the reptile people of fabled Valusia ; three from the furry pre-human Hyperborean worshippers of Tsathoggua ; one from the wholly abominable Tcho - Tchos ; two from the arachnid denizens of earth 's last age ; five from the hardy coleopterous species immediately following mankind , to which the Great Race was some day to transfer its keenest minds en masse in the face of horrible peril ; and several from different branches of humanity .
I talked with the mind of Yiang - Li , a philosopher from the cruel empire of Tsan - Chan , which is to come in 5,000 A.D. ; with that of a general of the greatheaded brown people who held South Africa in 50,000 B.C. ; with that of a twelfth - century Florentine monk named Bartolomeo Corsi ; with that of a king of Lomar who had ruled that terrible polar land one hundred thousand years before the squat , yellow Inutos came from the west to engulf it .
I talked with the mind of Nug - Soth , a magician of the dark conquerors of 16,000 A.D. ; with that of a Roman named Titus Sempronius Blaesus , who had been a quaestor in Sulla 's time ; with that of Khephnes , an Egyptian of the 14th Dynasty , who told me the hideous secret of Nyarlathotep ; with that of a priest of Atlantis ' middle kingdom ; with that of a Suffolk gentleman of Cromwell 's day , James Woodville ; with that of a court astronomer of pre-Inca Peru ; with that of the Australian physicist Nevil Kingston - Brown , who will die in 2,518 A.D. ; with that of an archimage of vanished Yhe in the Pacific ; with that of Theodotides , a Greco - Bactrian official of 200 B.C. ; with that of an aged Frenchman of Louis XIII 's time named Pierre - Louis Montagny ; with that of Crom - Ya , a Cimmerian chieftain of 15,000 B.C. ; and with so many others that my brain cannot hold the shocking secrets and dizzying marvels I learned from them .
I awaked each morning in a fever , sometimes frantically trying to verify or discredit such information as fell within the range of modern human knowledge .
Traditional facts took on new and doubtful aspects , and I marvelled at the dream - fancy which could invent such surprising addenda to history and science .
I shivered at the mysteries the past may conceal , and trembled at the menaces the future may bring forth .
What was hinted in the speech of post - human entities of the fate of mankind produced such an effect on me that I will not set it down here .
After man there would be the mighty beetle civilisation , the bodies of whose members the cream of the Great Race would seize when the monstrous doom overtook the elder world .
Later , as the earth 's span closed , the transferred minds would again migrate through time and space — to another stopping - place in the bodies of the bulbous vegetable entities of Mercury .
But there would be races after them , clinging pathetically to the cold planet and burrowing to its horror - filled core , before the utter end .
Meanwhile , in my dreams , I wrote endlessly in that history of my own age which I was preparing — half voluntarily and half through promises of increased library and travel opportunities — for the Great Race 's central archives .
The archives were in a colossal subterranean structure near the city 's center , which I came to know well through frequent labors and consultations .
Meant to last as long as the race , and to withstand the fiercest of earth 's convulsions , this titan repository surpassed all other buildings in the massive , mountain - like firmness of its construction .
The records , written or printed on great sheets of a curiously tenacious cellulose fabric were bound into books that opened from the top , and were kept in individual cases of a strange , extremely light , rustless metal of greyish hue , decorated with mathematical designs and bearing the title in the Great Race 's curvilinear hieroglyphs .
These cases were stored in tiers of rectangular vaults — like closed , locked shelves — wrought of the same rustless metal and fastened by knobs with intricate turnings .
My own history was assigned a specific place in the vaults of the lowest or vertebrate level — the section devoted to the culture of mankind and of the furry and reptilian races immediately preceding it in terrestrial dominance .
But none of the dreams ever gave me a full picture of daily life .
All were the merest misty , disconnected fragments , and it is certain that these fragments were not unfolded in their rightful sequence .
I have , for example , a very imperfect idea of my own living arrangements in the dream - world ; though I seem to have possessed a great stone room of my own .
My restrictions as a prisoner gradually disappeared , so that some of the visions included vivid travels over the mighty jungle roads , sojourns in strange cities , and explorations of some of the vast , dark , windowless ruins from which the Great Race shrank in curious fear .
There were also long sea voyages in enormous , many - decked boats of incredible swiftness , and trips over wild regions in closed projectile - like airships lifted and moved by electrical repulsion .
Beyond the wide , warm ocean were other cities of the Great Race , and on one far continent I saw the crude villages of the black - snouted , winged creatures who would evolve as a dominant stock after the Great Race had sent its foremost minds into the future to escape the creeping horror .
Flatness and exuberant green life were always the keynote of the scene .
Hills were low and sparse , and usually displayed signs of volcanic forces .
Of the animals I saw , I could write volumes .
All were wild ; for the Great Race 's mechanised culture had long since done away with domestic beasts , while food was wholly vegetable or synthetic .
Clumsy reptiles of great bulk floundered in steaming morasses , fluttered in the heavy air , or spouted in the seas and lakes ; and among these I fancied I could vaguely recognise lesser , archaic prototypes of many forms — dinosaurs , pterodactyls , ichthyosaurs , labyrinthodonts , plesiosaurs , and the like - made familiar through palaeontology .
Of birds or mammals there were none that I could discover .
The ground and swamps were constantly alive with snakes , lizards , and crocodiles while insects buzzed incessantly among the lush vegetation .
And far out at sea , unspied and unknown monsters spouted mountainous columns of foam into the vaporous sky .
Once I was taken under the ocean in a gigantic submarine vessel with searchlights , and glimpsed some living horrors of awesome magnitude .
I saw also the ruins of incredible sunken cities , and the wealth of crinoid , brachiopod , coral , and ichthyic life which everywhere abounded .
Of the physiology , psychology , folkways , and detailed history of the Great Race my visions preserved but little information , and many of the scattered points I here set down were gleaned from my study of old legends and other cases rather than from my own dreaming .
For in time , of course , my reading and research caught up with and passed the dreams in many phases , so that certain dream - fragments were explained in advance and formed verifications of what I had learned .
This consolingly established my belief that similar reading and research , accomplished by my secondary self , had formed the source of the whole terrible fabric of pseudomemories .
The period of my dreams , apparently , was one somewhat less than 150,000,000 years ago , when the Palaeozoic age was giving place to the Mesozoic .
The bodies occupied by the Great Race represented no surviving — or even scientifically known — line of terrestrial evolution , but were of a peculiar , closely homogeneous , and highly specialised organic type inclining as much as to the vegetable as to the animal state .
Cell action was of an unique sort almost precluding fatigue , and wholly eliminating the need of sleep .
Nourishment , assimilated through the red trumpet - like appendages on one of the great flexible limbs , was always semi- fluid and in many aspects wholly unlike the food of existing animals .
The beings had but two of the senses which we recognise — sight and hearing , the latter accomplished through the flower - like appendages on the grey stalks above their heads .
Of other and incomprehensible senses — not , however , well utilizable by alien captive minds inhabiting their bodies — they possessed many .
Their three eyes were so situated as to give them a range of vision wider than the normal .
Their blood was a sort of deep - greenish ichor of great thickness .
They had no sex , but reproduced through seeds or spores which clustered on their bases and could be developed only under water .
Great , shallow tanks were used for the growth of their young — which were , however , reared only in small numbers on account of the longevity of individuals — four or five thousand years being the common life span .
Markedly defective individuals were quickly disposed of as soon as their defects were noticed .
Disease and the approach of death were , in the absence of a sense of touch or of physical pain , recognised by purely visual symptoms .
The dead were incinerated with dignified ceremonies .
Once in a while , as before mentioned , a keen mind would escape death by forward projection in time ; but such cases were not numerous .
When one did occur , the exiled mind from the future was treated with the utmost kindness till the dissolution of its unfamiliar tenement .
The Great Race seemed to form a single , loosely knit nation or league , with major institutions in common , though there were four definite divisions .
The political and economic system of each unit was a sort of fascistic socialism , with major resources rationally distributed , and power delegated to a small governing board elected by the votes of all able to pass certain educational and psychological tests .
Family organisation was not overstressed , though ties among persons of common descent were recognised , and the young were generally reared by their parents .
Resemblances to human attitudes and institutions were , of course , most marked in those fields where on the one hand highly abstract elements were concerned , or where on the other hand there was a dominance of the basic , unspecialised urges common to all organic life .
A few added likenesses came through conscious adoption as the Great Race probed the future and copied what it liked .
Industry , highly mechanised , demanded but little time from each citizen ; and the abundant leisure was filled with intellectual and aesthetic activities of various sorts .
The sciences were carried to an unbelievable height of development , and art was a vital part of life , though at the period of my dreams it had passed its crest and meridian .
Technology was enormously stimulated through the constant struggle to survive , and to keep in existence the physical fabric of great cities , imposed by the prodigious geologic upheavals of those primal days .
Crime was surprisingly scant , and was dealt with through highly efficient policing .
Punishments ranged from privilege deprivation and imprisonment to death or major emotion wrenching , and were never administered without a careful study of the criminal 's motivations .
Warfare , largely civil for the last few millennia though sometimes waged against reptilian or octopodic invaders , or against the winged , star - headed Old Ones who centered in the antarctic , was infrequent though infinitely devastating .
An enormous army , using camera - like weapons which produced tremendous electrical effects , was kept on hand for purposes seldom mentioned , but obviously connected with the ceaseless fear of the dark , windowless elder ruins and of the great sealed trap - doors in the lowest subterranean levels .
This fear of the basalt ruins and trap - doors was largely a matter of unspoken suggestion — or , at most , of furtive quasi - whispers .
Everything specific which bore on it was significantly absent from such books as were on the common shelves .
It was the one subject lying altogether under a taboo among the Great Race , and seemed to be connected alike with horrible bygone struggles , and with that future peril which would some day force the race to send its keener minds ahead en masse in time .
Imperfect and fragmentary as were the other things presented by dreams and legends , this matter was still more bafflingly shrouded .
The vague old myths avoided it — or perhaps all allusions had for some reason been excised .
And in the dreams of myself and others , the hints were peculiarly few .
Members of the Great Race never intentionally referred to the matter , and what could be gleaned came only from some of the more sharply observant captive minds .
According to these scraps of information , the basis of the fear was a horrible elder race of half - polypous , utterly alien entities which had come through space from immeasurably distant universes and had dominated the earth and three other solar planets about 600 million years ago .
They were only partly material — as we understand matter — and their type of consciousness and media of perception differed widely from those of terrestrial organisms .
For example , their senses did not include that of sight ; their mental world being a strange , non-visual pattern of impressions .
They were , however , sufficiently material to use implements of normal matter when in cosmic areas containing it ; and they required housing — albeit of a peculiar kind .
Though their senses could penetrate all material barriers , their substance could not ; and certain forms of electrical energy could wholly destroy them .
They had the power of aërial motion , despite the absence of wings or any other visible means of levitation .
Their minds were of such texture that no exchange with them could be effected by the Great Race .
When these things had come to the earth they had built mighty basalt cities of windowless towers , and had preyed horribly upon the beings they found .
Thus it was when the minds of the Great Race sped across the void from that obscure , trans - galactic world known in the disturbing and debatable Eltdown Shards as Yith .
The newcomers , with the instruments they created , had found it easy to subdue the predatory entities and drive them down to those caverns of inner earth which they had already joined to their abodes and begun to inhabit .
Then they had sealed the entrances and left them to their fate , afterward occupying most of their great cities and preserving certain important buildings for reasons connected more with superstition than with indifference , boldness , or scientific and historical zeal .
But as the aeons passed there came vague , evil signs that the elder things were growing strong and numerous in the inner world .
There were sporadic irruptions of a particularly hideous character in certain small and remote cities of the Great Race , and in some of the deserted elder cities which the Great Race had not peopled — places where the paths to the gulfs below had not been properly sealed or guarded .
After that greater precautions were taken , and many of the paths were closed forever — though a few were left with sealed trap - doors for strategic use in fighting the elder things if ever they broke forth in unexpected places .
The irruptions of the elder things must have been shocking beyond all description , since they had permanently coloured the psychology of the Great Race .
Such was the fixed mood of horror that the very aspect of the creatures was left unmentioned .
At no time was I able to gain a clear hint of what they looked like .
There were veiled suggestions of a monstrous plasticity , and of temporary lapses of visibility , while other fragmentary whispers referred to their control and military use of great winds .
Singular whistling noises , and colossal footprints made up of five circular toe marks , seemed also to be associated with them .
It was evident that the coming doom so desperately feared by the Great Race — the doom that was one day to send millions of keen minds across the chasm of time to strange bodies in the safer future — had to do with a final successful irruption of the elder beings .
Mental projections down the ages had clearly foretold such a horror , and the Great Race had resolved that none who could escape should face it .
That the foray would be a matter of vengeance , rather than an attempt to reoccupy the outer world , they knew from the planet 's later history — for their projections shewed the coming and going of subsequent races untroubled by the monstrous entities .
Perhaps these entities had come to prefer earth 's inner abysses to the variable , storm - ravaged surface , since light meant nothing to them .
Perhaps , too , they were slowly weakening with the aeons .
Indeed , it was known that they would be quite dead in the time of the post - human beetle race which the fleeing minds would tenant .
Meanwhile , the Great Race maintained its cautious vigilance , with potent weapons ceaselessly ready despite the horrified banishing of the subject from common speech and visible records .
And always the shadow of nameless fear hung about the sealed trap - doors and the dark , windowless elder towers .

THAT is the world of which my dreams brought me dim , scattered echoes every night .
I cannot hope to give any true idea of the horror and dread contained in such echoes , for it was upon a wholly intangible quality — the sharp sense of pseudo - memory — that such feelings mainly depended .
As I have said , my studies gradually gave me a defence against these feelings in the form of rational psychological explanations ; and this saving influence was augmented by the subtle touch of accustomedness which comes with the passage of time .
Yet in spite of everything the vague , creeping terror would return momentarily now and then .
It did not , however , engulf me as it had before ; and after 1922 I lived a very normal life of work and recreation .
In the course of years I began to feel that my experience — together with the kindred cases and the related folklore — ought to be definitely summarised and published for the benefit of serious students ; hence I prepared a series of articles briefly covering the whole ground and illustrated with crude sketches of some of the shapes , scenes , decorative motifs , and hieroglyphs remembered from the dreams .
These appeared at various times during 1928 and 1929 in the Journal of the American Psychological Society , but did not attract much attention .
Meanwhile I continued to record my dreams with the minutest care , even though the growing stack of reports attained troublesomely vast proportions .
On July 10 , 1934 , there was forwarded to me by the Psychological Society the letter which opened the culminating and most horrible phase of the whole mad ordeal .
It was postmarked Pilbarra , Western Australia , and bore the signature of one whom I found , upon inquiry , to be a mining engineer of considerable prominence .
Enclosed were some very curious snapshots .
I will reproduce the text in its entirety , and no reader can fail to understand how tremendous an effect it and the photographs had upon me .
I was , for a time , almost stunned and incredulous ; for although I had often thought that some basis of fact must underlie certain phases of the legends which had coloured my dreams , I was none the less unprepared for anything like a tangible survival from a lost world remote beyond all imagination .
Most devastating of all were the photographs — for here , in cold , incontrovertible realism , there stood out against a background of sand certain worn - down , water - ridged , storm - weathered blocks of stone whose slightly convex tops and slightly concave bottoms told their own story .
And when I studied them with a magnifying glass I could see all too plainly , amidst the batterings and pittings , the traces of those vast curvilinear designs and occasional hieroglyphs whose significance had become so hideous to me .
But here is the letter , which speaks for itself .
49 , Dampier St. ,
Pilbarra , W. Australia ,
May 18 , 1934 .
Prof. N. W Peaslee ,
c /o Am. Psychological Society ,
30 E. 41st St. ,
New York City , U.S.A. My Dear Sir :—
A recent conversation with Dr. E. M. Boyle of Perth , and some papers with your articles which he has just sent me , make it advisable for me to tell you about certain things I have seen in the Great Sandy Desert east of our gold field here .
It would seem , in view of the peculiar legends about old cities with huge stonework and strange designs and hieroglyphs which you describe , that I have come upon something very important .
The blackfellows have always been full of talk about " great stones with marks on them , " and seem to have a terrible fear of such things .
They connect them in some way with their common racial legends about Buddai , the gigantic old man who lies asleep for ages underground with his head on his arm , and who will some day awake and eat up the world .
There are some very old and half - forgotten tales of enormous underground huts of great stones , where passages lead down and down , and where horrible things have happened .
The blackfellows claim that once some warriors , fleeing in battle , went down into one and never came back , but that frightful winds began to blow from the place soon after they went down .
However , there usually is n't much in what these natives say .
But what I have to tell is more than this .
Two years ago , when I was prospecting about 500 miles east in the desert , I came on a lot of queer pieces of dressed stone perhaps 3 × 2 × 2 feet in size , and weathered and pitted to the very limit .
At first I could n't find any of the marks the blackfellows told about , but when I looked close enough I could make out some deeply carved lines in spite of the weathering .
There were peculiar curves , just like what the blackfellows had tried to describe .
I imagine there must have been thirty or forty blocks , some nearly buried in the sand , and all within a circle perhaps a quarter of a mile in diameter .
When I saw some , I looked around closely for more , and made a careful reckoning of the place with my instruments .
I also took pictures of ten or twelve of the most typical blocks , and will enclose the prints for you to see .
I turned my information and pictures over to the government at Perth , but they have done nothing about them .
Then I met Dr. Boyle , who had read your articles in the Journal of the American Psychological Society , and , in time , happened to mention the stones .
He was enormously interested , and became quite excited when I shewed him my snapshots , saying that the stones and the markings were just like those of the masonry you had dreamed about and seen described in legends .
He meant to write you , but was delayed .
Meanwhile , he sent me most of the magazines with your articles , and I saw at once , from your drawings and descriptions , that my stones are certainly the kind you mean .
You can appreciate this from the enclosed prints .
Later on you will hear directly from Dr. Boyle .
Now I can understand how important all this will be to you .
Without question we are faced with the remains of an unknown civilization older than any dreamed of before , and forming a basis for your legends .
As a mining engineer , I have some knowledge of geology , and can tell you that these blocks are so ancient they frighten me .
They are mostly sandstone and granite , though one is almost certainly made of a queer sort of cement or concrete .
They bear evidence of water action , as if this part of the world had been submerged and come up again after long ages — all since those blocks were made and used .
It is a matter of hundreds of thousands of years — or heaven knows how much more .
I do n't like to think about it .
In view of your previous diligent work in tracking down the legends and everything connected with them , I cannot doubt but that you will want to lead an expedition to the desert and make some archaeological excavations .
Both Dr. Boyle and I are prepared to cooperate in such work if you — or organizations known to you — can furnish the funds .
I can get together a dozen miners for the heavy digging — the blackfellows would be of no use , for I 've found that they have an almost maniacal fear of this particular spot .
Boyle and I are saying nothing to others , for you very obviously ought to have precedence in any discoveries or credit .
The place can be reached from Pilbarra in about four days by motor tractor — which we 'd need for our apparatus .
It is somewhat west and south of Warburton 's path of 1873 , and 100 miles southeast of Joanna Spring .
We could float things up the De Grey River instead of starting from Pilbarra — but all that can be talked over later .
Roughly the stones lie at a point about 22° 3 ' 14 " South Latitude , 125° 0 ' 39 " East Longitude .
The climate is tropical , and the desert conditions are trying .
I shall welcome further correspondence upon this subject , and am keenly eager to assist in any plan you may devise .
After studying your articles I am deeply impressed with the profound significance of the whole matter .
Dr. Boyle will write later .
When rapid communication is needed , a cable to Perth can be relayed by wireless .
Hoping profoundly for an early message , Believe me , Most faithfully yours , Robert B. F. Mackenzie
Of the immediate aftermath of this letter , much can be learned from the press .
My good fortune in securing the backing of Miskatonic University was great , and both Mr. Mackenzie and Dr. Boyle proved invaluable in arranging matters at the Australian end .
We were not too specific with the public about our objects , since the whole matter would have lent itself unpleasantly to sensational and jocose treatment by the cheaper newspapers .
As a result , printed reports were sparing ; but enough appeared to tell of our quest for reported Australian ruins and to chronicle our various preparatory steps .
Professor William Dyer of the college 's geology department — leader of the Miskatonic Antarctic Expedition Of 1930 - 31 — Ferdinand C. Ashley of the department of ancient history , and Tyler M. Freeborn of the department of anthropology — together with my son Wingate — accompanied me .
My correspondent , Mackenzie , came to Arkham early in 1935 and assisted in our final preparations .
He proved to be a tremendously competent and affable man of about fifty , admirably well - read , and deeply familiar with all the conditions of Australian travel .
He had tractors waiting at Pilbarra , and we chartered a tramp steamer sufficiently small to get up the river to that point .
We were prepared to excavate in the most careful and scientific fashion , sifting every particle of sand , and disturbing nothing which might seem to be in or near its original situation .
Sailing from Boston aboard the wheezy Lexington on March 28 , 1935 , we had a leisurely trip across the Atlantic and Mediterranean , through the Suez Canal , down the Red Sea , and across the Indian Ocean to our goal .
I need not tell how the sight of the low , sandy West Australian coast depressed me , and how I detested the crude mining town and dreary gold fields where the tractors were given their last loads .
Dr. Boyle , who met us , proved to be elderly , pleasant , and intelligent — and his knowledge of psychology led him into many long discussions with my son and me .
Discomfort and expectancy were oddly mingled in most of us when at length our party of eighteen rattled forth over the arid leagues of sand and rock .
On Friday , May 31st , we forded a branch of the De Grey and entered the realm of utter desolation .
A certain positive terror grew on me as we advanced to this actual site of the elder world behind the legends — a terror , of course , abetted by the fact that my disturbing dreams and pseudo - memories still beset me with unabated force .
It was on Monday , June 3rd , that we saw the first of the half - buried blocks .
I cannot describe the emotions with which I actually touched — in objective reality — a fragment of Cyclopean masonry in every respect like the blocks in the walls of my dream - buildings .
There was a distinct trace of carving — and my hands trembled as I recognised part of a curvilinear decorative scheme made hellish to me through years of tormenting nightmare and baffling research .
A month of digging brought a total of some 1250 blocks in varying stages of wear and disintegration .
Most of these were carven megaliths with curved tops and bottoms .
A minority were smaller , flatter , plain - surfaced , and square or octagonally cut - like those of the floors and pavements in my dreams — while a few were singularly massive and curved or slanted in such a manner as to suggest use in vaulting or groining , or as parts of arches or round window casings .
The deeper — and the farther north and east — we dug , the more blocks we found ; though we still failed to discover any trace of arrangement among them .
Professor Dyer was appalled at the measureless age of the fragments , and Freeborn found traces of symbols which fitted darkly into certain Papuan and Polynesian legends of infinite antiquity .
The condition and scattering of the blocks told mutely of vertiginous cycles of time and geologic upheavals of cosmic savagery .
We had an aëroplane with us , and my son Wingate would often go up to different heights and scan the sand - and - rock waste for signs of dim , large - scale outlines — either differences of level or trails of scattered blocks .
His results were virtually negative ; for whenever he would one day think he had glimpsed some significant trend , he would on his next trip find the impression replaced by another equally insubstantial — a result of the shifting , wind - blown sand .
One or two of these ephemeral suggestions , though , affected me queerly and disagreeably .
They seemed , after a fashion , to dovetail horribly with something I had dreamed or read , but which I could no longer remember .
There was a terrible familiarity about them — which somehow made me look furtively and apprehensively over the abominable , sterile terrain toward the north and northeast .
Around the first week in July I developed an unaccountable set of mixed emotions about that general northeasterly region .
There was horror , and there was curiosity — but more than that , there was a persistent and perplexing illusion of memory .
I tried all sorts of psychological expedients to get these notions out of my head , but met with no success .
Sleeplessness also gained upon me , but I almost welcomed this because of the resultant shortening of my dream - periods .
I acquired the habit of taking long , lone walks in the desert late at night — usually to the north or northeast , whither the sum of my strange new impulses seemed subtly to pull me .
Sometimes , on these walks , I would stumble over nearly buried fragments of the ancient masonry .
Though there were fewer visible blocks here than where we had started , I felt sure that there must be a vast abundance beneath the surface .
The ground was less level than at our camp , and the prevailing high winds now and then piled the sand into fantastic temporary hillocks — exposing low traces of the elder stones while it covered other traces .
I was queerly anxious to have the excavations extend to this territory , yet at the same time dreaded what might be revealed .
Obviously , I was getting into a rather bad state — all the worse because I could not account for it .
An indication of my poor nervous health can be gained from my response to an odd discovery which I made on one of my nocturnal rambles .
It was on the evening of July 11th , when the moon flooded the mysterious hillocks with a curious pallor .
Wandering somewhat beyond my usual limits , I came upon a great stone which seemed to differ markedly from any we had yet encountered .
It was almost wholly covered , but I stooped and cleared away the sand with my hands , later studying the object carefully and supplementing the moonlight with my electric torch .
Unlike the other very large rocks , this one was perfectly square - cut , with no convex or concave surface .
It seemed , too , to be of a dark basaltic substance , wholly dissimilar to the granite and sandstone and occasional concrete of the now familiar fragments .
Suddenly I rose , turned , and ran for the camp at top speed .
It was a wholly unconscious and irrational flight , and only when I was close to my tent did I fully realise why I had run .
Then it came to me .
The queer dark stone was something which I had dreamed and read about , and which was linked with the uttermost horrors of the aeon - old legendry .
It was one of the blocks of that basaltic elder masonry which the fabled Great Race held in such fear — the tall , windowless ruins left by those brooding , half - material , alien things that festered in earth 's nether abysses and against whose wind - like , invisible forces the trap - doors were sealed and the sleepless sentinels posted .
I remained awake all night , but by dawn realised how silly I had been to let the shadow of a myth upset me .
Instead of being frightened , I should have had a discoverer 's enthusiasm .
The next forenoon I told the others about my find , and Dyer , Freeborn , Boyle , my son , and I set out to view the anomalous block .
Failure , however , confronted us .
I had formed no clear idea of the stone 's location , and a late wind had wholly altered the hillocks of shifting sand .
Chapter 6 [ edit ]
I COME now to the crucial and most difficult part of my narrative — all the more difficult because I can not be quite certain of its reality .
At times I feel uncomfortably sure that I was not dreaming or deluded ; and it is this feeling in view of the stupendous implications which the objective truth of my experience would raise — which impels me to make this record .
My son — a trained psychologist with the fullest and most sympathetic knowledge of my whole case — shall be the primary judge of what I have to tell .
First let me outline the externals of the matter , as those at the camp know them .
On the night of July 17 - 18 , after a windy day , I retired early but could not sleep .
Rising shortly before eleven , and afflicted as usual with that strange feeling regarding the northeastward terrain , I set out on one of my typical nocturnal walks ; seeing and greeting only one person — an Australian miner named Tupper — as I left our precincts .
The moon , slightly past full , shone from a clear sky , and drenched the ancient sands with a white , leprous radiance which seemed to me somehow infinitely evil .
There was no longer any wind , nor did any return for nearly five hours , as amply attested by Tupper and others who saw me walking rapidly across the pallid , secret - guarding hillocks toward the northeast .
About 3:30 a.m. a violent wind blew up , waking everyone in camp and felling three of the tents .
The sky was unclouded , and the desert still blazed with that leprous moonlight .
As the party saw to the tents my absence was noted , but in view of my previous walks this circumstance gave no one alarm .
And yet , as many as three men— all Australians — seemed to feel something sinister in the air .
Mackenzie explained to Professor Freeborn that this was a fear picked up from blackfellow folklore — the natives having woven a curious fabric of malignant myth about the high winds which at long intervals sweep across the sands under a clear sky .
Such winds , it is whispered , blow out of the great stone huts under the ground , where terrible things have happened — and are never felt except near places where the big marked stones are scattered .
Close to four the gale subsided as suddenly as it had begun , leaving the sand hills in new and unfamiliar shapes .
It was just past five , with the bloated , fungoid moon sinking in the west , when I staggered into camp — hatless , tattered , features scratched and ensanguined , and without my electric torch .
Most of the men had returned to bed , but Professor Dyer was smoking a pipe in front of his tent .
Seeing my winded and almost frenzied state , he called Dr. Boyle , and the two of them got me on my cot and made me comfortable .
My son , roused by the stir , soon joined them , and they all tried to force me to lie still and attempt sleep .
But there was no sleep for me .
My psychological state was very extraordinary — different from anything I had previously suffered .
After a time I insisted upon talking — nervously and elaborately explaining my condition .
I told them I had become fatigued , and had lain down in the sand for a nap .
There had , I said , been dreams even more frightful than usual — and when I was awaked by the sudden high wind my overwrought nerves had snapped .
I had fled in panic , frequently falling over half - buried stones and thus gaining my tattered and bedraggled aspect .
I must have slept long — hence the hours of my absence .
Of anything strange either seen or experienced I hinted absolutely nothing — exercising the greatest self - control in that respect .
But I spoke of a change of mind regarding the whole work of the expedition , and urged a halt in all digging toward the northeast .
My reasoning was patently weak — for I mentioned a dearth of blocks , a wish not to offend the superstitious miners , a possible shortage of funds from the college , and other things either untrue or irrelevant .
Naturally , no one paid the least attention to my new wishes — not even my son , whose concern for my health was obvious .
The next day I was up and around the camp , but took no part in the excavations .
Seeing that I could not stop the work , I decided to return home as soon as possible for the sake of my nerves , and made my son promise to fly me in the plane to Perth — a thousand miles to the southwest — as soon as he had surveyed the region I wished let alone .
If , I reflected , the thing I had seen was still visible , I might decide to attempt a specific warning even at the cost of ridicule .
It was just conceivable that the miners who knew the local folklore might back me up .
Humouring me , my son made the survey that very afternoon , flying over all the terrain my walk could possibly have covered .
Yet nothing of what I had found remained in sight .
It was the case of the anomalous basalt block all over again — the shifting sand had wiped out every trace .
For an instant I half regretted having lost a certain awesome object in my stark fright — but now I know that the loss was merciful .
I can still believe my whole experience an illusion — especially if , as I devoutly hope , that hellish abyss is never found .
Wingate took me to Perth on July 20th , though declining to abandon the expedition and return home .
He stayed with me until the 25th , when the steamer for Liverpool sailed .
Now , in the cabin of the Empress , I am pondering long and frantically upon the entire matter , and have decided that my son at least must be informed .
It shall rest with him whether to diffuse the matter more widely .
In order to meet any eventuality I have prepared this summary of my background — as already known in a scattered way to others — and will now tell as briefly as possible what seemed to happen during my absence from the camp that hideous night .
Nerves on edge , and whipped into a kind of perverse eagerness by that inexplicable , dread - mingled , mnemonic urge toward the northeast , I plodded on beneath the evil , burning moon .
Here and there I saw , half shrouded by sand , those primal Cyclopean blocks left from nameless and forgotten aeons .
The incalculable age and brooding horror of this monstrous waste began to oppress me as never before , and I could not keep from thinking of my maddening dreams , of the frightful legends which lay behind them , and of the present fears of natives and miners concerning the desert and its carven stones .
And yet I plodded on as if to some eldritch rendezvous — more and more assailed by bewildering fancies , compulsions , and pseudo - memories .
I thought of some of the possible contours of the lines of stones as seen by my son from the air , and wondered why they seemed at once so ominous and so familiar .
Something was fumbling and rattling at the latch of my recollection , while another unknown force sought to keep the portal barred .
The night was windless , and the pallid sand curved upward and downward like frozen waves of the sea .
I had no goal , but somehow ploughed along as if with fate - bound assurance .
My dreams welled up into the waking world , so that each
