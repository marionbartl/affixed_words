Mint issues advisory on Obama coins
Cable television viewers have been treated recently to a deluge of ads for a " Barack Obama Inaugural Dollar , " a " genuine " dollar produced by the " New England Mint . "
It can be yours for a mere $ 9.95 .
Now , the real U.S. Mint has issued an advisory about the coins , warning consumers that the coins are n't official government tender , but merely plastic coating on real dollar coins .
Says the Mint :
These advertisements feature genuine United States coins that the private commercial businesses have altered by affixing a colorized image to the coin .
Additionally , some businesses have treated the coins by gold - plating them .
These items are not official United States Mint products .
Furthermore , these products , businesses , and advertisements are not approved , endorsed , sponsored , or authorized by the United States Mint , the Department of the Treasury , or the United States Government .
The United States Mint does not encourage , endorse , or sponsor products that alter the fundamental images depicted on its coins .
The North American Earth Liberation Front Press Office has issued a statement against the proposed bailout for the ‘ big 3 ’ automakers .
In particular , the release voices their opposition to bailing out General Motors due to their resistance to improving fuel - efficiency .

“ General Motors deserves bankruptcy , ” said Jason Crawford , a press officer for the ELF .
“ Fully aware of America ’s dependence on foreign oil and the horrific environmental impact of the Hummer — an 8,500 - pound monstrosity that yields an average of 10 - mpg — GM continued producing gas - guzzling , polluting vehicles . ”
Crawford , who acts as an above - ground representative for the ELF , criticized GM for killing off their EV1 electric car in the ‘ 90s in order to promote the gas - guzzling Hummer H2 .
Meanwhile , foreign automakers like Toyota and Honda , which are in much better financial shape now , began working on more fuel - efficient vehicles like the Prius and Insight .
The ELF , a decentralized group ranked as the top ‘ domestic terrorist ’ threat by the FBI , is notorious for their arson attacks on car dealerships , housing developments , and other projects they deem to be intrusive or damaging to the environment .
In 2003 , they famously destroyed over 40 Hummers and other vehicles in California .
The press office estimates that while no one has ever been physically harmed , the ELF has caused of $ 150 million in damages since their first action in the United States in 1996 .
But Crawford said the tactics might not have been terribly effective .
“ Instead of targeting Hummer and SUV dealerships over the last few years , the ELF should have put General Motors out of business years ago with well - placed incendiary devices in Detroit , ” he said .

You ’d expect Republican Senator John Ensign to criticize Obama .
That ’s not news .
It is news when another GOPer slams Palin .
At this point in an election , the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , should n’t be trashing the top of his ticket .
But , that ’s what he did yesterday
Republican Sen. John Ensign says Sarah Palin is not experienced enough to be president and John McCain ’s presidential campaign “ completely mishandled ” her early days on the ticket .
The Nevada senator made the comments in a television interview in which he also criticized Democratic nominee Barack Obama ’s readiness for the job .
Ensign then strayed far from the GOP ’s standard description of its vice presidential pick ’s qualifications .
Now , Ensign is , of course , on the verge of overseeing huge losses in the Senate .
So , he ’s obviously trying to assign blame elsewhere .
Jed has video of Ensign .
Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt Marry ( Photos )
The Hills starsandquietly tied the knot at the One & Only Palmilla Resort outside of Cabo San Lucas over the weekend .
Montag confessed this little secret totoday .
People magazine contacted Heidi's father to ask him about the wedding and he knew nothing about it and said , " I would be upset if she got married and did n't invite me ! "
After finding out that the news was true he switched up his comment by saying , " Then we just have to have another wedding here . "
Maybe Heidi was hammered , in which case she will soon come to her senses .
Heidi appears to be just as hungry for media attention as her new hubby Spencer , who still seems to have a shady side despite the image he tries to portray .
Montag told Perez that after the two exchanged their vows she could n't stop crying .
It 's okay Heidi - everyone makes mistakes from time to time .

Jimmy Carter says closing Guantanamo Bay and ending torture would send a strong message .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
It has been heartening to witness the outpouring of worldwide enthusiasm over the election of Barack Obama as the next president of the United States , a transformational moment for our country .
Our incoming president has huge challenges ahead of him , and he will undoubtedly reach out to other world leaders to help address the most difficult problems .
A high priority will be the restoration of human rights , which have been badly eroded in recent years .
President - elect Obama has reiterated his decision to close Guantánamo Bay detention center and end U.S. - sponsored torture .
Also under discussion is the establishment by the U.S. government of an independent commission to examine the actions that led to these shameful policies and practices .
Together , these steps would signal a renewed commitment to the cause of universal human rights long championed by the United States .
As this year marks the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the reassertion of these fundamental rights is necessary .
While the U.S. government has much work to do in this regard , there will have to be a concerted international effort to achieve meaningful protection of human rights , even as the issue of security continues to demand our attention .
The American people and our courts have rejected the proposition that some people 's rights can be suspended arbitrarily ; to do so violates the very core of our democracy .
Hopefully , those working to establish democratic practices and institutions worldwide will seize upon this development and convince their own fellow citizens that democracy and human rights are worth the struggle .
The international community , including a newly energized United States , should move swiftly and decisively to support the local heroes who risk much to advance this cause .
Human rights defenders from throughout the world are participating in our annual conference at The Carter Center this week to share the challenges they face , and to decide how the international community can best support their efforts .
For years , these activists have told us that when the United States engaged in torture and indefinite detention , their decades of struggle for rights began to erode .
Dictators who had felt pressure from the United States to improve rights were suddenly off the hook .
With new leadership in Washington , a clear and principled message on the centrality of human rights can help set a new tone .
Too often , the international community has failed to respond to emerging crises , partly because voices of the oppressed are missing in policy discussions .
Had the international community heeded the warning of human rights defenders in the former Yugoslavia , Rwanda , Darfur , and the Democratic Republic of Congo , more robust and coordinated diplomacy and even limited intervention may have averted these crises .
Catastrophic conditions exist in Congo , Zimbabwe , Sudan , Myanmar , Afghanistan and elsewhere and will require unprecedented cooperation to resolve .
It is time to embrace the idea that when human beings are systematically abused , international peace and security are inherently threatened .
In such situations , the global community should spare no effort to help societies in distress .
Crises like these can be assuaged before they escalate if there is determined global leadership and cooperation .
Human rights defenders are on the frontlines of this battle , and we must protect them when they face danger because of their work .
We must do a better job of listening to their diagnoses of issues and be receptive to their proposed solutions .
And we must strengthen their voices and help to protect them in a collective , undeniable commitment to create the world of peace and freedom that many of us enjoy and we all desire .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jimmy Carter .

SYDNEY , Australia  Australian sailors have received an early Christmas gift with the announcement that all non-essential naval staff will be placed on two months ’ paid leave over the holidays .
Instead of swabbing the decks and polishing the brass , most of Australia ’s roughly 13,000 naval personnel will be allowed to enjoy the lazy days of their southern hemisphere summer break , which begins Dec. 3 .
The initiative , announced Tuesday by Defense Minister Joel Fitzgibbon , is part of reforms designed to make Australia ’s navy a more family - friendly employer .
Australia ’s defense forces , like many industries , have suffered from a shortage of skilled workers over the past 15 years as the local economy boomed .
Competition from the mining sector and a shift in workers ’ attitudes away from lifetime careers have made recruiters ’ jobs more difficult .
In the second of our series of dispatches from the ravaged country , Afghans explain how mounting civilian casualties are aiding Taliban recruiting
It was 7.30 on a hot July morning when the plane came swooping low over the remote ravine .
Below , a bridal party was making its way to the groom 's village in an area called Kamala , in the eastern province of Nangarhar , to prepare for the celebrations later that day .
The first bomb hit a large group of children who had run on ahead of the main procession .
It killed most of them instantly .
A few minutes later , the plane returned and dropped another bomb , right in the centre of the group .
This time the victims were almost all women .
Somehow the bride and two girls survived but as they scrambled down the hillside , desperately trying to get away from the plane , a third bomb caught them .
Hajj Khan was one of four elderly men escorting the bride 's party that day .
" We were walking , I was holding my grandson 's hand , then there was a loud noise and everything went white .
When I opened my eyes , everybody was screaming .
I was lying metres from where I had been , I was still holding my grandson's hand but the rest of him was gone .
I looked around and saw pieces of bodies everywhere .
I could n't make out which part was which . "
Relatives from the groom 's village said it was impossible to identify the remains .
They buried the 47 victims in 28 graves .
Stories like this are relatively common in today 's Afghanistan .
More than 600 civilians have died in Nato and US air strikes this year .
The number of innocents killed this way has almost doubled from last year , and tripled from the year before that .
These attacks are weakening support for the Afghan government and turning more and more people against the foreign occupation of the country .
" If things were going OK maybe we could accept the occasional mistake .
But with the economy the way it is , the worsening security situation , and the lack of development - when they kill civilians on top of everything else , it 's too much for people , " says Jahid Mohseni who runs Tolo TV , Afghanistan 's most popular television station , with his two brothers .
The US military initially denied any civilians had been killed in the Kamala bombing but later said they were investigating the incident .
When asked this week for an explanation of events on that morning in July , the US military in Afghanistan said they were unfamiliar with the specifics but would look into it .
The latest figures from the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission , taken a month ago , suggest about 750 civilians have been killed by foreign forces this year .
Most were killed in air strikes .
The remainder were shot by jumpy soldiers , who often open fire in crowded public places after an attack on one of their convoys .
Humanitarian aid agencies say privately that they believe the figure is significantly higher , as many victims classed as " insurgents " are actually non-combatants .
As the situation deteriorates across the country , the killing of civilians is seen as a final affront in a litany of mistakes by the foreign forces in Afghanistan .
Patience among ordinary Afghans has worn thin and anger grows with each attack .
In July this year hundreds of Afghans took to the street in Nangarhar province after the air strike on the wedding party .
The riots turned violent as protesters raged against the foreign occupiers and the government they support .
The army eventually had to be called in to quell the rioting .
Civilian casualties are not new to Nangarhar province - last year a convoy of US Marines hit by a bomb attack subsequently opened fire in a bazaar killing 16 people .
The marines involved were sent home and their officers charged , but a subsequent ruling cleared them of responsibility for the deaths .
Nato and US spokesmen say their forces go to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties .
But all too often after an air strike , they deny civilians are among the dead or claim far fewer were killed .
A recent Human Rights
Watch report said US investigations , when launched , have been " unilateral , ponderous , and lacking in transparency , undercutting rather than improving relations with local populations and the Afghan government " .
The routine denials and hands - off attitude are contributing to a growing sense among Afghans that their lives are cheap in the eyes of the foreigners .
" We know they do n't intend to kill the civilians but we do n't believe they care enough not to , " said Ahmad Zia , a jeweller in Kabul 's busy bazaar .
" If it continues we will see a lot more people joining the fight against the foreigners .
It 's inevitable . "
The accidental targeting of wedding parties in Afghanistan has only deepened resentment .
Last month 27 people were killed when a wedding party was bombed near Kandahar .
It was the third wedding party to be hit this year alone .
He says many of the incidents result when planes are brought in to protect forces coming under fire .
" Their troops are in trouble so they call in the air strikes without considering that it is a civilian area . "
Sharif Hassanyar , a former interpreter with US Special Forces who is now working as a journalist , described how decisions were taken to bomb areas based on flimsy intelligence .
" I remember when I was working with a group of Rangers and a spy in the area told them the Taliban were training in a garden of a house so they bombed the house , without checking the information .
Afterwards they found out that there had not been any Taliban there , only civilians were killed by the bombs , " he said .
Informants for the foreign forces often give bad information either accidentally or because they are pursuing tribal or personal vendettas against individuals in neighbouring villages , he added .
" The Taliban grow very strong in the aftermath of each attack , " said Hassanyar .
Mullah Zubiallah Akhond , a Taliban commander in Oruzgan province , says the attacks are sending recruits his way daily .
" The people who are fighting with the Taliban are the brothers , uncles and relatives of those killed by the Americans .
They have joined the Taliban and are fighting the Americans because they want to avenge their brothers , fathers or cousins , " he says .
" There are now Taliban in every village , many of them have rejoined the movement after the savage attacks carried out by the Americans . "
He believes the attacks have helped turn their fight against the foreigners into a nationwide popular struggle .
" When an American vehicle is blown up every day on the main road in Wardak , the order is not coming from the Taliban leadership .
It is the people themselves who have turned against the foreigners .
They have come together in their villages and do not allow the foreigners to pass through their areas . "
It is not just the deaths from air strikes that are poisoning the hearts of Afghans .
In the capital , Kabul , each day , terrified drivers swerve out of the way as foreign troops hurtle through the streets in their armoured convoys training their rifles on the drivers and pedestrians and shouting obscenities : " Stay the fuck back ! "
The Afghans know to keep out of the way .
Last year a US military convoy ploughed into several vehicles , killing seven people including a family .
The incident sparked a riot involving thousands of angry Kabul residents .
It was suppressed only after the security forces started shooting protesters on the streets .
At least 15 people were killed .
" The anti-American feelings in Afghanistan are not just coming from conservative or religious elements , " said Shukria Barakzai , a female MP .
" These feelings stem from the actions and military operations of the foreign troops .
The anti-western sentiment is directly because of the military actions , the civilian casualties , and the lack of respect by foreign troops for Afghan culture . "
Ghost Bikes are small and somber memorials for bicyclists who are killed or hit on the street .
A bicycle is painted all white and locked to a street sign near the crash site , accompanied by a small plaque .
They serve as reminders of the tragedy that took place on an otherwise anonymous street corner , and as quiet statements in support of cyclists ' right to safe travel .
The first ghost bikes were created in St. Louis , Missouri in 2003 .
Currently there are over 630 ghost bikes that have since appeared in over 210 locations throughout the world .
For those who create and install the memorials , the death of a fellow bicyclist hits home .
We all travel the same unsafe streets and face the same risks ; it could just as easily be any one of us .
Each time we say we hope to never have to do it again -- but we remain committed to making these memorials as long as they are needed .

Gaza .
Always the suffering of Gaza , most potent symbol of the tragedy of Palestine .
In 1948 , during the Nakba – or " The Catastrophe " as Palestinians describe the war that gave birth to the state of Israel – 200,000 refugees poured into Gaza , swelling its population by more than two - thirds .
Then Gaza fell under Egyptian control .
The six day war of 1967 saw more refugees , but with it came the occupation of Gaza by Israel – an occupation that , despite Israel 's declaration under Prime Minister Ariel Sharon that it would unilaterally withdraw its settlements and troops in 2005 , has never really ended .
It has not ended , for to be in Gaza is to be trapped .
Without future or hope , limited to a few square miles .
Its borders , land and sea , are defined largely by Israel ( with Egypt 's compliance along the southern end of the Strip ) .
It is not open to the ocean apart from a narrow outlet accessible only to the fishing fleet , a coastal blockade policed by Israel 's gunboats , the boundaries of which have only recently been tested by boats of protesters sailing from Cyprus to draw attention to conditions inside Gaza .
Once it was possible for Gazans to pass with relative ease in and out of the Strip to work in Israel .
In recent years , the noose around the 1.5 million people living there has been tightening incrementally , until a whole population – in the most densely settled urban area upon the planet – has been locked in behind walls and fences .
Since Israeli troops overran the Strip in 1967 , Israeli politicians and generals have always seen it as a problem – a hotbed of radicalism and opposition .
And so Israel has ventured failed experiment after experiment in the attempt to control Gaza .
It has tried everything except the obvious – to allow its people to be free .
It has tried directly managing Gaza , and a brutal policy of quarantine backed by tanks , jets and gunboats .
It has attempted the maintenance of strategic settlements , which only provided a focus for resistance against the patrolling troops .
And when that failed , Israel retreated – only to find that , without a proximate enemy , those living inside turned to attacking the nearby towns with crude missiles .
Ironically , one of Israel 's experiments involved assisting in the creation of Hamas , which had its roots in Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood , to counter the power of Yasser Arafat 's Palestine Liberation Organisation .
Israel has been determined to push Hamas ever closer to all - out war since insisting that even though it won free and fair Palestinian legislative elections in 2006 , its right to govern could not be treated as legitimate .
Since Hamas took power in Gaza in summer 2007 , after a short , brutal struggle with Fatah , Israel 's policy has been one of collective punishment , summed up in the policy of " no prosperity , no development , no humanitarian crisis " .
Not a visible humanitarian crisis , at least .
For what has been going on inside Gaza since the economic blockade began a year and a half ago has cynically stretched the definition of what constitutes the boundaries of such a crisis .
Those seeking urgent medical care outside Gaza 's walls are forced to go through a long and humiliating process .
Even some of those who are allowed to leave , human rights groups say , have been pressured into becoming informers for Israeli intelligence .
One in two Gazans is now living in poverty .
Aid is sporadic , and as the World Bank warned at the beginning of December , the blockade has forced Gaza to become reliant on smuggling tunnels ( taxed by Hamas ) , which risked destroying its conventional economy .
Inflation for key products smuggled through the tunnels is rampant , which in turn has brought cash to Hamas .
Equally worrying , from a long - term point of view , has been the corrosion of Gaza 's institutions and social cohesion , which has resulted in sporadic eruptions of inter-factional and inter-clan violence .
What Israel hopes to achieve with the present military offensive – beyond influencing the coming Israeli elections – is not clear .
For if a long - anticipated ground operation , leading to a partial reoccupation on the ground , is to follow these air strikes – as it did in the war in Lebanon in 2006 – it will have to achieve what neither Hamas nor its rival Fatah can : unifying Palestinian society once more against a common enemy , as Gaza was once united against Israeli settlements inside its boundaries .
If that is not the intention , it is hard to see what Israel 's actions are meant to achieve in a community that cherishes its martyrs ; where violent death is intended to reinforce social cohesion and unity .
For in the end what has happened in the past few hours is simply an expression of what has been going on for days and months and years : the death and fear that Gaza 's gunmen and rocket teams and bombers have inflicted upon Israel have been returned 10 , 20 , 30 times over once again .
And nothing will change in the arithmetic of it .
Not in Gaza .
But perhaps in a wider Arab world , becoming more uncomfortable by the day about what is happening inside Gaza , something is changing .
And Israel has supplied a rallying point .
Something tangible and brutal that gives the critics of its actions in Gaza – who say it has a policy of collective punishment backed by disproportionate and excessive force – something to focus on .
Something to be ranked with Deir Yassin .
With the Sabra and Shatila massacres .
Something , at last , that Israel 's foes can say looks like an atrocity .

The latest figures for the prevalence of diabetes are two years old and by common medical consent hopelessly out of date .
It is estimated that up to three million people die from the disease every year , and over a quarter of a billion people are affected .
Both figures are likely to be very short of the mark .
World Diabetes Day is on 14 November and all over the planet events are taking place to draw attention to the threat of what is described as an epidemic that is out of control .
Already it kills more people than HIV / Aids and the prognosis is grim .
Doctors do not understand why Indians have a high rate of diabetes India is the nation with most diabetics .
Officially there are 41 million Indians with the disease , but in Chennai , Tamil Nadu as many as 15 % of the population suffer .
Elsewhere in the vast country , doctors report diabetes rates of between 9 % and 14 % .
So , even taking the lower of the two marks , it is clear that India , with its population of 1.1 billion , has upwards of 100 million diabetics and that figure is growing every year .
Diabetes causes myriad medical complications : heart disease , blindness , loss of limbs and death .
Nagabushan has little sight left .
He can see light and dark and he can pick out a few shapes , but his vision has deteriorated very rapidly in the past couple of years , a victim of diabetes .
Nagabushan 's diabetes diagnosis came too late
He has come for his monthly check - up on the mobile eyecare truck which has pulled into his home town , Shimoga , for the day .
Shimoga is in the heart of rural India in the southern state of Karnataka .
What worries the health professionals is that type 2 diabetes , which is the variety that is spreading so fast , is on a seemingly unstoppable rise in villages and rural areas .
Type 2 diabetes is known as the " disease of affluence " ; it preys on people who , as they become better off , take less exercise and change their diet away from fresh vegetables and fruit .
Professor Ramachandran , a diabetes physician in Chennai says : " Of course people want to be better off .
They want to have an easier lifestyle .
" But what many of them do n't realise is that as they adjust their lives and become more sedentary and consume more junk food they are opening the door to diabetes . "
Nagabushan noticed that his eyesight was weakening , and he started experiencing a loss of sensation in his feet - both classic symptoms of diabetes , but he put these down to advancing years .
He had never heard of diabetes .
Eventually he did go to his doctor , who diagnosed the disease , already at a fairly advanced stage .
The diabetes screening van tours Karnataka
In one respect Nagabushan has been fortunate .
He could never have afforded to travel for treatment to the nearest big city - Bangalore , six hours ' drive away - but concerned doctors and healthcare professionals , backed by the World Diabetes Forum , commissioned the building of a truck equipped with some of the latest eyecare technology .
It tours round Karnataka taking eyecare to people in remote locations .
Nagabushan has been told that they cannot restore his lost vision , but they can stop it getting any worse .
In many respects it has already too late : Nagabushan 's near - blindness has forced him to stop running a stall in the market from which he earned barely enough to keep his family .
He depends now on the charity of others .
In Chennai , KJ Thomas is at the other end of the socio-economic scale .
He is a retired professional and has had diabetes for 25 years .
He can afford to pay for treatment to keep it at bay .
He has been told that a changing lifestyle has probably caused his symptoms , but this puzzles him .
" I am not obese , " he said , " and I get up every morning at 4 am and have an hour 's walk . "
Mr Thomas 's experience highlights the other huge threat to Indians posed by diabetes .
For reasons that doctors do not fully understand Indians seem to have an unnaturally high risk of contracting diabetes .
The government plans an awareness campaign for Indians
So if they stray just slightly into an unhealthy way of living they become very vulnerable .
The Indian government has plans to set up a public awareness programme to warn citizens of the risk .
Diabetes can be averted if the right measures are taken early enough .
Responding early has become critically important , because there are now signs that young people - even those in their early teens - are getting Type II diabetes .
Diabetes used to be a disease of the elderly and middle aged .
If it gets a grip on the young , the outlook is very bleak .

Neocons still love that Cold War mentality
When Robert Kagan …
The details of who did what to precipitate Russia ’s war against Georgia are not very important .
Do you recall the precise details of the Sudeten Crisis that led to Nazi Germany ’s invasion of Czechoslovakia ?
Of course not , because that morally ambiguous dispute is rightly remembered as a minor part of a much bigger drama .
The events of the past week will be remembered that way , too .
… and Bill Kristol …
When the “ civilized world ” expostulated with Russia about Georgia in 1924 , the Soviet regime was still weak .
In Germany , Hitler was in jail .
Only 16 years later , Britain stood virtually alone against a Nazi -Soviet axis .
Is it not true today , as it was in the 1920s and ’30s , that delay and irresolution on the part of the democracies simply invite future threats and graver dangers ?
…rely on the same flawed historical parallel , you know the neocons are longing for the simplistic duality of the Cold War .
The war between Georgia and Russia offers just such an opportunity .
But as is often the case , the neocon pitch deserves to be ignored .
Joe Klein gets this just right :
With Word War IV — Norman Podhoretz ’s ridiculous oversell of the struggle against jihadi extremism — on a slow burn for the moment , Kagan et al are showing renewed interest in the golden oldies of enemies , Russia and China .
This larval neo-crusade has influenced the campaign of John McCain , with his comic book proposal for a League of Democracies and his untenable proposal to kick the Russians out of the G8 .
To be sure , Russia ’s assault on Georgia is an outrage .
We should use all the diplomatic leverage we have ( not all that much , truthfully ) to end this invasion , and — as Richard Holbrooke and Ronald Asmus argue in this more reasonable take — help Georgia to recover when it ’s over .
And , to be sure , neither Russia nor China are going to be our good buddies , as many of us hoped in the afterglow of the fall of communism .
They will be a significant diplomat challenge .
But it is important , yet again , to call out the endless neoconservative search for new enemies , mini-Hitlers .
It is the product of an abstract over - intellectualizing of the world , the classic defect of ideologues .
It is , as we have seen the last eight years , a dangerous way to behave internationally .
And it has severely damaged our moral authority in the world …
I mean , after the U.S. invasion of Iraq , after Abu Ghraib , after our blithe rubbishing of the Geneva Accords , why should anyone listen to us when we criticize the Russians for their aggression in the Caucasus ?
Good point .
Matt Yglesias , from his new stomping ground , added :
So how did Barack Obama fare in college ?
It ’s unclear how well he did as an undergraduate , although he was not a distinguished student .
Obama refuses to release his transcript from his undergraduate years .
According to an article in the Wall Street Journal , Obama was not well - known among classmates after he transferred to Columbia University from Occidental College in the early 1980s .
The article quotes a former roommate who states that Obama ’s performance improved after he stopped taking drugs ( which Obama has admitted to openly ) .
Since Obama did not graduate with honors , that means his GPA was between a 2.0 and a 3.3 — although , since he was admitted to Harvard Law School , it ’s hard to imagine his GPA was much lower than a 3.3 .
Obama graduated from Columbia in 1983 with a degree in political science .
He specialized in international relations .
Law school was another story for Obama .
He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School ( the second highest honor available ) in 1991 .
He also was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review , a very prestigious honor .

' How we caught the fidayeen alive '
T he first thing you notice as you enter D B Marg police station in south Mumbai is the photograph of Tukaram G Omble , who died battling terrorists early on the morning of November 27 .
The assistant police sub - inspector had grabbed a terrorist 's AK - 47 and did not let go even as six bullets ripped through him .
Omble knew that if he let go his comrades would also die .
His heroic action helped his colleagues kill one terrorist and nab the other -- Ajmal Qasab .
Senior Inspector Nagappa R Mahale is the man in charge of the D B Marg police station .
He was on duty when he heard that terrorists had attacked south Mumbai .
" The first thing I did was put up nakabandi ( police blockades ) at two places .
There were the two roads that led from south Mumbai to our area . "
" When we heard that a Skoda car was heading with two armed terrorists towards Girgaum Chowpatty , I immediately told my men to seal the road and put up two barricades .
I did not want them to try and crash through . "
" At 0015 am we got the message that the Skoda had entered Marine Drive and was coming towards us .
At 0030 the Skoda stopped 50 feet away from our barricades .
They knew that they could not go through . "

Late Monday , the Ignatieff camp released the names of 46 Liberal MPs who are backing the frontrunner .
It did not mention his support among senators , who tend to lean more towards Rae .
Ignatieff said in the email that he was " honoured by the incredible surge of support from all parts of our party . "
And he tackled worries that being selected leader at Wednesday 's caucus meeting would freeze out thousands of party members from the process .
If successful this week , Ignatieff said he would ensure that his leadership is " confirmed " by the party at the May convention in Vancouver .
" Should I become leader I hope to immediately engage the grassroots in the very real policy challenges facing our country at a time of peril and in the party renewal challenges that all Liberals must face together .
I will need the best from each and every one of us in this regard , " he said .
Ignatieff ’s supporters hope his installation as interim leader would put irresistible pressure on his one remaining leadership rival — Bob Rae — to bow out , although Rae could theoretically remain in the race until the May 2 leadership vote .
With Rae out , Ignatieff would become the de facto permanent leader whose acclamation would be formalized in Vancouver .
That scenario was spelled out Monday by LeBlanc .
“ I would be very pleased if the caucus were to unite around Michael on Wednesday , ” LeBlanc told a news conference .
While the national executive would normally rubber - stamp the decision of caucus , LeBlanc held out the possibility of the executive developing some sort of alternative process to allow party rank - and - file to “ validate ” the caucus choice .
Rae was giving no sign of giving up without a fight .
He continued to insist that the party must find some expedited way to allow all members to choose the next leader before end of January .
“ It ’s better to have the party as a whole involved in finding a solution than it is having a solution imposed from above , ” said Rae .
“ I do n’t think that coronations are generally very successful in political parties .
I think most people believe that it ’s better to have a contest , it ’s better to have a choice . ”
Rae charged that letting caucus alone determine the leader would be undemocratic and elitist , and would shut out party members in vast areas of the country that are not represented by Liberals in the House of Commons .
He got some support Monday from Toronto MP Gerard Kennedy , the kingmaker who helped secure the leadership for Dion in 2006 .
Kennedy , who endorsed Rae for the leadership this time , argued that a more inclusive process would confer more “ legitimacy ” on whomever wins .
Kennedy and other MPs said they ’ve been hearing from angry Liberals who do n’t want to be left out of the process .
Insiders said national executive members were also deluged with missives from irate party members .
In response to one upset Liberal , party president Doug Ferguson promised : “ I will stand up for our members on this issue . ”
Sources said Ferguson and national party director Greg Fergus feverishly cobbled together four options for choosing the next leader , including two that would ensure broad grassroots participation .
The proposals were be to presented late Monday to the full national executive .
Liberal riding presidents were also to be consulted during a conference call Tuesday .
The proposals included :
— The Ignatieff camp ’s preferred option of having the frontrunner effectively crowned at Wednesday ’s caucus meeting and ratified by the national executive .
— Expanding the number of Liberals required to approve the caucus choice of interim leader to include riding presidents and defeated candidates , in addition to the national executive .
— Have caucus choose an interim leader Wednesday other than Ignatieff or Rae .
Later this month or early January , allow every party member to vote by phone for a permanent leader , who would be officially ratified by delegates at the May convention .
— Move up the delegate selection meetings for the May convention , currently scheduled for early March , to early January .
With only two contenders left in the race , the winner would be evident at this point , although formal ratification would n’t take place until May .
Dion ’s departure throws into doubt the future of the coalition proposal he negotiated with the NDP .
While Rae has championed the plan , Ignatieff has been lukewarm to the idea of forming a Liberal — NDP coalition cabinet propped up in the Commons by the separatist Bloc Quebecois .
Ignatieff has suggested the Liberals should continue to use the threat of a coalition to wring concessions out of Prime Minister Stephen Harper , but should wait to see the content of the budget before deciding whether to follow through .
In Ignatieff ’s own words , his position amounts to “ coalition if necessary but not necessarily coalition . ”

­ In 2006 , the United States consumed an average of almost 20.6 million barrels of petroleum per day , the equivalent of more than 865 million gallons of o­il [ source : Energy Information Administration ] .
Oil powers your car on a trip to the grocery store .
It helps industry develop and fosters technological advances in science and medicine .
It also creates a tremendous amount of wealth :
The global economy is based in large part on oil drilling , refining , transportation and distribution .

But oil is a finite resource produced from the fossilized remains of ancient marine plants and animals .
It takes at least 10 million years for fossilized remains to become crude oil , and people use oil much faster than it is created .
Eventually oil production will peak , and we will begin to run out .
Some estimate that this peak has already occurred ; others see it taking place in the near future .
Either way , most people believe that we are in the midst of an impending energy crisis .
After all , petroleum plays such a big role in daily human activity .
What happens when we run out of oil ?
­­
­ The energy sector spends billions on the quest for alternatives to gasoline .
But the next energy source has to do more than just supply the world with power .
With increasing concerns over greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) from fossil fuels leading to glob­al warming , the next fuel has to be clean , too .
It has to be affordable , and it has to help sustain the economy .
The next generation of fuels needs to arrive quickly , to help people transition from petroleum .
After all , the world can't grind to a halt for a decade or two while the next fuel is developed and implemented .
All of this put together sounds like an impossible laundry list of demands on any fuel source .
That 's why it 's so surprising that , after a just a few years of research , an energy source that seems to fulfill all of these obligations is emerging .
Ethanol ( ethyl alcohol ) is a form of fuel derived from the complex carbohydrate­s in plants .
For decades , researchers have been aware of its potential as a fuel .
But the process to produce ethanol inexpensively and efficiently has been elusive -- until now , some scientists say .

So how can grass become fuel ?

MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) -- Meagan McCormic faced television cameras on Christmas Day to plead for the return of her missing 5 - month - old son .
Meagan McCormic , 22 , is charged with filing a false police report about a missing baby .
" I do n't even know if he 's dead or alive , " she said .
In fact , she knew that the child had never existed , police said .
McCormic was trying to lure an ex-boyfriend back when she invented a missing - child story that triggered a statewide search this week , police said Friday .
Investigators have charged the 22 - year - old with filing a false police report .
If convicted , they said , she may have to pay authorities for the cost of their search .
She was scheduled to appear in court Friday afternoon .
McCormic had described her infant son as having a mohawk , a single tooth and a fake tattoo .
She told reporters his name was Riley Buchness and that she had left him with a nanny who had a French accent and a gap between her teeth .
She invented the story to lure back an ex-boyfriend by pretending he had fathered a child he did not know about , said Delrish Moss , a spokesman for the Miami Police Department .
When the boyfriend showed up and asked to see the child , Moss said , McCormic told him the boy was missing .
" He finally decided to show up , and she created a story and he had no idea , " Moss said .
On Christmas Day , the estranged boyfriend attended a news conference with McCormic under the impression that he had a son who was missing .
" I do n't understand , " John Buchness , 26 , said then , choking back tears .
" It 's Christmas . "
McCormic told police she had left her son with a nanny named Camille .
" I do n't know if they 're in Florida , " she said .
" I do n't know where they are . "
Authorities around Florida started looking for the boy and nanny , using the descriptions McCormic supplied , police said .
She even gave police a picture of the boy , but Friday they said they believe she had downloaded the photo from the Internet .
Authorities have called off their search .

There ’s a lot of bad fan art out there .
Wannabe artists agonize for hours over portraits of their favorite celebrities , characters and settings that exist only in fiction .
I ’ve seen many poorly rendered anime drawings and pastel portraits of young Anakin Skywalker , but sometimes , you come across fan art that truly honors the originals .
Here are 7 examples that go far beyond the typical , offering an homage to geeky movies , games , comics and more .
Dr. Manhattan Illustration
Ardent fans of The Watchmen comic book series are fiercely protective over the world created by Alan Moore , and many have already dismissed the upcoming film as not faithful enough to the original .
As such , it might seem sacrilegious to portray the character Dr. Manhattan differently than the way Dave Gibbons imagined him – but this interpretation , by illustrator Tim Durning , should win some people over .
Recycled Storm Trooper Sculpture
If there ’s one thing you would n’t expect to run into at the mall , it ’s a life - size storm trooper sculpture made of recycled industrial materials .
But , in Dubai , you should throw all of your expectations out the window , because the unexpected is everywhere .
And this storm trooper was n’t alone : he was accompanied by Bobo Fett and an Alien .
World of Warcraft Painting
WoW seems to attract more crazy - talented creators of fan art than any other geeky subject .
Some of the things fans have created in honor of the game are downright awesome , looking like they could easily be used for promotional materials , like this piece from Jeremy Sun .
See the full piece and hundreds more over at the Blizzard fan art program .
Star Wars Dollar Bill Origami
Won Park is obviously a big fan of Star Wars ( and Star Trek , if you take a look at the rest of his work ) .
He spent hours meticulously folding dollar bills into intricate paper replicas of the Millenium Falcon , TIE fighters , the Death Star and more .
Stephen Colbert Rubik ’s Cube Portrait
What makes this fan art geeky is both the subject and the medium .
This portrait was created entirely of Rubik ’s cubes by artist David Litwin , who said of the effort , “ What does one do with 768 cubes once you ’ve made your company logo ?
I spent way too much time getting them stickered properly to just leave it at that .
No , you move on to doing other pictures .
I had considered great works of art ( Mona Lisa , etc. ) , but thought a tribute to Stephen Colbert would be more fun . ”
Lord of the Rings Origami Series
More origami , but this time the subject is Lord of the Rings and the medium is one piece of uncut square craft paper ( per figure ) .
Artist Eric Joisel bends and folds paper into these incredible figures without the use of adhesive , creating a ‘ crease pattern ’ blueprint that often takes years to develop .
You can see the rest of his figures – and images of the blueprints – at his website .
Futurama Case Mod
Futurama fans upset by the series ’ cancellation waited years to be sated with new episodes , and kept themselves occupied in the meantime by creating the kind of fan art that only true fanatics can even conceive of .

Joshua Bolten , left , White House chief of staff , stands with John Podesta , an Obama aide and ex-Clinton chief of staff , during president - elect Barack Obama 's visit to the White House on Monday .
WASHINGTON  President - elect Barack Obama imposed strict new ethics rules on his transition team Tuesday , barring federal lobbyists from donating to his transition and inaugural events .
The Democrat , who vowed that special interests will not run his White House , also prohibits federal lobbyists from engaging in any lobbying while working for the transition .
IN TRANSITION : World leaders reach out to Obama team NEW TEAM : Obama surrounded by big fundraisers Obama transition aide John Podesta called the guidelines " the strictest ethics rules ever applied . "
Obama , however , allows state and local lobbyists to work on the transition .
Federal lobbyists also can participate as long their transition work is not in areas in which they tried to exert influence in the previous year .
Fred Wertheimer , president of the non-partisan watchdog group Democracy 21 , said the rules are unique for a president - elect and " unlike anything that I have seen at the transition stage in 35 years . "
Podesta acknowledged that the guidelines may leave some qualified people out of the Obama transition .
" So be it , " he said .
Obama , who collected a record $ 659.7 million in his presidential race , must raise even more before he is sworn into office Jan. 20 .
He needs to collect about $ 6.7 million in private donations to supplement the $ 5.3 million in public money available for office space , furniture and other essentials .
Relocation expenses for transition employees , for instance , must come from private money , said Michael Toner , a former Federal Election Commission chairman and President Bush 's transition attorney in 2000 .
IRAQ : Obama 's plan for country about to meet reality VOTER SURVEY : Who did groups vote for in '08 ?
Federal law limits transition contributions to $ 5,000 , but sets few rules on who can donate .
Podesta said Obama will not take transition money from federal lobbyists , corporations or political action committees — as he did during his campaign .
The donors will be disclosed later this month and in December .
Obama is not required to do so until Feb. 20 .
Millions more in private donations will be needed for inaugural events .
Podesta said no lobbyist money would be accepted for those expenses .
He said more details , including the budget , are still to come .
In 2004 , President Bush spent $ 42.8 million .

John Resig ’s role at the Mozilla Corporation is JavaScript Evangelist .
I challenge you to invent a cooler title !
He also happens to be the creator and lead developer of the jQuery JavaScript library .
Ara Pehlivanian caught up with him recently to talk about the future of JavaScript , online privacy , and a handful of his long list of ongoing projects .
SitePoint :
Let me start out by congratulating you on the recent announcements by Microsoft and Nokia that they ’ll be using jQuery in their platforms .
I ’m curious , was there any lobbying from the jQuery community for this outcome , or did it come as a surprise ?
There has certainly been a number of jQuery developers who also worked on ASP .
NET .
Reading the blogs , you could see just how happy they were over the announcement .
As far as I know , there was n’t official lobbying by the community – but there was certainly lobbying from within the respective organizations to support jQuery as the library of choice .
Both of the announcements were a surprise ( in that we were approached by the companies without expecting it ) but we talked with them and worked hard to make sure that everything went smoothly for any sort of collaboration .
Both companies were very reasonable about the collaboration .
We set out a number of terms surrounding any future work , so that the community would benefit in the end ( such as no code forking , sending contributions back to the project , open communication , and such ) .
SP : How will this affect jQuery ’s evolution ?
It ’ll absolutely be for the better .
By being able to have more resources ( because we ’ll need more of everything : more testing of jQuery , more patches , more input ) at our disposal , the entire project will benefit .
In the end it ’ll only force us to become more professional and have a more - refined development process – which is really what we should shoot for , anyway .
SP : As creator and lead developer on jQuery , what ’s your opinion of competing JavaScript libraries , and how do you think the landscape will evolve over time ?
Libraries go through cycles ( as do browsers , for that matter ) .
There ’s a period of competition , followed by cooperation , followed by homogenization .
For example , for the CSS selector engines that all libraries now implement , there was a lot of competition surrounding the performance of their engines ; there had to be some differentiation since everyone was , effectively , implementing the same feature over and over again .
Libraries then cooperated and came up with a solid set of selectors to support , sharing performance - improvement techniques , as well .
Finally , we ’re now seeing the homogenization of the code base – unifying on a single back end ( like Sizzle ) .
I absolutely expect that we ’ll see this with other features that libraries duplicate .
The biggest benefit of a library is two - fold : it should remove the user from dealing with browser issues , and it should provide the user with an API that will simplify their development .
It must do both for the library to succeed .
At the same time , though , it ’s important to realize that asking for a unified library ( some sort of amalgamation of different libraries ) just does n’t make sense .
Much of what makes a library unique is its API and how it chooses to tackle the problems presented by the browser .
Turning it into a bland , generic API will only result in a device that users will have to paper over again and again .
SP : What is Sizzle ?
Sizzle is a new pure JavaScript CSS selector engine .
Sizzle is the code name for what will , eventually , become the new engine within jQuery .
I wanted an engine that was fast ( at least competitive with other engines ) , small ( a light file size ) , easily extensible , and had no dependencies .
The bonus of achieving this is that the engine is likely to become part of a number of major libraries .
I ’ve been talking with the MochiKit , Prototype , Dojo , and TinyMCE teams and they ’re all interested in using Sizzle for their code base .
It ’ll be great to have a unified approach to tackling JavaScript CSS selectors .
SP : These libraries often fill in the gaps in JavaScript ’s evolution , but there seems to be some contention regarding the shape it should take moving forward .
Recently , for example , Douglas Crockford and Brendan Eich have been at odds over the need to complexify or simplify the language .
What ’s your take on this issue ?
I do n’t think that they ’re mutually exclusive .
The biggest contention appeared to be ( and was relatively solved by the recent Harmony merger ) that the new features of the language should be built using smaller building blocks .
The Microsoft JScript team wanted the language to be built in this way and I agree : if there ’s going to be a class{} structure , then it needs to be nothing more than syntactic sugar for a task that can already be done using the built - in methods of the language .
Starting simple and then building up the complexity is a very efficient way to write code .
SP : With browser support for anything beyond JavaScript 1.5 being a bit sketchy , in your opinion , what should coders do who want to play with more advanced features of the language ?
I would worry less about the advanced features of the language and look more into the upcoming features of HTML5 .
If you want to be practical and be able to use what you learn today , then you ’ll rarely find solace in the realm of JavaScript language .
However , since the DOM is nicely object - detectable ( if ( document.querySelectorAll ) ) , it ’s quite easy to get up and running right away , to start playing with new features .
SP : Let ’s talk about some of the things you ’re working on right now .
The projects page on your web site lists 76 projects .
Is there one or two in particular that you ’re particularly excited about ?
Oh , gosh – there ’s a bunch .
My two favorites that show promise are :
port the browser environment over to pure JavaScript ( running in Rhino ) .
It allows you to run web applications , including libraries like jQuery and Prototype , completely offline .
There are a bunch of people working on it now and using it for a number of applications .
processing.js –
This is a more recent project of mine , which was a port of the processing visualization language to JavaScript ( running on top of Canvas ) .
This has seen a lot of uptake with people using it to build everything from games , real - time visualizations , charts – to art , all made with JavaScript .
One of my longest - running projects is a schedule maker for RIT ( Rochester Institute of Technology , the college that I went to ) where you could plug in a number of classes and it would compute all the possible schedule permutations .
Using this , you could find the ideal schedule for your classes .
It ’s been running since early 2003 and there are still a bunch of people using it .
SP : I ’ve heard you mention Fuel a few times in the past , what is it ?
This was a project that I undertook when I first joined Mozilla back in 2007 .
It was an attempt to simplify the complex Mozilla APIs by putting a simple JavaScript layer in front of them .
There are a number of extensions making good use of it now ( since it ships with Firefox 3 ) , so I ’m glad to see it starting to help make developers ’ lives simpler .
SP : Apart from your programming projects , you ’re also an author .
You post regularly to your blog and have recently started writing articles for Ars Technica .
With everything else on your plate , what prompted you to do this ?
I wanted to do some writing that was divorced from my blog – to write from a more neutral perspective .
Ars Technica has a great reputation for writing technical pieces that are relatively unbiased but still very informative .
Being able to write for them is a great challenge and should certainly improve my writing ability .
SP : You ’re also writing a new book called Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja .
How ’s that coming along ?
It ’s coming slowly .
I ’ve fallen behind these past couple of months , so I need to catch up again .
It ’s looking likely that it ’ll be a North American spring release , at the earliest .
SP : Who is the target audience ?
Can a newbie learn from it or is it geared more toward experienced coders looking to become Ninjas ?
It ’s definitely more towards experienced coders .
There are plenty of books for people new to JavaScript , but I felt as if the market for people craving more was quite under - nourished at the moment .
SP : What can we expect from this book that ’s unique ?
It actually dares to cover cross - browser development .
Almost all JavaScript books stay in the safe realm of the JavaScript language where there are , comparatively , few bugs to contend with .
Once you move into the DOM and tackle hard problems – the kind of problems that libraries handle – that ’s where the most work comes into play .
SP : I ’ve got a couple of non -work related questions for you .
You used to list your cell phone number on your About Me page as a sign of openness .
It ’s no longer there .
How come ?
Honestly , it was rarely ever used for what it was intended .
I ’d roughly say that about 70 % of the calls were from recruiters – who I had to send elsewhere ; 25 % were jQuery questions that were better handled by the mailing list ; and 5 % were other questions that required ( at least ) a follow - up email just so
I could better understand what the problem was .
I still reply to questions that I get by email or IM ( handling them on my own timetable is nice ) ; it just turned out that having the phone number displayed was too intrusive without much benefit .
SP : So , you ’re writing a book , and regularly posting articles on different sites ( including your own ) ; you ’re speaking at conferences , and coding on several different projects .
You ’re obviously a very busy person .
Can we get a glimpse of the other side of John Resig ?
What do you do for fun ?
What are your favorite bands / movies / games / books / magazines / web sites ?
I have a wonderful girlfriend , Claire , who I spend a lot of my free time with .
I enjoy going out to shows ( recently saw The Dodos , The Presets , and Cut Copy ) , visiting museums , and generally hanging out with friends .
I ’m also an enthusiast of good television : currently watching True Blood , Dexter , Mad Men , and It ’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia .
I ’m working my way through some good graphic novels at the moment : have just finished Watchmen and working on Batman : The Dark Knight Returns .
I ’m also hopelessly addicted to reddit .
I like to keep a pretty clear separation between my work and my personal life .
When I ’m having fun with friends , I ’m not muddying it up with talk about work or computers .
It ’s very relaxing – in fact , the majority of my real life friends know very little about computers at all .
Of course , living in Boston it ’s hard to ignore sports so I like to catch a game or two , when I can .
Thanks for your time , John !
My pleasure Ara , thank you .
Palin says voter question is ' gotcha journalism ' David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday September 29 , 2008
Print This Email This On Monday night , CBS ' Katie Couric talked to John McCain and Sarah Palin about their apparent disagreement on attacking terrorists within Pakistan .
Echoing the words of a voter who asked Palin a similar question , the VP candidate turned the question on end , equating questions from the public to " gotcha journalism . "
Couric , referring to Palin 's support for attacking Pakistan , which is similar to Democratic nominee Barack Obama , asked whether she and McCain are on the same page .
During the first presidential debate , McCain chastised Obama for stating the plan out loud .
Playing off his running - mate 's seeming strategic slip , Couric asked McCain if she had made the right move .
" We had a great discussion with President Zardari as we talked about what it is that America can and should be doing together to make sure that the terrorists do not cross borders and do not ultimately put themselves in a position of attacking America again or her allies , " said Palin .
" And we will do what we have to do to secure the United States of America and her allies . "
" Is that something you should n't say out loud , Sen. McCain ? " asked Couric .
" Of course not , " replied McCain .
" But , look , I understand this day and age of ' gotcha ' journalism .
Is that a pizza place ?
In a conversation with someone who you did n't hear ... the question very well , you do n't know the context of the conversation , grab a phrase .
Gov. Palin and I agree that you do n't announce that you 're going to attack another country ... "
" Are you sorry you said it ? " questioned Couric .
" ... and the fact ... " trailed McCain .
" Governor ? " asked Couric .
" Wait a minute , " interrupted McCain .
" Before you say , 'is she sorry she said it , ' this was a ' gotcha ' sound bite that , look ...
" It was n't a ' gotcha , ' " said Couric .
" She was talking to a voter . "
After some further wrangling , Palin finally capitulated to McCain 's defense of her . " ... this is all about ' gotcha ' journalism , " she said .
" A lot of it is .
But that 's okay , too . "
But while gaffes on journalistic styles may be the least of Palin 's concerns at the moment , it may yet get worse for the Alaska Republican .
According to Politico , CBS is holding back a clip of the VP candidate flummoxed when asked to name key Supreme Court decisions apart from Roe vs. Wade .
Of concern to McCain 's campaign , however , is a remaining and still - undisclosed clip from Palin 's interview with Couric last week that has the political world buzzing .
The Palin aide , after first noting how " infuriating " it was for CBS to purportedly leak word about the gaffe , revealed that it came in response to a question about Supreme Court decisions .
After noting Roe vs. Wade , Palin was apparently unable to discuss any major court cases .
There was no verbal fumbling with this particular question as there was with some others , the aide said , but rather silence .

In a secret document viewed by The Independent , it appears that not - so - Great Britain is sabotaging a safeguard protecting farmers who unknowingly grow genetically modified crops .
The document shows that the UK stands alone in its opposition to the provision .
If removed , European farmers could sow billions of GM seeds annually without even realizing it .
Currently , the UK is quite free of genetically modified crops .
That would surely change without this rule .
The document is set to be finalized by ministers across Europe on Thursday .
It was drawn up by France to enforce guidelines on using such technologies as GM crops which continually contaminate conventional crops .
Say that three times fast .
According to The Independent , a study found that two - thirds of US conventional crops are “ contaminated ” in this way .
Four years ago the EU drew up plans that would allow 0.5 per cent contamination of beet seeds , and 0.3 per cent of maize and oilseed rape ones .
This would have permitted the growth of up to 4.5 billion GM oilseed rape plants , and 2.3 billion GM beet plants , across Europe every year , but the plans were scrapped after many protests .
Now every European government except Britain wishes to reduce the permitted level of GMOs to lowest amount that is scientifically detectable .
The Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs says it is being “ pragmatic and proportionate ” by opposing the provision , but Clare Oxborrow of Friends of the Earth says its position is “ an indefensible threat to GM - free farming ” .

A French ship has begun repairing two undersea cables in the Mediterranean that were severed on Friday , disrupting internet and phone communications .
A robot submarine will locate the ends of the cables on the sea bed and bring them to the surface to be re-connected .
They were cut within 5 minutes of each other , possibly by a trawler net .
Egypt says it has been able to restore most of its communications by re-routing services , but other parts of the Middle East remain badly affected .
We have to fix the cable fibre by fibre , and it's a very huge cable
Louis - Michel Aymard
France Telecom Marine Experts have warned that it may be days before the fault is fixed and that the knock - on effect could have serious repercussions on regional economies .
Lengthy process Experts from France Telecom Marine arrived at the site of the damage to the SEA - ME - WE4 and SEA - ME - WE3 lines onboard the cable ship , Raymond Croze , at 1330 GMT on Sunday , spokesman Louis - Michel Aymard said .
They then sent a remotely - operated submarine robot called " Hector " to the sea bed to begin the search for the two ends of each line .
It is unclear how long repairs will take , as a ship could have dragged the cables several kilometres from their normal positions .
Once located , the cable ends will be brought to the surface by the robot and repairs will be carried out in a special facility on the ship - a process that could take days .
Engineers will deploy ' Hector ' to retrieve cables from the sea floor " We have to fix the cable fibre by fibre , and it's a very huge cable , " Mr Aymard told the Associated Press .
France Telecom said it expected to repair SEA - ME - WE4 by 25 December and SEA - ME - WE3 by the end of the year .
A third line , operated by FLAG Telecom , was also cut and will be repaired by another ship .
In January the same line was damaged off Egypt 's Mediterranean coast , severely disrupting internet and phone communications for many in the Middle East for days , although only two lines were snapped then .
A few hours before the three lines were cut , a suspected sub - sea earthquake damaged a local GO cable to Malta , severely disrupting communications to the island .

My colleagues and I have spent the week building up anticipation for this post on Twitter .
After you read this post I am sure that you will agree that the wait was worthwhile .
The hallways at Amazon have been buzzing with excitement of late .
After working for years to build and to run our line of highly scalable infrastructure web services we are happy to see that developers large and small are putting them to good use .
Here ’s what ’s happening today :
Amazon EC2 is now in full production .
The beta label is gone .
There ’s now an SLA ( Service Level Agreement ) for EC2 .
Microsoft Windows is now available in beta form on EC2 .
Microsoft SQL
Server is now available in beta form on EC2 .
We plan to release an interactive AWS management console .
We plan to release new load balancing , automatic scaling , and cloud monitoring services .
Let ’s take a look at each of these items in turn .
Production – After a two year beta period , Amazon EC2 is now ready for production .
During the beta we heard and responded to an incredible amount of customer feedback , adding support for powerful features such as Availability Zones , Elastic Block Storage , Elastic IP Addresses , multiple instance types , support for the OpenSolaris and Windows operating systems , and ( as of today ) a Service Level Agreement .
Regular EC2 accounts are allowed to run up to 20 simultaneous instances .
Requests for hundreds and even thousands of additional instances are granted all the time and can be made here .
SLA – The new EC2 Service Level Agreement works at the Region level .
Each EC2 Region ( there ’s only one right now but there will be more in the future ) is divided into a number of Availability Zones .
The SLA specifies that each Region will be available at least 99.95 % of the time .
Per the SLA , a Region is unavailable if more than one of its Availability Zones does not have external connectivity .
Windows Support – Beta level support for Microsoft Windows is now available on EC2 , in the form of 32 and 64 bit AMIs , with pricing starting at $ 0.125 per hour .
Microsoft SQL
Server is also available in 64 bit form .
All of the powerful EC2 features listed above can be used with the new Windows instances and we ’ll be adding support for DevPay in the near future .
Once launched , the Windows instances can be accessed using the Windows Remote Desktop or the rdesktop client .
I ’ve spent some time using Windows on EC2 and it works really well .
I used the EC2 command line tools to launch a 32 bit instance , opened up an additional port in the security group , and then logged in to it using Remote Desktop .
We ’ll be running Windows on EC2 at next week ’s PDC in Los Angeles , so be sure to stop by and to say hello if you are there .
Rumor has it that we ’ll be giving out a really cool badge to the people who stop by our booth .
RightScale founder Thorsten von Eiken has written up a helpful post which outlines the differences between Windows and Linux with respect to launching , accessing , bundling , and using the Elastic Block Store .
He also describes current and planned support for Windows in their products .
We ’ve updated ElasticFox with a number of new features , including direct access to EBS and Elastic IP addresses from the main tab , one - click AMI bundling on Windows , better key and security group management , and the ability to directly launch Remote Desktop sessions .
There ’s also a brand - new ( and very helpful ) ElasticFox Getting Started Guide .
We are looking forward to seeing how our customers will put Windows to work .
We expect to see ASP .
Net sites , media transcoding , HPC ( High Performance Computing ) , and more .
I ’ve talked to a number of developers who will deploy hybrid web sites using a mix of Linux and Windows servers .
This really underscores the open and flexible nature of EC2 .
We are also planning to offer some new capabilities in 2009 to make managing cloud - based applications even easier .
As usual , we ’ll start with a private beta and you can express your interest here .
Management Console –
The management console will simplify the process of configuring and operating your applications in the AWS cloud .
You ’ll be able to get a global picture of your cloud computing environment using a point - and - click web interface .
Load Balancing –
The load balancing service will allow you to balance incoming requests and traffic across multiple EC2 instances .
Automatic Scaling –
The auto - scaling service will allow you to grow and shrink your usage of EC2 capacity on demand based on application requirements .
Cloud Monitoring –
The cloud monitoring service will provide real time , multi-dimensional monitoring of host resources across any number of EC2 instances , with the ability to aggregate operational metrics across instances , Availability Zones , and time slots .
Amazon CTO
Werner Vogels has done a very nice job of explaining why services of this type are needed to build highly reliable and highly scalable applications .
His blog is a must read for those interested in cloud computing .
Werner has spent so much time talking about AWS of late that I ’ve asked him to be an honorary member of my team of AWS evangelists !
I think it is important to note that load balancing , automatic scaling , and cloud monitoring will each be true web services , with complete APIs for provisioning , control , and status checking .
We ’ll be working with a number of management tool vendors and developers to make sure that their products will support these new services on a timely basis .
So , there you go .
What do you think ?

THE former president , born 150 years ago today , was interviewed in his childhood home at 28 East 20th Street .
He has long been a ghostly presence there .
The house is now the Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site .
Due to Roosevelt ’s great age , it is difficult to tell how well he hears contemporary questions .
But he is as forceful as ever in expressing himself .
His statements below are drawn from the historic record and are uncut except when interrupted by his interviewer .
Q. Happy birthday , Mr. President !
Or do you prefer being called Colonel ?
ROOSEVELT
I ’ve had the title of president once  having it twice means nothing except peril to whatever reputation I achieved the first time .
Q. “ Colonel , ” then .
Do you think the Congress elected two years ago as a foil to the Bush administration has fulfilled its mandate ?
A. I am heartsick over the delay , the blundering , the fatuous and complacent inefficiency and the effort to substitute glittering rhetoric for action .
When I first read this puzzle on the Google Treasure hunt page I did n't think that much of it , but it 's clearly actually quite good .
Lots of great code , all of it much better than mine which was the worst solution of the lot .
Here 's my C++ code :
#include < algorithm > # include < string > # include < iostream > int main ( ) { uint64_t answer = 0 ; std:: string question ( std::string ( 54 , ' d ' ) + std::string ( 42 , 'r ' ) ) ; for ( ; std::next_permutation ( question.begin( ) , question.end ( ) ) ; ++ answer ) if ( answer % 1000000 == 0 ) std::cout << answer << " : " << question << std::endl ; std::cout << " There are " << answer << " paths " << std::endl ; }
There are two big problems with this code ( and one small one ) .
The first is that it gives the wrong answer .
As Jon Randy pointed out , if you 're looking for the answer on a 3 by 7 grid you can only go right twice and down six times .
The code should be searching for permutations of 53 ds and 41 rs .
The second thing that 's wrong with it is that it wo n't produce an answer at all .
Well , not without leaving it to run for a very , very long time .
Let 's put the futility of this solution into perspective .
After running for about 985 minutes ( about 16 and a half hours ) the program had tried out an impressive 2,018,494,000,000 routes — after all it was checking more than 34 million paths per second .
That 's super fast .
Still , the answer is 760,365,888,182,828,026,538,367,852 and in order to have counted all of the permutations I 'd have had to leave it running for around 705,953,403,388 years !
Oh and there 's one last problem — it does n't count the first permutation so it 'll be off by one .
All in all a pretty poor attempt .
All of this is of course what happens when you do n't think before you start to tap away at the keyboard .
Thankfully other people were thinking and the right answer was offered by both Jon Randy and JordiB.
JordiB posted this Java solution :
import java.math .
BigDecimal ; public class Treasure { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { final int x = 54 ; final int y = 42 ; final int R = Math. min( x , y ) - 1 ; final int N = x+y - 2 ; BigDecimal paths = new BigDecimal ( 1 ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < R ; i++) { paths = paths.multiply ( new BigDecimal ( N - i ) ) .divide ( new BigDecimal ( i+1 ) ) ; } System.out.println ( " Paths : " +paths.toString ( ) ) ; } }
Jon did n't send in the code he used , but JordiB certainly spotted a nice little optimisation that cuts down on the size of the numbers used in the partial results and the number of multiplications required .
I think the size of the partial results is the only “ problem ” with this solution , which is neatly side stepped by luke_bkk 's Ruby version .
def robot ( rows , cols ) matrix = Array.new(rows ).collect{ Array.new ( cols ) } x , y = rows - 1 , cols - 1 x.downto(0 ) do |row| y.downto(0 ) do |col| a = ( matrix[ row +1 ] [ col ] unless matrix[ row +1] .nil ? ) || 0 b = matrix [row ] [ col +1 ] || 0 sum = a + b matrix [ row ] [ col ] = sum >
0 ? sum : 1 end end matrix [ 0 ] [ 0 ] end start = Time.now solution = robot ( 48 , 54 ) time = Time.now - start puts " Robot solution #{solution} computed in #{time}s "
luke_bkk 's is very clever .
It works out by repeated calculation the number of paths by working back from the destination and realising that the paths going through any point on the grid is related to the number of paths going through the points around it .
So , well done JordiB , Jon Randy & luke_bkk .
Not so good Kirit , must try harder …

let ’s talk about cheesecake .
it ’s so rich and decadent that i usually can’t resist cutting myself pieces that are way too big for one person .
you ’ll have a tough time too with this cake , since it has ginger in the crust and in the cheese filling .
i know it sounds crazy , but it works !
the result is a creamy , tangy and soothing dessert ( or breakfast or lunch or dinner or snack ) that you ’ll want to tell your friends about .
do n’t be afraid : embrace the ginger cheesecake .
are you one of those people who likes the crust more than the actual cake ?
it can be a tough balance .
with every bite , i’m torn between wanting more of both .
for those of you who prefer the cheese , this crust just may turn you to the other ( crusty ? ) side .
it ’s a mixture of ginger snaps and pecans , a combination so beautiful you should buy enough for two crusts in case you just eat the first before you can get it in the oven .
i used several common tricks to reduce the likelihood that my cheesecake would crack , including putting a bowl of water in the oven to keep it moist and cooling the cake very slowly by not immediately turning off the heat .
despite my efforts , the cake cracked like the grand canyon , and to be honest , i’m ok with it , because i think it actually gives it a lot of character .
ginger cheesecake
adapted from several recipes .
share this one with your friends .
crust
2 cups crushed pecans
1 1/2 cups crushed ginger snaps
1/2 cup melted butter ( 1 stick )
3 tsp crushed ginger
cake
3 eggs
2 8 oz packages cream cheese
3 cups sour cream
1 cup sugar
2 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp salt
2 Tbsp fresh ginger , peeled and grated
1. crush the pecans and ginger snaps in a food processor ( i only recomment the processor because both of these things are really difficult to crush by hand or even with a rolling pin ) .
add to the melted butter and sprinkle in the crushed ginger .
mix until moist .
press crust into the bottom of a 9 ″ springform pan .
2. microwave the cream cheese to soften it and add it to the sour cream .
mix in the eggs , sugar , vanilla , salt and fresh grated ginger .
pour over the crust in the pan .
3. bake at 375 F for about 45 minutes .
the cake will be done when the sides and edges are firm and turn a bit golden brown .
the middle may still jiggle a bit when you move the cake but it will continue baking from the inside .
DO NOT open the oven door until the 45 minutes have passed .
cool the cake slowly after the baking is finished ( to avoid cracks ) by turning off the oven and opening the door so the temperature does not drop so quickly .
after about a half hour in the open oven , move the cake to a wire rack to cool to room temperature .
refrigerate until chilled before serving .
BONUS !
if anyone is interested in how or where i take my photos , here is a sneak peek into my living room “ studio : ”

How We Made Our Face Recognizer 25 x Faster Posted by Louis Brandy on 27 October 2008
This is a war story from my real day job .
I work at a start - up company in Pittsburgh that does face detection , tracking , and recognition software .
This particular problem involved optimization of the face recognizer .
I 'm going to try to simplify our face recognition algorithm as much as possible to get to the point I 'm trying to make .
If you are reading this to try to learn our algorithmic secrets , you 'll be sorely disappointed .
What you 'll see here is in the first few chapters of a pattern recognition textbook .
Recently , we came out with a brand new version of our face recognizer .
As is usually the case , once they are happy with the accuracy they hand it off to me to see if I can speed it up .
The Problem
for i in range ( face_list1 ) : for j in range ( face_list2 ) : answer [i , j ] = compare ( face_list1 [ i ] , face_list2 [j ] )
PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME + COMMAND 32603 louis 16 0 246 m 24 m 4620 S 800 4.8 0:09.12 recognize
Not So Fast
The Inner Loop
# pythonic psuedo code for face1 in face_list_a : # on the order of 1000 for face2 in face_list_b : # on the order of 1000 for feature in features : feature_list [ feature ] = extract_feature ( feature , face1 , face2 ) answer [ face1 ] [ face2 ] = classify ( classifier , feature_list )
The Solution - Becoming cache - friendly
for f in feature_list : for face1 in face_list_a : # on the order of 1000 for face2 in face_list_b : # on the order of 1000 feature_lists [ face1 ] [ face2 ] [ f ] = extract_feature( f , face1 , face2 ) for face1 in face_list_a : for face2 in face_list_b : answer [ face1 ] [ face2 ] = classify ( classifier , feature_lists [ face1 ] [ face2 ] )
Comparing faces tends to grow quadratically with the number of input faces .
When you imagine comparing 1000 faces to another 1000 , that equals a million comparisons .
Here 's the pseudo - code of that operation :
When you look at this code , notice how threadable this problem is .
These comparison operations are completely independent , numerous , and sizable amounts of computation .
This is a concurrent programmer ' sproblem .
So when it came time to parallelize this algorithm , I was n't worried .
This is what one might refer to as an embarrassingly parallel problem .
Our speed - up should be identical to the number of CPU cores .
So I sat down , as I 've done many times , whipped up a little thread pool , instantiated my thread - safe queue with a mama - process for feeding the workers .
We generate a to - do list , dump them all on the queue , and have the worker threads go to town on the other end of that queue .
This is a pretty standard solution .
Before lunch I was ready to fire it up and I saw the most beautiful thing a concurrent programmer can ever see : Just in case you are n't familiar with the output of top , this is showing my program using all 8 CPU cores ( dual quad - core ) .
Problem solved .
I went to lunch .
A funny thing happened over lunch .
My test finished running and the results were n't what I expected .
Having an embarrassingly parallel problem and a CPU pegged at 800 % , you 'd expect an 8 x speed - up .
That 's not at all what happened .
We ended up with about 3 x improvement .
Since our CPU is pegged at 800 % , it 's not a synchronization problem .
Having been down this road a time or two , I was fairly certain of the culprit but took a moment to prove it .
It was n't due to file I/ O or anything like that ( since none of that stuff was present ) .
With a little use of oprofile ( which deserves its own post , one day ) , I could tell the time was spent in user space , and not the kernel , which removes things like page zeroing or page faulting .
Cache misses , on the other hand , are " assigned " to the user process .
Our code was cache bound .
I'm going to strip out all of the layers and show you the entire algorithm , simplified .
Take my word for it , however , that in our ordinary code base , these loops were separated by numerous layers of abstraction , function calls , and a gigantic mass of book - keeping .
It should be fairly trivial to understandthe algorithm is doing .
How and why it works , though , are topics for a pattern recognition class .
This may require some explanation for people without any pattern recognition background .
First , every face is made up of a set of features .
Think of a feature as some measurement ( like eye color ) .
How are features chosen , or generated ?
Go take that pattern rec class .
We extract all of the features from our faces and dump them into our classifier which is able to determine a likelihood of a match .
The reason this is thrashing cache was pretty straight forward for me .
The inner loop is iterating over features .
Since each feature computation is relatively expensive , " iterating " over features is awful for cache performance .
The solution is a very simple reordering of the loops :
This means we use the same feature for every input first and once we are done with it , we move on to the next one .
This allows each successive comparison between faces to take advantage of the caching done in previous comparisons .
Not surprisingly , the above algorithm improved the performance of the single threaded recognizer by a factor of 6 .
It also removed the cache bottleneck .
With the algorithm no longer cache bound , our speed - up factor equaled our core count .
Once we combined all of the optimizations , we ended up with a 25 x speed - up of our 8 - threaded version on our octo-core machine .
Dead Abstractions
When I put the three loops next to each other , it appears like a textbook case of loop reordering .
Sometimes , however , reordering loops is n't as easy as you 'd like to believe .
In this case , these loops were scattered over multiple levels of abstractions .
Do you see which abstraction died ?
The compare ( face1 , face2 ) function .
The loop reordering requires a set of input faces to work properly so that a single compare ( ) function goes back to the slower , cache - inefficient algorithm .
It would be natural for a programmer to decide that you need a compare ( face1 , face2 ) function .
Unfortunately , however , implementing multiple comparisons by making multiple calls to a single compare ( ) function leads to the misuse of cache .
Writing cache - friendly algorithms is n't necessarily easy .
Usually , it involves breaking some nice abstractions .
This cache - friendliness problem is exacerbated , greatly , in the multi-core generation where cache performance can act as a hidden serializing force .
You are doubly punished for misusing cache in this new world .
Added to this is the fact that writing cache friendly , highly scalable , concurrent algorithms is a black , black art .
For any embarrassingly parallel problem , like mine , the solution might be bit messy but it 'll work .
For more difficult problems , good luck .
For Craig , my husband , allowing the cameras to film his last moments in Zurich was about facing the end of life honestly .
This was n't a film about him personally .
He was keen to have it shown because when death is hidden and private , people do n't face their fears about it .
They do n't acknowledge that it is going to happen , they do n't reflect on it , they do n't want to face it .
That 's the taboo .
Craig had his first random symptom of motor neurone disease at Christmas 2005 .
In the spring , he deteriorated very quickly .
He lost the use of his arms and , during the summer , he was on a ventilator 24 hours a day , then he was starting to lose rapidly the use of his legs .
He wanted to remove a veil so that people could see how comfortably someone could die who – without this option of assisted suicide – maybe would have had a very painful death .
Craig had been a teacher , and you could say he made this film with his educative hat on .
Both of us had been interested in why society and laws regulate very specific decisions that we make .
He had resisted the Vietnam War .
If he had had to leave the US to avoid the draft , he would have – but he was lucky , it did n't come to that .
And I have had an ongoing interest in the regulation of the body , and how the law regulates the body , so this was something that we were interested in before Craig 's illness .
We met when we were at college in the Chicago area .
I came to Britain to study in 2001 .
A couple of years before that , he had retired from his 20 - year career in IT and he had taken up some teaching posts , so I continued my studies , and he found a teaching post in Harrogate , north Yorkshire , teaching maths and science .

In late March or early April , he was having a lot of trouble breathing .
The onset of motor neurone disease ( MND ) symptoms can be quite different for different people , and for him it was his breathing .
He was diagnosed by the end of April by one neurologist .
He got a second opinion , and then he was sent to a specialist consultant who said , by a process of elimination , that that was what it was .
By early June 2006 , he knew he had MND .
This disease was , in an odd way , his real nightmare because he had a real fear of paralysis and of suffocation .
I knew that about him .
I had known about that fear for years .
Since meeting Craig when we were in our early 20s , he had always been very clear what he would do if he was in a situation like this .
In fact , in the film my daughter says that she remembered from childhood her daddy saying that if he ever had a fatal disease and he felt he needed to go quickly , he wanted the kids to take him to Amsterdam for a night of fun and then he wanted to end his life the next day .
So , in his mind he always had this travelling to Amsterdam sort of thing going on , but when he investigated it he found that it was not possible because he was not a Dutch citizen .
Given those two facts that I had known about him for decades , it was not at all a shock to me when he had to contact Dignitas .
He would have waited longer had he had a prescription sitting by his bedside that he could use when he needed to but , because we are not at that point yet , he had to make the decision sooner than he would have liked .
After Craig set his appointment with Dignitas , they asked him if he might be interested in speaking to John Zaritsky , who had been in contact with Dignitas for about a year .
" They said , ' We have this person that has a real interest in this subject .
We feel okay about him and he is looking for someone to film at the end .
Are you okay about it ? '
And Craig said yes .
John travelled to Harrogate and he interviewed Craig four or five days before he travelled to Switzerland .
When I first saw John Zaritsky 's film , it was what I expected it would be , and what I think Craig would have hoped it would be .
I was very happy with it .
I have been to screenings in Amsterdam , Toronto and Vancouver , and I have taken questions from the audience .
The most negative reaction I have had was from one person when it was shown one time in the US at a film festival .
Most of the time , older people are very understanding .
Younger people will say things like , " the medical profession could have taken care of him " , but I think that is just youth and inexperience talking .
When you look at the fine points of MND , most people might die peacefully – but Craig 's fear was of being one of the ones who was n't in the " most " category , and that he would get to the point where he could n't do anything about it .
That horrified him .
* The programme is to be broadcast at 9 pm on Sky Real Lives .
During some of my skeptical lectures I flash a picture of a familiar movie star on the screen for a fraction of a second to demonstrate that most people can recognize the person , out of the millions they have ever seen , even after such a brief exposure .
It ’s a quick way to demonstrate the power of our face - recognition ability , which still outstrips that of supercomputers .
I use it to make the point that our brains are exceptional at pattern recognition , which also helps us understand one of our major cognitive weaknesses – hyperactive pattern recognition , or seeing patterns where they do not really exist .
Neuroscientists are also interested in face - recognition , and other pattern - recognition , that occurs in the human brain .
R. Quian Quiroga from the University of Leicester has published a number of studies exploring this ability .
His latest research reveals what the press has dubbed “ The Jennifer Aniston neuron . ” Quiroga recorded the activity in the visual cortex of using micro-electrodes of subjects viewing the faces of familiar stars , like Aniston , Tom Cruise or Halle Berry .
He found that each familiar face seems to be encoded in a single neuron .
This finding is a bit surprising as it was previously thought that visual memories such as this would be stored in a network of neurons .
Rather , our brains assign a single neuron to remember a single familiar face , and that neuron will fire whenever that face is viewed – in any condition and from any angle .
Previous research from Quiroga looking at medial temporal lobe responses to familiar faces and object found that the response of the memory neuron is an all - or - none response , and that it can be fired even by stimulation as brief as 33 miliseconds ( thousandths of a second ) .
This all - or - nothing finding is not surprising at all – the nervous system generally functions that way .
You cannot partially fire a neuron ( although the rate at which a neuron fires can alter ) .
It also matches our common subjective experience , when trying to recognize someone the answer may seem to just click into place – recognition comes suddenly with all the attendant information in tow .
How does a single neuron store so much information ?
Well , those single neurons do not exist in isolation – on average they make over a thousand synapses ( connections ) with other neurons .
Those synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory , and they can vary in strength .
So while a single neuron may be the location where the memory of a specific face , for example , is stored , the abstract information about that face is likely stored in the pattern of synapses made by that neuron .
Individual neurons may be part of many such groupings , reflecting the brain ’s massively parrallel structure .
This also explains the brain ’s pattern recognition ability , as overlapping networks of neurons will allow one image to remind us of another image because they share neurons .
Understanding the role of these single master neurons , acting like the “ address ” of a memory , is an important incremental step in our progressive understanding of how the brain works .
This research also shows that our technology is starting to get down to the resolution , both in time and space , at which the brain is functioning .
At least we are getting down to the single neuron level .
There is still a finer level of detail in all the synapses being made by those neurons .

Arctic Update
New and improved old memes
2008 will probably be 10th Hottest year since 1880 .
Of course that is not how the Guardian reported it , they said “ 2008 will be coolest year of the decade “ , but in this case those are the same thing .
Already the Deniers are spreading the “ coolest of the decade ” ( ie ‘ Climate change has ended ‘ ) meme , a classic example of how the Deniers want you to look at the data , but not too closely .
Three things they do NOT want you to look at in this case :
1 ) Obviously they do n’t want you to look at the past 130 years where it is quite clear it ’s still pretty freaking hot .
2 ) As discussed in the last blog post ( and before ) , they do not want you to look at how the steady increase in temperature is made up of new record highs followed by short cooler periods ;
3 ) They absolutely do NOT want you to look at the huge difference between where the global temperature anomaly is , and where it would be if we were not experiencing anthropogenic climate change .
Since the El Niño- Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) is in the cool La Nina phase ( and here ) and Solar activity has been at a minimum we should actually be in a cool period with very low temperatures globally , not near record hot .
I have no idea how low the anomaly ‘ should be ’ naturally , but almost definitely 0.0 to - 0.5 somewhere .
Regardless of the facts we can expect the Denialosphere to continue spinning this as further “ proof ” that the climate change that is n’t happening has ended , or incoherence to that effect .
Sea Levels
Of course Deniers are always trying to spin short term fluctuations as significant even the absurdity of it is apparent in the material they present .
“ Watts Up WithThat ” give ’s us “ Satellite derived sea level updated - short term trend has been shrinking since 2005 . “
Strictly speaking that title is true .
Equally accurate titles would have been “ Satellite derived sea level updated – normal variation in rising trend as expected ” , or perhaps “ Trivial fluctuations that mean nothing continue . ”
If anything his “ shrinking trend ” is less significant than the ones 1994 - 1997 and late 1998 to 2001 and they had no influence on the real trend , as anyone can see by just looking at the graph .
Unfortunately Watts is probably correct in thinking that by giving it the headline that he did and drawing peoples attention only to the 2005 - present fluctuation , most will leave with the impression that there has been some sort of reversal in the long term trend .
Climate Models
I expect that the “ Models are Flawed ” meme is going to take new force thanks to an unfortunate interview of Lenny Smith by Fred Pearce in New Scientist .
“ Are climate scientists overselling their models ? ” is a perfectly legitimate question to ask , and to publish on .
However , it seems to me that the rather informal dialogue lends itself to significant abuse .
Initially Smith is not talking about the models themselves so much as the public perception of what the models can and ca n’t do .
If I am reading it correctly his critique is not about the models accuracy , but rather their precision .
I think most people treat the two terms as near synonyms and muddle their meaning , but the difference is critical .
For example , if I say the Sun is about 149 million kilometers from Earth I am being accurate , but imprecise .
If I say it is exactly 149,141,592.65358979323846 million meters from Earth I am being very precise , but completely inaccurate .
Not that I disagree with Smith .
He is absolutely right in stating “ Effective application of climate science hinges on clear communication of which results we believe are robust and which are not ” , and that the “ … future warming could be greater or less than what is suggested by the diversity between models in the report . ”
I just think we need to bookmark that latter quote when this is inevitably cited as an ‘ admission that the models are nonsense ’ .
UPDATE : Daily Mail right on cue “ ‘ Climate change forecasters do not know how global warming will affect the world , ’ top physicist claims . ”
Do n’t these people have editors ?

Which is a segue to some very bad news about the Arctic , viz confirmation of the continued ice loss , and in a different study , what appears to be a fundamental change in the winds and currents which is accelerating ice loss .
The paper in the Geophysical Research Letters is reported in Spiegel International as “ Point of No Return for the Arctic Climate ? ”
A bleak picture indeed – do n’t forget to help turn that around by posting and sharing the debunks I mention here .
Thanks .

The major drawback to Facebook Connect is that the social data gathered in these transactions all gets fed back into Facebook .
By implementing Facebook Connect , a site owner is agreeing to share any data it collects about users who log in using the system with Facebook -- and Facebook alone .
Users get the benefit of carrying all that Facebook friend data with them , but they can't use it anywhere else .
If they want to broadcast their activities on Digg through some other means , like a Blogger blog , they 're on their own .
The battle lines have been forming gradually over the past two years , but now 2009 seems poised to become the Year of the Identity Wars .
For all of you social - network users out there , here 's the deal .
Many of us share the experience of first having , say , a MySpace account , only a few months later to create a Facebook account , and maybe again a few months later creating a Twitter or Digg account , etc .
And whenever we 're surfing the Web and want to leave comments or buy products on other sites , we have to create new accounts for them as well .
Is n't re-entering our personal information and having to re-discover our " friends " a major pain in the rear - end ?
This is the problem that social media companies are desperate to solve .
What they all want to do is be able to say to people : create a profile and " friend " network with us , and you 'll be able to use that information to login anywhere on the internet ; bringing your " friends " , your one username / password combination , and ( ideally ) your purchase history and credit card information with you everywhere you go .
Rather than having several cyber identities , you 'll have only one , housed with us , and you 'll never need another again .
This utopian vision is closer than you think .
The technology is already here , and the major companies already all have services designed to do exactly this .
It 's just a question of which will be the first to reach a tipping point of users adopting their service over that of their rivals .
On one side of the battle is the social media powerhouse Facebook .
Its service , Facebook Connect , lets users participate on other websites , like Digg and CNET , using their Facebook IDs .
The user also gets the option of re-broadcasting whatever they do on the third - party site on their News Feed within Facebook .
The user can also match existing friend relationships on Facebook with those on the third - party site .
On the other side of the battle is , basically , everyone else .
Because Facebook is such a gargantuan foe , the field has teamed up and are all backing a service known as OpenID .
Rivals such as Google Friend Connect MySpace Data Availability , Yahoo , AIM , EBay , and more have all adopted OpenID in the hopes that it will become more universal .
There is a key difference in the battle between Facebook vs.
The World : Facebook is one social network , while OpenID , led by Google Friend Connect , can be used by any site , service or social network that uses OpenID for identification .
In other words , Facebook Connect is completely useless to anyone who does n't have a Facebook account , whereas OpenID can be made useful regardless of whether you have your account with Google , AOL , Yahoo , MySpace , etc .
How much this will matter is the million - dollar question .
This battle will also pit two competing ideologies against one another : that of the relative merits between proprietary vs. open source systems .
Facebook Connect is proprietary - meaning it 's privately owned by one entity and therefore closed to everyone without express permission - while OpenID is based on open source technologies that can be shared and used by all .
The casual user probably could n't care less , however the community of web developers has been anxiously awaiting a fight like this for years , and the result will be sure to have serious consequences on business models in the foreseeable future .
All that said , my ( ahem ! ) expert analysis leads me to believe that OpenID is definitely the better way to go from a developer perspective .
It will allow programmers to more easily innovate fresh ideas while ordinary users will probably find it more helpful in their day - to - day cyber lives .
However , the non-developer ( a.k.a. - " normal human being " ) in me knows just how ubiquitous Facebook is and how devoted is its following .
Despite the technical advantages of OpenID , it 's going to be pretty hard to overcome the " human advantages " of Facebook .
But it should be fun to watch the Identity Wars play out , regardless .
Shares on Wall Street entered positive territory this afternoon , helping the London stockmarket recover from heavy losses racked up earlier in the day .
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 162 points to 8541 by 5.30 pm , up nearly 2 % , after falling earlier .
In London , the FTSE 100 index closed down 30.77 points at 3862.59 , a fall of 0.79 % .
During morning trading , the FTSE 100 fell by more than 5 % , or 218 points , to 3665.21 , the lowest level it has reached in recent weeks , with the prospect of a deep worldwide recession continuing to haunt investors .
Stockmarkets in the rest of Europe also recovered after Wall Street went up , with Germany 's Dax rising 38.97 points to 4334.64 , a 0.9 % increase .
France 's CAC clawed back some losses but was still down 126.44 points at 3067.35 , a fall of nearly 4 % .
Banks Standard Chartered and HSBC were hit today on fears that emerging markets are becoming the latest victims of the ongoing crisis .
Standard Chartered was the biggest loser on the FTSE 100 , falling by more than 10 % .
HSBC was down more than 10 % in early trading and closed at 663 p , 4.7 % lower .
Mining companies also suffered sharp falls .
On the currency markets , sterling fell almost six cents against the dollar to $ 1.5299 at one stage , close to the six - year low set last Friday when official data showed the economy shrinking much faster than expected .
This heightened expectations of further interest rate cuts from the Bank of England in an attempt to stimulate the economy .
The dollar and the yen rallied as investors shunned risky investments and sought shelter in those currencies .
Experts are ruling out a sustained stockmarket rally before 2009 .
Asian markets saw another day of panic selling , with Japanese stocks hitting a 26 - year low .
On Friday , the FTSE 100 crashed by 9 % at one stage , closing 5 % lower .
It remains to be seen whether today 's rally on Wall Street is repeated across the rest of the world tomorrow – the 79th anniversary of the Black Monday crash on Wall Street .
" Confidence is at zero level and sentiment is on its knees , " said David Buik of BGC Partners .
" To look for a rally in stockmarkets would be unrealistic before Christmas .
However , to have some stability for two or three days without the market falling out of bed would be a huge help . "
Jeremy Batstone - Carr , of stockbroking firm Charles Stanley , warned that some companies had still not fully recognised how the global slowdown would hit them .
" A western recession is morphing into a global recession .
On a corporate level , companies are now waking up to the fact that this could be a pretty prolonged period of recession , " he said .
The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut the cost of borrowing later this week , but this did not prevent markets in France and Germany falling sharply this morning .
" If the Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter point , then it will make absolutely no difference to the markets as it is fully priced in , " said Batstone - Carr .
" The only way that central banks can make a difference with rate cuts is to go bigger than expected . "
Asian crash
As the current crisis sparked by the failure of Lehman Brothers entered a seventh week , Japan 's Nikkei index fell 6.4 % to its lowest level since 1982 , extending its recent slump .
It has now lost 20 % of its value in the last week .
Hong Kong also saw shares routed , with the Hang Seng index plunging 12 % – its biggest daily fall since 1997 .
And the Chinese stockmarket tumbled more than 6 % , hitting its lowest level since September 2006 , bringing more pain to small investors who have watched the Shanghai Composite index fall 70 % from last year 's peak .
India 's stock market fell by 8 % .
The latest sharp falls , following last week 's heavy losses , showed that investors have little confidence that the world 's leaders can stave off a painful economic contraction .
In Japan , Canon became the latest blue - chip company to slash its profit forecasts .
It blamed the strength of the yen , which has pushed up the cost of its exports overseas .
The soaring yen is such a concern that the G7 group of industrialised nations expressed concern over its " volatility " , but this failed to stop the currency strengthening again .
The continuing turmoil in the financial markets has left many smaller countries facing a cash squeeze .
The International Monetary Fund is drawing up emergency plans for a new short - term loan facility to help these economies , and Ukraine and Hungary both accepted loans from the IMF yesterday .
And in Belgium , bank KBC received a € 3.5 bn ( £ 2.8 bn ) government bail - out after its share price collapsed .
Before today , KBC was the only Belgian bank to have resisted state help .
There ’s a fascinating comparison to be made between computer scientists and libertarians .
It is pretty old , originally having been posted to libernet in 1992 by Stuart Reges , but it remains very much worth reading and digesting .
It explains a lot about how libertarians argue , and why the internet seems to be so libertarian .
The piece was reposted here .
Its original title appears to be Libertarian IQ .
I ’ll repost it at the end if you prefer your reading in something more colourful than 72 - column monospaced text .
Some highlights :
I think most people find this odd about libertarians .
They understand how an economist might be able to predict the effect of a certain law on the economy or how a social scientist might be able to predict how drug legalization might affect the ghettos , but they do n’t understand how somebody could predict all of these things , especially someone who has no formal training .
Libertarians , on the other hand , do n’t seem to understand how someone could fail to have such a model of interaction …
The nonlibertarians have no comprehensive model of interaction , and as a result , they ca n’t communicate in a meaningful way with those who do .
Their attention is always focused on misleading superficial problems rather than on the underlying causes of such problems .
Just as programmers have a model of computation , libertarians have what I call a model of interaction .
Just as a programmer can “ play computer ” by simulating how specific lines of code will change program state , a libertarian can “ play society ” by simulating how specific actions will change societal state .
The libertarian model of interaction cuts across economic , political , cultural , and social issues .
For just about any given law , for example , a libertarian can tell you exactly how such a law will affect society ( minimum wage laws create unemployment by setting a lower - bound on entry - level wages , drug prohibition artificially inflates drug prices which leads to violent turf wars , etc. ) .
As another example , for any given social goal , a libertarian will be able to tell you the problems generated by having government try to achieve that goal and will tell you how such a goal can be achieved in a libertarian society .
I believe this is qualitatively different from other predictive models because of the breadth of the model and the focus on transitions ( both of which are also true of programming ) .
On newsgroups I often see questions … [ that ] … libertarians almost always quickly answer by saying , “ I ’ll tell you exactly what would happen … ”
And , surprisingly , the libertarians tend to give the same answer in most cases .

Libertarian IQ
I ’m finally making good on my promise to post my “ wild speculations ” about Computer Science IQ and Libertarian inclination .
First let me give some background on CS IQ .
I have taught at least 5,000 students how to program , which has given me a strong set of hunches about what goes on in their heads .
But the most useful source of information came from my work as Chief Reader for the Advanced Placement Exam in Computer Science .
AP programs allow high school students to take college - level courses at their high schools and take a test that allows them to receive placement and usually credit for their work .
As with all AP exams , the AP / CS Exam is divided into two parts : multiple - choice and free - response .
In the free - response section , students hand - write solutions to problems .
This has always been considered an integral part of the AP program because of the ( at least perceived ) limitations of multiple - choice tests .
The AP / CS exam had 50 multiple - choice and 5 free - response questions .
The free - response questions were all of the form , “ Write a piece of code that does the following … ”
Obviously , the hand - written solutions need to be graded by real people .
Every year about 60 CS teachers ( called “ readers ” ) get together for 6 days to grade 10,000 exams .
As Chief Reader , I was responsible for choosing the 60 teachers , managing their efforts for those 6 days , and setting the ultimate distribution of AP grades .
In 1988 I made AP history by giving the all - time worst set of AP grades ever given out ( I failed almost half of them ) .
As a result , ETS approved a request they had never approved before .
They gave me a diskette ( actually 2 ) with the raw scores for all 10,000 candidates so that I could “ study ” it .
My undergraduate degree is in math with a statistics specialization , so I ’m the kind of person who likes to play with data .
One of the things I looked at was the set of correlations between various multiple - choice questions A high correlation between 2 test items indicates that candidates performed similarly on those items ( i.e. , those who got one right tended to get the other right and those who got one wrong tended to get the other wrong ) .
I expected to find either virtually no correlations , because there was little repetition on the test , or clusters of correlations .
If you were to test people on math , for example , you might find that arithmetic questions correlated highly with arithmetic questions , algebra questions correlated highly with algebra questions , geometry questions with geometry questions , and so on .
I expected a similar pattern based on various programming constructs / skills .
What I found was highly puzzling .
Five multiple - choice questions were each correlated with over a dozen other questions and I found virtually no other correlations at all .
But there was no pattern to the correlations for these five .
Let me describe the grandaddy as an example .
One had more correlations than any other and I nicknamed it the “ grandaddy . ”
It was highly correlated with 25 other questions , yet the topic that it tested had nothing to do with the topics covered by these other questions .
When I looked at correlations between multiple - choice and free - response , I became even more puzzled .
There was definitely repetition between the two halves of the test .
For example , we had a free - response question about a technique called recursion and we also had several recursion multiple - choice questions .
So were the multiple - choice recursion questions the most highly correlated with the recursion free - response question ?
Nope .
The grandaddy was !
Even though the grandaddy had nothing to do with the topics being tested in ANY of the five free - response items , it was the # 1 correlated question for 4 of the 5 and was # 2 for the fifth .
Furthermore , the group of five questions mentioned above were in all cases among the top 6 correlated multiple - choice questions for each of the free - response items , and usually they were the top five .
Either I stumbled upon some kind of statistical fluke , or there was something special about these 5 multiple - choice questions .
Flukes like this are highly unlikely with a pool of 10,000 .
Also , as I studied other aspects of the data , I was surprised to find these same five questions appear in the answer to two completely unrelated questions I pursued .
I wo n’t bore you with the details , but suffice it to say that I found even more evidence that these questions were more “ central ” than the others .
My theory is that these 5 are CS IQ questions ( particularly the grandaddy ) .
I presented my data to CS faculty and students at Stanford , and they seemed to agree with my conclusion .
They also gave me some interesting feedback about the five questions themselves .
Everyone who looked at them agreed that they “ felt ” like the kind of questions that would distinguish a computer scientist .
One faculty member described them as “ the intersection of logic and programming . ”
A more apt description given by another faculty member who had taught intro courses himself was that each question required a model of computation , and in his experience , this was the prime distinction he had seen between those who could program and those who could not .
It was also obvious from the questions that logic and recursion are highly related to CS IQ .
Let me say a bit more about what I mean by a model of computation .
Programmers are able to “ play computer ” in their head ( sometimes requiring the aid of a scrap of paper ) .
In other words , we have a model of exactly what the computer does when it executes each statement .
For any given program , we have a mental picture of the state the computer is in when execution begins , and we can simulate how that state changes as each statement executes .
This is rather abstract , so let me try to explain by giving a specific example .
Let me tell a story that is typical of those I heard from the TAs who worked for me at the computing center .
A student comes up to the TA and says that his program is n’t working .
The numbers it prints out are all wrong .
The first number is twice what it should be , the second is four times what it should be , and the others are even more screwed up .
The student says , “ Maybe I should divide this first number by 2 and the second by 4 .
That would help , right ? ”
No , it would n’t , the TA explains .
The problem is not in the printing routine .
The problem is with the calculating routine .
Modifying the printing routine will produce a program with TWO problems rather than one .
But the student does n’t understand this ( I claim because he is n’t reasoning about what state his program should be in as it executes various parts of the program ) .
The student goes away to work on it .
He comes back half an hour later and says he ’s closer , but the numbers are still wrong .
The TA looks at it and seems puzzled by the fact that the first two numbers are right but the others do n’t match .
“ Oh , ” the student explains , “ I added those 2 lines of code you suggested to divide the first number by 2 and the second by 4 . ”
The TA points out that he did n’t suggest the lines of code , but the student just shrugs his shoulders and says , “ Whatever . ”
The TA endeavors to get the student to think about what change is necessary , but the student obviously does n’t get it .
The TA has a long line of similarly confused students , so he suggests that the student go sit down and think through his calculating procedure and exactly what it ’s supposed to be doing .
Half an hour later the student is back again .
“ While I was looking over the calculating procedure , a friend of mine who is a CS major came by and said my loop was all screwed up .
I fixed it the way he suggested , but the numbers are still wrong .
The first number is half what it ’s supposed to be and the second is one - fourth what it ’s supposed to be , but the others are okay . ”
The TA considers for a moment whether he should bring up the student on an honor code charge for receiving inappropriate help , but decides that it is n’t worth it ( especially since that line of similarly confused students is now twice what it was an hour ago ) .
He asks the student whether he still has those lines of code in the printing routine that divide by 2 and 4 before printing .
“ Oh yeah , ” the student exclaims , “ those lines you said I should put in .
That must be the problem . ”
The TA once more politely points out that he did n’t suggest the two lines of code , but the student again shrugs and says , “ Whatever .
Thanks , dude ! ”
The student in my hypothetical story displays the classic mistake of treating symptoms rather than solving problems .
The student knows the program does n’t work , so he tries to find a way to make it appear to work a little better .
As in my example , without a proper model of computation , such fixes are likely to make the program worse rather than better .
How can the student fix his program if he can’t reason in his head about what it is supposed to do versus what it is actually doing ?
He can ’t .
But for many people ( I dare say for most people ) , they simply do not think of their program the way a programmer does .
As a result , it is impossible for a programmer to explain to such a person how to find the problem in their code .
I ’m convinced after years of patiently trying to explain this to novices that most are just not used to thinking this way while a small group of other students seem to think this way automatically , without me having to explain it to them .
Let me try to start relating this to libertarian philosophy .
Just as programmers have a model of computation , libertarians have what I call a model of interaction .
Just as a programmer can “ play computer ” by simulating how specific lines of code will change program state , a libertarian can “ play society ” by simulating how specific actions will change societal state .
The libertarian model of interaction cuts across economic , political , cultural , and social issues .
For just about any given law , for example , a libertarian can tell you exactly how such a law will affect society ( minimum wage laws create unemployment by setting a lower - bound on entry - level wages , drug prohibition artificially inflates drug prices which leads to violent turf wars , etc. ) .
As another example , for any given social goal , a libertarian will be able to tell you the problems generated by having government try to achieve that goal and will tell you how such a goal can be achieved in a libertarian society .
I believe this is qualitatively different from other predictive models because of the breadth of the model and the focus on transitions ( both of which are also true of programming ) .
On newsgroups I often see questions like :
If we were in situation A and government took action X , what would happen ?
If we were in situation B and a corporation took action Y , what would happen ?
If we were in situation C and an individual took action Z , what would happen ?
Libertarians almost always quickly answer by saying , “ I ’ll tell you exactly what would happen … ”
And , surprisingly , the libertarians tend to give the same answer in most cases .
I think most people find this odd about libertarians .
They understand how an economist might be able to predict the effect of a certain law on the economy or how a social scientist might be able to predict how drug legalization might affect the ghettos , but they do n’t understand how somebody could predict all of these things , especially someone who has no formal training .
Libertarians , on the other hand , do n’t seem to understand how someone could fail to have such a model of interaction ( it would almost be like having a Supreme Court judge who had never thought about Roe vs. Wade – ha ha ) .
The nonlibertarians have no comprehensive model of interaction , and as a result , they ca n’t communicate in a meaningful way with those who do .
Their attention is always focused on misleading superficial problems rather than on the underlying causes of such problems .
When I observe how most people approach politics , it reminds me of the way my hypothetical student approached his program .
A person notices that some people are making $ 1 and $ 2 an hour and are having difficulty managing financially on such a sum .
This seems bad and they want to fix it .
But they have no model of interaction that would allow them to reason about what might cause such a result .
So they decide to pass a minimum wage law so the problem will go away .
And it does ( apparently ) .
There are n’t any poor people making $ 1 and $ 2 an hour anymore .
But there are suddenly lots of unemployed people who have to live off welfare ( a new problem ) .
Does the person make the connection and realize that they caused this problem ?
Not without a model of interaction .
So instead they say we have to fix the unemployment problem .
And then we have to fix the new problems generated by the fix to the unemployment problem .
And then we have to fix the new problems generated by the new fixes .
And so on .
If you suggest that eliminating minimum wage laws and the government interference that made those people so poor in the first place would be a better solution , they look at you incredulously and say you must be crazy .
This is just like the situation with my TA and the student who had added 2 lines of code to make the numbers print out correctly ( “ Are you crazy ?
Why would I delete those lines of code when the numbers would then print out incorrectly ? ”
Because the problem is elsewhere , and that ’s the problem you should be addressing , but that ’s difficult to explain to someone who does n’t have a model of how his program works ) .
Seriously , I think the credibility gap that existed between my TAs and the students who sought their help is similar to the credibility gap between libertarians and nonlibertarians .
And I also suspect that the gap will continue to exist unless and until those other people learn to think in terms of a comprehensive model of interaction .
As usual , I ’ve talked more than I should .
I ’m not sure that I ’ve made my point very well , but I think it would require a great deal more time for me to make this more comprehensible .
I suspect that the programmers who read this message will understand me , but the others might not .
Anyway , I think I ’ll leave it mostly at that , but add a few related comments .
Don Knuth , who wrote the CS equivalent of The Bible , says that the thing that most distinguishes computer scientists is their ability to “ jump levels of abstraction . ”
I mentioned that programmers can “ play computer , ” but what good is that when you are working on a 100,000 - line program ?
It would take so long to simulate the thousands of instructions and the vast amount of data that you ’d never get anywhere .
But programmers get around this by using abstraction .
A programmer can reason about the top - level execution of a program , for example ( a macro - view , if you will ) .
But when necessary , he can focus in on a program module , or a single subprogram , or a single loop , or a single line of code ( more and more of a micro- view ) .
A programmer can even , when necessary , reason about how that line of code will be translated into machine - code and even what changes are likely to happen to the physical hardware involved .
A programmer understands a program at all of these levels of abstraction .
It is essential that he can jump quickly between levels , and relate information at one level to information at another level , if he is to be able to eliminate problems in his code .
I think libertarians also exhibit this behavior .
A libertarian can comfortably tell you how governments interact with each other , how governments interact with corporations , how corporations interact with each other , how corporations treat individuals , and how individuals interact with each other .
It would be impossible to have a model of interaction without these levels of abstraction and without being able to jump between levels when necessary ( e.g. , saying , “ If government A passes law X , that is likely to pressure government B to also pass law X , which causes the corporations controlled by government B to take action Y , which causes individuals working for those corporations to take actions Z and W. ” )
Another link between libertarianism and programming is that the principles of good programming are closely related to libertarian ideals .
We call it “ top - down programming , ” but anyone who has studied structured programming knows that “ central planning ” is quite different .
A well - structured programming will have high - level modules that are loosely - coupled ( i.e. , as independent as possible ) .
This means that at the highest level , a program should minimize tasks so that it performs only those tasks that are essential .
In other words , “ that program is best that programs least . ”
This is the principle of decentralized government .
As another example , the structured programming concept of information hiding is really the libertarian belief in privacy .
Information hiding says that the internal details of a subprogram should be independent from other subprograms ( in fact , the goal is to have them INVISIBLE to other subprograms ) .
This is like saying that the private choices made by one individual that affect only that individual should not be influenced by other individuals ( and would ideally be kept entirely confidential ) .
I mentioned the importance of logic to CS IQ .
I believe it is equally important to libertarian philosophy .
From my observation , libertarians tend to think that all political questions can be answered with an almost mathematical certitude .
There is no such thing as “ a friendly disagreement ” in mathematics .
If two mathematicians disagree , then one is mistaken .
Similarly , if two libertarians disagree , each asserts that the other is either operating from a false assumption or has a flaw in his logic .
I think nonlibertarians are really turned off by this , particularly because it comes across as obnoxious and egotistical .
But libertarians seem to thrive on it .
The community has a kind of intellectual - warrior ethos .
The Bush administration chalked up another in a growing list of environmentally ignorant midnight rulings by “ clarifying ” a rule that could allow the approval of several new coal - fired power plants .
Instead of decommissioning America ’s fleet of coal - fired power plants and making concerted efforts to prevent the construction of any new ones , the United States Government is finding ways to make sure plenty more can be built .
In a memo issued by EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson on Thursday , the Bush administration has “ clarified ” a rule prohibiting any federal agency from denying an operating permit to new or significantly remodeled power plants based on their carbon dioxide emissions .
[ social_buttons ]
Thursday ’s ruling stems back to a 2007 case in Utah when the Sierra Club sued EPA because they granted an operating permit to a new coal - fired power plant without taking the new plant ’s carbon dioxide emissions into account .
In November of this year , the appeals board with legal jurisdiction in the case said the EPA ’s rule was unclear .
Thursday ’s memo from Johnson was an effort to make the administration ’s position clear ; they have no intention of treating carbon dioxide as a pollutant , despite being told by the Supreme Court they needed to do just that .
But it ’s not just the highest court in the land the EPA is blowing off .
In the memo , Johnson did n’t seem phased by the rising tide of public opinion regarding climate change either .
He wrote , “ The current concerns over global climate change should not drive E.P.A. into adopting an unworkable policy of requiring emission controls . ”
Vickie Patton , deputy general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund , told The New York Times that as much as 8,000 megawatts of new coal - fired power plants could win swifter approval as a result of the ruling .
Some of the power plants which may be allowed to move ahead blissfully ignorant of the position taken by the Supreme Court include a proposed $ 1.25 billion plant , called Pee Dee , that a South Carolina utility , is seeking to build ; a project in Rogers City , Mich. , that the Wolverine Power Cooperative Electric is seeking to build ; and another project in Utah , a small plant sought by Consolidated Energy in Davis County .
But the big question is whether any of these plants will be able to squeeze through the rest of the permitting process before president - elect Barack Obama ’s administration moves in and takes a much tougher position on carbon dioxide .
Obama has said he would direct his administration to regulate carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act .

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) knows that most of the 1.9 million tons ( 1.7 million metric tons ) of discarded cell phones , computers and televisions , among other electronic goods , went into landfills , because those are the agency 's own figures .
The EPA also knows that this so - called e-waste contains cadmium , mercury and other toxic substances , and it is responsible for making sure that lead - laden monitors and television sets with cathode - ray tubes ( CRT ) are disposed of properly and the parts recycled .
But congressional investigators charge that the EPA has failed to even attempt to clean up the mess — or keep it in check .
The agency has " no plans and no timetable for developing the basic components of an enforcement strategy , " concludes a report released this week by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , Congress 's investigative arm .
GAO official John Stephenson testified at a House hearing yesterday that his investigators had posed as would - be buyers of CRT waste in Hong Kong , India , Pakistan , Singapore and Vietnam and found at least 43 recyclers willing to export the toxic e-waste from the U.S. in direct violation of EPA regulations .
In addition , unlike the European Union ( E.U. ) , the EPA has no regulations concerning the disposal of other types of used electronic devices , despite their dangers .
" This is a failure to enforce even the weak regulations they have , " says Democratic Rep. Gene Green of Houston , who introduced a House resolution calling for a ban on the export of e-waste .
( Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D–Ohio ) introduced a similar measure in the Senate . )
" EPA is sometimes not as interested in doing what statutorily they should be . "
According to the report , the EPA told GAO officials that it prefers " nonregulatory , voluntary approaches " to the growing e-waste problem .
" EPA currently has 10 ongoing investigations and the [ regional offices ] plan to conduct inspections at electronic waste collection and recycling facilities this year , " wrote assistant administrators Granta Nakayama and Susan Parker Bodine in response .
When such e-waste is exported to places such as Guiyu in China , it ends up in vast recycling centers where laborers earn a pittance smashing , cracking , melting and cooking old electronic goods to extract the valuable materials they hold , ranging from gold to plastics .
But burning off wire insulation , cooking circuit boards and using acid to extract gold all take a health and environmental toll .
A study published last year in Environmental Health Perspectives found that children in Guiyu had lead levels 50 percent higher than those in surrounding villages and 50 percent higher than safety limits set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Lead is known to cause brain damage .
That toll is not confined to China .
According to a recent study by chemist Jeffrey Weidenhamer of Ashland University in Ohio , the lead in recalled children 's jewelry bears a proportion of tin and copper that are " consistent with an origin from recovered solder . "
And U.S. prisoners are often exposed to the same conditions working at disassembling e-waste for the government - owned corporation UNICOR Federal Prison Industries in Washington , D.C. " I visited a federal prison in California and I saw prisoners with hammers smashing apart CRT monitors , " says Ted Smith , chairman of the advocacy group Electronics TakeBack Coalition .
" There are prisoners who have been made ill and a number of prison guards as well . "
As a result , at least nine states , including California , Maine and Maryland , have implemented their own controls on the proper handling of e-waste , and the electronics industry has voluntary guidelines to reduce it .
" We have a national system to collect and recycle all products we put our name on , " says Mark Small , vice president for corporate environment , safety and health at Sony Corporation of America , which has partnered with Waste Management , Inc. , to recycle e-waste .
" We have eliminated probably 99 percent–plus of the toxic materials in our products .
We use lead - free solder and changed the design of TVs from CRT to new [ liquid - crystal displays ] . "
Other companies , such as Apple , Dell and Hewlett - Packard have similar programs , and Samsung is set to launch a free take - back program for all their electronic products , including old televisions , on October 1 .
The E.U. in 2002 imposed a comprehensive ban on the export of any e-waste , along with a requirement for producers of such electronic goods to take back used electronics .
Violators face fines up to 1.2 million euros or imprisonment .
In contrast , the EPA to date has imposed only one fine of $ 32,500 on a single exporter , according to the GAO report .
But given the difficulty and expense of dealing with e-waste properly , unscrupulous E.U. recyclers have taken to labeling their shipments as used electronics that can be employed in developing countries to bridge the digital divide .
" The containers arriving in ports like Lagos [ Nigeria ] were loaded with 75 percent junk and 25 percent material that could be resold in the marketplace , " Smith says .
" They take that material that was not salable , dump it and burn it . "
He adds : " There are an awful lot of bottom - feeders in this industry . "
But some companies , such as Columbus , Ohio–based Redemtech , have found that coping with the more than three billion electronic devices purchased each year by U.S. companies and consumers can be good business .
" Per weight of e-waste , 90 percent of it is moderately valuable nontoxics like steel , aluminum , plastics , " says Redemtech president , Robert Houghton , which the company handles at one of six plants in North America .
The rest is sent to centralized facilities with the safety equipment to handle toxic materials such as lead .
" If we send 1,000 pounds of toxic - bearing circuit cards , we expect to have 1,000 pounds of materials liberated . "
The volume of e-waste , particularly lead - bearing CRTs , will likely grow exponentially next February , when U.S. television networks switch from analog to digital signals .
And it would appear , based on the GAO report , that EPA is not ready to enforce regulations for the proper handling of such toxic materials .
Further , the liquid - crystal display televisions that are likely to replace them contain mercury in the fluorescent lightbulbs inside them .
" We do n't know how to take out the mercury , let alone deal with it responsibly , " Smith says .
In the future , light - emitting diodes might prove a toxic - free alternative , according to Sony 's Small .
But that would just unleash another onslaught of e-waste if all TV owners were to make the switch again — and much of that would likely end up shipped out of the country .
" Only 5 percent of imports are inspected , " Small notes .
" One can only imagine how many exports are inspected . "
" We can't just ship it overseas any longer and pretend it does n't exist , " says Rep. Mike Thompson ( D–Calif . ) who supports federal e-waste legislation .
" It should be regulated to prevent harm to human health and the environment overseas — and right here in this country . "
COLUMBUS , Ohio 
An Ohio State University academic adviser and a real estate agent held a $ 10 - a - ticket raffle that offered an evening with a prostitute who is also a child sex - abuse caseworker , police said .
Christopher S. Johnson , 33 , an academic adviser at OSU 's School of Nursing , organized the raffle through a Craigslist.com chat board , police said .
Real estate agent Rusty Blades , 42 , held the invitation - only party at his house in October for the participants .
Both Johnson and Blades were charged with promoting prostitution .
A judge set bail Saturday at $ 50,000 for Blades and $ 25,000 for Johnson .
OSU spokesman Jim Lynch said that Johnson was placed on unpaid leave and that the school will investigate whether he improperly used his computer .
Police Detective Jeffrey Ackley identified Vanise Dunn , 31 , as the prostitute involved in the raffle .
She has worked at Franklin County Children Services since 2000 , and court records show she was charged with prostitution Nov. 12 for allegedly soliciting a vice detective .
Her attorney , Scott Kossoudji , declined to comment .
Dunn has been on paid leave since her arrest , said Doris Calloway Moore , spokeswoman for Franklin County Children 's Services .
The agency is looking into whether Dunn violated any of its policies .
A message seeking comment was left Monday with Blades ' attorney Richard Wetzel .
A woman who answered the phone at Johnson 's home said he was not available .

IT ’S 2020 , and we are a decade into a huge experiment in which we are trying to convert our country to a sustainable or “ steady - state ” economy .
We have two guiding principles : we do n’t use natural resources faster than they can be replenished by the planet , and we do n’t deposit wastes faster than they can be absorbed .
In our society , scientists set the rules .
They work out what levels of consumption and emission are sustainable – and if they ’re not sure they work out a cautious estimate .
Then it ’s up to the economists to work out how to achieve those limits , …
Well ... they did trademark it in 1996 .
And they did create a very similar product to what we now call netbooks .
I mean , I hate to be a dick to Gizmodo and all , but I completely see where they are coming from .
Tripling of Heart Failure Hospitalization Rate Coincides With Use of Sunscreen Lotion and Advice to Avoid the Sun
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
DIGG THIS
A dramatic rise in the heart failure hospitalization rate now being reported over the past three decades has coincided with the use of ultraviolet - B blocking sunscreen lotions which inhibit the production of vitamin D in human skin .
The rate of hospitalization for heart failure nearly tripled since 1980 .
The public has been urged to avoid the sun and use sun-blocking agents beginning in 1971 .
A lag period of about a decade is explained by a delay in public adoption in the use of sunscreens .
The use of sunscreen products peaked in 2004 at 72 % of Americans using a sunscreen when going outdoors .
[ Skin & Allergy News July 1 , 2005 ]
A recent Australian study shows a season pattern for heart failure peaking in winter months when vitamin D levels are typically low .
[ Australian New Zealand Journal Public Health 2008 Oct ; 32(5):408—13 ]
Another study conducted by researchers in Austria reveals a 284 % increased risk for heart failure and a 505 % increased risk for sudden - death heart attack among adults with low circulating vitamin D levels ( less than 25 nanomole / liter 25 - OHD test compared to adults with optimal vitamin D levels greater than 75 nanomole / liter 25 - OHD test ) .
[ Journal Clinical Endocrinology Metabolism 2008 Oct ; 93(10 ):3927 — 35 ]
This study suggests a massive public education program be implemented , aimed at senior adults , to promote vitamin D supplementation , particularly during winter months when vitamin D levels are low .
Longjian Liu , MD , PhD , MSc , associate professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics of the Drexel University School of Public Health in Philadelphia , Pa. , reports the number of patients 65 and older who were hospitalized for heart failure increased 131 percent to 807,082 in 2006 , from 348,866 in 1980 .
Nearly 5.3 million Americans live with heart failure and 660,000 new cases are diagnosed each year , generating over $ 34 billion in healthcare costs , according to estimates of the American Heart Association .
Heart failure is an age - related phenomenon .
Patients ages 75 — 84 are twice as likely to be hospitalized for heart failure compared to US adults age 65 — 74 years , while those age 85 or older have four times more risk of hospitalization for heart failure than those ages 65 — 74 .
Due to skin thickening with advancing age , older adults produce less vitamin D from sun exposure compared to younger adults .
[ Hormone Research 1995 ; 43 ( 1—3) :76—9 ]
Dr. Liu urges “ innovative strategies be implemented ” to reduce the number of Americans with heart failure .
Nothing is said of the growing body of evidence linking a shortage of vitamin D with heart failure .
The link between vitamin D deficiency and heart failure is compelling .
Among heart failure patients awaiting a heart transplant , those patients who have higher vitamin D levels are more likely to survive the waiting period prior to organ transplantation .
[ European Journal Heart Failure 2008 Mar ; 10 ( 3):321—7 ]
Heart failure among infants is observed in cases of rickets ( bone weakening ) caused by a lack of vitamin D. [ Heart 2008 May ; 94( 5) :581—4 ]
Heart failure is more prevalent among African Americans who dark skin pigmentation impairs vitamin D synthesis during sun exposure .
[ Translational Research 2006 Dec ; 148(6):301—8 ]
Heart failure is more prevalent among Arabic women and their offspring due to the use of traditional clothing and headwear that blocks sun / skin exposure .
[ European Journal Heart Failure 2006 Nov ; 8( 7):694—6 ]
Bone loss ( osteoporosis ) among postmenopausal women is associated with low vitamin D levels and is more often accompanied by signs of heart failure , particularly among women who are genetically prone to vitamin D insufficiency .
[ Journal Internal Medicine 2003 Apr ; 253(4):439 — 46 ; Journal American College Cardiology 2003 Jan 1;41( 1) :105 — 12 ; American Journal Medicine 1997 Sep ;103( 3) :197— 207 ]
The intravenous administration of the active form of vitamin D ( calcitriol ) reduces the thickening of the heart wall characteristically seen in heart failure patients .
[ American Journal Kidney Diseases 1999 Jan ; 33 ( 1):73 — 81 ]
As early as the 1970s doctors reported " hungry bone " syndrome and heart failure following surgical removal of the parathyroid glands .
[ American Journal Medical Sciences 1976 Jan — Feb ; 271( 1):85 —9 ]
A shortage of vitamin D causes parathyroid glands to shrink .
Adults with heart failure are less likely to be exposed to midday sun .
[ International Journal Vitamin Nutrition Research 2007 Jul ; 77( 4):280—8 ]
Public health authorities are remiss in recommending universal vitamin D testing for all older adults and testing all older adults for vitamin D levels upon hospital admission .
Mass vitamin D supplementation recommended
The widespread deficiency of vitamin D suggests all Americans begin supplementation with vitamin D3 .
Not known to show much interest in preventive medicine , modern medicine continues to drag its feet over the use of vitamin D supplements , a vitamin that was discovered in 1922 .
It is becoming more obvious every day that millions of Americans have died prematurely due to a lack of an inexpensive vitamin .
Concerns of over - dose of vitamin D are largely unfounded given that an hour of total - body midday summer sun exposure in a sunny climate can produce up to 10,000 units of vitamin D without side effect or liver toxicity .
Vitamin D pills avoid concerns over aging and wrinkling of the skin by sunlight .
The National Academy of Sciences inexplicably continues to assert 2000 units of vitamin D is the " safe upper limit " for vitamin D supplementation , an amount of vitamin D equivalent to just 12 minutes of sunning .
Vitamin D researchers now recommend the safe upper limit be established at 10,000 IU ( international units ) [ American Journal Clinical Nutrition 2007 Jan ; 85:6— 18 ] , which represents a 4 - times safety margin since side effects do not begin till 40,000 IU are consumed for many months .
[ American Journal Clinical Nutrition 2001 Feb ; 73:288—94 ]
Sunscreen recommendations misdirected
Regarding skin cancer , the habitual use of sunscreen lotion has been counterproductive .
Sunscreen lotions are designed to block the fast - tanning UV - B rays that produce vitamin D in the skin , while permitting more deeper - penetrating UV - A sun rays to reach the skin .
Only recently has it been recognized that solar UV - A radiation produces mutations and skin cancer in humans .
[ Photochemistry Photobiology 2005 Jan — Feb ; 81:3—8 ]
Sunscreen lotions block production of vitamin D which prevents cancer , while allowing exposure to UV - A rays that promote cancer .
In 1971 , when a campaign to urge Americans to use sunscreen lotions began , mortality due to malignant melanoma was uncommon .
Today , with widespread sunscreen use , mortality due to malignant melanoma has risen to 7000 cases per year .
Sunscreen use in northern climates actually increases the risk for melanoma .

Woman Burns Houseboy�s Penis For Allegedly Stealing N700,000
A housewife , Mrs. Bola Williams , who resides at 11 , Olawoyin Street , Palm Avenue , Mushin , Lagos , has been arrested by the police , for allegedly burning the penis of her houseboy , John , an 18 - year - old Togolese , in a bid to recover her N700,000 allegedly stolen by the teenager .
A housewife , Mrs. Bola Williams , who resides at 11 , Olawoyin Street , Palm Avenue , Mushin , Lagos , has been arrested by the police , for allegedly burning the penis of her houseboy , John , an 18 - year - old Togolese , in a bid to recover her N700,000 allegedly stolen by the teenager .
P.M. News gathered that the victim was tortured for about one week before he escaped , naked .
His hands were reportedly tied behind him while fire was place under his scrotum .
His buttocks and scrotum bore marks of having been scorched by something hot , probably flames from a fire .
An eyewitness , who identified himself as Aina , said he heard the houseboy screaming for help , but could not come to his aid because it was not the first time he was being punished by his mistress .
� It was later discovered that she had tied the boy and was using fire to burn his private part .
When the boy ran out and everyone intervened , she claimed that he stole her money .
� Immediately , we called the Police at Zone D , and the woman was arrested .
The boy was taken to the hospital .�
Commenting on the incident , an occupant of the building , who pleaded anonymity , described Mrs. Williams as a very wicked landlady who has been having a running battle with her tenants .
Majority of residents who spoke with P.M. News on the issue described Mrs. Williams as wealthy , and an impossible person who fights everyone in the area .
By Dave Lindorff
The one thing we are not hearing from Congress or from incoming president Barack Obama in the current economic crisis facing the country are the words “ anti- trust ” and “ public ownership . ”
From the moment the crisis first struck , with the near collapse of AIG , the mantra has been that companies like AIG , Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch , Citibank , etc. -- and more recently General Motors Corp. and Ford - - are “ too big to fail . ”
That is , it is argued that these companies are so huge that if they were to collapse into the rubble they deserve to be , it would damage the nation irreparably .
The question is , if that is genuinely the case , why were they allowed to be that big in the first place , and why are n’t we rethinking that policy ?
It ’s not as though they got that way through organic growth by being successful at what they did .
Hardly .
GM was the quintessential result of a merger of smaller automakers .
Ford grew too , by acquiring the competition , most recently Volvo .
Most , if not all of those acquisitions were first vetted and approved by the Federal Trade Commission and found to be acceptable as a matter of economics and public policy .
In the banking industry , which is regulated , the picture is even worse , with the government first opening the door to the creation of national banking companies , and then routinely approving the gobbling up of one after another regional or even national bank by another .
At some point we reached the point where the giants in the industry — Citibank , JP Morgan Chase , Bank of America , Wells Fargo , etc. — were able to say , when they ran into trouble , that allowing them to fail would have dire consequences for the national economy .
This kind of extortion should never have been allowed to happen .
First of all , the argument for national banks never made sense for ordinary people , and was n’t necessary for large customers either .
Large corporate fundings have always been done by bank consortia , and this could have been accomplished with the nation ’s banking industry fragmented into small state - chartered institutions .
Meanwhile , small businesses and individuals always lose when a bank is national in scale .
It is much more costly to handle the banking business of small enterprises and individual families than it is to handle the business of huge corporate clients , with the result that the major banks have made it costlier and costlier for small customers to do business with them .
The answer is clear .
Bigness is fundamentally bad when it comes to capitalism .
There is a point where any company in any industry becomes too big for it to be socially acceptable .
Big companies not only attempt to behave in a monopolistic fashion by destroying or buying up the competition , both nationally or , as in the case of a retailer like WalMart or a bank like Citibank , locally , using their huge financial power to locally underprice the competition and drive them out of business ( after which they are free to gouge the local customer base ) .
They also ride roughshod over local political interests , demanding tax breaks , zoning waivers , etc .
This being the case , the government should simply not be allowing corporations to achieve such scale and market dominance .
Companies , whether banks , car makers , or media companies , should never be allowed to grow to a point that they become “ too big to fail . ”
If that can be said about any company , whether because of the assets it holds , or because of the number of people it employs , it is time to break it up .
Think of GM .
If GM were ripped up into six or seven competing companies , it is certain that at least one of those smaller entities would be producing electric cars by next year .
The Saturn plant already made one , the Impact , that was wildly popular ( see the excellent documentary “ Who Killed the Electric Car ” ) , and if left to its own devices to sink or swim , could probably be cranking those out in volume for the 2010 model year .
Some companies would certainly fail .
But that ’s what is supposed to happen in a capitalist system .
This piece is not meant to be a paen to capitalism .
But having said that , if you ’re going to have capitalism , which is the ruling ideology here in the US of A , you have to let it function as intended .
As soon as the government comes in and starts encouraging the establishment of monopolies or quasi- monopolies , and preventing the failure of poorly managed enterprises or dying industries , as it is doing in the case of the banking and automotive sectors , it is no longer true capitalism .
That could work , too .
Many democratic countries , including Japan , Sweden , France and Germany , have the concept of shared governance of corporations , in which large corporate entities are partially owned and run by government , and of planned economies , in which certain sectors are deliberately protected and promoted by government policy .
The US has moved in that direction with the investment by the government in nine of the country ’s largest banks , and in discussions to provide $ 25 - 50 billion in financial assistance to the major US auto companies .
But in the US case , the government is studiously avoiding demanding a role in running those companies .
It is by design only a “ passive ” investor .
This is the triumph of ideology over rationality and the public interest .
I recently interviewed a number of investment strategists in the course of working on an article for an investment magazine .
They all had the same advice for worried investors : invest in shares of the “ magic nine ” banks that are recipients of tens of billions of dollars in bail - out money from the federal government .
As they all point out , the government ’s stake in these banks means that they will not be allowed to fail , and moreover , they are in a unique position to use their flush capital reserves to acquire , at fire sale prices , the assets of smaller banks that are being left to sink or swim in the current credit crisis and recession .
That is not a free market .
It ’s a government program to reduce the competition in the banking sector and hand all the business over to a favored few giant banks .
Now that would be okay if the government , in return for its investment , were taking a management role in those favored banks .
But it is not .
Congress , the Bush administration , and , so far at least , the incoming administration of Barack Obama , have not been demanding a management stake in any of the companies that are getting bail - out funding .
If the government takes ownership positions at all , it is taking non-voting shares in those companies , solely in the hope of someday getting some of the invested money back by selling those shares .
This is not just a rip - off of the taxpayer .
It is a craven program to enrich big investors in the bailed - out enterprises , while putting control of the nation ’s economic destiny increasingly into a smaller number of hands of people whose interests are not even aligned with the national intereest ( these are , after all , all transnational corporations only nominally headquartered in the US ) .

Legislation bans nationals from courses and facilities .
The UK and the United States require extra security clearance for Iranians studying nuclear technologies ; this is the first ban .
The Dutch government has enacted legislation barring Iranian nationals from access to courses and facilities related to nuclear technology .
Under the new law , passed on 4 July , Iranians , including those holding dual citizenship in the Netherlands , will be unable to enrol in graduate - level courses involving nuclear and rocket technologies .
These encompass nine subject areas outlined in the legislation , including the technology of reactors for uranium enrichment and the chemistry of rocket fuels .
Some students will be allowed to take these courses with a special government waiver , according to Rob Dekker , a spokesman for the Dutch foreign ministry .
Iranian nationals will also be banned from five nuclear facilities , including those of the Urenco Group , a European company that operates uranium - enrichment plants .
Iran 's uranium - enrichment technology is thought to be based on plans taken by a Pakistani scientist working at Urenco during the early 1970s .
Dekker says the move comes in response to United Nations and European Union resolutions calling for restrictions on Iran 's access to nuclear and weapons - related technology .
The UN Security Council has passed , for example , a resolution halting the transfer of uranium - enrichment technology to Iran .
" We needed to adopt specific sanctions arrangements , " says Dekker .
“ You are banning the enemy of your enemy . ”
But the Dutch law is surprisingly harsh , says Jeffry Lewis , an arms - control expert at the New America Foundation , a think - tank based in Washington DC .
" I do n’t know of any other state that has viewed its obligations in such a broad fashion , " he says .
" [ The legislation ] seems like an awfully crude instrument to me . "
Other countries , including the United Kingdom and the United States , require a special security review for Iranian nationals seeking to study nuclear technologies .
The Dutch legislation is thought to be the first outright ban on courses and facilities .
It is not immediately clear how many students will be affected by the ban .
Mojtaba Sabeghi , a PhD student in computer engineering at Delft University of Technology , says that Iranians have come to the Netherlands in relatively large numbers because the security requirements have been less onerous than those of other Western countries .
His own department , the Faculty of Electrical Engineering , Mathematics and Computer Science , accepted 40 new Iranian students this year , he says .

" I am against Iranian policy and ideology ; that is why I live in the Netherlands , " said one Iranian - born nuclear physicist who asked not to be named .
" You are banning the enemy of your enemy , " he told Nature News .
Dekker insists that most Iranians will be unaffected by the new restrictions .
" It 's not that we 're banning all Iranian students from the Netherlands , " he says .
The law applies " only for very specific fields of science " , agrees Maarten van der Sanden , a spokesman for the Delft University of Technology .
" We hope that all nationalities will still subscribe to our courses . "

No refunds will be given to viewers who voted in Strictly Come Dancing 's semi-final , which was affected by a tie in the scoring on Saturday evening .
Contestants Lisa Snowdon and Rachel Stevens and their partners were given top points by the show 's judges .
But that meant Tom Chambers could not be saved from a dance - off to decide who left the series .
All three qualified .
The voting has been carried forward to next weekend 's final .
" No vote has been disregarded , " a BBC spokesman said .
The corporation has faced criticism from viewers following the incident , with more than 100 calls to the corporation on Saturday evening alone .
They should have worked it out and decided what they were going to about to do about it
Media commentator Steve Hewlett
But while viewers were able to get refunds after broadcaster John Sergeant left the series last month , they will not be able to claim their money back this time .
" Viewers were asked to vote for their favourite dancer and they will all be going through , " the BBC spokesman said .
" Nobody 's vote has been disregarded , in fact , quite the opposite . "
The situation was not explained to viewers at the time , and the programme ended 10 minutes early , forcing BBC
One to fill the gap with trailers .
' Really unfortunate '
When the series started in the autumn , with 16 celebrities paired with professional dancers , the original plan was to have three couples in the final .
But after broadcaster Sergeant quit the show following criticism from the judges , it was decided to continue voting one couple off each week until just two were left to compete in the final .
Now three couples will appear in next Saturday 's final anyway .
The BBC 's controller of entertainment production , Jon Beazley , called the situation " really unfortunate " but said : " There were exceptional circumstances at play .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" We have so many contingencies for a live programme of the complexity of Strictly Come Dancing , this was one extra set of circumstances we did n't have the contingencies in place for .
Everything else , we could have legislated for .
But that 's the nature of the beast . "
Dancer Karen Hardy , who teamed up with cricketer Mark Ramprakash to win the fourth series in 2006 , said she would not have expected producers to foresee the situation .
" This just shows you what live TV is all about , " she said .
" Can a production this big know every single thing that is going to happen ?
The bosses of the show are never going to know what the judges are going to mark . "
' Entirely predictable '
But media commentator Steve Hewlett , presenter of BBC Radio 4's Media Show , said the incident was " entirely predictable " .
HOW IT HAPPENED
Scoring is split 50:50 between judges and viewers
The two couples with the lowest scores once the votes have been combined must perform in a dance - off in front of the judges alone
If there is a tie , the viewers ' votes take priority
In this case , the judges ' votes for Lisa Snowdon and Rachel Stevens ( above ) were so high , viewers ' votes for Tom Chambers would have been worthless
Strictly 's voting rules " They should have worked it out and decided what they were going to about to do about it , " he said .
" When you add it all together with John Sergeant and all the other phone - in things that have happened , you do just sometimes wonder , you can't just invite us , the great unwashed , to play this game , and then disregard what we say .
" What 's to stop this happening next week ? "
Earlier this year , the BBC was fined £ 400,000 by media watchdog Ofcom for misleading its audiences by " faking " phone-ins on TV and radio .
A new code of practice was introduced after the furore .
Mr Beazley said the incident was " validation of the work that 's been put into trust at the BBC " .
" A decision was made - a very clear decision which was communicated to the audience , which was ' this is n't right ' , " he said .
" We 've out our hands up , we 've said it 's not right , it 's a shame we did n't have the contingency in place , but we 'll make it right and we 'll sort it . "
Perfect score HAVE YOUR SAY
I have effectively wasted a pound on a vote that does n't even count .
Ridiculous !
Barney , Liverpool Singer Stevens , dancing with Vincent Simone , and presenter Snowdon , partnered by Brendan Cole , had both been awarded 75 marks out of a possible 80 by the judges after their two dances , with Snowdon achieving a perfect score on her ballroom round .
That meant both couples were awarded three points to take into the audience vote , with Holby City star Chambers and partner Camilla Dallerup awarded just one .
In the audience vote , a further three would have been the most points Chambers and Dallerup could have won and a further one would have been the least either of the other couples could have got .
Therefore , whatever the outcome of the audience vote , Chambers and Dallerup would have been one of the two lowest - scoring couples and facing a dance - off for a place in the final against the other lowest scorers .

Dec. 8 , 2008 -- Breastfeeding may help new mothers shed the baby weight .
A new study examines the relationship between breastfeeding and postpartum weight retention .
The study , which looked at data for more than 25,000 women participating in the Danish National Birth Cohort , measured how long women breastfed and also how intensely .
Each woman received a breastfeeding score .
Results showed that women with higher breastfeeding scores were more likely to lose their pregnancy weight six months after giving birth .
Researchers concluded that women who gain a reasonable amount during pregnancy and breastfeed exclusively are likely to lose all pregnancy weight six months after giving birth .
They also estimate that women who breastfeed retain 2 kilograms ( 4.4 pounds ) less than women who do n't breastfeed at six months after giving birth .
Participants , all recruited by their doctors during their first prenatal visit , were interviewed four times -- twice during pregnancy , as well as six months after giving birth and 18 months after giving birth .
They answered questions about their weight and how they were feeding their babies .
Postpartum weight retention is an important health topic , according to authors , because U.S. women of childbearing age " are alarmingly heavy . "
Fifty - two percent are overweight and 29 % are obese , according to the study .
These existing weight problems can be exacerbated by pregnancies .
Another key factor that contributes to postpartum weight retention is the amount of weight gained during pregnancy .
Thirty - eight percent of American women gain more weight during pregnancy than recommended .
This study , published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , provides one more reason to breastfeed .
Current recommendations call for breastfeeding six months exclusively and to any extent until the baby 's first birthday , according to the study .
Ali Ashtari's appeal was summarily dismissed , Iran says Iran has hanged a telecoms engineer convicted of spying for Israel , reports from Tehran say .
Ali Ashtari , an Iranian , was convicted in June of spying for Mossad , Israel 's intelligence agency .
A video said to be of his confession was broadcast on TV .
He was convicted of sending " sensitive information on military , defence and research centres " for three years .
Israeli officials were quoted in June as saying that Israel was not familiar with the case .
Announcing the execution , which reportedly took place on Monday , Iran 's official news agency said the case against the 45 - year - old was clear and his appeal was summarily dismissed .
" He had spied for Mossad for three years , " the state news agency quoted the intelligence ministry 's director of counter - terrorism as saying .
I feared going to the intelligence ministry , and this fear was the reason why I kept choosing the wrong path ,
Ali Ashtari
Confession broadcast on Iranian TV " His espionage was so evident , " the unnamed official said .
Officials said Ashtari was recruited by Israeli secret services to intercept the communications of Iranian officials working in the military and its controversial nuclear programme .
Broadcasting his apparent confession , state TV showed Ashtari sitting down wearing an open - necked shirt and jumper .
" It was my mistake and perhaps I feared going to the intelligence ministry , and this fear was the reason why I kept choosing the wrong path , " he said , speaking into the camera .
" Do not repeat the mistakes that I made . "
The case unfolded throughout the year against a backdrop of concerns in Iran that Israel was planning to launch a pre-emptive strike against its nuclear facilities .
Israel is a leading advocate of strong action against Tehran , which it believes is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
Iran denies that charge , saying its nuclear programme is intended for energy supply only .

Barack Obama and Joe Biden speak to reporters .
Obama bristles as the bubble closes in
HONOLULU –
The media glare , the constant security appendage and the sheer production that has become a morning jog or a hankering for an ice cream cone – it ’s been closing in on Barack Obama for some time .
Now the president - elect appears increasingly conscious of the confines of his new position , bristling at the routine demands of press coverage and beginning to chafe at boundaries that are only going to get smaller .

Obama even took the unusual step Friday morning of leaving behind the pool of reporters assigned to follow him , taking his daughters to a nearby water park without them .
It was a breach of longstanding protocol between presidents ( or presidents - elect ) and the media , that a gaggle of reporters representing television , print and wire services is with his motorcade at all times .
Then when reporters finally caught up with Obama at Koko Marina Paradise Deli and he acknowledged them for one of few times since arriving in Hawaii last Saturday , he sounded resigned .
After ordering a tuna melt on 12 - grain bread , Obama approached reporters and placed his hand on the shoulder of pool reporter Philip Rucker of The Washington Post , who was scribbling away in his notebook .
“ You do n't really need to write all that down , ” Obama said .
All presidents and would - be presidents struggle with “ the bubble ” – the security detail and the always - there reporters that impose barriers to any spontaneous interaction with the outside world .
But Obama seems to be struggling particularly hard , particularly early .
As rapid as Obama ’s political rise has been , so too has his family ’s introduction to the bubble .
Four years ago Obama was an Illinois state senator who was on his way to the U.S. Senate .
Next month , he will become one of only a handful of modern presidents who has not endured a similar bubble as a governor or top U.S. official before taking office .
Already , Obama no longer gets out for an impromptu lunch or a haircut .
The barber he ’s gone to for 15 years now comes to him , and he mostly orders out .
Soon Obama likely will be forced to give up the BlackBerry he often kept attached to his hip during the campaign .
“ There 's still some things we 're not adjusted to , " Obama said in a “ 60 Minutes ” interview after the election .
“ You know , the small routines of life that keep you connected , I think some of those are being lost . ”
Bill Clinton grew frustrated that he could n’t go out any time he wanted , and once went Christmas shopping without the pool .
After he became president , George W. Bush stopped sending e-mails to his daughters because he did n't want the personal notes to become public one day .
“ It ’s just hard to know that there ’s somebody with you all the time , ” said Steve Elmendorf , who was deputy campaign manager for John Kerry in 2004 .
“ Being able to get up and go biking or go for a walk , or hold hands with your wife — everything you do is not just under the scrutiny of the press or the pool . ”
For Obama , who received a Secret Service detail earlier than any presidential candidate since the practice began , the scrutiny is much more intense .
The glare on his family is shaping up to be unprecedented , both because Obama assumes the presidency amid a 24 - hour , Web - dominated media age where many traditional boundaries do n’t exist and because of what he represents .
He ’s the first African - American to be elected president .
At 47 , he ’s a young guy – as presidents go .
He also has a youthful , attractive family that is social and active .
During the first week in Hawaii , Obama has had to deal with paparazzi waiting in the distance , photographing him shirtless outside his beachfront vacation home and later while spreading his grandmother ’s ashes at the Pacific coast .
And even though the pool photographers remained out of sight and without an image of these private moments , Obama seems to be tiring of the journalists who have followed him daily since the campaign .
“ OK , guys , come on , " Obama said last Sunday , looking toward photographers clicking away as he warmed up before a round of golf .
“ How many shots do you need ? ”
It ’s been a progression .
And Obama ’s frustration shows in waves .
On Halloween , Obama grew testy with a Polish media crew as he took his daughter Sasha to a party at his campaign treasurer Marty Nesbitt ’s Chicago home .
" All right guys .
That 's enough .
You 've got a shot .
Leave us alone .
Come on guys .
Get back on the bus , ” Obama said before breaking into a trot with Sasha still holding his hand .
The day before Thanksgiving , a sixth grader at a Chicago school asked Obama about his new life .
“ You do n't have a lot of privacy , " Obama told some 200 children , adding that going to Walgreen 's and riding a bicycle are now far more involved than before .
Those close to the Obamas have spoken to the media less and less since the election .
Calls and e-mails to close friends and associates of the Obamas were not returned .
“ My husband and I have been asked not to speak with the press about the Obamas , ” one of them wrote in an e-mail .
“ They would prefer that we stay out of the papers for now . ”
It seems the narrower the gap between transition and reality gets , the more private Obama has tried to become .
“ You can see how he chafes at it , ” Elmendorf said .
“ It ’s hard for people who like to do outdoors things .
It ’s also hard for people with young kids . …
You decide at 9 in the morning , I ’m not going out anymore , then at 2 p.m. you decide , ‘ Hey let ’s get some ice cream . ’ ”
“ Normal people can do that .
The president or president - elect ca n’t do that , ” he said .
Friday was only the second time since the election that Obama has traveled without the press pool .
Reporters also were left behind in Chicago once when they could n’t gather fast enough after Obama decided to return home from his transition office .
Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt issued a statement Friday saying that because the president - elect had no further events scheduled as of 9:30 a.m. , aides sent reporters back to their Waikiki Beach hotel 30 minutes away from his vacation home .
But then Obama changed his mind .
“ The president - elect decided to take the girls to a water park and we assembled the pool as quickly as possible , ” the statement said .
Later , when paying attention to his press pool and ordering treats for his daughters and their friends at Kokonuts Shave Ice & Snacks , Obama went so far as to offer reporters some shave ice .
“ Guys , here 's your chance , " Obama said .
“ No ?
I 'm telling you , this is really good . ”
“ I do n't think this is against policy , ” he continued .
“ You want one , I can tell . "
Reporters declined the president - elect 's offer .
But , perhaps in a sign of defiance , Obama made it while standing in one of his hometown spots with his BlackBerry clipped to his hip .
' Terrorist fist jab ' or just a way of saying hello ?
The top ten media blunders of 2008
The media took its share of lumps this year , with persistent claims of bias and complaints about often wrong - headed speculation from a seemingly endless parade of talking heads .
Of course , there was great reporting , with journalists breaking news and penning terrific profiles of the candidates and the campaigns .
TV ratings and Web traffic were through the roof , evidence of huge voter interest .
But there were plenty of missteps on the way , and Politico compiled a list of 2008 ’s greatest blunders ( along with a look at how the media responded to each ) .
Were there worse media mishaps we 've missed ?
Politico invites readers — never shy to tell us reporters when we 're wrong — to comment below and let us know what should have made the cut .

1 ) New Hampshire primary : Pundits predicted a campaign - ending , double - digit loss long before the polls closed , and some networks , perhaps disbelieving the results , did n’t call the election until after Obama had already conceded .
" I will never underestimate Hillary Clinton again , ” Chris Matthews said on MSNBC .
Response : The New Hampshire debacle came up again and again , especially when cable talking heads began saying Obama had sewn up the nomination .
But many pundits , perhaps wary of repeating their previous mistake , kept up with the claim the race was neck and neck well after the delegate math no longer gave Clinton any opening .
2) The New York Times ' McCain - Iseman story :
There was so much hype leading up to The Times ' front - page investigation of John McCain ’s relationship with lobbyists — dating back at least to a Drudge leak two months earlier — that without something concrete , the story was doomed to fail .
Executive Editor Bill Keller said there ’s more to the piece than the strongly suggested , never outright stated , romantic relationship between the senator with lobbyist Vikki Iseman , but that ’s what the public seized upon .
The Times put it out there but could n’t prove it , leading both the right and the left to slam the piece .
Response :
The campaign sparred publicly with the Gray Lady throughout the campaign , using the liberal media as a whipping boy when it needed to rally the base , and the paper often appeared to return the favor , most notably in an hostile October profile of wife Cindy McCain .
3 ) Matthews , Olbermann as co-anchors : Having MSNBC stars Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann co-anchor Election Night and convention coverage drew the public ire of conservatives ( and many Clinton supporters ) , and internally network journalists grumbled that the pair tarnished NBC ’s established journalism brand .
By the time the Democrats reached Denver , Jon Stewart had dubbed the network “ lord of the flies . ”
Response : Even - keeled NBC utility player David Gregory took over as anchor , allowing Matthews and Olbermann to let their opinions run free .
4 ) “ Terrorist fist bump ” and “ baby mama ” : Fox News , in one week last summer , twice took racially tinged shots at Michelle Obama .
Host E.D.
Hill apologized for calling the playful fist pound between the Obamas at the convention a “ terrorist fist jab , ” and then days later , the network placed an offensive chyron up next to the future First Lady : “ Obama ’s baby mama . ”
Response : Hill ’s contract was n’t renewed when it expired in November , and the producer responsible for the “ baby mama ” line went to CNBC .
5 ) “ Pimped out ” : MSNBC ’s David Shuster said that Chelsea Clinton was being “ pimped out ” by the campaign for calling superdelegates on her mother ’s behalf .
The Clinton camp and NBC executives became embroiled in a tense back - and - forth , with the Democratic contender threatening to withdraw from a network - sponsored debate .
Response : Shuster was suspended for a couple weeks , but the incident was n’t a career setback .
Just last week , MSNBC named Shuster host of “ 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . ”
6 ) ABC Democratic Debate in Philadelphia : Co-moderators Charles Gibson and George Stephanopoulos faced plenty of blowback following the Obama - Clinton debate for spending the first half focused on what many complained were trivial issues — his relationships with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers , and his stance on flag pins .
Response : Gibson and Stephanopoulos weathered the criticism , but also did n’t get another debate .
Little was heard about Wright after that , or about Ayers until the McCain campaign went hard at the link in the final weeks of the race .
7 ) National Enquirer ’s Edwards story : During the primaries , mainstream media outlets , this one included , declined to report on the National Enquirer ’s shoe - leather reporting on John Edwards ’ affair , even after their reporters caught him visiting the woman at the Beverly Hilton .
Bloggers kept the story simmering while most news organizations ignored the mounting evidence — that is , until Edward finally came clean on ABC after he 'd already dropped out of the race .
Response : Still more ammo to those predisposed to thinking the establishment media ’s days as gatekeeper are numbered .
8 ) New Yorker ’s “ Politics of Fear ” cover : The Zabar ’s set were in on the joke .
But some did n’t see the humor in the illustration of Barack and Michelle Obama sharing a terrorist fist - jab and dressed , respectively , as a Muslim and Angela Davis - style black radical , with an Osama bin Laden painting on the mantle and an AK - 47 leaning against the fireplace , in which burned the American flag .
Response : Both campaigns slammed the cover , and rumors flew that New Yorker writer Ryan Lizza was kept off the campaign ’s overseas trip as a result .
But now , both Lizza and editor David Remnick — the former whose excellent piece on Obama in the same issue was largely overlooked in the ensuing dustup — are working on books dealing with Obama .
9 ) Veepstakes mistakes :
OK , there probably could be a long list , so we 'll settle for a pair of political commentators who were both right and wrong .
On “ Fox News Sunday , ” Bill Kristol repeatedly said that Obama would choose Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine , even offering the time and place of the announcement .
And Time ’s Mark Halperin boasted of having two Republican sources telling him that McCain had “ apparently settled on Romney . ”
Response :
They kept on giving predictions .
To Kristol ’s credit , he was talking up Palin as McCain ’s VP long before most of the lower 48 knew who she was .
Halperin was on the right track with Obama ’s pick , evident in his cryptic “ Beau knows … the pick ” line on “ The Page . ”
10 ) CNN ’s Drew Griffin misquoting the National Review : CNN finally got an interview with Sarah Palin , but ran into trouble when Griffin read part of a National Review story to the Alaska governor : “ I can't tell if Sarah Palin is incompetent , stupid , unqualified , corrupt or all of the above . "
Turns out the author , Byron York , was n't taking a shot at Palin , but at the media for portraying her as those things .
Response :
The incident fed straight into the narrative that mainstream outlets were n’t giving Palin a fair shake .
Griffin apologized on - air for taking the quote out of context and personally to both York and editor Rich Lowry .
SAN FRANCISCO -
In this tough economy , Valerie Whitlock uses two forms of currency : money and barter .
The 37 - year - old actress and writer from Los Angeles holds down sporadic film and television gigs to cover her rent , utilities , car payments , and insurance .
For everything else - head shots and haircuts , clothing and cut reels - she trades her handcrafted jewelry .
She started swapping for goods while at work on the set .
But now the classifieds website Craigslist and her MySpace page for Fancy Pants Jewelry have become great places to find even more trading partners .
Her best scores include microdermabrasion treatments , a used Apple G4 iBook computer , and Marc Jacobs jeans .
" Jewelry - making has become a creative outlet for me as well as an extra income and barter tool , " Whitlock said .
" It has made a huge difference in my life . "
As the financial crisis makes cash and credit increasingly scarce , the ancient custom of bartering is booming .
Cost - conscious consumers are getting creative to make every dollar count .
Some are dusting off books , DVDs , video games , and other little - used items to trade for necessities or gifts .
Others are exchanging services such as house painting for Web design or guitar lessons for clerical work .
These newly minted cheapskates are seeing the world through green eyeshades , cutting costs wherever and whenever they can .
" In the last couple of months , it 's been like a bucket of cold water in our faces , " said Mary Hunt , founder of money management site DebtProofLiving.com .
" It has woken us up .
We are paying attention to what things cost . "
Every recession triggers bartering , economists say .
But the Internet has given the practice unprecedented reach .
Before the Web connected strangers from anywhere , bartering was limited by geography and social circle .
As a form of everyday currency , bartering has downsides .
It 's far more time - consuming and tricky to negotiate the exchange of goods and services than it is to simply plunk down some bills .
Sometimes prospective swappers flake out or try to rip off their trading partners .
Transactions do n't always go smoothly .
Plus , there are potential tax liabilities .
The Internal Revenue Service considers income from bartering taxable .
Still , exchanging something you no longer want or need for something you do is appealing to many .
A growing number of websites , including TradeaFavor.com and JoeBarter.com , cater to the cost - conscious .
There were 148,097 listings in the barter category of Craigslist in September , up sharply from 83,554 a year earlier , according to the classifieds website .
Bartering via Craigslist 's Los Angeles service was up 72 percent over the same time , with 4,009 listings in September .
Specialty sites such as PaperBackSwap.com and Peerflix.com , are also popular .
Jessica Hardwick , founder of SwapThing.com , started noticing an uptick in bartering in the spring .
Families who were worried about the soaring price of groceries and gas started taking vacations by swapping homes with people who lived within a few hours ' drive .
Over the last few months , her Cupertino - based site 's membership and traffic have snowballed as more people look to trade their talent and time .

One of the climate change Denier claims that keeps resurfacing is that more people die from cold than from heat , therefore warming is a good thing .
I am not sure who started this one , but there is little question Bjorn Lomborg popularized it ( and here ) .
Recently this meme is turning up again thanks to a new posting at that font of climate wisdom The Cato Institute ( also here and here ) viz “ The Deadliest U.S. Natural Hazard : Extreme Cold ” and another three posted at the equally reliable ( so to speak ) Watts Up With That ?
All of them seem to a response to the recent Reuters piece saying heat was the biggest natural cause of death in the US , and all are authored by Indur Goklany .
Goklany is one of the Heartland Institute ‘s “ experts “ , has work hosted by the Fraser Institute ( also here and here ) , but darned if I can find where he currently hangs his hat .
Even ExxonSecrets does n’t seem to know .
All of the posts are based on a 2007 paper he did for the “ Civil Society Coalition on Climate Change ” , yet another astroturf think tank that is part of
the overlapping web that frankbi is documenting at the International Journal of Inactivism .
Many of the flaws that Kåre Fog documents about Lomborg ’s claim that “ warmer is better ” are present here as well , but there are differences so I thought it might be a good time to revisit the meme .
The point form version includes :
The piece “ 95,000 Excess U.S. Deaths during the Cold Months Each Year ” is easiest to dismiss as it is quiet simplistic .
Basically he calculates that in the months December to March 95,000 more people die than compared to the rest of the year .
That ’s it , and then adds “ So bundle up if you go outside , and keep warm indoors as well . ”
I did not even bother checking his math since there is not even an attempt to demonstrate that the increase is in anway caused by cold .
Obviously that is what you are supposed to assume , but it ’s not shown .
Frankly , the fact that it is n’t shown to be caused by cold suggests very strongly that it is n’t .
I say that because as we shall see Goklany has been looking at the data pretty closely .
Next we get “ The Deadliest U.S. Natural Hazard : Extreme Cold ” in which we are presented with a table of “ Total Deaths all causes 1979 - 2002 average ” .
Do you see it ?
where is Goklany ’s 95,000 / year ?
This table says only 16,313 total over 23 years with an average of 680 per year .
A bit different , no ?
Of course confusing 95,000 with 680 is a mistake anyone could make … not .
I bring this up just to underscore Goklany is clearly deliberately misleading in his first article .
There are other flaws to mention as well , so let ’s push on .
The first thing I note is that Goklany ’s table is derived for “ extreme weather . ”
This could account for some of his missing cold deaths , but it would also mean a lot of missing heat deaths .
If you died of heat stroke , but it was n’t during extreme weather , then you did n’t count for Goklany ’s paper .
Glokany does acknowledge this in his “ Follow up to Questions on Deaths from Extreme Cold and Extreme Heat . ”
Whether the numbers are in the dozens or the tens of thousands this table does suggest cold is twice as deadly as heat .
This would contradict the Reuters piece which is based on a study by Borden and Cutter .
Two studies disagree … that does n’t make Goklany right .
It just means we need to try and understand why they disagree and if one of them is “ wrong ” .
Goklany explains the difference in the different data set ’s they used and states that “ medical opinion as captured in death certificate records is more reliable than determinations made by the meteorologists ” in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’s NCDC . ”
Except Borden and Cutter only used the NCDC data for deaths due to hurricane , storms , etc .
It is quite clear that for temperature related deaths Borden and Cutter used the mortality data from The Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute ‘s SHELDUS database , not the NCDC .
To screw up such an important item is mind boggling as it is the core of Goklany ’s explanation for the difference in their conclusions .
If he is able to screw that up one has to wonder about the rest of his work .
I have not looked into what constitutes extreme weather as defined by this study , but I do n’t think we need the numbers to make a few more observations about the piece .
The most obvious one is the implicit assumption that if it get ’s warmer there will be fewer deaths overall .
Huh ?
It ’s not explicitly stated , but that is what you are supposed to believe if you buy into the “ would n’t it be better to be warmer ” meme .
Hello !
Reality to Deniers !
If temperatures increase there may be fewer deaths due to cold , but there will be more due to heat .
What no one does is show that on the balance it will be an improvement , and I want to suggest that it will be quite the reverse .
Frankly deaths attributable to cold can cover the gamut from death by exposure to increased disease and traffic accidents due to road conditions .
I am not convinced that many winter deaths are a consequence of temperature per se though .
Winter is also a period of much less light , particularly as you go further north .
This could lead to more fatalities due to accidents ( eg as a result of a lot more night driving ) , suicides as a result depression , etc .
Sticking with temperature though , I still question the premise that warmer is better .
Ok , take a cold snap of - 20 oC , now raise it 5 oC .
Do you think there are going to be that many fewer deaths due to the causes mentioned ?
Some , yes .
A large difference ?
I am skeptical .
Now let ’s look at a heat wave , like the one that killed 52,000 people in Europe in 2003 .
Now raise it 5 oC .
Think there will be a significant difference ?
Although I have not found a study on it ( can anyone help me here ? )
I suspect that the relationship between cold and mortality is roughly linear .
By that I mean that for every degree colder you get N more deaths .
Further that it does n’t matter much whether you are talking - 20 to - 21 or - 30 to - 31 .
However for heat I suspect that the difference is non-linear , and that past a certain threshold ( probably around 39 oC ) there is a large jump in mortality for every added degree .
Of course this premise of uniform warming is nonsense anyway .
In a world with erratic climate you can set new lows as well as highs .
I merely preserve the assumption to note that Goklnay ’s claims are false even if we accept his premises .
As with temperature , so with disease .
We are led to understand that in a warmer US there will be fewer colds and flus , etc .
No mention of the other diseases such as malaria that will expand their range as the world warms , or heart failure due to heat stress , etc .
However , I reserve my two largest criticisms for last .
First , this is about the US ( and by implication , to some extent Europe ) .
What happens in Cairo , Mumbai , Jakarta and Sao Paulo as the world warms ?
Even if we experienced a few thousand fewer deaths , what about the rest of the world ?
Second , climate change is first and foremost about food .
Not heat waves or flooding or any of that , but food .
Our ability to feed ourselves .
It is a series of posts to document how and why , but anyone who
understands climate change knows it is code for “ massive famine . ”
Yes , including in the Industrialized West .
Any discussion of the alleged benefits of climate change that fails to address that reality is just so much hot air .
Indeed much of the Denier rhetoric is the metaphoric equivalent of ‘ having your house catch fire is good because it would take the dampness out of the basement . ’
Clearly Goklany ’s claims range from suspect to irrelevant to ridiculous .
Any serious analysis of heat vs cold deaths will have to do a full accounting and compare both increases and decreased mortality .
Further , and analysis of the costs or benefits of climate change has to look at the full range of consequences , not just cherry pick one flawed claim that seems to show benefits .
We give our consent every moment that we do not resist .
Denier “ Challenge ” aka Deathwatch Update : Day 79 … still no evidence .

JOY : ' Oldest mother ' Rajo Devi and husband Bala Ram with their new baby
Rajo Devi delivered her first healthy baby at a village fertility centre .
Anurag Bishnoi , the doctor who supervised the treatment , said mother and child were healthy .
Devi , of Alewa in northern India , and her land owning husband Bala Ram , 72 , were both said to be thrilled at finally conceiving a child .
“ We longed for a child all these years and now we are very happy to have one in the twilight years of our life , ” said Ram .
The previous oldest mother was Romanian Adriana Iliescu , who was 66 when she gave birth to a daughter in 2005 .
Since the introduction of IVF treatment in rural India , it has become relatively common for childless elderly couples to try to conceive a child .
This library implements the SHA suite of message digest functions , according to NIST FIPS 180 - 2 ( with the SHA - 224 addendum ) .
The functions have been tested against most of the NIST test vectors for the various functions .
However , only slight attention has been paid to the speed of the functions .
1882 : An inventive New Yorker finds a brilliant application for electric lights and becomes the first person to use them as Christmas tree decorations .
Edward H. Johnson , who toiled for Thomas Edison ’s Illumination Company and later became a company vice president , used 80 small red , white and blue electric bulbs , strung together along a single power cord , to light the Christmas tree in his New York home .
Some sources credit Edison himself with being the first to use electric lights as Christmas decorations , when he strung them around his laboratory in 1880 .
Sticking them on the tree was Johnson ’s idea , though .
It was a mere three years after Edison had demonstrated that light bulbs were practical at all .
The idea of replacing the Christmas tree ’s traditional wax candles – which had been around since the mid-17th century – with electric lights did n’t , umm , catch fire right away .
Although the stringed lights enjoyed a vogue with the wealthy and were being mass - produced as early as 1890 , they did n’t become popular in humbler homes until a couple of decades into the 20th century .
A general distrust of using electricity for indoor lighting , still widespread in the late 19th century , kept the popularity of Christmas lights low .
They were most commonly seen ringing the seasonal display windows of big-city department stores .
In 1895 , President Grover Cleveland ( a New York stater himself ) supposedly ordered the family ’s White House tree festooned with multicolored electric lights .
If he did , it barely moved the needle on the popularity scale .
Even so , General Electric began selling Christmas - light kits in 1903 .
Another New Yorker is generally credited with popularizing indoor electric Christmas lights .
According to the story , Albert Sadacca , whose family sold ornamental novelties , became a believer in 1917 after reading the account of a bad fire caused by a candlelit tree bursting into flames .
Whether or not that ’s the reason , Sadacca began selling colored Christmas lights through the family business .
By then , the public ’s distrust of electricity had diminished .
So the timing was right , and sales took off .
With his brothers , Sadacca later started a company devoted solely to the manufacture of electric Christmas lights .
He succeeded in roping a few competitors into a trade association , which proceeded to dominate the Christmas - light industry into the 1960s .

Following onto a set of recent posts ( from James , me , then James again ) , Martijn Faassen wrote a description of Grok ’s version management .
Our ideas are pretty close , but he ’s using buildout , and I ’ll describe out to do the same things with pip .
Here ’s a kind of development workflow that I think works well :
A framework release is prepared .
Ideally there ’s a buildbot that has been running ( as Pylons has , for example ) , so the integration has been running for a while .
People make sure there are released versions of all the important components .
If there are known conflicts between pieces , libraries and the framework update their install_requires in their setup.py files to make sure people do n’t use conflicting pieces together .
in their files to make sure people do n’t use conflicting pieces together .
Once everything has been released , there is a known set of packages that work together .
Using a buildbot maybe future versions will also work together , but they wo n’t necessarily work together with applications built on the framework .
And breakage can also occur regardless of a buildbot .
Also , people may have versions of libraries already installed , but just because they ’ve installed something does n’t mean they really mean to stay with an old version .
While known conflicts have been noted , there ’s going to be lots of unknown conflicts and future conflicts .
When starting development with a framework , the developer would like to start with some known - good set , which is a set that can be developed by the framework developers , or potentially by any person .
For instance , if you extend a public framework with an internal framework ( or even a public sub - framework like Pinax ) then the known - good set will be developed by a different set of people .
As an application is developed , the developer will add on other libraries , or use some of their own libraries .
Development will probably occur at the trunk / tip of several libraries as they are developed together .
A developer might upgrade the entire framework , or just upgrade one piece ( for instance , to get a bug fix they are interested in , or follow a branch that has functionality they care about ) .
The developer does n’t necessarily have the same notion of “ stable ” and “ released ” as the core framework developers have .
At the time of deployment the developer wants to make sure all the pieces are deployed together as they ’ve tested them , and how they know them to work .
At any time , another developer may want to clone the same set of libraries .
After initial deployment , the developer may want to upgrade a single component , if only to test that an upgrade works , or if it resolves a bug .
They may test out combinations only to throw them away , and they do n’t want to bump versions of libraries in order to deploy new combinations .
This is the kind of development pattern that requirement files are meant to assist with .
They can provide a known - good set of packages .
Or they can provide a starting point for an active line of development .
Or they can provide a historical record of how something was put together .
The easy way to start a requirement file for pip is just to put the packages you know you want to work with .
For instance , we ’ll call this project - start .
txt :
Pylons -e svn+http://mycompany/svn/MyApp/trunk#egg=MyApp -e svn+http://mycompany/svn/MyLibrary/trunk#egg=MyLibrary
You can plug away for a while , and maybe you decide you want to freeze the file .
So you do :
$ pip freeze -r project - start .
txt project - frozen.txt
By using -r project - start .
txt you give pip freeze a template for it to start with .
From that , you ’ll get project - frozen .
txt that will look like :
Pylons==0.9.7 -e svn+http://mycompany/svn/MyApp/trunk@1045#egg=MyApp -e svn+http://mycompany/svn/MyLibrary/trunk@1058#egg=MyLibrary ##
The following requirements were added by pip -- freeze : Beaker==0.2.1 WebHelpers==0.9.1 nose==1.4 #
Installing as editable to satisfy requirement INITools==0.2.1dev-r3488 : -e svn+http://svn.colorstudy.com/INITools/trunk@3488#egg=INITools-0.2.1dev_r3488
At that point you might decide that you do n’t care about the nose version , or you might have installed something from trunk when you could have used the last release .
So you go and adjust some things .
Martijn also asks : how do you have framework developers maintain one file , and then also have developers maintain their own lists for their projects ?
You could start with a file like this for the framework itself .
Pylons for instance could ship with something like this .
To install Pylons you could then do :

Before she died on August 9 last year , his wife had made other unsuccessful suicide attempts .
In the summer of 2005 , she took a late - night overdose .
Convinced his wife would be dead when he awoke , Mr Grosvenor Myer left her lying on a futon in the television room .
" She was still there next morning , still alive .
Halfway through the day , I realised that she had gone into a coma .
I could n't cope with a coma so I called for help .
One of the paramedics said very meaningfully to me : ' It 's as well you phoned us as soon as you could or you might have found yourself on a manslaughter charge ' .
So he obviously knew what the score was and was giving me a hint to be careful . "
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
The beatings , the broken bones , the squalid conditions -- it was " nothing , " former prisoner Amir Fakhravar has told CNN , compared to the pain that he suffered under " white torture " in an Iranian jail .
Amir Fakhravar believes that change in Iran will only come from complete isolation .
" We did n't see any color , all of the cell was white , the floor was white , our clothes were white and also the light , 24 hours , was white .
Our food , also , was white rice , " explains Fakhravar , now 25 .
" We could n't see any color and we could n't hear any voices . "
Amnesty International first documented Fakhravar 's case in 2004 , saying such conditions of extreme sensory deprivation appear to be designed to weaken political prisoners .
It says that he was held at a ' covert ' detention center used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard .
The organization added that he had to slip a white piece of paper under the door if he wanted to use the toilet .
Even the guards wore padded shoes to muffle any sound .
The organization describes the silence as " deafening " and " inhumane . "
" I was there for eight months and after those months I could n't remember my father and my mother 's face , " says Fakhravar .
" When they released me from that prison I was not a normal person . "
Fakhravar has said he was first arrested aged 17 after criticizing the Iranian regime through speeches and writings , and spent more than five years shuttling between Iranian prisons and being tortured .
The " white torture " began in January 2004 and lasted until August of that year .
He eventually escaped to the United States but has said he will not rest until there is regime change in his homeland .

As a young medical student , Fakhravar has said he wanted reform , not regime change , and struggled in prison to understand why the Iranian government was putting him through such extraordinary and dehumanizing psychological torture .
" That was the question for us .
I asked my interrogator : ' What do you want from us ? '
And after several times experiencing this I realized they want to inject fear into Iranian society , all of Iranian society . "
Fakhravar has said that he now knows how dangerous the Iranian regime is and how determined its leaders are to export the Islamic revolution around the world .
" They are trying to brainwash all the children in Iran , " Fakhravar said , claiming that there is an institutional program to indoctrinate all Iranian children into believing the globe should be converted to Shia Islam .
" Iranian children , Iranian students , they are suffering a really bad time in school and they are more dangerous than the atomic bomb . "
Fakhravar believes that change in Iran will only come from complete isolation , enforced by severe economic sanctions .
He also offered some sobering advice for American presidential candidate Barack Obama , who has said he believes the U.S. should engage Iran through dialogue .
" He cannot find anybody to talk to him , " said Fakhravar .
" It does n't work , and I 'm sure that the Islamic republic will be closer to an atomic bomb . "

Left 4 Dead
Developer : Valve
Publisher : Valve
Platform : PC ( Reviewed ) , 360
Price : $ 49.99 ( Shop. Ars )
Rating : Mature
Valve seems dedicated to the cause of multiplayer gaming on the PC .
Sure , you can get Left 4 Dead on the 360 , and I 'm sure many people will enjoy it , but the best way to play this game is with a mouse and a keyboard , headphones on , screaming at your teammates that you 're surrounded and need backup .
You can also play the game in single - player mode , and it's not a bad time , but without your friends alongside you reacting to the game and later telling stories of your play sessions night after night , the title does lose something .
Mark my words : you 'll want to play this game on the PC with three people you know , and it 's best played in the dark .
There will be blood
The setup is simple , and the story is essentially meaningless : the world has been overrun by zombies .
You are with a group of four survivors desperately trying to get to some place safe .
That 's it .
Each " movie , " the game 's version of levels , ends with " The Survivors have Escaped . "
The characters may be paper - thin , but the archetypes work , mainly due to the many lines of dialog that they spout in different situations .
You 'll never really learn where they come from or who they are , but each one has gobs of personality .
In a game that never plays the same way twice , there is a remarkable amount of humor and laughs to be had while fending off the zombie horde .
Each movie begins with a poster , giving you some idea of what you 're getting into .
You fight through the four sections , and then there 's a finale where the game throws insane amounts of bad guys at you .
If you survive — a single player can beat each movie if his or her teammates all succumb — you get an achievement .
It sounds sparse , and it certainly is , but the trick here is the " director , " a nifty piece of artificial intelligence that makes sure each movie is different every time .
If you 're doing well as a team , expect more enemies and a tougher challenge .
If you 're getting beaten up , you 'll see fewer enemies .
If you 're really getting torn to pieces ?
Sometimes the director throws you a tank , one of the game 's special enemies .
You see , the director is something of a dick .
If you play the game in single - player on easy , then you can see everything there is to see in about four hours .
That being said , this is a game that has caused me and my friends to spend hours and hours in the demo .
The demo has two levels , one of which is half the size it is in the full game .
The full game has twenty levels , in four movies .
Even though I plan on beating the game again tonight with a new group of people , in one sitting , I know I 'll want to play again the night after that .
Read on to see why this game is so special , and why twenty levels can last forever .
In a new report published online today in the January issue of Addiction , researchers question whether current licensing policies have contributed to a rise in the phenomenon of " pre-drinking " amongst young people .
" Pre-drinking " or " pre-gaming " involves planned heavy drinking , usually at someone 's home , before going to a social event , typically a bar or nightclub .
As defined by young people themselves ( see online dictionary of slang at www.urbandictionary.com) pre-drinking is " [ the ] act of drinking alcohol before you go out to the club to maximise your fun at the club while spending the least amount on extremely overpriced alcoholic beverages " .
The authors see pre-drinking as symptomatic of a " new culture of intoxication " whereby young people are drinking with the primary motive of getting drunk .
Recent research suggests that a large proportion of young people pre-drink and that pre-drinkers are more likely to drink heavily and to experience negative consequences as compared to non-pre - drinkers .
Pre -drinking often involves the rapid consumption of large quantities of alcohol which may increase the risk of blackouts , hangovers and even alcohol poisoning .
It may also encourage the use of other recreational drugs such as cannabis and cocaine as drinkers are socialising in unsupervised environments .
The authors argue that the policy of banning drink promotions or specials such as " happy hour " in bars and clubs may have the unintended consequence of encouraging young people to drink cheaper alcohol in private settings before going out , especially when heavily discounted alcohol is offered in shops and supermarkets .
The authors also point out that while later closing times have been justified as a way of reducing problems associated with large numbers of young people being on the street after bars and clubs close , they may encourage private drinking to precede rather than follow public drinking , producing different social dynamics and possibly increasing the potential for violence and other alcohol - related problems .
To discourage or reduce pre-drinking , the authors suggest a comprehensive strategy including :
Developing policies that reduce large imbalances between on and off premise alcohol pricing
Attracting young people of legal drinking age back to the bar for early drinking , where alcohol consumption is monitored by serving staff and drinks are served in standard sizes
Addressing young people 's motivations for pre-drinking , including being able to socialize with friends and saving money - for example bars might expand their social function and create an attractive atmosphere for more intimate socialising
Forming effective strategies to reduce planned intoxication - for example policy and programming could be aimed at changing drinking norms and promoting moderation
Lead author Dr. Samantha Wells , a researcher at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health , Canada says , " Many young bar - goers have found a way to avoid paying high alcohol prices in bars : they pre-drink .
And we have begun to see that this intense and ritualized activity among young adults may result in harmful consequences .
Therefore , we need to look closely at the combined impact of various policies affecting bars and young people 's drinking and come up with a more comprehensive strategy that will reduce these harmful styles of drinking among young people . "

Laurent Nkunda : War Nerd Hero
If you ever want to find a real hero , here ’s one way to recognize him : the TV news will be making him into a monster 24/ 7 .
Today ’s monster hero is the Tutsi general Laurent Nkunda , the leader of the “ rebel ” forces that are supposedly “ closing in ” on Goma in Eastern Congo .
The BBC , the only news agency that even pretends to take Africa seriously , has its number - one ghoul reporter , Orla Guerin , on Nkunda ’s case every day .
You may not know Guerin ’s name but if you like war news you ’ll recognize her , because you ’ve probably seen her reporting from some African death zone .
She fits right in in those places , really comes into her own .
She ’s got the face of a skull , except skulls smile , and some creepy accent that makes you think of cold porridge and leftover damnation .
Wherever she ’s from , they must have had a party when she left .
In this BBC video you ’ll see Orla talking about what a shame it is that the “ refugees ” at Kibati Refugee Camp have to stampede for food , worried as they are about being overrun by Nkunda ’s “ rebels . ”
The way Orla and the other networks are telling it , everything was just fine in Eastern Congo until the bad “ rebel ” leader Nkunda ordered his troops to advance .
When the innocent “ refugees ” heard Nkunda was coming , they started running , creating a “ human rights crisis . ”
The print media is getting in on it too , with the Brit rag The Guardian saying that Nkunda ’s troops may have actually “ killed civilians , ” as if that was anything unusual in Central Africa .
The Guardian ’s account barely mentions that the “ civilians ” killed were in a “ stronghold of Hutu militias ” — the same militias that killed most of the Tutsi population in Rwanda back in ’ 94 .
It ’s like if the Jews had formed an army to push back the Nazis , and when the poor Nazis fled next door , the Jews did an occasional incursion to discourage the Nazi “ refugees ” from returning to their genocidal ways .
And that ’s an atrocity .
Except the Nazis , give them their due , were brave as Hell and fought to the last man ; the Hutu “ militias ” were only good a hacking babies and raping little girls , and fled at the first rumor that the enemy was approaching .
That ’s why they ’re still around .
Every word , every disgusting damn word , of these BBC and Guardian stories is bullshit .
actually makes me sick , listening to these stupid lies over and over .
The reason Nkunda ’s little army ( estimates range from 5000 to 10000 men ) advanced into Eastern Congo this week is that the Hutu gangs were getting a little too aggressive about jumping ethnic - Tutsi villages in eastern Congo , killing the men and kidnapping women and girls as sex slaves .
Nkunda knows very well nobody else will protect the Tutsi , for the simple reason nobody ever has .
So he went in to do it himself .
Nkunda is a great man , a brilliant man , a hero , a military genius who speaks four languages and has beaten the biggest armies around with a force of less than 10,000 men .
He ’s the only decent leader that part of Africa ’s ever seen .
It ’s worth looking at the way they ’ve been slandering him , because you ’ll see the same techniques used to slam any real hero .
Let ’s start with the oldest trick in the book , calling somebody you do n’t like a “ rebel . ”
How did the BBC decide that Nkunda is a “ rebel ” ?
Does n’t there have to be a government , law and order , before you can rebel against it ?
Who is Nkunda supposed to be rebelling against ?
There ’s no law in the forests of Eastern Congo .
The UN has a pitiful token force of blue helmets wandering around slapping mosquitoes and bargaining for blow jobs with the local girls , but the real power there before Nkunda ’s forces marched in was held by the leaders of the Hutu “ refugees . ”
“ Refugee ” ; now there ’s another wonderful word , a good match for “ rebel . ”
It makes the Hutu the innocent victims , shivering in fright at the approach of the bad ol ’ Tutsi .
Well , of course that ’s another do - gooder lie .
These “ refugees ” are gangs run by the worst people in the world : the leaders of the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambe , the Hutu “ militias ” who massacred 800,000 Tutsi men , women , children and babies in Rwanda in 1994 .
In fact , “ militia ” is way too good a name for these overgrown death squads .
You ’ll find the BBC and the other networks have a whole range of names for kill groups : “ terrorist ” if they hate you , “ paramilitary ” if they ’re not sure but would n’t invite you to their kids ’ birthday parties , and “ militia ” if they like you .
Calling the Hutu genocide squads a “ militia ” is like calling Columbine a kids ’ prank .
The reason these Hutu are out in the jungle is simple : they massacred almost a million fellow Rwandans in less than four months , back in those happy Clinton years , and then ran when the Tutsi , who ’ve always been braver than the Hutu , formed a small army , the RPF , and chased the much bigger “ militias ” out .
The truth is that the Tutsi behaved so well through the whole thing that the world ought to be cheering them .
I tell you , if I ’d been in command of the RPF when it marched back into Rwanda stepping over piles of stinking corpses chopped up with machetes , I would have taken my cue from Foday Sankoh ’s name for his nutcase army ’s advance on Freetown up in Sierra Leone : “ Operation Kill Every Living Thing . ”
But the Tutsi did n’t do that .
They took no revenge , let the Hutu live and even tried to set up a decent government from both tribes .
They ’re fucking saints , and they ’re supposed to be the bad guys here ?
Let me remind you again , since nobody seems to want to remember : eight hundred thousand Tutsi civilians chopped to death with machetes in less than four months .
It was a real community effort by the Hutu , like one of the Amish barn raisings , only bloodier .
If you want a good look at how they did it , I recommend a book called Machete Season .
It ’s very simple , totally straightforward , just interviews with a gang of Hutu farmers who spent three months making daily expeditions into the local swamp , where surviving Tutsi civilians were trying to hide .
They all tell the same story : “ Every morning we got up , took our machetes and looked for Tutsis to hack to death .
Sometimes we gang - raped the pretty girls , because those Tutsi girls have such soft skin from all the milk they drink .
But we ’d kill them too when we were done .
After weeks of killing the Tutsi did n’t even resist any more .
They just stood there and waited for us to finish them off .
We had the time of our lives . ”

I did not anticipate the huge response my inbox received for the article slamming Pakistan .
Many of those who wrote in have sought concrete steps to tackle the Terror Central .
The terror attack on world citizens at Mumbai has created revulsion and outrage all over the world .
It is imperative that India seize the opportunity provided to destabilise Pakistan .
A stable Pakistan is not in the interest of world peace , leave alone India .
Army controls the country and owns its economy .
A significant portion of its GDP is due to army - controlled entities ( See : Military Inc - Inside Pakistan 's Military Economy , by Ayesha Siddiqa ; OUP ; 2007 ) .
One can easily say that Pakistan economy and its Army / ISI are synonymous .
Unless this elementary fact is internalised , we are not going anywhere .
This implies we should stop talking of a stable Pakistan since a stable Pakistan means multiple attacks on many more cities of India by that rogue organisation ISI , which is the core of the Pakistan Army and the heart of Pakistan 's economy .
Let us not even assume that Zardari is in control .
Poor man -- he did not trust his own investigators to probe his wife 's assassination -- he wanted Scotland Yard to do the job .
Now he blabbers that if his investigators are satisfied , then he will initiate action against terrorists sitting inside Pakistan .
Periodically , the Pakistan Army likes to present some useful idiots ( as Lenin would have called them ) as elected representatives and we swoon over such events .
India should take the following steps to destabilise the economy of Pakistan :
1. Identify the major export items of Pakistan ( like Basmati rice , carpets , etc ) and provide zero export tax or even subsidise them for export from India .
Hurt Pakistan on the export front .
2. Identify the major countries providing arms to Pakistan and arm twist them .
Tell Brazil and Germany ( currently planning to supply massive defense items to Pakistan ) that it will impact their ability to invest in India .
Tell Germany that retail license to Metro will be off and other existing projects will be in jeopardy .
3 . Incidentally , after the arrival of Coke and Pepsi in China , the human rights violations of China are not talked about much by US government organs .
Think it is a coincidence ?
Unless we use our markets to arm - twist arms exporters to Pakistan , we will not achieve our objectives .
4. Tell American companies that for every 5 % increase in FDI limit for them , their government needs to reduce equipping Pakistan by $ 5 billion .
That is real politics , not whining .
Let us remember that funds are in desperate search of emerging markets and not the other way about .
Let us also remember that international economics is politics by another name .
5. Create assets to print / distribute their currency widely inside their country .
To some extent , Telgi types can be used to outsource this activity .
Or just drop their notes in remote areas .
6. Pressurise IMF to add additional conditionality to the loans given to them or at least do not vote for their loans .
7. Create assets within Pakistan to destabilise Karachi stock market - it is already in a shambles .
8. Cricket and Bollywood are the opium of the Indian middle classes .
Both have been adequately manipulated / controlled by the D - company since the eighties .
Chase the D - company money in cricket / Bollywood and punish by burning D-assets in India instead of trying to have them auctioned by the IT department when nobody comes to bid for it .
9 . Provide for capital punishment to those who fund terror and help in that .
We have the division in the finance ministry to monitor money laundering , etc .
It is important that terror financing is taken seriously and fully integrated into money laundering monitoring systems and this division is provided with much larger budget and human resources .
And it should coordinate with RAW .
10 . Encourage and allow scientists / academicians / elites of Pakistan to opt for Indian passport and widely publicise that fact since it will hurt their self - respect and dignity .
There will be a long queue to get Indian passports -- many will jump to get our passport -- since they will not be stopped at international airports .
It is rumoured that Adnan Sami wants one .
Do not give passports to all -- make it a prized possession .
Let it hurt the army - and ISI - controlled country .
This one step will destroy their identity and self - confidence .
11 . Discourage companies from India from investing in Pakistan , particularly IT companies , till Pakistan stops exporting its own IT ( international terrorism ) .
12 . In all these , it is important that we do not bring in the domestic religious issues .
The target is the terror central , namely Pakistan , and if there are elements helping them here then they also should be punished -- irrespective of religious labels .
If Pakistan is dismantled and the idea of Pakistan is gone , many of our domestic issues will also be sorted out .
Will the Indian elite go for the jugular or just light more candles and scream at the formless / nameless political class before TV cameras ?
It is going to be a long haul and may be in a decade or so , we can find a solution to our existential crisis of being attacked by barbarians from the West .
We need to combine strategy and patience and completely throw to the dustbin the ' Gujral Doctrine ' by that mumbling prime minister about treating younger brothers with equanimity .
The doctrine essentially suggests that if we are slapped on both the cheeks we should feel bad that we do not have a third cheek to show .
He , according to security experts , seems to have dismantled our human intelligent assets inside Pakistan , which has resulted in the gory death of thousands of Indian citizens in the last few years .
Such is our strategic thinking in this complex world since our political class is not adequately briefed and the elite do n't think through issues .
Better to be simple in our talks and vicious in our actions rather than the other way .
Hopefully , this November attack will create a new vibrant India capable of taking care of its own interests .

Palin's ' traveling makeup artist ' paid $ 32,000 a month John Byrne
Published : Friday December 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Yesterday , a National Journal report put Palin 's total " accessory " and clothing tab at $ 180,000 .
Today a report put her total styling bill for hair and makeup at a whopping $ 110,000 .
It gets better -- Palin's " traveling makeup artist " was paid roughly $ 32,000 a month for the final two months of the campaign .
Palins " traveling makeup artist " raked in $ 68,400 and her hair stylist netted more than $ 42,000 -- for roughly two months of work .
To put that in perspective , makeup for Palin alone would have cost $ 410,400 if spread out over an entire year , and her hair -- $ 252,000 .
The campaign finance report filed with the Federal Election Commission and reported by the New York Times late Thursday .
" Ms. Palins makeup artist , Amy Strozzi  who was nominated for an Emmy award for her cosmetics work on the television show  So You Think You Can Dance ?   was paid $ 32,400 by Senator John McCains presidential campaign between Oct. 16 and Nov. 24 , the period covered by the most recent reports filed with the commission , " the Times wrote .
" This amount came on top of the $ 36,000 she had already been paid in previous reports , dating back to September , , " they added .
Angela Lew , Palin's hair stylist , billed another $ 42,225 .
The Republican National Committee was scheduled to report roughly another $ 30,000 spent on clothing and accessories on Thursday , but the report had not been filed or was not available by late Thursday night .
" In October , Politico revealed that the RNC had spent approximately $ 150,000 on clothing and accessories for Palin and her family after she was selected as Sen.
John McCains running mate , " National Journal reported Thursday .
" The story provoked a storm of criticism of the Alaska governor , a mother of five and favorite of the conservative wing of the GOP . "
GOP officials would n't provide many details .
" The amount to be reported is significantly less than $ 150,000 , " one RNC official told National Journal .
" The accessories on the report are less than $ 30,000 . "
The clothing , the official says , is in the committee 's possession and
will be dispersed to national and local charities at the appropriate time . "
They are said to include " other " accessories purchased for the " hockey mom " before the election .
Sen. John McCain's ( R - AZ ) campaign spent more than $ 150,000 on Palin 's wardrobe between late August and Nov. 4 .
In early September , the RNC 's clothing buys for Palin included bills from Saks Fifth Avenue in St. Louis and New York for $ 49,425.74 , and shopping trips to Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis , including one totaling $ 75,062.63 in September .
The RNC also spent $ 4,716.49 on hair and makeup through September , Politico reported .
Today 's report puts the total cost at more than ten times the original figure .

The US president has " no hard feelings " about the Iraqi journalist who flung shoes at him , the White House says .
Muntadar al - Zaidi threw his shoes at George W Bush during a Baghdad press conference , calling him a dog .
Mr Bush was unhurt in the incident , but his spokeswoman , Dana Perino , received a black eye in the melee that ensued .
Mr Zaidi on Tuesday appeared before an investigating judge and " admitted the action he carried out " , a High Judicial Council spokesman said .
Iraq 's military earlier denied claims by Mr Zaidi 's brother that the journalist had been beaten in custody .
The TV journalist allegedly suffered a broken arm , broken ribs and internal bleeding after the incident , his older brother , Dargham , told the BBC .
Mr Zaidi has been remanded in custody while the judge investigates the case as part of complicated legal proceedings that could take months before a possible trial .
Black eye Ms Perino said Mr Bush trusted Iraq 's legal system to decide an appropriate punishment for the assault .

" The president harbours no hard feelings about the incident , " she said .
The spokeswoman was injured when a heavy metal microphone stand swung round at her as security guards rushed to restrain Mr Zaidi , reports said .
Arrested by forces under the command of Mowaffaq al - Rubaie , Iraq 's national security adviser , Iraqi authorities have said Mr Zaidi , 28 , will be prosecuted under the country 's law .
" Zaidi was brought today before the investigating judge in the presence of a defence lawyer and a prosecutor , " said Abdul Satar Birqadr , a spokesman for Iraq 's High Judicial Council spokesman .
If he is charged with trying to murder a president , his sentence could be seven to 15 years in prison , said Mr Birqadr .
Tuesday saw a second day of rallies being held across Iraq hailing Mr Zaidi as a hero and calling for his release .
Meanwhile , offers to buy the shoes he threw were reportedly being made around the Arab world for as much as $ 10 m ( £ 6.5 m ) .
' Goodbye kiss '
The head of Iraq 's journalists ' union has asked the government for clemency towards the journalist .

The previously little - known journalist from the private Cairo - based al - Baghdadia flung both his shoes at Mr Bush on Sunday during the US president 's farewell visit to Iraq before he steps down next month .
" This is a goodbye kiss from the Iraqi people , dog , " yelled Mr Zaidi as he threw the shoes .
Dargham Zaidi told the BBC his brother had deliberately bought Iraqi - made shoes , which were dark brown with laces , from a well - known shopping street in central Baghdad .
A graduate of communications from Baghdad University , Mr Zaidi lives in the Iraqi capital where he has worked for al - Baghdadia for three years .

Lance Selfa recounts the history of an era that is still remembered for the important changes that benefited the working majority .
COMPARISONS BETWEEN
Barack Obama 's assumption of power and Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's in 1933 have been many and varied .
Following Obama 's first press conference as president - elect , New York Times business reporter Joe Nocera wrote a November 7 column titled " 75 Years Later , a Nation Hopes for Another FDR . "
Others , like the writers and editors for the liberal Nation , openly endorse a " new New Deal " from the Obama administration to help working people .
None of this is surprising .
Roosevelt 's New Deal is remembered today for signature programs that seem very relevant in light of the economic disaster spreading from Wall Street through the rest of the economy .
The New Deal is synonymous with Social Security ; with the " alphabet soup " agencies like the WPA ( Works Progress Administration , which created jobs for the unemployed constructing public buildings ) ; and with the government 's recognition of the right of workers to join unions .
But the New Deal did n't come about because of some hitherto hidden enthusiasm among American political leaders for giving working people new rights and programs .
The New Deal was , first and foremost , a program to save a U.S. economy in crisis .
That American workers made gains was the result of huge struggles that gave a radical content to that program .
A Civilian Conservation Corps crew constructing a new road
THE 1929 stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression followed a decade - long employers ' offensive against the labor movement that reduced union membership from 19.4 percent of the nonagricultural workforce in 1920 to 10.2 percent in 1930 .
The labor movement seemed dead , with no new strategies in place and nowhere to turn for new members .
By 1933 , when Roosevelt took office , unemployment hit one - quarter of all workers .
Roosevelt did n't run for president with the intention of championing workers ' rights or creating a welfare state .
For much of his campaign against the incumbent president , Herbert Hoover , he attacked the Republican for " reckless " spending and pledged to balance the budget by cutting federal spending by 25 percent .
The 1932 Democratic Party platform affirmed the call for a balanced budget and huge cuts in federal spending , and it included a call for the states to follow suit .
In words that would be familiar from today 's free - market ideologues , it also called for " the removal of government from all fields of private enterprise , except where necessary to develop public works and natural resources in the common interest . "
What else to read Lance Selfa 's The Democrats : A Critical History examines the two - party system in the U.S. and focuses on a socialist history of the Democratic Party .
To learn more about the labor struggles that have shaped U.S. history , Sharon Smith 's Subterranean Fire : A History of Working - Class Radicalism in the United States is an excellent history of the working class movement .
For an account of the 1934 Minneapolis Teamster strikes that ushered in the high point of 1930s struggle , see Teamster Rebellion by Farrell Dobbs , who became a socialist through his participation at Minneapolis .
Labor 's Giant Step by Art Preis gives an account of the first 20 years of the CIO , starting with the federation 's roots in the turbulent 1930s .
Jeremy Brecher 's Strike ! is the place to start for a survey of U.S. labor history .
The depth of the economic crisis forced a different response .
Roosevelt enlisted the help of some of the country 's leading businessmen , including General Electric 's Gerard Swope and Walter Teagle of Standard Oil of New Jersey , who argued that deteriorating business conditions required state intervention to control the excesses of private capitalism .
The " New Deal capitalists " also urged Roosevelt to adopt reforms modeled on private - sector benefit and insurance plans .
The Social Security Act , passed in 1935 , took as its inspiration a number of " welfare capitalism " programs established in the 1920s by some of the country 's leading corporations .
Despite some capitalists ' complaints that the New Deal represented a step toward " socialism , " Roosevelt and the New Dealers had no such intention .
In fact , Roosevelt wrote in one letter about " the failure of those who have property to realize that I am the best friend the profit system ever had . "
In campaign speeches when he ran for reelection in 1936 , he proclaimed himself the " savior " of " the system of private profit and free enterprise . "
Roosevelt 's " New Deal " coalition was launched in this context .
While popularly perceived as an alliance of Blacks , labor , urban dwellers and other " popular " constituencies , behind it all was a fundamental recasting of the alignment of business forces in American politics .
The New Deal coalition , wrote political scientists Joel Rogers and Thomas Ferguson , involved not :
the millions of farmers , Blacks and poor that have preoccupied liberal commentators , nor even the masses of employed or striking workers who pressured the government from below ... but something else -- a new power bloc of capital - intensive industries , investment banks and internationally - oriented commercial banks .
Roosevelt 's first tentative steps toward addressing the crisis in the economy bore a number of similarities to initiatives the discredited Hoover administration had taken .
But circumstances forced Roosevelt 's hand .
Though it represented , in essence , a political rearrangement of American capital , the New Deal could only succeed by striking a new arrangement with the system 's traditional victims .
Thus , included in the National Recovery Act ( NRA ) , the New Deal 's first major economic plan , was Clause 7a , which allowed workers to bargain collectively with their employers .
Clause 7a had the unintended consequence of spurring an explosion of union organizing .
" There was a virtual uprising of workers for union membership , " the American Federation of Labor ( AFL ) executive council reported to the federation 's 1934 convention .
" [ W ] orkers held mass meetings and sent word they wanted to be organized . "
The consequences of this new period of union organizing ushered in by the NRA 's Clause 7a was immense .
Existing unions tripled , quadrupled or quintupled in size .
New unions seemed be formed overnight .
Between 1933 and 1937 , the number of workers who were union members jumped from 2.7 million to more than 7 million .
Driving these numbers upward was a quantitative and qualitative leap in the class struggle .
The number of strikes jumped from 1,856 in 1934 to a peak of 4,740 in 1937 , with the number of strikers involved leaping from 1.1 million to 1.9 million in the same period .
A large number of the stoppages were for union recognition against employers who refused to follow Clause 7a 's recognition of collective bargaining .
A further number of these strikes , especially the three 1934 general strikes in Toledo , San Francisco and Minneapolis , took on a near - insurrectionary character .
Roosevelt responded to the pressure of the rising class struggle by legalizing collective bargaining rights for workers who were using the strike weapon to demand them .
But he did n't do so enthusiastically .
Liberal Democratic Sen. Robert Wagner introduced what became the National Labor Relations Act in 1934 .
The bill aimed at creating permanent procedures so that union recognition and employer - union relations would be something regulated by the government , instead of fought out on the shop floor between workers and bosses .
Industry opposition to the bill made FDR withhold his support , causing Wagner 's legislation to stall in Congress .
But the 1934 strike wave " confirmed Senator Wagner in his conviction that the nation needed a new labor policy , " as one history put it .
Wagner reintroduced the bill , and it won overwhelming support in Congress .
Roosevelt then backed it as a way to rein in a labor movement that showed signs of getting out of control .
ROOSEVELT DID succeed , ultimately , in reining in the struggle .
But it was n't a one - way proposition .
He had willing collaborators among union leaders whose vision for organized labor offered them a " seat at the table " alongside the nation 's policymakers .
Even before the formation of the Congress of Industrial Organizations ( CIO ) -- a newly formed coalition of unions in the mass industries that served to challenge the conservatism of the AFL - - a labor leader like Sidney Hillman of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers represented " a labor statesman in waiting , waiting for a movement to represent and a regime to accept that representation , " as his biographer put it .
This observation is n't to take away from the initiative and courage that top CIO leaders like Hillman and John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers of America ( UMWA ) exhibited when they launched the CIO .
But it does make clear what they , or at least what New Deal loyalists like Hillman , ultimately wanted from the industrial union movement .
Rather than seeing it as a means by which workers could organize an independent voice to win their demands , these union leaders saw it as a means to give labor leverage in the halls of power .
Thus , the leadership of the CIO was " connected by a thousand threads to a newly emergent managerial and political elite , an elite which in collaboration with the CIO would foster a permanent change not only in the national political economy , but in the internal political chemistry of the Democratic Party and in the prevailing politics of production in basic industry , " commented labor historian Stephen Fraser .
It was n't long before these leaders ' commitment to remain credible in the halls of power rendered them opponents of rank - and - file initiatives .
Roosevelt shrewdly used his power to cement the loyalty of the trade union officialdom to the New Deal and to the Democratic Party .
That 's why mineworkers ' leader Lewis complained about the difficulty of organizing a labor - based opposition to the administration :
[ FDR ] has been carefully selecting my key lieutenants and appointing them to honorary posts in various of his multitudinous , grandiose commissions .
He has his lackeys fawning upon and wining and dining many of my people ...
In a quiet , confidential way he approaches one of my lieutenants , weans his loyalty away , overpowers him with the dazzling glory of the White House and appoints him to a federal post under such circumstances that his prime loyalty shall be to the President and only a secondary , residual one to the working - class movement from which he came .
Rank - and - file union activists -- especially those on the front lines of the class struggle -- were far less loyal to the Democrats , or even to Roosevelt .
By 1933 , pressure began to mount among unionists for the creation of labor 's own political party to end the unions ' collaboration with both Democrats and Republicans .
Calls for a labor party reflected a newly confident working class and its desire to fight on its own .
CIO leaders Lewis and Hillman made a priority of garnering CIO support for Roosevelt in the 1936 election .
But in order to do so , they had to squelch pro-labor party sentiment among CIO members .
This meant sabotaging unionists ' own initiatives independent of the Democrats .
When the newly formed United Auto Workers ( UAW ) voted in 1936 to support the creation of a national farmer - labor party , CIO leaders threatened to remove funding for organizing the rest of the auto industry if the union did n't rescind the vote and back Roosevelt .
The UAW caved and endorsed Roosevelt .
From then on , organized labor has been a loyal lieutenant of the Democratic Party .
THE NEW
Deal left behind a set of programs that , while certainly an advance over the pre-Depression lack of social provision , fell far short of erecting a European - style " welfare state . "
The Social Security
Act established a divide between " social security " and " welfare . "
Unemployment and old - age insurance would not be paid out immediately , but only after employer and employee taxes had been collected in federally managed funds for workers .
A regressive payroll tax , capped at a fixed amount , assured that workers would pay more to finance the system than would the rich -- despite the fact that the rich also would be eligible to receive benefits from the old - age pension program .
Nevertheless , the " universalism " of Social Security - - on offer to every worker -- accounts for its enduring and widespread support ever since .
By design , the New Deal set up a distinction between those who " deserved " old - age or disability benefits because they worked , and the " undeserving poor " who were viewed as too lazy to work .
Millionaire FDR himself called welfare " a narcotic , a subtle destroyer of the human spirit . "
For a generation , the memory of the New Deal sustained the Democratic Party as the majority party of American capital .
This political order began unraveling in the 1960s and 1970s as the turmoil of the period , the war in Vietnam and the struggles of the era fractured the Democratic Party .
This opened the door to the conservative period of the last generation , which seems , finally , to have run its course .

Sarah Palin famously claimed she had " absolutely no diva in me , " but former McCain aides did their best to demolish that assertion in a super - juicy Thursday Times story .
Among their embittered , anonymous and still entirely plausible claims :
They budgeted the Republican vice presidential nominee around $ 25,000 for clothes and were shocked at her $ 150,000 shopping spree ; Palin wrote a concession speech that she desperately wanted to deliver Tuesday night ; and she never told McCain about a call she thought she had scheduled with the president of France ( really a DJ prank ) .
Now they 're talking about sending lawyers to audit her family 's closets and just generally trying to destroy her chances of running for anything anywhere , ever .
Here 's what they told the Times about Palin 's clothes shopping :
On Wednesday , two top McCain campaign advisers said that the clothing purchases for Ms. Palin and her family were a particular source of outrage for them .
As they portrayed it , Ms. Palin had been advised by Nicolle Wallace , a senior McCain aide , that she should buy three new suits for the Republican National Convention in St. Paul in September and three additional suits for the fall campaign .
The budget for the clothes was anticipated to be from $ 20,000 to $ 25,000 , the officials said .
Instead , in a public relations debacle undermining Ms. Palin 's image as an everywoman " hockey mom , " bills came in to the Republican National Committee for about $ 150,000 , including charges of $ 75,062 at Neiman Marcus and $ 49,425 at Saks Fifth Avenue .
The bills included clothing for Ms. Palin 's family and purchases of shoes , luggage and jewelry , the advisers said .
Palin's alleged behavior sounds , either by the designs of her enemies or by the logical progression of events , like the mistakes of a rookie politician .
You just do not go wasting the Republican Party 's hard - earned donations on overfancy clothes and jewelry and so forth , as Richard Nixon learned 56 years ago .
If you want to be fancy , you wait until you 're elected and then " borrow " haute couture for free , just like Nancy Reagan did .
And you certainly do n't go loading up at the expense - account buffet on behalf of your family .
( Unless that 's exactly what the McCain campaign encouraged you to do , which is what we may well be told tomorrow . )
Also , VP candidates do not give concession speeches .
Does n't work that way .
Palin was apparently told this and still insisted on bringing a copy of her speech with her Tuesday night .
The Times also addressed allegations that the McCain people were upset Palin did not adequately prepare for her disastrous interview with CBS ' Katie Couric , as reported Wednesday on Fox News .
There is indeed anger over the lack of preparation , according to the Times ' source , but it 's not like Palin refused any prep ; she just did n't have time amid cramming for her big PR trip to the UN .
A shitstorm of bickering between the McCain and Palin camps has erupted within 24 hours of the Republican ticket 's defeat — this story in the Times and the thing about Palin not knowing her continents , via Fox News .
Just imagine the terrible mud reporters will find once they have time to really start turning over rocks !

The essential fuzziness of time may be the limiting factor for a gravitational - wave detector in Germany .
Could GEO600 have detected the fundamental fuzziness of time ?
Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics ( Albert Einstein Institute ) / Leibniz University Hannover
Poets have long believed the passage of time to be unavoidable , inexorable and generally melancholic .
Quantum mechanics says it is fuzzy , ticking along at minimum intervals within which the notion of time is meaningless .
And Craig Hogan claims he can ' see ' it — in the thus far unexplained noise of a gravitational - wave detector .
" It 's potentially the most transformative thing I 've ever worked on , " says Hogan , director of the Center for Particle Astrophysics at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Illinois .
" It 's actually a possibility that we can access experimentally the minimum interval of time , which we thought was out of reach . "
In a classical view of the world , space and time are smooth .
The minimum scales at which , according to quantum mechanics , the smoothness breaks down — the Planck length and time — can be derived from other quantities , but they have not been tested experimentally , nor would they be , given their impossibly small size .
Yet if Hogan 's ideas are right , noise associated with this fundamental fuzziness should be prominent at GEO600 , a joint British and German machine operating near Hannover , Germany , that is searching for gravitational waves .
These waves are thought to arise during events such as the massive cosmic collisions of black holes and neutron stars .
Confirmation of the idea — which could come as experimental upgrades to GEO600 are put in place over the coming year — would be a big step towards a verifiable quantum theory of gravity , a long - sought unification of quantum mechanics ( the physics of the very small ) with general relativity ( the physics of the very big ) .
Hogan outlines his predictions in a paper published on 30 October in Physical Review D1 .
Hocus pocus
“ If it 's true , it 's Nobel - prize - winning stuff ” Karsten Danzmann
Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics
Of course , theorists are full of extraordinary ideas that never pan out , so physicists at GEO600 are treating Hogan 's ideas with a healthy dose of scepticism .
" To me as an experimentalist , this all seems a bit like black magic , " says Karsten Danzmann , principal investigator for GEO600 , and director of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics .
" It seems a bit far - fetched and artificial .
But if it 's true , it 's Nobel - prize - winning stuff . "
Hogan says that the noise could be responsible for about 70 % of some unaccounted for noise that GEO600 is recording .
Danzmann says it's " intriguing " that this noise just happens to be the right magnitude and shape to account for most of the ' mystery ' noise that his team has been unable identify for a year now .
The predictions are based on a lower - dimensional view of spacetime : two spatial dimensions , plus time .
Spacetime would be a plane of waves , travelling at the speed of light .
The fundamental fuzziness of the waves , on the order of the Planck length and time , could be amplified in large systems such as gravitational - wave detectors .
The third spatial dimension of the macroscopic world would be encoded in information contained in the two - dimensional waves .
" It 's as if , in the real world , we are living inside a hologram , " says Hogan .
" The illusion is almost perfect .
You really need a machine like GEO600 to see it . "
Holographic promise
According to Hogan , the ' holographic ' noise is more likely to be seen in certain detectors , because the fuzziness gets translated into noise only in the plane of the underlying wavy two - dimensional fabric of spacetime .
GEO600 is less sensitive to gravity waves than are detectors such as those in LIGO ( Laser Interferometer Gravitational - Wave Observatory ) , two similar , large L - shaped detectors in Washington and Louisiana .
But Hogan says GEO600 is more sensitive to holographic noise , because its power is locked in a beamsplitter that amplifies the peculiar transverse quality of the fuzziness .
The idea for an essentially holographic Universe has gained traction in recent years , as string theorists have found ways to trim the 10 dimensions that their theories call for .
A decade ago , Juan Maldacena , now of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , New Jersey , put forward the idea that most of the 10 dimensions can be reduced when the information is encoded , like a hologram , in three or four basic dimensions .
" The ideas of holography in string theory are extremely well accepted , " says Gary Horowitz of the University of California , Santa Barbara .
He adds , however , that Hogan 's ideas about holography do n't use conventional starting points .
" There is reason to be somewhat sceptical .
I do n't find the theoretical motivation totally convincing . "
But Hogan 's predictions are striking and specific enough to get the attention of the GEO600 staff .
Hogan will travel to Hannover to work with GEO600 scientists such as Harald Lück , who is leading an effort to double the sensitivity of the machine by the end of 2009 .
That should mean that the instrumental noise also drops .
But if most of the noise remains , then it could be a sign that it is due to holographic noise , which would be fundamental , and pervasive throughout the Universe .
" If the noise is still there , we have to be serious " about the observations , says Lück .

Madison - State Sen. Jeff Plale ( D - South Milwaukee ) noticed something a little odd when he logged onto the state 's new Web site for campaign finance information .
Prominently displayed at http://cfis.wi.gov is a picture of the Capitol in Madison next to a beautiful skyline - of Minneapolis .
" I 'm looking at that thinking , what the heck ? "
Plale said Monday .
" I do n't think a lot of Minnesota legislators care about our Government Accountability Board , but who knows ? "
The board , which runs the Web site , confirmed the only way to see the skyline from Wisconsin is with a telescope in Hudson .
The board is paying Connecticut - based PCC Technology Group about $ 1 million to develop the site .
The board quietly unveiled it this year as it rolls out its system for tracking campaign fund raising and spending .
Some candidates used the system this fall as part of a pilot program .
In January , all candidates will have to start using the system , greatly increasing the traffic on the site by candidates and those who monitor their spending .
Candidates have complained about glitches with the site that have caused delays , but board officials say they are ironing out problems , and the site allows more detailed searches than the previous computer system .
Joe Singh , a PCC executive vice president , said the company is using the image of the Minneapolis skyline as a placeholder while it searches for a copyright - free image of Madison 's skyline .
He said he expected it to be updated in early January .
Jonathan Becker , director of the board 's Ethics Division , joked that the skyline was a " fanciful picture of what Madison may look like someday . "
He said he had assumed the skyline was of Wisconsin 's biggest city .
He 's not from Milwaukee , so he said he had n't noticed the skyline lacked landmarks such as the Milwaukee Art Museum , the newly renovated City Hall and the U.S. Bank Center .
He said he would ask the vendor to find promptly a skyline from Wisconsin .
" It 's nice , though , is n't it ? " he said .
" It looks like a nice place to live .
It 's the Emerald City . "
Steve Filmanowicz - an aide to former Milwaukee Mayor John O. Norquist who now works with Norquist at the Congress for the New Urbanism in Chicago - was surprised to see a Minnesota skyline on a Wisconsin Web page .
" The state does n't need to outsource their skyline , " he said .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The future of the U.S. auto industry was in doubt Friday morning after a proposal for $ 14 billion in federal loans died in a late night Senate vote .
The Senate voted 52 - 35 to bring the measure for a vote -- short of the 60 votes needed to advance the legislation .
The failure followed the collapse of negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans seeking a compromise that both parties , as well as the companies and the United Auto Workers union , could accept .
The dramatic late - night developments could doom General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) to a bankruptcy and closure in the coming weeks , with Chrysler LLC potentially following close behind .
While Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) has more cash on hand to avoid an immediate crisis , its production could be disrupted by problems in the supplier base , as could the production of overseas automakers with U.S. plants such as Toyota Motor ( TM ) and Honda Motor ( HMC ) .
Investors around the world reacted negatively .
Stocks closed lower in Japan and Hong Kong and were trading down in Europe .
U.S. stock futures were down sharply .
General Motors was trading 34 % lower and Ford 11 % in premarket trading .
Chrysler is privately held .
GM and Chrysler said in statements that they were disappointed but did not reveal their next moves .
" We will assess all of our options to continue our restructuring and to obtain the means to weather the current economic crisis , " according to the GM statement .
GM has continually said it could not continue to operate if it is forced to file for bankruptcy .
In response to reports that the company has hired a prominent bankruptcy attorney , GM said its board " is meeting frequently and monitoring the situation very closely and is committed to considering all options -- as is management -- and has engaged appropriate advisors for all contingencies . "
However , the Big Three could still wind up getting government funding .
Bush officials warned wavering GOP senators earlier Thursday that if they did n't support the legislation , the White House will likely be forced to tap funds from the Wall Street bailout to lend them money , two Republican congressional officials told CNN .
The White House has been strongly opposed to using any of the $ 700 billion in bank bailout funds to help the auto industry , but the Bush administration has also said the Big Three must get some financial assistance soon .
" It 's disappointing that Congress failed to act last night , " said White House Deputy Press Secretary Tony Fratto .
" We will evaluate our options in light of the breakdown in Congress . "
The measure the Senate turned back would have provided $ 14 billion in federal loans as a stopgap measure until the new Congress and the incoming Obama administration could reach a longer - term solution .
While the package was far less than the $ 34 billion requested by the automakers earlier this month , it would have seen them through their current cash crisis .
GM has said it needs $ 4 billion by the end of the month or its cash reserves will fall below the level it needs to continue operations .
It needs another $ 6 billion in the first two months of 2009 , according to its request to Congress .
Chrysler had said its cash would run out early next year and it would need $ 4 billion in the first quarter to continue operations .
Hopes for compromise quickly faded
Earlier in the evening , it appeared that the two sides were getting close to an agreement on the bailout .
But just after 10 p.m. , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , announced a failure to reach an agreement and that he would call for a procedural vote to test support for the measure .
" We have worked and worked and we can spend all night tonight , tomorrow , Saturday , and Sunday , and we 're not going to get to the finish line , " Reid said on the Senate floor before the vote .
" That 's just the way it is .
There 's too much difference between the two sides . "
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , said the sticking point was the United Auto Workers union 's refusal to put employees at U.S. auto manufacturers at " parity pay " with U.S. employees at nonunion plants operated by foreign automakers in the United States .
Negotiations centered around proposals from Sen. Bob Corker , R - Tenn. , that would have set dates in 2009 by which the automakers receiving the loans had to reach cost cutting agreements with unions and creditors or be forced into bankruptcy .
Corker said the two sides were very close to a deal and stumbled on the deadline for the union to agree to the reduced pay .
" We are about three words away from a deal , " Corker said .
Currently , analysts estimate the union workers at U.S. automakers make about $ 3 to $ 4 per hour more than the non-union U.S. employees of foreign automakers like Toyota and Honda , according to the Center for Automotive Research .
The benefit costs are significantly greater for U.S. automakers , though , because they have to pay health care costs for hundreds of thousands of retirees .
The union agreed to close much of that gap in the 2007 labor agreements by shifting responsibility for retiree health care to union - controlled trust funds .
But those changes wo n't take effect until 2010 .
The House easily passed the bailout bill Wednesday night but it quickly ran into trouble in the Senate , where Republicans objected to several provisions .
CNN 's Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report .

In the 18th century , several European governments financed research to improve the technology , as a way to overcome an acute shortage of firewood : ecotech before the term existed .
However , its further development and distribution was thwarted by the arrival of coal , gas and oil .
Oven stoves are large , heavy and slow , but they offer so many advantages that they – again - deserve to be subsidized by the government .
An oven stove is a very efficient and robust oven that radiates heat all day .
In the US it was introduced only 20 years ago , but in Europe the technology is almost one thousand years old .
Especially in Russia , Scandinavia and Central Europe the oven stove has a long and rich tradition .
Oven stoves are greener , more efficient , healthier , safer and cosier than all modern heating systems .
Why are they gone and how do we get them back ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most people think that the metal stove was the successor of the campfire and the fireplace , and if you only look at the US , that is true .
In the New World , there was never a shortage of firewood and therefore no incentive to improve the inefficient fireplace .
But in Europe and Northern - Asia , there was an important and succesful link between the fireplace and the metal stove .
It is known as the Russian , Austrian , Finnish , Swedish or German stove , or as “ kakelugn ” ( in Sweden ) , “ pechka ” ( in Russia ) , “ kachelöfen ” or “ steinöfen ” ( in Germany and Austria ) , and as “ tulikivi ” ( in Finland ) .
More general terms are tile oven , brick oven , ceramic stove , tiled stove , soapstone heater or masonry heater .
The technology is more closely related to a traditional oven than to a metal stove – therefore the German term “ kachelöfen ” ( oven stove ) describes it best as an umbrella term .
Oven stoves already appear on drawings and paintings in the 1300s ( see illustrations above and below ) .
They are in fact the first real heating appliances in history .
Earlier , the Romans invented the hypocaust , a forerunner of central heating , but that knowledge was largely lost when their civilization collapsed .
Oven stoves are traditionally fuelled on wood , but today they can also be equipped to work on gas , or alternately on both fuels .
They can even cooperate with a central heating system .
An oven stove can take any form or dimensions : it can be almost invisible , built into a wall or underneath the stairs , or it can be an impressive work of art standing in the middle of the living room .
Stone versus metal
The most essential feature of an oven stove is that it is made out of some kind of stone or brick , while all our modern heating appliances are made of steel .
Metal heats up fast , but it also cools down just as quickly .
Therefore , a metal heating appliance has to be fuelled almost continuously .
Stone requires more time to heat up , but once it has , it holds the heat much longer .
An oven stove is only fired for a short time , from a quarter of an hour to one or two hours and only once or twice per day .
An average oven stove then radiates heat for at least 12 hours .
Smoke channels
The main part of the heating appliance consists of a labyrinth of smoke channels and smoke rooms .
Their aim is to hold the warm gasses inside the oven as long as possible , so that the stone can absorb the heat before it leaves the chimney .
The energetic output of an oven stove is 80 to 90 percent , compared to 40 to 50 percent for metal stoves or central heating appliances , and only 10 to 15 percent for a fireplace – where most heat escapes via the chimney .
One of the most striking features of a ( wood fuelled ) oven stove is the stokehold , which looks ridiculously small compared to the stove itself .
Thanks to the high output , a modest masonry heater or tile stove ( heating a room of 60 square meters ) only needs 6 cubic meters of wood per year : one tree .
If you have even a small garden , you can easily fuel your oven stove by means of your own cuttings – thin wood is very well suited for tile stoves , although it needs to be dry enough .
Radiant heat
All our contemporary heating appliances warm a house or a room mainly by means of convection : they heat up the air .
An oven stove does it by means of radiant heat : infrared radiation , comparable to the heat of the sun .
In a room that is heated by an oven stove , a thermometer can hardly measure anything .
The effect is comparable to that of a skier who enjoys a schnapps while sunbathing , in spite of the freezing temperatures .
Radiant heat does not ( only ) warm up the air , but particularly also the body of the skier directly .
An oven stove acts in the same way as the sun : it does not so much heat the air , but the floor , the walls , the furniture and the people in the room .
These objects in their turn radiate that absorbed heat to their environment – similar to a city radiating heat after a long hot summer day , when the walls and the pavement slowly release back the heat from the sun .
This might sound a bit weird for 21st century computer wizards , but until 150 years ago heating was by definition radiant heating .
Heating by convection is a very recent invention , and it has more drawbacks than advantages .
Hot air balloon
Convection causes constant air movement in the house , because hot air is pushed upwards ( the principle of a hot air balloon ) and cold air is being sucked in ( all convectors need a constant supply of air ) .
Warm air rises to the ceiling , while the people that it should warm find themselves on the floor .
This is not very efficient .
Moreover , it is always too hot close to the radiator or the stove and always too cold at the other side of the room .
Secondly , convection is not healthy .
The dust in the house starts floating around , which irritates the respiratory system .
In combination with the drying effect of warm air and by the scorching of dust by the metal surfaces of radiators and stoves , this leads to an unpleasant , alkaline air climate , which can cause headaches .
This problem is mostly solved by air humidifiers or electric water heaters , which blow a mix of steam and air into the room .
Unfortunately , this creates the ideal conditions for house dust mite and for nasty fungii .
You can not open a window to ventilate , because then the warm air escapes quickly .
Sleeping on the stove
An oven stove has none of these disadvantages .
Because it hardly warms up air , there is no dust circulation .
Because the surface of the oven does not become as hot as the surface of a metal stove or a radiator , there is no scorching of dust .
And because the air does not rise , the heat is distributed evenly across the room , instead of rising to the ceiling ( or via an open staircase to the upper floors ) .
This means you can open a window upstairs to ventilate the house , without losing energy .
Because the exterior of an oven stove does not become too hot , there is no danger of burning yourself .
This quality is sometimes used to integrate a bench or a couch into the stove , a luxury that no other heating appliance can offer .
In Russia it used to be a habit to install beds atop of an oven stove .
Thanks to their warm ( but not too warm ) exterior , oven stoves offer more possibilities .
They are very well suited to keep pots and pans warm , or to dry laundry – metal stoves or radiators are mostly too hot for that .
A ceramic stove can be equipped with hot plates and an oven , so that it can be used as a cooking appliance , too .
Complete combustion
Oven stoves are an alternative for all modern heating appliances , but compared to wood stoves they have another , important advantage .
More and more people choose wood as an energy source for heating , so that they are not dependent on the unpredictable energy prices of oil and gas .
In one sense this is not a bad thing , since unlike gas and oil , wood is a renewable and CO2 - neutral fuel ( the CO2 that is produced by the burning of wood was taken out of the atmosphere by the tree during the years before ) .
The problem is that wood stoves are not very efficient , and extremely polluting .
Wood can be burned without too much air pollution , but then the temperature has to be high enough : 1100 to 1200 degrees Celsius .
In that case , 99 percent of the wood is converted to CO2 and water vapour , almost without smoke .
A metal wood stove , however , only reaches a temperature of 650 to 700 degrees , with an incomplete wood combustion as a result .
Wood consists for two thirds out of combustible gases and for one third out of combustible material .
In the case of an incomplete combustion , these gases escape as smoke via the chimney .
In regions where many people use wood heating , the air quality worsens dramatically ( an incomplete wood combustion is more polluting than the burning of oil or gas ) .
Overheating
In a wood stove the fire is quelled by diminishing the supply of air , if not the room would overheat by the fast release of warmth by the metal appliance .
Because an oven stove does not immediately release the heat of the fire , but stores it temporarily in the masonry mass , wood can be burned at a very high temperature without overheating the room .
An oven stove is always stoked at full power , even if a lower temperature is desired : in that case you simply stoke a smaller portion of wood , or you stoke less often .
A complete combustion is not only advantageous for air quality and efficiency , it is also safer .
In the case of an incomplete combustion , the chimney gets ever more densely set with creosote , which can lead to a chimney fire when one day the stove is fuelled at full power ( the reason why a chimney has to be cleaned regularly ) .
Instant heat
Oven stoves have some disadvantages , too , although none of them are insuperable .
Probably the largest drawback is the fact that a tile stove or masonry heater does not deliver the instant heat that we got used to .
If you turn on the gas stove , you are almost immediately rewarded with heat .
But an oven stove takes a couple of hours before it starts radiating heat .
That is not such a problem during long , cold periods , because once the cycle has been started and the stove is stoked shortly each morning , the house is always warm .
It is less obvious during periods with large temperature fluctuations , or when you travel a lot .
You can make the best of that , by dressing warm for instance , or in a less low - tech way by installing an extra heating appliance – like a gas stove – in the same room .
This second heating generator may also be a much smaller tile stove , or a ceramic oven ( a small tile stove meant solely for cooking ) .
The small one can then be used to heat up the room relatively fast while the large one is warming up .
A tile stove equipped with two stokeholds , a big one for the heating and a smaller one for cooking , offers the same possibility .
Overheating
A masonry heater neither delivers the fine temperature tuning of other heating appliances .
If a wood or gas stove is overheating the room , you simply turn it lower and the temperature goes down fast .
With a tile stove , this is impossible to do .
If you burn too much wood or gas in the morning , this decision can not be reversed during the course of the day .
There is no option left but to open the windows , and that is not so efficient anymore .
Heating a room to the right temperature thus requires some practice and dedication , especially in a climate which is not like it is in Russia or Finland .
A third disadvantage of the tile stove is a consequence of radiant heat .
An oven stove only heats the room where it is positioned .
Opening the door will not warm up the room next to it , because it is largely lying in the “ shadow ” of the radiant heat .
This is again comparable to a warm sun on a winter day : if you step out of the sun into the shade , the radiant heat is gone and all you feel is the air temperature .
A gas or wood stove does not perform too well on this either , but a central heating system seems to be the indisputable winner .
However , a tile stove does not exclude a system of central heating .
Heat walls
Heat walls or heat floors are another way of applying radiant heat .
Here , warm water is not led through plate steel radiators as in a conventional central heating system , but through plastic hoses which are integrated into the walls ( or into fake walls ) .
Because of its porous surface a stone wall can not heat up air , it radiates like a tile stove .
Heat walls can be combined with an oven stove .
The stove is connected to a boiler system , which distributes the warm water via hoses in the walls or the floor throughout the house .
In this way one tile stove ( assuming it is powerful enough ) can heat up all rooms in a house , something which is otherwise not possible .
In the same way a tile stove can deliver warm water for a household .
Heat walls can also be combined with an existing central heating appliance .
This is already a step in the right direction , because the energy consumption goes down ( the water does not have to be as warm as in the case of a traditional central heating system , because the heat is radiated over a larger surface area ) and you get a better interior air climate .
As a third possibility an oven stove can also be connected to a network of metal radiators ( as in this church ) , but in that case you lose the advantage of radiant heat .
Steel plate radiators warm up the air .
Heavy , bulky and expensive
Another , quite fundamental drawback is that oven stoves are rather big and heavy .
A modest tile stove amounts to at least 800 kilograms , and big ones ( especially in the US and the former Soviet Union ) can weigh up to 5 tonnes , or more .
Smaller models exist , but they lose some advantages compared to their larger brothers ( they have to be stoked more often , and do not always reach a complete wood combustion , or the same energy efficient output ) .
A masonry heater needs to be large and heavy , there is nothing one can do about that .
Metal heating appliances have the indisputable advantage of being compact .
Masonry stoves also cost 2 to 3 times as much as other heating systems .
Since the energy consumption costs are lower , and a well - built oven stove lasts a lifetime , this investment pays itself back after a while .
However , you have to be able to afford the purchase .
In Finland , a major producer of soapstone heaters , the purchase of an oven stove is subsidized by the government , with the consequence that 90 percent of new houses has them inside .
Oven stoves are expensive because they are products of craftsmanship .
They are not really suited for mass production ( although efforts are being made ) , and are therefore not of much interest to the heating industry .
They prefer to sell , for example , pellet stoves .
Pellet stoves
A pellet stove is the only wood stove that reaches a complete combustion like an oven stove does .
Sophisticated technology is used to accomplish this – which is also the weak point of this heating system .
A pellet stove needs electricity to power all the high - tech ( conveyor belt , ventilation , temperature regulation , and so on ) , which means that this electricity use should be taken into account when calculating the environmental score .
Furthermore , a pellet stove stops delivering heat when there is a breakdown .
A pellet stove can only be fed with pellets , small rods made of wood , which are processed in a factory .
Pruned wood or sawed wood are of no use in a pellet stove .
Producing these pellets requires a lot of energy .
Another consequence is that once again you are dependent on the unpredictable prices of an energy supplier .
Also , a pellet stove mainly heats up the air and hardly emits any radiant heat , so there is no health advantage compared to a wood stove , a gas stove or a central heating system .
Thanks to all the high - tech inside , however , a pellet stove costs as much as an oven stove .
Fake oven stoves
Now that oven stoves are gaining some popularity again , the manufacturers of metal heating appliances try to get a slice of the pie .
A few have started offering them according to traditional methods , sending masons to your house to build whatever oven stove you desire .
Most manufacturers , however , now use radiant heat as a greenwash promotion strategy .
There are now stoves on the market that look like an oven stove , only they are not .
They are normal metal stoves , wrapped in tiles .
They betray themselves by grates to let in cool air , something an oven stove does not need ( see picture below ) .
Of course the tiles get hot when the stove is running , but they cool down just as fast when it is turned off .
These appliances are promoted as an ideal combination of both technologies , but they are simply convection stoves .
They hardly emit any radiant heat , they scorch dust and they have a lower performance .
Yet , they sell .
Another example is this German wood stove , pictured below .
It is enthusiastically being promoted as a modern variant of an oven stove , and it will appeal to steampunks and survivalists , yet this is just a plain wood stove , not very efficient and very polluting .
Burning the woods
The oven stove is the only technology that allows a clean burning of wood without the need for another energy input , and thus it is the only technology that promises an environmentally friendly alternative for the dwindling resources of gas and oil .
The crucial question is whether the earth can produce enough wood to keep a significant amount of people warm .
Today ’s energy crisis is not the first in human history .
Starting in the 15th century , some countries in Europe already faced a serious shortage of firewood and this became an acute problem in the 17th and 18th century , which only got “ resolved ” by the arrival of coal .
It seems impossible that the present European population could again be warmed by wood , because there are now many more people than in those times .
But there is some hope that the potential is larger than expected .
The massive deforestation in the Middle Ages was the consequence of the fireplace , which needs ten times as much fuel as an oven stove ( wood was also the main construction material ) .
Even though the tile stove is almost 10 centuries old , it only broke through on a large scale in the 19th century , and even then only in some European countries .
The potential of the technology was never fully developed because of the start of the industrial revolution , and the abundance of coal .
Research has yet to reveal how large the potential of wood as a fuel can be if we would use oven stoves , but it is surely greater than if we would return to wood stoves .

Turns out there was just too much in that little 9 1/2 minute interview to cover in one day .
This is installment # 4 in picking apart Sarah Palin ’s interview by the Daily News and KTUU in her Wasilla home on Sunday .
I found this particular question to be quite fascinating … probably because I was involved personally in the incidents discussed .
I covered extensively the protest rallies in Anchorage that occured while Palin was on the campaign trail .
I ’ll recap , just to clarify :
1 ) Alaska Women Reject Palin –
This rally happened at the Loussac Library and had about 1500 attendees , mostly women .
Nobody had ever seen anything like this .
Anchorage rallies usually manage to round up a couple dozen people … if they ’re lucky .
This was epic .
There was a sea of homemade signs slamming her positions on reproductive rights , aerial wolf hunting , troopergate , global warming and croneyism .
Anyone at that rally knew that something had awakened in the Alaskan people , that had resulted in something unexpected – an engaged citizenry .
2 ) Alaskans for Truth Rally –
This rally happened at the Park Strip in downtown Anchorage , and had approximately 1800 attendees .
The focus of this rally was to hold our Governor accountable for her actions , and to demand the immediate resignation of Alaska State Attorney General , Talis Colberg .
Colberg advised state employees that they could disregard legislative subpoenas , and they did .
Sarah Palin had promised to cooperate with the Legislative investigation , and she did n’t .
The organizers were wondering if that first rally was an anomaly .
They wondered if they could pull off a repeat .
They did , and more .
Speakers included local activists , progressive media , Republicans , representatives of the Native community and the Alaska State Troopers , and even Walt Monegan ’s mom .
The other purpose of this rally was to show support for former Commissioner of Public Safety Walt Monegan , independent investigator Stephen Branchflower , and State Senator Hollis French , all of whom had been mercilessly and unfairly slandered in the media by Palin and her mouthpiece , Meg Stapleton .
This rally got much more media coverage than the first one , and resulted in Mudflats having its busiest day ever , with more than 1/3 of a million hits in 24 hours .
It was covered by the Anchorage Daily News , CBS , national blogs , local blogs and all local TV stations .
The national coverage was not massive , but it was significant , and it ’s doubtful that this went unnoticed by Palin , and it certainly did n’t go unnoticed by her staff still in Alaska .
So , yes … .
I was curious to see how Palin would answer this question .
Q. Governor , were you aware that during the campaign there were some large protests in Anchorage against your candidacy , as well as your handling of the Walt Monegan issue ?
What do you think about that and what can you do to bring those people back ?
Palin :
To bring those people back in terms of ….. and I was n’t aware of the protests ’ til like after they happened .
I ’d hear about it .
A friend emailed me or somethin ’ sayin ’ there were placards out there saying whatever they ’d say .
( waves hand dismissively ) I think that ’s the nature of a a national level campaign also some you know they evidence of that the opposition to our ticket on the national level that that ’s going to be expressed here on the local level too .
The thing that really got me was the hand wave .
She brushed us away like a mosquito .
An annoyance .
Not worthy of even breaking out the flyswatter .
I hope this will be Palin ’s big mistake .
She underestimates those who have defected .
Her approval ratings went from over 90 % when she was first elected , to about 60 % now .
When one third of your supporters turn , it can make life difficult , especially when that 30 % is angry , riled up , and out to change things .
An interesting thing has happened during this election , especially for progressives .
All of a sudden , we feel like we ’ve made a difference .
We feel like we ’ve taken our country back from the brink of something that no longer looked like the America we learned about in grade school .
We have ushered in to office , the first African American president , who is a northerner , an educated , literate man with progressive ideals , and we ’ve done it $ 5 or $ 25 , or $ 100 at a time .
We ’ve seen a grassroots movement that actually shaped not only the future of our nation , but the future of the world .
It feels pretty good .
My hunch is that this feeling is not going to help the likes of Sarah Palin .
Why ?
Because people feel empowered to make change .
I do n’t know if Alaskans will sit idly by while our Governor charges the state per diem to sleep in her house , or charges the state for her children ’s one way tickets and fancy hotel rooms , or while political appointments are based on religious idealogy and / or presence in the Wasilla High School year book .
I do n’t know if we ’ll be willing to swallow an administration that fires people and sullies their reputations because of a personal vendetta .
I do n’t know if Alaskans will forget the “ other ” Sarah Palin who incited cries of “ Kill him ! ” when she said that our President Elect was “ palling around with terrorists . ”
I do n’t know that Alaskans were able to deposit their permanent fund checks , and their energy rebate checks this year , and square that with watching our Governor sling accusations of “ socialism ” like it was a four letter word , and “ spreading the wealth ” like it was a moral crime .
Who knows .
Maybe I ’m wrong .
Alaskans have surprised me before …. like when they voted en masse for a convicted felon .
But anyone who lives here , does not underestimate the power of a mosquito .
There ’s a joke that the mosquito is the Alaska State Bird .
And when you get a whole lot of them agitated and looking for blood , you can definitely affect some kind of change in behavior .
I ’ve seen a giant bull moose standing in water up to its nostrils just to get relief from big black clouds of those pesky little creatures .
So why not a state government ?
It 's a tense , emotion - filled moment on All My Children ( but then , when is it not ? ) as wide - eyed Ryan says bye to Greenlee and walks off , apparently forgetting to return her underwear .
Keep your eyes peeled at : 12 , sports fans .
Buy Nothing Year
Freeconomist without a cent Today is ‘ Buy Nothing Day ’ , a chance for the wealthy to ease the pressure on their conscience – but pretty galling for anyone in genuine poverty .
We are all encouraged to take a “ global holiday from consumerism ” and have a 24 - hour break from any kind of shopping .
It certainly has an added resonance in the credit crunch .
It ’s quite another thing to go without spending any money for a whole year .
That ’s what Mark Boyle ( 29 ) says he planning to do .
Starting today Boyle , living in Bristol , South West England , aims to “ put his potatoes where his mouth is ” and become the ultimate “ freeconomist ” , living entirely off the land and the waste products of society .
Fuelled by his conviction that money really is the root of all evil , or at least the root cause of the profligate wastefulness of society , Boyle has a track record of failing to finish what he started .
Freegan or Freeloader ?
Earlier this year he set of on a walk from London to India with no money .
But he gave up at Calais when he discovered that no - one could understand him .
He set out with only T - shirts , a bandage and sandals , hoped to rely on the kindness of strangers for food and lodging .
But , because he could n’t speak French , people mistook him for a freeloader or an asylum seeker .
In his online diary at the start of his journey to Porbander , Gandhi ’s birthplace , he said : “ … not only did no one not speak the language , they had also seen us as just a bunch of freeloading backpackers . ”
Now the betting is that Boyle will give up once he had milked the publicity from his latest venture .
But that does n’t make his words any less true when he says : “ It ’s the disconnection we have with what we consume that is the primary cause of the wasteful culture we live in today , ” he says .
“ If we all had to grow our own food , we would n’t waste one third of it .
If we had to clean our own drinking water , we sure as hell would n’t s**t in it .
We ’ve absolutely no respect for the energy that goes into the things we consume and buy today , so we think nothing of throwing them ‘ away ’ . ”
Boyle has admitted that he appears a ” hypocrite ” but says he will now “ start living what I believe ” .
It ’s going to be tough : his caravan is heated only by a wood - burner made from an old gas bottle and a few bicycle parts , on which he will also cook his foraged or skip - salvaged meals .
What ’s more , there will be “ no pre-payment of bills , no storing up of food , no using the plug socket in the library ” .
Boyle says he will be completely off - grid , using “ transitional tools ” such as the laptop and phone only in as much as the sun can power them .
Lighting will be provided by his own home - made beeswax candles and a solar panel on the caravan ’s roof .
For transport , there ’s his trusty bike , equipped with waterproof panniers and a trailer , which he will be using to scavenge waste and dead wood for the stove .
If he needs to journey further afield , he will avail of the Liftshare scheme – a worldwide initiative where members share car journeys – or , failing that , hitchhike .
While Boyle ’s set - up sounds rather grim and spartan , the man himself is full of irrepressible enthusiasm , and he ’s refreshingly free of any kind of hectoring eco-piety .
“ The wood - burner is placed facing my bed , so I can watch the embers glow as I read a book on those cold winter evenings , ” he says happily .
“ This is not about sacrifice .
It ’s about appreciating the beautiful simplicity of life . ”
As the founder of the alternative “ Freeconomy ” community – a trust - based , money - free online group , where members share tools and skills instead of paying for them – Boyle is already further along the road of self - sufficiency than most of us .
But he ’s realistic enough to know that there will be many tricky moments ahead .
“ I ’ve been preparing a lot over the last couple of months , but the challenge will be the things I can’t plan for : a broken arm , exhaustion or – the worst case scenario – a family bereavement .
I suspect the most difficult thing will be socialising in a world that revolves around money .
I ’ll be living on a day - to - day basis , hand to mouth , which means I ’ll never really know where my next meal comes from . ”
Boyle ’s plans have already come in for some criticism from those who see the experiment as little more than a self - serving and rather grandiose publicity stunt .
Is he the ultimate freeconomist – or the ultimate freeloader ?
And , if the scheme really is a personal journey of self - sufficiency , why not keep it private ?
Boyle acknowledges that he is in a privileged position to be able to attempt the experiment in the first place .
He says the reason he is going to document it and talk about it is not to inflate his ego .
He may be a steadfastly sunny optimist , but Mark Boyle is no fool .
He knows that his year without cash is an infinitesimally small riposte to the excesses of global capitalism .
“ This is not a revolution , ” he says .
“ We ’re not going to get a world without money tomorrow .
But even if everyone thinks I have completely lost my mind , at least it may have made them question the role money plays in their own lives . ”

BOSTON ( MarketWatch ) -- A minimum of 10,000 workers at Merrill Lynch & Co. MER , +27.69 % are likely to lose their jobs after the company is acquired by Bank of America Corp.
BAC , - 1.32 % , Ladenburg Thalmann analyst Richard Bove wrote in a note to clients Tuesday .
" Bank of America 's ' slash and burn ' style following acquisitions is likely to be pronounced at Merrill , " Bove said .
" It overlaps with Bank of America in multiple divisions . "
Separately , Bloomberg reported that Merrill plans to cut about 500 jobs in its trading unit as Chief Executive John
Thain reduces the workforce to position for an economic slowdown .
Syria has accused the US of committing a " war crime " after a helicopter raid within its borders left eight people dead .
Sam is a BBC user who lives in Abu Kamal , the Syrian border town where the attack happened on Sunday .
He describes the local anger at the attack directed at America - and at Syrian authorities .
I live less than two miles ( three kilometres ) away from where it took place .
I was asleep at the time , but went to the hospital less than two hours afterwards .
Nearly everyone who had heard about it was there .
Syrian TV showed what appear to be bloodstains at the site of the attack Most of the people here have bitter anti-American sentiments and this has only added fuel to the fire .
We are also very disappointed with the lack of response from our own authorities .
The attack was in the village of Sukariya , which is inhabited almost entirely by the Mashahda tribe .
They are very relaxed , laid back people , not very religious - there 's no Mujahideen from this tribe .
The guard and the woman who died were very simple people .
They lived in a tent and were being paid to guard building materials such as cement and timber , 24 hours a day .
These people will have had nothing to do with the insurgency in Iraq .
Most of the people who live here have families in Iraq .
A lot of smuggling goes on : bringing guns and sheep from Iraq to Syria .
There is security everywhere in this country .
The government is very severe with the locals ; if they have a tip - off that someone has a stolen gun , the place will be surrounded in two minutes .
But yesterday there was zero response .
The attack happened close to a bridge over the Euphrates and there are military posts either side of the bridge - so very near .
But the army is indecisive when it comes to action .
The people who were killed were harmless , they should have been protected .
It is a very saddening experience .
People talk about patriotism , but when it comes to action - nothing .
People here hate America more than before and they are disappointed in their own authorities ' response .

Most Ponzi schemes collapse relatively quickly , but there is fragmentary evidence that Mr. Madoff ’s scheme may have lasted for years or even decades .
A Boston whistle - blower has claimed that he tried to alert the S.E.C. to the scheme as early as 1999 , and the weekly newspaper Barron ’s raised questions about Mr. Madoff ’s returns and strategy in 2001 , although it did not accuse him of wrongdoing .
Investors may have been duped because Mr. Madoff sent detailed brokerage statements to investors whose money he managed , sometimes reporting hundreds of individual stock trades per month .
Investors who asked for their money back could have it returned within days .
And while typical Ponzi schemes promise very high returns , Mr. Madoff ’s promised returns were relatively realistic  about 10 percent a year  though they were unrealistically steady .
Mr. Madoff was not running an actual hedge fund , but instead managing accounts for investors inside his own securities firm .
The difference , though seemingly minor , is crucial .
Hedge funds typically hold their portfolios at banks and brokerage firms like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs .
Outside auditors can check with those banks and brokerage firms to make sure the funds exist .
But because he had his own securities firm , Mr. Madoff kept custody over his clients ’ accounts and processed all their stock trades himself .
His only check appears to have been Friehling & Horowitz , a tiny auditing firm based in New City , N.Y .
Wealthy individuals and other money managers entrusted billions of dollars to funds that in turn invested in his firm , based on his reputation and reported returns .
Victims of the scam included gray - haired grandmothers in Florida , investment companies in London , and charities and universities across the United States .
The Wilpon family , the main owners of the New York Mets , and Yeshiva University both confirmed that they had invested with Mr. Madoff , and a Jewish charity in Massachusetts said it would lay off its five employees and close after losing nearly all of its $ 7 million endowment .
Other investors included prominent Jewish families in New York and Florida .
On Friday afternoon , investors and lawyers for investors with Mr. Madoff packed Judge Louis L. Stanton ’s courtroom at federal court in Manhattan , hoping to question lawyers for Mr. Madoff and the S.E.C .
But a deputy for Judge Stanton canceled the hearing , leaving investors with few answers .
Several investors said they were planning to file lawsuits against the firm in the hope of recovering some money .
Based on the vagueness of the complaints against Mr. Madoff , his confession , as detailed in court filings , seems to have taken the F.B.I. and S.E.C. by surprise .
Investigators have not explained when they believe the fraud began , how much money was ultimately lost and whether Mr. Madoff lost investors ’ money in the markets , spent it , or both .
It is not even clear whether Mr. Madoff actually made any of the trades he reported to investors .
China ’s foreign trade took a tumble last month , as exports shrank for the first time in more than seven years and imports plunged .
The 2.2 % drop in exports from November 2007 , reported by the government Wednesday , underscores the rapidly deteriorating conditions in China ’s economy .
In October , the nation had posted a 19.2 % jump in exports from a year earlier .
“ It basically reflects what you ’re seeing on the ground : Factories are closing , ” said Andy Xie , an independent economist in Shanghai .
“ It ’s very grim , ” he added .
“ You can bet the next few months are going to be worse . ”

China ’s exports to the U.S. fell especially hard , dropping 6.1 % as Americans socked by the recession reined in their spending .
Wessco International in Los Angeles is forecasting a 10 % to 20 % decline next year in the volume of toiletry kits , stationery , bags and other products that it makes largely in China for airlines , hotels and cruise lines , said Petros Sakkis , Wessco ’s manager based in Hangzhou .
That could be mitigated by new business that Wessco is chasing in China , the Middle East and Europe , he said .
Less than a year ago , U.S. companies with production operations in China were fretting about the appreciating Chinese currency , soaring raw material costs and pressure from local governments that seemed to want only high - end manufacturing .
But all that ’s eased since the global financial crisis took hold and spread to China .
“ China needs us again , ” Sakkis said .

China ’s imports fell more dramatically than exports -- down 17.9 % in November from a year earlier .
The drop , partly reflecting the decline in commodity prices , boosted China ’s monthly trade surplus to about $ 40 billion , a record high , although it was hardly news to cheer about in Beijing .
Some analysts said the wider gap could add to trade tensions between China and its major partners : the U.S. and Europe .
The erosion of imports indicates weakening domestic demand .
And the pullback in export orders from around the world has dealt a blow to China ’s industrial base and wiped out countless jobs , triggering labor unrest that poses a severe test to the Communist Party leadership .
“ On the one hand , government does n’t want exports to drop dramatically and hurt social stability , ” said Zhang Bin , deputy director of international finance at the Institute of World Economics and Politics , a government think tank in Beijing .
“ But on the other hand , it is necessary for China to have a structural adjustment and industry upgrade . . . to decrease some exports and transfer resources from the manufacturing industry to the service industry . ”

Zhang says he thinks the central government ’s recently announced $ 586 - billion economic stimulus package , consisting mainly of infrastructure projects , will be enough to sustain adequate growth .
The government , though , is expected to continue loosening lending policies and pushing through measures to bolster the sagging property market and help export businesses .
China ’s efforts may get a boost from new data today that showed the nation ’s inflation rate falling further in November as sharp jumps in food and energy costs eased .
Consumer prices rose 2.4 % over the year - earlier period , the government said .
That was down from October ’s 4 % increase , and could give Beijing added room to spur economic growth without provoking more price hikes .
November ’s trade report was released as top leaders in Beijing , concluding an annual economic planning meeting , pledged to maintain a “ stable , healthy growth ” next year by boosting domestic demand and restructuring the economy , according to the official New China News Agency .

But Chinese leaders are facing powerful global head winds .
Exports to the U.S. had been slipping for some months , but more recently , Europe , Japan and the Asia - Pacific region also have cut back on orders .
Chinese - made steel products , electrical machinery , electronics and light manufacturing , such as apparel , all saw a sharp decline last month , analysts said .
“ Demand is simply disappearing , ” Tao Wang , a UBS Securities economist in Beijing , said in a research report .
Among the hardest - hit sectors has been China ’s shipbuilding industry , which is reeling from cancellations .
That in turn has rippled down to suppliers such as Dalian Lushun Xinfei Ship Machinery Co. in northeastern China .
“ Many of the small manufacturers in our area are half - dead , ” said Li Jiyou , the company ’s general manager .
He said his 20 - year - old business would be lucky to break even this year , and he feared what lay ahead .

“ The aftershocks [ of the global credit crisis ] have n’t yet spread completely to our industry .
Next year is going to be a big challenge for us . ”

Man with 84 wives remanded in prison could be put to death
An 84 - year - old Nigerian Muslim with 86 wives , Alhaji Bello Abubakar Masaba , has been arrested and charged to an Islamic Sharia court in Bida , capital of Nigeria ’s northern Niger State , for ’’ insulting or inciting the content of a religious creed and unlawful marriage ’’ .
Back in 1955 , a Sears store had an advertisement listing Santa Claus ’ phone number , prompting children to call and speak with the generous old man .
Naturally , thousands of children tried to call .
What they did n’t know is that the number had been misprinted , and was actually the emergency number for CONAD , NORAD ‘s ancestor .
The man in charge of the organization , in an act of generosity , asked his team to verify Santa ’s location using radar echoes , and when children called the number , they were given the speculated position of Santa ’s sleigh .
From this point , it became a tradition at NORAD to follow Santa ’s movement across the world .
Naturally , as years passed , NORAD has modernized its technique to follow the bearded fellow , using 47 radar installations and multiple geostationary satellites to carefully monitor his progress .
So this year again , on December 24 , for the fiftieth consecutive year ( 1958 – 2008 ) , NORAD will be following Santa Claus ’s journey across the world , inviting kids to follow him on a Web site dedicated to the task , noradsanta.org .
And for the second time , the site will be using Google Maps and Google Earth to display the location of the gift - filled sleigh .
Last year , NORAD Tracks Santa received over 10 million unique visitors from 212 different countries .

Gonzo author Hunter S. Thompson committed suicide in 2005 , leaving behind his new wife and grown son .
Thoughtfully , he left his frozen sperm behind for widow Anita Thompson , as she confessed in Scotland 's Sunday Herald .
" Hunter and I were always trying to have children , " she says , " but we just never did ...
Hunter was such a loving person that it would have been a joy to have a family with him , " she says , and then adds , almost casually : " But I could still have his child if I want to . "
As this bombshell resonates , Thompson opens up , clams up , opens up again .
There are certain things she wants off the record - specifically the words " frozen sperm " .
I respect those wishes , naturally , but , having tried for several days , I genuinely can't think of any other way to put it .
" He left that possibility for me but it 's a long series of ethical questions for me whether I would want to have his child now . "

CNN Deputy Political Director
( CNN ) —
A new national poll suggests that three out of four Americans feel President Bush ’s departure from office is coming not a moment too soon .
Twenty - eight percent of those polled say President Bush is the worst president in U.S. history .
Seventy - five percent of those questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Friday said they ’re glad Bush is going ; 23 percent indicated they ’ll miss him .
“ Earlier this year , Bush scored some of the lowest presidential approval ratings we ’ve seen in half a century , so it ’s understandable that the public is eager for a new president to step in , ” said Keating Holland , CNN polling director .
CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider added , “ As President Bush prepares to leave office , the American public has a parting thought : Good riddance .
At least that ’s the way three - quarters feel . ”
The portion who say they wo n’t miss Bush is 24 percentage points higher than the 51 percent who said they would n’t miss President Bill Clinton when he left office in January 2001 .
Forty - five percent of those questioned at that time said they would miss Clinton .
The poll indicates that Bush compares poorly with his presidential predecessors , with 28 percent saying that he ’s the worst ever .
Forty percent rate Bush ’s presidency as poor , and 31 percent say he ’s been a good president .
Only a third of those polled said they want Bush to remain active in public life after he leaves the White House .
That 33 percent figure is 22 points lower than those in 2001 who wanted Bill Clinton to retain a public role .

Questions linger after Bush withdraws pardon
Poll : 23 percent call Cheney worst vice president ever
“ It ’s been like a failed marriage , ” Schneider said .
“ Things started out well .
When President Bush first took office in 2001 , more than 60 percent saw him as strong and decisive .
That impression was confirmed after the September 11th attacks .
The public still saw Bush as strong and decisive when he took office a second time in 2005 .
“ But no more .
The public has completely lost confidence in this president , ” Schneider said .
Bush has dropped on a number of measures , but possibly the biggest is that only 20 percent say he inspires confidence , Holland said .
“ That ’s an important figure when the country is facing its biggest economic crisis in a generation , ” he added .
When running for the White House in the 2000 presidential campaign , Bush promised to be a uniter and not a divider .
But 82 percent of poll respondents felt that Bush did not unite the country , compared with 17 percent who said he did .
“ The vast majority of Americans believe he betrayed his promise to unite the country , ” Schneider said .
“ He took a country that was divided under President Clinton and he divided it worse . ”
Only 27 percent of those questioned in the poll approve of the way Bush is handling his job as president ; 72 percent disapprove .
“ President Bush ’s job approval rating has been at or below freezing since the beginning of the year , ” Schneider said .
“ The current 27 percent approval rating is one of the lowest ratings for any president , ever . ”
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted December 19 - 21 , with 1,013 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey ’s sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .

United Hypermiles Trans - Pacific Flights , Proves Flaws with FAA
Many of us will be hopping on a flight to visit the family this holiday season , but what kind of mileage are we getting up there ?
Â
Airlines are strapped these days and consequently cut costs , weight , and services to make a buck — including fuel consumption .
Â
As a frequent flier , I can report that generally means : surcharges on luggage , limited use of A/C until the cabin reaches 110 - degrees , and packed flights for maximum dollars - per-mile .
The most efficient use of travel time and fuel consumption is simply choosing the proper route taken .
Â
Flights simply cannot fly directly to their destination in a straight line or gradually up to cruise altitude and back down .
Â
Planes have to travel on designated “ highways ” and take a jagged path to be tracked by air traffic control .
Â
Descending from maximum altitude , the path would look like stair steps as each controller is handed off the flight into their airspace .
Image : Marcin Wichary
So , our controllers are using 1970 ’s technology , are overworked , and the system is taxed to the limit ( just fly through O’Hare on any given day and you ’ll see ) .
Â
Airlines are trying methods of their own to save fuel with what they have to work with .
Â United Airlines conducted a series of fuel saving measures on a recent flight from Sydney to San Francisco using Boeing ’s latest airliner , the 777 .
The Asia -Pacific airspace is a large , less - crowded area in which to conduct fuel economy runs .
Â
In this case , the FAA joined the team to allow a gradual decent , instead of the forced , step - down descent .
Â
In total , 11 fuel saving techniques saved 1,564 gallons of fuel and prevented the release of 32,656 pounds of carbon emissions .
Â
Some of these tricks include single - engine taxiing to the runway , direct routing , and a priority approach to landing , instead of slowing to “ get in line ” to land .
Â
Most airliners these days have a flight computer designed to maximize fuel economy , but the ATC system forces another scenario .
So what about that trip to Grandma ’s house in Cleveland ?
Â
Here is where the root of problem is fully exposed .
Â
Frankly , our air traffic system is a crumbling existence of our failing infrastructure .
Â
The federal government has not placed a sufficient focus on upgrading the system , so we ’re stuck with the wasteful , inefficient design .
Â
Even with a reduction in flights lately , the system is consistently overloaded .
Image : eschipul
The scenario is much like a crowded metro highway .
Â
On-ramps with traffic entry control lights are like runways with ATC holding flight before takeoff into the departure pattern .
Â
For safe spacing distances , planes slow down just like traffic jams , and exit ramps pile - up just like approach control with planes circling or slowing down .
Â
All it would take is what ’s called the “ NextGen ” system .
This is a solution , but it is taking quite a while to implement .
Â
The system will use satellite tracking and updated computer systems to allow a smoother flow of flights to their direct destination and more efficient departure and arrival queues .
Â
So , around 2012 - 2018 , we could see an improvement .
Â
If you ’re concerned with emissions , choose an airline with a documented carbon offset scheme .
Â
In the meantime , pack light and chip - in for that extra bag .

慶應大学湘南藤沢キャンパ ス( SFC ) のリニューア ルWeb
追記2008/12/20 : 旧 HTML版と新Flashの両方が表示できるように修正されています。
まだいくつかリンクが切れているなどの問題はありますが、今後徐々に修正されていくと予想しています。
中のかた、素早い修正お疲れ様です。
昨日、私の母校である慶應義塾大学湘南藤沢キャンパス( SFC ) のWebサイトがリニューアルされていました。
しかし、残念ながら私のまわりでは非常に評判が悪いです。
以下、どのように変わって、何が批判されているのかをまとめてみました。
アクセシビリティゼ ロ
JavaScriptをOFFにすると何も見られません。
お使いのブラウザでは 当サイトをご覧いただくことができません。 最新版 のFlashプレーヤーをダウンロードしていただき JavaScriptを有効にしていただく必要があります。
HTMLを見るとbody部分は以下のようになっています。
< body > < div id =" flashcontent " > <!-- message --> < div id =" message " > <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name= " message " --> <h1>お使いのブラウザでは<br />当サイトをご覧いただくことができません。</h1 > < h3>最新版の Flashプレーヤーをダウンロードしていただき < br />JavaScriptを有効にしていただく必要があります。</h3>< br /> < h5 >< a href= " http://get.adobe.com/jp/flashplayer/ " target = " _blank " >
→ Flash プレーヤーのダウンロード</a></h5 > <!-- InstanceEndEditable --> </div> </div > < script type=" text / javascript " >
//<![ CDATA [ HIGEWheel.join(attributes.id ) ; // ] > </ script > </ body >
視覚障害を持つ友人私の友人は音声化ソフト(音声ブラウザ)を使ってWebを読んでいますが、今回のリニューアル後はその音声化ソフトが落ちるようになったそうです。 修正されるまで「 SFCのWebサイトはもう見ることがない」そうです。
そして各種デバイス排除
Flashを使えない各種デバイスでは、SFCのWebサイトを見ることが不可能になってしまいました。 例えば、iPhoneやiPod Touch はFlash非対応です。 携帯電話でも表示不能な機種が多そうです。 テレビに内蔵されているブラウザ もFlash非対応のものがあります。
大学のトップページがそれをやってしまうのはマズイのではないでしょうか？ 少なくとも「情報とは何か」に対して重点を置いてあるはずのSFCのWebサイトで、これはマズイ気がしてなりません。
ページランクをゴミ箱へ
site:www.sfc.keio.ac.jpで検索してみて下さい。 ほとんどのURLが以下のようなメッセージが表示される状態になっています。
お探しのページは見つかりませんでした。 リンクが無効になっているか、アドレス（URL）のタイプミスの可能性があります。
これにより、多くの検索エンジンに登録されてきたWebページは無効となり、Web経由の訪問者は激減することでしょう。
この時期に大量のURLを無効にしてしまうのは、受験生を減らすために送り込まれた工作員の仕業なのではないかと思うほど痛いことだと思います。
過去の資産として積み上げてきたURLは復活させた方が良いと思われます。
受験生はどうやって見ればいいのだろう？
先生の顔を知らないと発見できません。 顔を知っていてもアイコンが小さくて発見しにくいです。
私も直接お世話になった先生を発見するのに10分近くかかりました。
そもそも、アイコンがブラウザの画面外に出ていたりして発見できない場合もあります。
アイコンをドラッグしても、勝手にどこかに逃げて言ってしまいますし。
さて、そのような状態で受験生はどうやって研究室を知るのでしょうか？
有名な先生の顔をクリックして、その他は全然見ないという傾向が強まるのではないでしょうか？
ロードが遅 い
毎回ロードを待たされます。 「 SFC 」という文字の上に教員の顔写真がドンドン張られていきます。
初めての一回はまだいいのですが、何度も見ようと思うとちょっと気になります。
例えば、授業情報を知りたい在校生はロード画面で何度も待たされるとイライラすると思います。
重い。。 。
動作が重いです。 6年ぐらい前 のWindows PC見ると恐ろしく動作が重いです。
UI がわかりにくい
どこをどうすれば良いのか理解するのに時間がかかりました。
例えば、教員の顔アイコンをクリックすると固定できることに気がつくのに10分ほどかかりました。
アイコンが小さくて発見しにくいというのもありました。
以前のデザインの評判が良かった
以前のSFCのページは、サイトコンセプト/アクセシビリティ/デザイン面が非常に評価されていたと思います。 雑誌やWebデザイン本などで参考用にSFCのWebが紹介されているのを何度も見たことがあります。
そのため、今回の変更はあまりに落差が激しくなってしまっているのではないかと思います。
ただ、 「前が良かったから」と言って変化を嫌うのは良い事ではないのであまりこの点は強調したくないところでもあります。
でも完成度が高い部分もある
Flashの作りこみやデザインという面で考えると完成度は高いと思われます。
人と人のつながりを可視化していたり、人だけではなく学科などの視点でのクラスタリングもできるのは秀逸です。
初期画面
学部のアイコンをクリックすると以下のようになります。
さらに、教員のアイコンをクリックすると、その教員がクローズアップされたうえに関係者もアイコンが拡大されます。
先生の写真をドラッグして移動すると関係者が一緒に引っ張られていったり、自動的に他の写真が避けていったりする様子は一見の価値があります。
Flashコンテンツとしては凄いものであり完成度は恐ろしく高いと思いますが、使う場所が適切とは言えず非常に残念です。
学際的学科という面もありそう
SFC は様々な研究が集合した学際的な学科です。
数学を扱ったり/半田ゴテでデバイスを作ったり/ソフトウェアを作ったり/インターネットを作ったり/ゲノム解析したりするような理系的な研究室がある一方で、福祉を考えたり/語学を研究してたり/地域政治を研究しているような研究室もあります。
さらに、看護医療学部もあります。
何か一貫したテーマがあれば説明がしやすいのですが、先生や研究室によってやっている事があまりに違うので、ワラワラとまとめるようなものでなかれば表現しにくいという悩みはありそうです。
これだけ発散したテーマに対する一覧性を実現しているという面では、評価できる表現手法であると思います。
特設ページにすべきだったと思う
何かの目的を持っていたり、有期のイベントのためのものであればフルに全部フラッシュでも良い気がします。
イベント物はアクセシビリティを無視しても良いと言っているわけではありませんが、常に情報を提示し続ける必要があるものではないイベント関連ならば許してもらえると思われます。
Flashは表現力が高くなるので、イベントなどではアピール効果がプレーンテキストのサイトよりも効果的になる場合もありそうです。
しかし、定常的に情報をWeb上で提示し続けるという用途には向いていないと思われます。
結局は表現力とアクセシビリティを天秤にかけて、どこまでどうするかを判断するというトレードオフなのではないでしょうか。
元に戻す事を提案します
「 元に戻しましょうよ。。。。」というのが、今回のWebサイトリニューアルに関しての個人的な感想です。
いや 、Flashで作りこまれた新しいWebも非常に苦労が見えていて良いのですが、特設サイトや教員案内新コーナーとして別URLを作ってやった方が良いと思います。
「 情報を発信すること」を目的とした大学のWebサイトがFlashだけというのは、ちょっと恥ずかしいことだと思います。
ただ 、Flashの作り込みそのものは評価できます。 それなので、折角の成果物は成果物として「新コーナー」にしてはどうでしょうか？
過去の遺産を踏み潰したり、排他的なものになっているのは色々と見落としていた結果であり、意図するところでは無いと信じています。
以上、残念ながらかなり批判的な文章になっていますが、SFCのWebサイトリニューアルを見た感想でした。
最後に
こんな検索キーワードいかがでしょうか？
「 site:www.sfc.keio.ac.jp W3C 」

政策・メディア研究科/SFC研究所
W3C の加藤文彦さんか らSFCへの公開質問状及び改善提案です。
「 SFC のサイトリニューアルの件について 」
追記 2008/12/20
12月20日1時現在、トップページでFlashとHTMLを選択する構成に変更されています。
Flashの軽量化として、読み込み画面を改造したり、教員マップをdefault非表示にして右上に表示用アイコンを漂わせたりしてあります。
まだ復活していないURLやリンク切れ等があるようですが、徐々に修正されていくものと思います。
非常に早急な対応であると思います(中のかた、お疲れ様です ) 。

Virgin Media has launched its new 50 Megabits per second ( Mbps ) domestic broadband service .
In doing so it will be the first UK ISP to roll out a next generation broadband service that runs far faster than most others available to UK web users .
The new 50 Mbps service will cost £ 51 a month , although this is reduced to £ 35 if users also take a Virgin Phone line for an additional £ 11 a month .
The service will put Virgin at the top of the speed league for UK ISPs .
Close behind is Be Broadband which offers a 24 M bps service for £ 17.50 per month .
The details of the service were released during a news conference on Monday .
Trials of the high - speed service were carried out in Kent during 2008 .
The service will be rolled out country - wide over the next six months .
The news comes as the cable group announces that it will cut 2,200 jobs by 2012 .
Rival competition BT has announced that Muswell Hill , in London , and Whitchurch , in Cardiff , will be the first pilot sites for its fibre - based broadband trial , which will begin in the summer of 2009 .
Up to 15,000 homes and businesses will get the chance to take part in a trial of fibre to the cabinet technology which can deliver speeds of up to 40 Mbps .
It has said it will invest £ 1.5 bn in laying fibre as far as its street cabinets .
The connection from the street cabinet to people 's homes will rely on copper lines .
What will deliver next - generation broadband ?
Rural areas see jump in broadband Charlie Ponsonby at comparison site Simplify Digital said higher speeds would drive changes in the way people use the web .
" As we see an increasing blur between the TV set and the PC , with on - demand content flowing seamlessly between the two , people 's appetite for broadband speed will head rapidly upwards , " he said .
" Today 's average of about 2 Mbps will soon seem as inadequate as a 56 Kbps dial - up connection already seems to the great majority of web users , " he added .
Not everyone is convinced that the cable modem technology on offer from Virgin Media will be enough to satisfy speed - hungry consumers .
The president of the Fibre to the Home Council of Europe , Joeri Van Bogaert , said : " Cable modem can be complementary to fibre to the home ( FTTH ) but is in no way a substitute , " he said .
" The main issue is speed .
While FTTH can easily deliver speeds of up to 100 Mbps and could eventually pump out 1000 Mbps , Virgin 's service offers 50 Mbps and is asymmetric .
" This means that uploading content will be much slower than download speeds . "

TOKYO --
For most of this year , Sony Corp . 's PlayStation 3 videogame console seemed finally to be taking off after a slow start .
The PS3 , trailing Nintendo Co.'s Wii and Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox 360 consoles , was closing in on the No. 2 Xbox 360 , with new games and quarterly sales growth at twice the speed of last year .
But early results from this holiday season are n't promising .
U.S. sales of the PS3 fell 19 % last month from a year earlier , while sales doubled for the Wii console and rose 8 % for the Xbox 360 , according to research ...
Why is GM ( and Ford and Chrysler ) seeking taxpayer subsidies when Toyota , Honda , Nissan , Kia , BMW , Daimler , Hyundai and other foreign nameplate producers , who are facing the same contracting demand and credit crunch quietly weathering the storm , are not ?
Because the latter have costs structures that have n’t been made obsolete and uneconomic by ludicrous union demands ( see chart above , data here ) .
And , of course , they make cars that Americans want to buy .

Trackbacks KopBusters Hoax Looks Like
It Was a Hoax Itself :
I thought it would be interesting to see if there were any new developments on the story , and it seems that recent developments point in the direction of the show being a misrepresentation and the claims of police misconduct being false .
In particular , it seems that KopBusters staffers themselves made an anonymous tip to try to cause the police to get a warrant .
( The show director has declined to say whether staffers sent in the tip -- a weird position perhaps best explained by the fact that making a false crime report is a crime .
However , a Google cache of the show 's message board shows a post , since edited , indicating that it did .
Compare a contemporary reference to the pre-edited version
In light of these developments , the KopBusters show is now taking the view that the episode does n't show police misconduct but rather " judge misconduct , " on the theory that the anonymous tip should n't have amounted to probable cause and the judge should n't have signed the warrant .
( See Related Posts ( on one page ) : KopBusters Hoax Looks Like It Was a Hoax Itself : KopBusters Reality Show :
A few weeks ago , I posted about what was supposed to be a new reality TV show , " KopBusters , " that showcased police misconduct .
The first show was about a fake drug house in Odessa , Texas , that the police allegedly raided without probable cause based on a bogus warrant .
I then added an update , to the effect that " [ s ] ome of the details about the show and the first episode seem sort of fishy at this stage , so perhaps it is best to approach this story with a healthy skepticism .
" I thought it would be interesting to see if there were any new developments on the story , and it seems that recent developments point in the direction of the show being a misrepresentation and the claims of police misconduct being false .
In particular , it seems that KopBusters staffers themselves made an anonymous tip to try to cause the police to get a warrant .

However , a Google cache of the show 's message board shows a post , since edited , indicating that it did .
Compare a contemporary reference to the pre-edited version here with the edited version here . )
In light of these developments , the KopBusters show is now taking the view that the episode does n't show police misconduct but rather " judge misconduct , " on the theory that the anonymous tip should n't have amounted to probable cause and the judge should n't have signed the warrant .
( See here , at the bottom . )
The problem with this argument is that as explained here , the anonymous tip had a number of details that would help corroborate the story and help create probable cause .
It 's hard to know without actually reading the affidavit whether its facts actually amounted to probable cause , but an anonymous tip can create probable cause if it 's sufficiently detailed and the police corroborate those details , see Illinois v. Gates , 462 U.S. 213 ( 1983 ) .
I would need to read the warrant affidavit to know if that happened here .
But at the very least the claims of police misconduct appear to be false , and all we seem to have left are some debatable claims that a judge may have signed a warrant that may have been based on less than probable cause .
Holocaust survivor and Nobel Laureate , Elie Wiesel , gave this impassioned speech in the East Room of the White House on April 12 , 1999 , as part of the Millennium Lecture series , hosted by President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton .
In the summer of 1944 , as a teenager in Hungary , Elie Wiesel , along with his father , mother and sisters , were deported by the Nazis to Auschwitz extermination camp in occupied Poland .
Upon arrival there , Wiesel and his father were selected by SS Dr. Josef Mengele for slave labor and wound up at the nearby Buna rubber factory .
Daily life included starvation rations of soup and bread , brutal discipline , and a constant struggle against overwhelming despair .
At one point , young Wiesel received 25 lashes of the whip for a minor infraction .
In January 1945 , as the Russian Army drew near , Wiesel and his father were hurriedly evacuated from Auschwitz by a forced march to Gleiwitz and then via an open train car to Buchenwald in Germany , where his father , mother , and a younger sister eventually died .
Wiesel was liberated by American troops in April 1945 .
After the war , he moved to Paris and became a journalist then later settled in New York .
Since 1976 , he has been Andrew Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Boston University .
He has received numerous awards and honors including the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize and the Presidential Medal of Freedom .
He was also the Founding Chair of the United States Holocaust Memorial .
Wiesel has written over 40 books including Night , a harrowing chronicle of his Holocaust experience , first published in 1960 .
At the White House lecture , Wiesel was introduced by Hillary Clinton who stated , " It was more than a year ago that I asked Elie if he would be willing to participate in these Millennium Lectures ... I never could have imagined that when the time finally came for him to stand in this spot and to reflect on the past century and the future to come , that we would be seeing children in Kosovo crowded into trains , separated from families , separated from their homes , robbed of their childhoods , their memories , their humanity . "
Listen to the entire speech
Mr. President , Mrs. Clinton , members of Congress , Ambassador Holbrooke , Excellencies , friends : Fifty - four years ago to the day , a young Jewish boy from a small town in the Carpathian Mountains woke up , not far from Goethe 's beloved Weimar , in a place of eternal infamy called Buchenwald .
He was finally free , but there was no joy in his heart .
He thought there never would be again .
Liberated a day earlier by American soldiers , he remembers their rage at what they saw .
And even if he lives to be a very old man , he will always be grateful to them for that rage , and also for their compassion .
Though he did not understand their language , their eyes told him what he needed to know -- that they , too , would remember , and bear witness .
And now , I stand before you , Mr. President -- Commander - in - Chief of the army that freed me , and tens of thousands of others -- and I am filled with a profound and abiding gratitude to the American people .
Gratitude is a word that I cherish .
Gratitude is what defines the humanity of the human being .
And I am grateful to you , Hillary -- or Mrs. Clinton -- for what you said , and for what you are doing for children in the world , for the homeless , for the victims of injustice , the victims of destiny and society .
And I thank all of you for being here .
We are on the threshold of a new century , a new millennium .
What will the legacy of this vanishing century be ?
How will it be remembered in the new millennium ?
Surely it will be judged , and judged severely , in both moral and metaphysical terms .
These failures have cast a dark shadow over humanity : two World Wars , countless civil wars , the senseless chain of assassinations -- Gandhi , the Kennedys , Martin Luther King , Sadat , Rabin -- bloodbaths in Cambodia and Nigeria , India and Pakistan , Ireland and Rwanda , Eritrea and Ethiopia , Sarajevo and Kosovo ; the inhumanity in the gulag and the tragedy of Hiroshima .
And , on a different level , of course , Auschwitz and Treblinka .
So much violence , so much indifference .
What is indifference ?
Etymologically , the word means " no difference . "
A strange and unnatural state in which the lines blur between light and darkness , dusk and dawn , crime and punishment , cruelty and compassion , good and evil .
What are its courses and inescapable consequences ?
Is it a philosophy ?
Is there a philosophy of indifference conceivable ?
Can one possibly view indifference as a virtue ?
Is it necessary at times to practice it simply to keep one 's sanity , live normally , enjoy a fine meal and a glass of wine , as the world around us experiences harrowing upheavals ?
Of course , indifference can be tempting -- more than that , seductive .
It is so much easier to look away from victims .
It is so much easier to avoid such rude interruptions to our work , our dreams , our hopes .
It is , after all , awkward , troublesome , to be involved in another person 's pain and despair .
Yet , for the person who is indifferent , his or her neighbor are of no consequence .
And , therefore , their lives are meaningless .
Their hidden or even visible anguish is of no interest .
Indifference reduces the other to an abstraction .
Over there , behind the black gates of Auschwitz , the most tragic of all prisoners were the " Muselmanner , " as they were called .
Wrapped in their torn blankets , they would sit or lie on the ground , staring vacantly into space , unaware of who or where they were , strangers to their surroundings .
They no longer felt pain , hunger , thirst .
They feared nothing .
They felt nothing .
They were dead and did not know it .
Rooted in our tradition , some of us felt that to be abandoned by humanity then was not the ultimate .
We felt that to be abandoned by God was worse than to be punished by Him .
Better an unjust God than an indifferent one .
For us to be ignored by God was a harsher punishment than to be a victim of His anger .
Man can live far from God -- not outside God .
God is wherever we are .
Even in suffering ?
Even in suffering .
In a way , to be indifferent to that suffering is what makes the human being inhuman .
Indifference , after all , is more dangerous than anger and hatred .
Anger can at times be creative .
One writes a great poem , a great symphony , one does something special for the sake of humanity because one is angry at the injustice that one witnesses .
But indifference is never creative .
Even hatred at times may elicit a response .
You fight it .
You denounce it .
You disarm it .
Indifference elicits no response .
Indifference is not a response .
Indifference is not a beginning , it is an end .
And , therefore , indifference is always the friend of the enemy , for it benefits the aggressor -- never his victim , whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten .
The political prisoner in his cell , the hungry children , the homeless refugees -- not to respond to their plight , not to relieve their solitude by offering them a spark of hope is to exile them from human memory .
And in denying their humanity we betray our own .
Indifference , then , is not only a sin , it is a punishment .
And this is one of the most important lessons of this outgoing century 's wide - ranging experiments in good and evil .
In the place that I come from , society was composed of three simple categories : the killers , the victims , and the bystanders .
During the darkest of times , inside the ghettoes and death camps -- and I 'm glad that Mrs. Clinton mentioned that we are now commemorating that event , that period , that we are now in the Days of Remembrance -- but then , we felt abandoned , forgotten .
All of us did .
And our only miserable consolation was that we believed that Auschwitz and Treblinka were closely guarded secrets ; that the leaders of the free world did not know what was going on behind those black gates and barbed wire ; that they had no knowledge of the war against the Jews that Hitler 's armies and their accomplices waged as part of the war against the Allies .
If they knew , we thought , surely those leaders would have moved heaven and earth to intervene .
They would have spoken out with great outrage and conviction .
They would have bombed the railways leading to Birkenau , just the railways , just once .
And now we knew , we learned , we discovered that the Pentagon knew , the State Department knew .
And the illustrious occupant of the White House then , who was a great leader -- and I say it with some anguish and pain , because , today is exactly 54 years marking his death -- Franklin Delano Roosevelt died on April the 12th , 1945 , so he is very much present to me and to us .
No doubt , he was a great leader .
He mobilized the American people and the world , going into battle , bringing hundreds and thousands of valiant and brave soldiers in America to fight fascism , to fight dictatorship , to fight Hitler .
And so many of the young people fell in battle .
And , nevertheless , his image in Jewish history -- I must say it -- his image in Jewish history is flawed .
The depressing tale of the St. Louis is a case in point .
Sixty years ago , its human cargo -- maybe 1,000 Jews -- was turned back to Nazi Germany .
And that happened after the Kristallnacht , after the first state sponsored pogrom , with hundreds of Jewish shops destroyed , synagogues burned , thousands of people put in concentration camps .
And that ship , which was already on the shores of the United States , was sent back .
I do n't understand .
Roosevelt was a good man , with a heart .
He understood those who needed help .
Why did n't he allow these refugees to disembark ?
A thousand people -- in America , a great country , the greatest democracy , the most generous of all new nations in modern history .
What happened ?
I do n't understand .
Why the indifference , on the highest level , to the suffering of the victims ?
But then , there were human beings who were sensitive to our tragedy .
Those non-Jews , those Christians , that we called the " Righteous Gentiles , " whose selfless acts of heroism saved the honor of their faith .
Why were they so few ?
Why was there a greater effort to save SS murderers after the war than to save their victims during the war ?
Why did some of America 's largest corporations continue to do business with Hitler 's Germany until 1942 ?
It has been suggested , and it was documented , that the Wehrmacht could not have conducted its invasion of France without oil obtained from American sources .
How is one to explain their indifference ?
And yet , my friends , good things have also happened in this traumatic century : the defeat of Nazism , the collapse of communism , the rebirth of Israel on its ancestral soil , the demise of apartheid , Israel 's peace treaty with Egypt , the peace accord in Ireland .
And let us remember the meeting , filled with drama and emotion , between Rabin and Arafat that you , Mr. President , convened in this very place .
I was here and I will never forget it .
And then , of course , the joint decision of the United States and NATO to intervene in Kosovo and save those victims , those refugees , those who were uprooted by a man whom I believe that because of his crimes , should be charged with crimes against humanity .
But this time , the world was not silent .
This time , we do respond .
This time , we intervene .
Does it mean that we have learned from the past ?
Does it mean that society has changed ?
Has the human being become less indifferent and more human ?
Have we really learned from our experiences ?
Are we less insensitive to the plight of victims of ethnic cleansing and other forms of injustices in places near and far ?
Is today 's justified intervention in Kosovo , led by you , Mr. President , a lasting warning that never again will the deportation , the terrorization of children and their parents be allowed anywhere in the world ?
Will it discourage other dictators in other lands to do the same ?
What about the children ?
Oh , we see them on television , we read about them in the papers , and we do so with a broken heart .
Their fate is always the most tragic , inevitably .
When adults wage war , children perish .
We see their faces , their eyes .
Do we hear their pleas ?
Do we feel their pain , their agony ?
Every minute one of them dies of disease , violence , famine .
Some of them -- so many of them -- could be saved .
And so , once again , I think of the young Jewish boy from the Carpathian Mountains .
He has accompanied the old man I have become throughout these years of quest and struggle .
And together we walk towards the new millennium , carried by profound fear and extraordinary hope .

The Obama campaign yesterday went to court to block what it alleged was an attempt by Republicans in Michigan to stop people who lost their homes in the mortgage crisis from voting in November 's election .
The suit , filed in a Michigan court yesterday , is the latest sign of contention over voting procedures .
Voting rights activists in several battleground states have reported an aggressive push by Republican elected officials and activists to make it harder to vote .
In Macomb county , Michigan , a swing constituency , Republican officials for the first time tried to use America 's housing crisis as a way of striking people off lists , the Obama camp told reporters yesterday .
" There is no doubt that there is an immediate threat to the voting rights of citizens in Michigan whose names could appear on a foreclosure list , " said Bob Bauer , an Obama lawyer .
The situation came to light last week when the Republican party chairman of Macomb county told a local newspaper he planned to draw on publicly available lists of home foreclosures to bar people from casting their vote .
" We will have a list of foreclosed homes and will make sure people are n't voting from those addresses , " the official , James Carabelli , told the Michigan Messenger .
The national Republicans later distanced the party from his comment , but other state party officials confirmed there were plans to deploy an army of poll " challengers " who would check voters ' credentials .
The Republicans argue that people who have lost their homes may no longer be resident at the address listed on voter records , and hence are ineligible to vote , and that their efforts are aimed at preventing voting fraud .
Such a claim is dismissed by campaign experts , who say there is minimal fraud in American elections .
Instead , they say the drive in Michigan to deploy poll challengers is intended to reduce turnout in poor areas and among African Americans , disproportionately affected by the housing crisis and thought to be likely Democratic voters .
Voting rights activists say they have already found a much more aggressive attempt by Republicans this election season to try to strike people off voting lists .
" I think that certainly the Republicans seem to be much more out front about how they are going to challenge people 's right to vote , " said Gerald Hebert , director of the nonpartisan campaign legal centre .
" What we are seeing this time around is more of a broad - based effort , and we are also seeing the Republicans being much more assertive and bold in their announcements and not necessarily trying to do it under the radar . "
Voting rights activists in Ohio and Missouri have reported attempts to use the housing crisis to try to disqualify voters .
In Michigan , Republican state party officials had planned to mail voters whose names appeared on a list of foreclosed homes obtained from the public records office .
The idea was to compile a list of people who had been forced to move homes , but had yet to update their voter registration to their new address .
Republican party workers stationed at polling stations would then challenge such voters when they turned up on election day .
Also in Ohio , the state Republican party filed a law suit seeking to block streamlined new regulations that make it easier for people to cast their ballot by early voting .
In Wisconsin , meanwhile , the state 's Republican attorney general has gone to court to try to compel poll workers to match voters ' names against driving licence records .
Florida , which has a Republican governor , also moved last week to require poll workers to check voters ' names against a government database .
The stated rationale of all these moves is prevention of voter fraud , although organisations which study elections say such fraud is a minimal risk .
The effort received a boost last April when the US supreme court ruled that states were entitled to require voters to present a state - issued photo ID such as a driving licence at the polls .
Civil rights organisations argued that the requirement discriminates against the poor and the elderly , who often do not have driving licences because they cannot afford a car .
More than 20 states now require voters to show ID at the polls , and there have been a series of recent reports about elderly people losing their right to vote .

A PROTEIN that plays a crucial role in conception could be the key to creating a contraceptive that does n’t tinker with a woman ’s hormones .
The coating of mammalian eggs contains a protein called ZP3 , which sperm must bind to if they are to burrow through the coating and fertilise the egg .
Female mice engineered to lack ZP3 do not have this coating , making them infertile , while women with abnormal ZP3 may also suffer fertility problems .

Megan Fox Wonder Woman Hoax
A new website , wonder - who.com , has released the above image of Megan Fox as Wonder Woman attempting to force studio executives to cast Fox over already cast model / actress Megan Gale .
Fox , rated as one of the sexiest women in the world , was mocked up in the movie - style trailer which teased fans this week with political - type slogans , including , “ It ’s time for a new ‘ W ' ” and an Obama - esque “ A real change is coming ” .
The campaign was deemed credible in movie gossip circles , given the trailer featured the company logos of Warner Bros , Legendary Pictures and DC Comics .
However , London ’s
The Guardian newspaper exposed the fan fraud in a blog entitled : “ The week in geek . ”
Confidential was out yesterday searching for a comment from Gale over the cyber push to unseat her from her Wonder Woman role , but her publicist said her Justice League contract with Warner Bros prevented her from speaking on the controversy saying :
“ Megan has an agreement with Warner Bros that she cannot comment on details of film projects that she ’s been linked with and she has to respect that request . ”
Australian actress and supermodel Megan Gale ( pictured below ) was set to play the star - spangled heroine in the stalled Justice League team - up movie .
In August , Gale claimed filming on the project would resume next year , and last month she claimed the script was being reworked to tie in with the storyline of Batman blockbuster The Dark Knight .
Gale said the film was slated for a 2011 release .
A solo Wonder Woman movie is still planned , with producers waiting for a script and Dannii Minogue eager to step into the role .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
It was already ominous enough that the U.S. budget deficit nearly tripled to $ 455 billion in the fiscal year that ended in September .
Now , even conservative projections show that it is on course to explode into the stratosphere , exceeding the $ 1 trillion mark in the current fiscal year - and most likely , by a wide margin .
So , how alarmed should we be by this bleak prospect ?
The rational answer is that the soaring budget deficit is unavoidable and , in fact , necessary to help stabilize the economy through some extraordinarily difficult times .
Let 's take a closer look at the issue - both the causes of the deficit as well as the concerns being raised by some fiscal conservatives .
The runaway deficit is the result of the convergence of three major factors :
1 ) The recession , which reduces tax revenues and increases certain types of spending related to higher unemployment and other welfare programs .
2 ) The steadily rising costs of the effort to address the financial crisis that burst onto the scene in September ( takeovers of Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) , Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) , and AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , as well as capital injections into the banking system ) .
3 ) The soon - to - be announced , highly ambitious fiscal - stimulus package by the incoming Obama administration .
The precise size of such a package remains unspecified , although " semi-official " hints have been given that it may be in the $ 600 billion to $ 800 billion range over several years .
All of the above forces represent an inescapable reality .
Neither the recession nor the financial crisis were developments that could have been brushed aside .
( The current recession is expected to continue till mid-2009 , according to the consensus among economists , which would make it the longest contraction since the Great Depression . )
Although specific aspects of how the bailout funds have been used so far can be open to question , not undertaking a massive program of stabilizing the financial system in the last few months was never really an option , as it would have exposed the entire U.S. economy to a potentially catastrophic outcome .
Similarly , the Obama administration 's stimulus package is not an elective development either .
The need to undertake such aggressive spending is imperative , given the severely crippled state of economic activity .
The alternative , a smaller deficit based on more restrained spending , would almost certainly lead to an unthinkable outcome for the U.S economy .
In a situation presenting itself so plainly , the current rumblings by some Congressional Republicans about the surging size of the deficit sound hollow and misguided , the product of rigid ideological adherence to the otherwise sound concept of fiscal discipline .
To be sure , the U.S. budget deficit is likely to approach 10 % of GDP in the current fiscal year , an unprecedented rate ; the previous high was 6 % of GDP in fiscal year 1983 and the generally accepted rule is that a deficit should stay within 2 % to 3 % of the country 's GDP .
( By comparison , the deficits in the euro zone countries are capped at 3 % , with some lenience only allowed recently as a result of the financial crisis . )
The main risks usually associated with a high deficit are :
1 ) The potential that the massive amount of borrowing that the government needs to undertake to finance it can squeeze the private sector out of the credit markets , therefore creating an intense competition for limited funds that can push interest rates higher .
However , such a risk is actually minimal in the current environment , where the weak economy has severely dampened the credit needs of the private sector and foreign investors seem to have , at least for now , an impressive appetite for U.S.
Treasury securities that are issued to finance the deficit .
2 ) The risk that the deficit will cause inflation .
This is true only when the Federal Reserve purchases large amounts of the newly - issued debt directly from the Treasury , a process called monetization .
There is no serious evidence suggesting that the Fed is engaging in such large - scale operations and , in the past , it has consistently refrained from doing so .
The Fed has certainly not been shy about injecting massive amounts of liquidity into the banking system in the last few months , but this process is totally unrelated to the size of the budget deficit and it is meant to address a very different aspect of the current predicament for the U.S economy : unclogging the frozen credit pipelines .
3 ) Large budget deficits add to the national debt , causing ever - increasing interest payments and , therefore , representing a burden for future generations .
While no sane person can deny the nearly immoral aspect of that burden that is being passed on to the next generation , at the same time it 's probably fair to say that the next generation would also have a keen interest in inheriting a functioning , thriving economy and not one that has been decimated by years of contraction caused by a blind adherence to the sacred principle of fiscal discipline .
Let 's make no mistake :
The surging budget deficits are not a pretty picture or a totally benign one either , and no argument can be made in favor of a more cavalier attitude toward fiscal discipline in normal or semi-normal times .
But these are extraordinary times and the deficits are just an unavoidable consequence - particularly considering the alternative .
Anthony Karydakis is a former chief U.S economist with JP Morgan Asset Management and currently an adjunct professor at New York University 's Stern School of Business .
General manager Mark Shapiro made a move on Friday to add some more pitching depth to the Cleveland Indians by signing pitcher Tomo Ohka to a minor league contract .
Ohka has been around the league in the past nine years as be has played with the Blue Jays , Brewers , Nationals ( Expos ) and Red Sox , but has never really been able to establish himself in any system .
The most games Ohka has won in a single season was 13 with the Expos in 2002 .
Last season , he was 2 - 5 in 10 starts with a 5.79 ERA for the Blue Jays .
Shapiro has not commented on the signing publicly yet , but it can be assumed that Ohka was signed simply to add some depth to the starting rotation .
The Indians are looking for someone to hold Jake Westbrook ’s spot in the rotation until he is fully recovered from surgery some time in July .
At 32 - years - old , Ohko made $ 1.5 million last season in Toronto , and may spend most of the season as a fill in starter or a long reliever .
It is conceivable that he could be bouncing back and forth between the Indians ’ new AAA home in Columbus and Cleveland .
A sublime cosmic mystery unfolds on a mild summer afternoon in Palo Alto , California , where I ’ve come to talk with the visionary physicist Andrei Linde .
The day seems ordinary enough .
Cyclists maneuver through traffic , and orange poppies bloom on dry brown hills near Linde ’s office on the Stanford University campus .
But everything here , right down to the photons lighting the scene after an eight - minute jaunt from the sun , bears witness to an extraordinary fact about the universe :
Its basic properties are uncannily suited for life .
Tweak the laws of physics in just about any way and — in this universe , anyway — life as we know it would not exist .
Consider just two possible changes .
Atoms consist of protons , neutrons , and electrons .
If those protons were just 0.2 percent more massive than they actually are , they would be unstable and would decay into simpler particles .
Atoms would n’t exist ; neither would we .
If gravity were slightly more powerful , the consequences would be nearly as grave .
A beefed - up gravitational force would compress stars more tightly , making them smaller , hotter , and denser .
Rather than surviving for billions of years , stars would burn through their fuel in a few million years , sputtering out long before life had a chance to evolve .
There are many such examples of the universe ’s life - friendly properties — so many , in fact , that physicists ca n’t dismiss them all as mere accidents .
“ We have a lot of really , really strange coincidences , and all of these coincidences are such that they make life possible , ” Linde says .
Physicists do n’t like coincidences .
They like even less the notion that life is somehow central to the universe , and yet recent discoveries are forcing them to confront that very idea .
Life , it seems , is not an incidental component of the universe , burped up out of a random chemical brew on a lonely planet to endure for a few fleeting ticks of the cosmic clock .
In some strange sense , it appears that we are not adapted to the universe ; the universe is adapted to us .
Call it a fluke , a mystery , a miracle .
Or call it the biggest problem in physics .
Short of invoking a benevolent creator , many physicists see only one possible explanation :
Our universe may be but one of perhaps infinitely many universes in an inconceivably vast multi­verse .
Most of those universes are barren , but some , like ours , have conditions suitable for life .
The idea is controversial .
Critics say it does n’t even qualify as a scientific theory because the existence of other universes cannot be proved or disproved .
Advocates argue that , like it or not , the multiverse may well be the only viable non­religious explanation for what is often called the “ fine - tuning problem ” — the baffling observation that the laws of the universe seem custom - tailored to favor the emergence of life .
“ For me the reality of many universes is a logical possibility , ” Linde says .
“ You might say , ‘ Maybe this is some mysterious coincidence .
Maybe God created the universe for our benefit . ’
Well , I do n’t know about God , but the universe itself might reproduce itself eternally in all its possible manifestations . ”
Taking on Copernicus Linde is lying in bed , recovering from a bad fall off a bicycle that broke his left wrist .
His left hand , bound in a cast , rests on a pillow .
Linde is sturdily built , with thick gray hair that flops down over his forehead ; you would n’t necessarily pick him out as a man who spends much of his time lost in thought about the distant universe .
Right now he is ignoring his injury , reciting a long list of some of the cosmic coincidences that make life possible .
“ And if we double the mass of the electron , life as we know it will disappear .
If we change the strength of the interaction between protons and electrons , life will disappear .
Why are there three space dimensions and one time dimension ?
If we had four space dimensions and one time dimension , then planetary systems would be unstable and our version of life would be impossible .
If we had two space dimensions and one time dimension , we would not exist , ” he says .
The idea that the universe was made just for us — known as the anthropic principle — debuted in 1973 when Brandon Carter , then a physicist at Cambridge University , spoke at a conference in Poland honoring Copernicus , the 16th - century astronomer who said that the sun , not Earth , was the hub of the universe .
Carter proposed that a purely random assortment of laws would have left the universe dead and dark , and that life limits the values that physical constants can have .
By placing life in the cosmic spotlight — at a meeting dedicated to Copernicus , no less — Carter was flying in the face of a scientific worldview that began nearly 500 years ago when the Polish astronomer dislodged Earth and humanity from center stage in the grand scheme of things .
Carter proposed two interpretations of the anthropic principle .
The “ weak ” anthropic principle simply says that we are living in a special time and place in the universe where life is possible .
Life could n’t have survived in the very early universe before stars formed , so the universe had to have reached a certain age and stage of evolution before life could arise .
The “ strong ” anthropic principle makes a much bolder statement .
It asserts that the laws of physics themselves are biased toward life .
To quote Freeman Dyson , a renowned physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , the strong anthropic principle implies that “ the universe knew we were coming . ”
A Wild Profusion
The anthropic principle languished on the fringes of science for years .
Physicists regarded it as an interesting idea , but the real action in the field lay elsewhere .
And in the late 1970s , Linde , then a professor at the prestigious Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow , was in the thick of that action .
At the time , he was n’t interested in the anthropic principle at all ; he was trying to understand the physics of the Big Bang .
Linde and other researchers knew that something was missing from the conventional theory of the Big Bang , because it could n’t explain a key puzzling fact about the universe : its remarkable uniformity .
Strikingly , the temperature of space is everywhere the same , just 2.7 degrees Celsius above absolute zero .
How could different regions of the universe , separated by such enormous distances , all have the same temperature ?
In the standard version of the Big Bang , they could n’t .
The universe as a whole has been cooling ever since it emerged from the fireball of the Big Bang .
But there ’s a problem :
For all of it to reach the same temperature , different regions of the universe would have to exchange heat , just as ice cubes and hot tea have to meet to reach the uniform temperature of iced tea .
But as Einstein proved , nothing — including heat — can travel faster than the speed of light .
In the conventional theory of the Big Bang , there simply has n’t been enough time since the universe was born for every part of the cosmos to have connected with every other part and cooled to the same temperature .
In this computer generated sequence , the universe evolves , inflating and expanding its terrain .
The gentle valleys represent quiescent cosmic zones where all is stable .
The jutting hills and soaring peaks symbolize the inflationary engine of universe creation , where new cosmic realms embody alternate physics and strange life — or none at all .

MIT physicist Alan Guth found a viable , but flawed , solution to the puzzle in 1981 .
Linde shored up that work shortly thereafter , making improvements to overcome those flaws .
In a nutshell , Guth and Linde proposed that the universe underwent a colossal growth spasm in the first instants of its existence , a phenomenon called inflation .
Today widely accepted as the standard version of the Big Bang theory , inflation holds that regions of the universe that are currently separated by many billions of light - years were once close enough to each other that they could exchange heat and reach the same temperature before they were wildly super - sized .
Problem solved .
By the mid-1980s Linde and Tufts University physicist Alex Vilenkin had come up with a dramatic new twist that remains nearly as controversial now as it was then .
They argued that inflation was not a one - off event but an ongoing process throughout the universe , where even now different regions of the cosmos are budding off , undergoing inflation , and evolving into essentially separate universes .
The same process will occur in each of those new universes in turn , a process Linde calls eternal chaotic inflation .
Linde has spent much of the past 20 years refining that idea , showing that each new universe is likely to have laws of physics that are completely different from our own .
The latest iteration of his theory provides a natural explanation for the anthropic principle .
If there are vast numbers of other universes , all with different properties , by pure odds at least one of them ought to have the right combination of conditions to bring forth stars , planets , and living things .
“ In some other universe , people there will see different laws of physics , ” Linde says .
“ They will not see our universe .
They will see only theirs .
They will look around and say , ‘ Here is our universe , and we must construct a theory that uniquely predicts that our universe must be the way we see it , because otherwise it is not a complete physics . ’
Well , this would be a wrong track because they are in that universe by chance . ”
Most physicists demurred .
There was n’t any good reason to believe in the reality of other universes — at least not until near the beginning of the new millennium , when astronomers made one of the most remarkable discoveries in the history of science .
The Accelerating Universe
In 1998 two teams of researchers observing distant super­novas — exploding stars — found that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .
The discovery was baffling .
Just about everyone had expected that the cosmic expansion , which started with the Big Bang , must be gradually slowing down , braked by the collective gravitational pull of all the galaxies and other matter out there .
But built into the very fabric of space , it seems , is some unknown form of energy — physicists call it simply dark energy — that is pushing everything apart .
Many cosmologists were skeptical at first , but follow - up observations with the Hubble Space Telescope , along with independent studies of radiation left over from the time of the Big Bang , have powerfully confirmed the reality of dark energy .
The idea that empty space might contain energy was not the part that surprised physicists .
Ever since the birth of quantum mechanics in the 1920s , they have known that innumerable “ virtual ” particles pop into and out of existence all around us , a sort of quantum white noise , always there but forever beneath our notice .
What astonished them was the peculiar specificity of the amount : exactly enough to accelerate expansion , yet not so much that the universe would rapidly rip itself apart .
The observable amount of dark energy appears to be another one of those strange anthropic properties , calibrated to allow planets , stars , and us .
“ If [ dark energy ] had been any bigger , there would have been enough repulsion from it to overwhelm the gravity that drew the galaxies together , drew the stars together , and drew Earth together , ” Stanford physicist Leonard Susskind says .
“ It ’s one of the greatest mysteries in physics .
All we know is that if it were much bigger we would n’t be here to ask about it . ”
Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg , a physicist at the University of Texas , agrees .
“ This is the one fine - tuning that seems to be extreme , far beyond what you could imagine just having to accept as a mere accident , ” he says .
The Multiverse on a String Dark energy makes it impossible to ignore the multiverse theory .
Another branch of physics — string theory — lends support as well .
Although experimental evidence for string theory is still lacking , many physicists believe it to be their best candidate for a theory of everything , a comprehensive description of the universe , from quarks to quasars .
According to string theory , the ultimate constituents of physical reality are not particles but minuscule vibrating strings whose different oscillations give rise to all the particles and forces in the universe .
Although string theory is enormously complex , requiring a total of 11 dimensions to work correctly , it is a mathematically convincing way to knit together all the known laws of physics .
In 2000 , however , new theoretical work threatened to unravel string theory .
Joe Polchinski at the University of California at Santa Barbara and Raphael Bousso at the University of California at Berkeley calculated that the basic equations of string theory have an astronomical number of different possible solutions , perhaps as many as 10 ^ 1,000 *.
Each solution represents a unique way to describe the universe .
This meant that almost any experimental result would be consistent with string theory ; the theory could never be proved right or wrong .
Some critics say this realization dooms string theory as a scientific enterprise .
Others insist it is yet another clue that the multiverse is real .
Susskind , a leading proponent of that interpretation , thinks the various versions of string theory may describe different universes that are all real .
He believes the anthropic principle , the multiverse , and string theory are converging to produce a coherent , if exceedingly strange , new view in which our universe is just one of a multitude — one that happened to be born with the right kind of physics for our kind of life .
“ Some people would call this the great disaster of string theory , that instead of giving rise to a single theory , it gave rise to something that is so diverse we can never make any sense out of it , ” Susskind says .
“ Others would say , ‘ Ah , this is exactly what we need for eternal inflation , for the multiverse , for anthropic thinking , and so forth . ’ ”
* Correction : Due to a formatting error , this number was originally rendered as “ 101,000 . ”
Prove
It Linde ’s recent research has helped solidify the connection between string theory and the multiverse .
Some physicists have long embraced the notion that the extra dimensions of string theory play a key role in shaping the properties of new universes spawned during eternal chaotic inflation .
When a new universe sprouts from its parent , the concept goes , only three of the dimensions of space predicted by string theory will inflate into large , full - blown , inhabitable spaces .
The other dimensions of space will remain essentially invisible — but nonetheless will influence the form the universe takes .
Linde and his colleagues figured out how the invisible dimensions stayed compact and went on to propose billions of permutations , each giving rise to a unique universe .
Linde ’s ideas may make the notion of a multiverse more plausible , but they do not prove that other universes are really out there .
The staggering challenge is to think of a way to confirm the existence of other universes when every conceivable experiment or observation must be confined to our own .
Does it make sense to talk about other universes if they can never be detected ?
I put that question to Cambridge University astrophysicist Martin Rees , the United Kingdom ’s Astronomer Royal .
We meet at his residence at Trinity College , in rooms on the west side of a meticulously groomed courtyard , directly across from an office once occupied by Isaac Newton .
Rees , an early supporter of Linde ’s ideas , agrees that it may never be possible to observe other universes directly , but he argues that scientists may still be able to make a convincing case for their existence .
To do that , he says , physicists will need a theory of the multiverse that makes new but testable predictions about properties of our own universe .
If experiments confirmed such a theory ’s predictions about the universe we can see , Rees believes , they would also make a strong case for the reality of those we cannot .
String theory is still very much a work in progress , but it could form the basis for the sort of theory that Rees has in mind .
“ If a theory did gain credibility by explaining previously unexplained features of the physical world , then we should take seriously its further predictions , even if those predictions are n’t directly testable , ” he says .
“ Fifty years ago we all thought of the Big Bang as very speculative .
Now the Big Bang from one milli­second onward is as well established as anything about the early history of Earth . ”
The credibility of string theory and the multiverse may get a boost within the next year or two , once physicists start analyzing results from the Large Hadron Collider , the new , $ 8 billion particle accelerator built on the Swiss - French border .
If string theory is right , the collider should produce a host of new particles .
There is even a small chance that it may find evidence for the mysterious extra dimensions of string theory .
“ If you measure something which confirms certain elaborations of string theory , then you ’ve got indirect evidence for the multiverse , ” says Bernard Carr , a cosmologist at Queen Mary University of London .
Support for the multiverse might also come from some upcoming space missions .
Susskind says there is a chance that the European Space Agency ’s Planck satellite , scheduled for launch early next year , could lend a hand .
Some multiverse models predict that our universe must have a specific geometry that would bend the path of light rays in specific ways that might be detectable by Planck , which will analyze radiation left from the Big Bang .
If Planck ’s observations match the predictions , it would suggest the existence of the multiverse .
When I ask Linde whether physicists will ever be able to prove that the multiverse is real , he has a simple answer .
“ Nothing else fits the data , ” he tells me .
“ We do n’t have any alternative explanation for the dark energy ; we do n’t have any alternative explanation for the smallness of the mass of the electron ; we do n’t have any alternative explanation for many properties of particles .
“ What I am saying is , look at it with open eyes .
These are experimental facts , and these facts fit one theory : the multiverse theory .
They do not fit any other theory so far .
I ’m not saying these properties necessarily imply the multiverse theory is right , but you asked me if there is any experimental evidence , and the answer is yes .
It was Arthur Conan Doyle who said , ‘ When you have eliminated the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth . ’”
What About God ?
For many physicists , the multiverse remains a desperate measure , ruled out by the impossibility of confirmation .
Critics see the anthropic principle as a step backward , a return to a human - centered way of looking at the universe that Copernicus discredited five centuries ago .
They complain that using the anthropic principle to explain the properties of the universe is like saying that ships were created so that barnacles could stick to them .
“ If you allow yourself to hypothesize an almost unlimited portfolio of different worlds , you can explain anything , ” says John Polkinghorne , formerly a theoretical particle physicist at Cambridge University and , for the past 26 years , an ordained Anglican priest .
If a theory allows anything to be possible , it explains nothing ; a theory of anything is not the same as a theory of everything , he adds .
Supporters of the multiverse theory say that critics are on the wrong side of history .
“ Throughout the history of science , the universe has always gotten bigger , ” Carr says .
“ We ’ve gone from geocentric to heliocentric to galactocentric .
Then in the 1920s there was this huge shift when we realized that our galaxy was n’t the universe .
I just see this as one more step in the progression .
Every time this expansion has occurred , the more conservative scientists have said , ‘ This is n’t science . ’
This is just the same process repeating itself . ”
If the multiverse is the final stage of the Copernican revolution , with our universe but a speck in an infinite megacosmos , where does humanity fit in ?
If the life - friendly fine - tuning of our universe is just a chance occurrence , something that inevitably arises in an endless array of universes , is there any need for a fine - tuner — for a god ?
“ I do n’t think that the multiverse idea destroys the possibility of an intelligent , benevolent creator , ” Weinberg says .
“ What it does is remove one of the arguments for it , just as Darwin ’s theory of evolution made it unnecessary to appeal to a benevolent designer to understand how life developed with such remarkable abilities to survive and breed . ”
On the other hand , if there is no multiverse , where does that leave physicists ?
“ If there is only one universe , ” Carr says , “ you might have to have a fine - tuner .
If you do n’t want God , you ’d better have a multiverse . ”
As for Linde , he is especially interested in the mystery of consciousness and has speculated that consciousness may be a fundamental component of the universe , much like space and time .
He wonders whether the physical universe , its laws , and conscious observers might form an integrated whole .
A complete description of reality , he says , could require all three of those components , which he posits emerged simultaneously .
“ Without someone observing the universe , ” he says , “ the universe is actually dead . ”
Yet for all of his boldness , Linde hesitates when I ask whether he truly believes that the multiverse idea will one day be as well established as Newton ’s law of gravity and the Big Bang .
“ I do not want to predict the future , ” he answers .
“ I once predicted my own future .
I had a very firm prediction .
I knew that I was going to die in the hospital at the Academy of Sciences in Moscow near where I worked .
I would go there for all my physical examinations .
Once , when I had an ulcer , I was lying there in bed , thinking I knew this was the place where I was going to die .
Why ?
Because I knew I would always be living in Russia .
Moscow was the only place in Russia where I could do physics .
This was the only hospital for the Academy of Sciences , and so on .
It was quite completely predictable .
“ Then I ended up in the United States .
On one of my returns to Moscow , I looked at this hospital at the Academy of Sciences , and it was in ruins .
There was a tree growing from the roof .
And I looked at it and I thought , What can you predict ?
What can you know about the future ? ”
Cosmic Coincidences
If these cosmic traits were just slightly altered , life as we know it would be impossible .
A few examples :
• Stars like the sun produce energy by fusing two hydrogen atoms into a single helium atom .
During that reaction , 0.007 percent of the mass of the hydrogen atoms is converted into energy , via Einstein ’s famous e = mc2 equation .
But if that percentage were , say , 0.006 or 0.008 , the universe would be far more hostile to life .
The lower number would result in a universe filled only with hydrogen ; the higher number would leave a universe with no hydrogen ( and therefore no water ) and no stars like the sun .
• The early universe was delicately poised between runaway expansion and terminal collapse .
Had the universe contained much more matter , additional gravity would have made it implode .
If it contained less , the universe would have expanded too quickly for galaxies to form .
• Had matter in the universe been more evenly distributed , it would not have clumped together to form galaxies .
Had matter been clumpier , it would have condensed into black holes .
• Atomic nuclei are bound together by the so - called strong force .
If that force were slightly more powerful , all the protons in the early universe would have paired off and there would be no hydrogen , which fuels long - lived stars .
Water would not exist , nor would any known form of life .
T. F .
A new report based on previously classified documents suggests that the Nixon and Ford administrations created conditions that helped destabilize Iran in the late 1970s and contributed to the country ’s Islamic Revolution .
A trove of transcripts , memos and other correspondence show sharp differences over rising oil prices developing between the Republican administrations and Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi in the mid-1970s , says a report to be published today in the fall issue of Middle East Journal , an academic journal published by the Washington - based Middle East Institute , a think tank .
The report , after two years of research by scholar Andrew Scott Cooper , zeros in on the role of White House policymakers -- including Donald H. Rumsfeld , then a top aide to President Ford -- hoping to roll back oil prices and curb the shah ’s ambitions , despite warnings by then - Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that such a move might precipitate the rise of a “ radical regime ” in Iran .
“ The shah is a tough , mean guy .
But he is our real friend , ” Kissinger warned Ford , who was considering options to press the monarch into lowering oil prices , in an August 1974 conversation cited by the report .
“ We ca n’t tackle him without breaking him . ”

Analysts and historians often contend that President Carter , a Democrat , fumbled Iran , allowing the country to eventually become one of the chief U.S. opponents in the region .
But the report suggests that his Republican predecessors not only contributed to the shah ’s fall but also were inching toward a realignment with Saudi Arabia as the key U.S. ally in the Persian Gulf .
The examination of pre- revolutionary Iran has special relevance today .
Cooper said Iran ’s economic situation just before the revolution resembled its current state , this time with big- spending President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad banking on high oil prices to sustain his power .
“ Ahmadinejad ’s fiscal recklessness is eerily reminiscent of the shah ’s , with Iran ’s inflation rate running at approximately 30 % and Iran ’s current deficit approximately $ 12 billion -- not to mention widespread underemployment and unemployment , ” Cooper said in an e-mail .
The report , based mostly on documents stored at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library in Ann Arbor , Mich. , opens a window on an unruly period more than 30 years ago that precipitated Iran ’s 1979 Islamic Revolution , which established a template for religiously inspired Muslim movements throughout the Middle East .

As high oil prices in the early 1970s began strangling the U.S. economy , Washington began to sour on Iran , the documents suggest .
After an oil embargo over American support of Israel ended in March 1974 , U.S. officials considered the shah the principal culprit in keeping oil prices from falling and wanted him to put on the brakes .
At one point , Rumsfeld , who later served as the current President Bush ’s Defense secretary , warned Iran ’s chief arms procurement official that Tehran was losing friends in Washington .
“ Do n’t try to get around me , ” he reportedly told Gen. Hassan Toufanian , in an encounter described by the Washington Post three decades ago and cited in the report .
“ Remember , Kissinger and I have to approve all [ arms ] exports . ”
Chief among those advocating pressure on Iran was William Simon , who served as Treasury secretary and energy czar under the Nixon and Ford administrations .
He blamed the shah for high oil prices and wanted the U.S. to use weapons sales to Tehran as leverage .
“ He is the ringleader on oil prices , together with Venezuela , ” Simon told President Nixon in July 1974 , referring to the Iranian ruler .
“ Is it possible to put pressure on the shah ? ”

Over the years , Kissinger advocated a friendlier line on Iran and the shah , who had been brought back to power by a U.S. - engineered coup in 1953 .
The report suggests that Kissinger had special insights into the country ’s instability .
At the time , university campuses in Iran were in turmoil , and guerrillas were attacking U.S. facilities and assassinating key officials .
Even in 1974 , a CIA analysis sounded the alarm , saying the shah ’s ambitious buildup of the country was causing economic polarization and cultural clashes that were roiling Iran .
By late 1976 the shah was in deep financial trouble , facing a huge cash crunch .
He wanted the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries oil cartel , or OPEC , to raise oil prices by 25 % , a move the U.S. opposed .
“ There is unanimity among my advisors that the world economy health is not good , ” Ford told Iranian Ambassador Ardeshir Zahedi in December 1976 , according to the archives .
“ Any increase in the price of oil would have a serious impact on the world financial structure . ”
But U.S. officials , especially Simon , had been working with Saudi officials behind the shah ’s back to seek help on oil prices in exchange for political and military support for the Arab kingdom .
The Saudis stunned OPEC by announcing at a December summit in Doha , Qatar , that they would boost production to 11.6 million barrels a day from 8.6 million barrels , driving down prices .

“ We should get credit for what happened at OPEC , ” Kissinger told Ford .
“ I have said all along the Saudis were the key .
. . .
Our great diplomacy is what did it . ”
But it would prove to be a Pyrrhic victory in terms of one American ally .
Iran was cash - strapped , having spent much of its reserves on American weapons and the shah ’s Great Civilization programs , which spurred inflation by flooding the country with money .
The shah was broke .
Declining oil revenue amid continued inflation forced him to abandon ambitious plans to modernize his country .
“ The collapse of the Doha summit , and the Saudi decision to undercut the price of crude and boost its output to try to flood the market , rushed the Iranian economy to the precipice , ” Cooper writes in his report .
Advertisement
The shah ’s government , shaken by the loss of oil revenue , imposed a harsh austerity budget that threw thousands out of work , collapsed investor confidence and panicked middle - class Iranians .
Economic chaos and unemployment quickly spread .
Within a year of the Doha summit , the first mass demonstrations that grew into revolution broke out on the streets of the Iranian capital .

‘ Terrorist ’ is elusive
Lebanese forces are hard - pressed to find the alleged key figure of an Al Qaeda - inspired group .

In a recent post , Micha blames the modal libertarian 's lack of sympathy with feminism for women 's rejection of libertarianism :
It always amuses me when white male libertarians wonder why there are so few non-white non-male libertarians out there .
This is why .
The problem with this hypothesis , at least with respect to women , is that it does n't fit the data .
According to the General Social Survey * , men are more than twice as likely as women to be atheists ( 3.6 % vs. 1.6 % ) or agnostics ( 6.2 % vs. 2.5 % ) .
I assume that those who agree with Micha 's hypothesis would also agree with the proposition that atheists are , in general , much more feminist and / or " pro-woman " than the religious .
By the same logic , we would expect women to be less religious than men ; in fact the opposite is true .
My suspicion is that women tend towards different political beliefs than men do for the same reason they tend towards different religious beliefs — i.e. , that there are differences in the way men and women think , and that these differences are rooted in biology .
I can't prove this , and I 'm not 100 % sure of it , but it fits the available data better than the hypothesis Micha offers .
* I can't find a way to link to my data tabulation , so you 'll have to reproduce the results yourself , but it 's pretty simple if you can figure out how to use the software .
To clarify , I 'm not saying that the evidence I cite proves that there are biologically - rooted differences in the way men and women think — lower rates of atheism amoung women could plausibly have cultural roots .
I 'm just pointing out that Micha 's explanation for why women reject libertarianism — that it 's dominated by anti-feminists — is inconsistent with their tendency to embrace religion , which is similarly dominated by anti-feminists .
The last paragraph is just me stating my personal conjecture based on a variety of things .

Presidential Debate I finally get to speak my peace about the debate that saw John McCain say some pretty interesting things .
The first being a freeze on all government spending except Defense and Veteran affairs !
What about education and technology ?
I guess when your 71 , you might not care as much about the future .
The U.S government is currently spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq .
Think about that for a second .
$ 10 billion a month … when the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports 34,000 registered companies in Iraq , up from 8,000 three years ago !
Iraqi business has more than quadrupled since Sadam was captured meanwhile , the average American can barely afford mortgage … let alone open a new business .
Finally George Bush makes a decision America can live with .
President Bush finally made a decision in the best interest of America … maybe he ’s feeling guilty about past decisions that have not benefited the average American !
The Republican way of thinking is usually , if it ’s not affecting me than it ’s not my problem , but even conservatives must have realized that America ’s uncorrected problems can often come back to bite them in the “ You know where ” !
The $ 700 Billion dollar plan is n’t perfect … but then again no plan involving that much money could be .
John McCain has questioned whether America can afford to implement such a plan when the question should be can it afford not two .
By Monday the Senate had put a side political ties and passed the bill , which was then shot down by the House of Representatives .
By Wednesday a new plan was in front of the senate that added $ 110 million dollars in tax breaks , it passed and is now awaiting approval from the House of Representatives .
After some serious lobbying by the president and other supporters of the bill , it is expected to pass when the house votes on Friday .
$ 120 billion dollars a year is pumping into their already stable economy as ours continues to fall and fall fast .
In the same three years that Iraq has saw its economical boom , the Dow Jones has dropped to a three year low .
That means the last time it was this low was shortly after the invasion of Iraq .
I wonder if that ’s a coincidence .
By the way , while exact figures have n’t been released it is a fact that Iraq currently has a budget surplus , said U.S. Comptroller General David Walker !
Meanwhile we have spent $ 45 billion on rebuilding Iraq .
Also On September 30 , 2008 , the total U.S. federal debt passed the $ 10 trillion mark , for the first time ever .
I did n’t major in mathematics but my eight year old daughter could figure this one out .
Maybe it was worth it .
At least we got those weapons of mass destruction right ?
Oh … that ’s right there were n’t any .
So tell me again why we spent over $ 500 billion and counting on this war ?
Even if the war was a half a trillion dollar mistake to keep spending money on it and not put money into education and technology is just making a bad decision worse .
I could bring up the premature withdrawal from Afghanistan … but that probably has less to do with McCain and more to do with President Bush ’s cozy relationship with the Bin Laden family .
No I ’m not necessarily a Michael Moore conspiracy theorist but facts are facts .
We have 126,900 troops in Iraq and we still have found not even the slightest proof of the weapons we were supposedly looking for .
In comparison there are 23,000 troops in Afghanistan looking for Osama Bin Laden .
In a 2007 report published in The Washington Post , the US government concluded that Osama Bin Laden was present during the Battle of Tora Bora , Afghanistan in late 2001 , and according to civilian and military officials with first - hand knowledge , failure by the US to commit US ground troops to hunt him led to his escape and was the gravest failure by the US in the war against al Qaeda .
The Washington Post also reported that the CIA unit dedicated to capturing Osama was shut down in late 2005 .
One of John McCain ’s reason ’s for leaving Afghanistan and seeing the war in Iraq through is “ So the soldiers that died did n’t die in vein . ”
So is McCain saying casualties of the Vietnam War died in vein ?
That certainly was a war that no one can argue …was an American loss .
Obama was right in saying anybody that fights for their country never dies in vein .
So the “ military expert ” , John McCain was wrong about the U.S. “ Muddling through Afghanistan . ”
He was wrong about the “ Quick resolution ” , of the war in Iraq .
He threatened extinction to North Korea , said Iran is a threat to the United States and has said he would invade Russia to prevent another holocaust .
No wonder he does n’t want to cut the defense budget , he plans on starting World War III the day after inauguration .
Next up the vice Presidential debate … ca n’t wait to see how many times Sarah Palin sticks her foot in her mouth .
I especially can’t wait to hear her take on foreign policy … after all she can see Russia from Alaska !
Vice Presidential Debate
I ’ll get into this more next week but I could n’t resist … the quote of the night .
“ The Ultimate bridge to nowhere ” – Sen. Joe Biden .
If you did n’t get it look up Sarah Palin and her plan to use government funds to build a $ 442 - million bridge to connect a city with 8,000 people to an airport which sees under 400,000 travelers a year !
Most over used phrase – “ Maverick ” – Sarah Palin
A few weeks later , a group of 23 officials from the eastern city of Wenzhou were punished after a set of lavish travel expenses for their trip to Las Vegas was posted on the internet .
During the trip , the officials stayed in a £ 500 a night hotel and visited a sex show in San Francisco .
Two of the officials were fired .
( NaturalNews ) Major pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline has been accused of pressuring poor Third World parents into enrolling their children in experimental drug trials that have led to the deaths of at least 12 infants .
The company is currently testing an experimental pneumonia vaccine on children under the age of one in Argentina , Colombia and Panama .
According to the Argentine Federation of Health Professionals ( Feprosa ) , poor Argentinean parents have been " pressured and forced into signing consent forms . "
" In most cases these are underprivileged individuals , many of them unable to read or write , who are pressured into including their children , " said Juan Carlos Palomares of Fesprosa .
" This occurs without any type of state control [ and ] does not comply with minimum ethical requirements , " the federation said .
At least 12 Argentinean babies enrolled in the study have died in the past year .
In response to be criticism , Glaxo said its strict safety protocols are monitored by an independent committee , and that no one is forced to participate in the program .
" Enrollment in the trial is on a voluntary basis and trial participants are free to withdraw at any time , " the company said .
But according to Julieta Ovejero , great aunt of one of the children who died , " A lot of people want to leave the protocol but are n't allowed ; they force them to continue under the threat that if they leave they wo n't receive any other vaccine .
"
The vaccine trial has also drawn accusations of corruption :
The trials in the Argentinean province of Santiago del Estero were authorized under provincial Health Minister Juan Carlos Smith , brother of the lead researcher in the study .
Critics such as Ana Maria Marchese , a pediatrician at the Santiago del Estero children 's hospital where the study is taking place , accuse Glaxo of using Third World children as guinea pigs .
" Because they can't experiment in Europe or the United States , they come to do it in third - world countries , " she said .

“ On balance , Mr. Harper remains the best man for the job in the tough times now upon us .
He deserves if not four more years , at least two more years . ”
National Post
“ Faced with these high stakes , we believe , Canada would be best served if Stephen Harper ’s Conservative government were to receive a second mandate , this time in majority form . ”
The Economist
And yet , in a sinking world , Canada is something of a cork .
Its well - regulated banks are solid .
Growth has slowed but not stopped .
The big worry is the fear that an American recession will drag Canada down with it .
Mr Harper says , rightly enough , that his government has taken prudent measures to help Canada weather a storm it cannot duck : he has offered tax cuts and selective aid to help vulnerable manufacturing towns .
But it is his seeming non-reaction to what is so far a non-crisis that looks likely to deny him the majority he was seeking , and could even let in the opposition .
In what is the first credit - crunch election in a big Western country , Mr Harper ’s ejection would set a dispiriting precedent that panic plays better politically than prudence .
Toronto Sun
While we respect all the national party leaders , realistically , Canadians Tuesday must choose between Stephen Harper and Stephane Dion to lead us through tough economic times .
To us , the choice for prime minister is clear .
It ’s Harper .
Vancouver Sun
So on the ballot box question that ’s on everybody ’s mind – the slowing economy – we trust Harper to navigate the rough road ahead .
A majority government for the Conservatives led by Stephen Harper is our choice .
Montreal Gazette
“ On balance , however , we believe that considering the Conservative record and the goals , policies , and personnel of the other parties , it is the Conservatives who deserve to be re-elected on Tuesday .
Amid all the unfair and misleading advertising of this campaign , one Conservative message is truer now than when the writ was dropped : Constancy and prudence with the country ’s finances are even more important when we ’re in the economic doldrums . ”
Ottawa Citizen
“ We believe that Canadians should return the Conservatives to government on Oct. 14 , but not because Stephen Harper is an inspiring figure .
He is not .
There are no Obama - esque promises to repair the world .
But Mr. Harper offers the steadiest hand and clearest judgment to steer Canada through the rough waters that lie ahead . ”
Winnipeg Free Press
“ Under the shrill cacophony of the opposition ’s cries for action , Mr. Harper ’s Conservatives have remained calm .
Look at the last two years , the prime minister says , correctly claiming that he has offered generally competent government .
In the face of this crisis , he promises more of the same .
On Thursday , two major international financial institutions , the International Monetary Fund and the World Economic Forum , agreed with him , saying that Canada was on the right course to weather the storm .
Mr. Harper ’s economic policy is clear and practical and worth supporting on Tuesday .
To turn the old saying on its head , this time , hard times should be Tory times .
As The Economist said Thursday , if Canadians reject the Conservatives , it would ‘ set a dispiriting precedent that panic plays better politically than prudence . ' ”
Edmonton Journal
“ And in that real world , both Canada and Alberta in particular will be best served if Stephen Harper ’s Conservatives are re-elected with the strength to be more than caretakers until we have to go through all of this again . ”
Kitchener - Waterloo Record
Each voter will have to respond to this question as he or she sees fit .
The way The Record ’s editorial board views the situation , there are only two viable options , one coming from Harper ’s Conservatives , the other from Stéphane Dion ’s Liberals .
And when we weigh things as fairly and carefully as we can , we conclude that Harper and his party deserve another term in government .
Ottawa Sun
In every election campaign there comes a moment when someone declares it to be the most important election in a very long time .
This is that moment for us .
What Ottawa and Canada need now is a strong Conservative government led by Stephen Harper .
Calgary Sun
But on the big question — who should be our prime minister — there ’s no question .
It ’s Harper .
Edmonton Sun
Still , after assessing all the party promises , the Edmonton Sun believes the one that will inflict the least damage on our economy and way of life is the platform presented by Harper ’s Conservatives .
Vancouver Province
Rather than roll the dice , protecting Canadians during these difficult and unstable times calls for proven , rational measures from a federal government that uses workable fundamentals , such as keeping taxes low , paying down debt and maintaining controlled spending .
That ’s why we are endorsing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Conservatives and urge voters to give them a majority on Oct. 14 , a majority incidentally that should include stronger representation from B.C .
Winnipeg Sun
Harper has also proven himself on the world stage .
He ’s unafraid to make tough decisions and , unlike the Liberals , committed to properly funding our military and giving it a clear mandate and mission , before sending our soldiers into harm ’s way .
Brantford Expositor
Like many Canadians , we have been fairly satisfied with Harper ’s government since it took office in January 2006 .
The Harper government has cut taxes and the national debt .
It has promised to remove our forces from Afghanistan .
It has belatedly responded to the crisis on the stock markets .
Calgary Herald
“ Thus , the choice is simple .
The Calgary Herald endorses Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Conservatives .
They deserve to be re-elected based on their record , competence , and on the prime minister ’s steady hand as Canada heads into uncharted , choppy economic waters . ”
Windsor Star
“ Harper has come under fire in some quarters for not empathizing more with Canadians fearful about their finances but Canadians do n’t want their leaders to feign emotion and pretend to “ feel their pain . ”
They want their leaders to alleviate it through sound policies rather than sound bites , actions rather than words .
Canadians need sturdy leadership in these uncertain times and Harper offers it . ”
( Fortune ) --
Now that the Madoff fraud has been exposed there are still a slew of fundamental questions outstanding .
How did one man , Bernard Madoff , run such a massive , self - described Ponzi scheme ?
Is it really true no one else was involved ?
How much money has really been lost ?
Is it $ 50 billion ?
And even if it is only several billion , how does someone burn through that much cash ?
Where did it go ?
And then there 's the heart - breaking question one of my elderly neighbors -- a Madoff investor -- asked me : " Will I ever see any of my money again ? "
I have no idea , I told her sadly , maybe you 'll get some , but you should assume that it 's all gone .
Of course there are thousands of stories like my neighbor's .
It 's outrageous that someone like Bernard Madoff -- a former NASDAQ chairman -- could operate such a vast conspiracy right under the noses of the regulators .
Not long ago the Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly looked into Madoff 's operation and found nothing wrong !
Hell - oo ?!
Anybody home ?!
Did the SEC ask who the custodian of these investments was ?
I guess not .
That 's disgraceful negligence on the part of the SEC .
And what about the point that Madoff suggests he acted alone ?
Well , gee , how convenient !
So he 's saying that none of his employees -- or sons or other relatives who worked all over the firm at the highest levels -- knew anything about anything ?
I say that for Madoff to perpetrate this fraud alone would have been next to impossible given the scale of the business .
And check out this note from a source : " I spoke with a friend today in Denver who used to call on them .
[ Madoff ] had this separate activity for the ' hedge fund . '
My friend tried to find out how to get into that part to get more biz from their firm .
He was told that was run on a separate floor in a room to which only three people had access where the algorithms were running the money in this black box format . "
Note :
Three people is more than one people .
What 's truly scary about Madoff is that when you talk to people who were ripped off you think , there but for the grace of God goes me .
Professionals feel the same way .
This from the president of a fund of fund business : " Every time one of these frauds is discovered I get scared to death it could happen to us .
We do lots of things to try to ensure it does n't , such as checking and confirming auditors and auditor changes , using a private investigator to check on managers when we first invest and the having the PI annually update the file , trying to find references which are not on someone 's reference list , etc . "
If big investors like these could be fooled , he said , anybody can be fooled .
So , bottom line , could investors have avoided Madoff ?
And what can you do to make sure you do n't get suckered by the next smooth talking , cheap - trick artist ?
Good questions .
What follows are some simple steps to crook - proof your portfolio .
Forgive me if some of them seem elementary .
But apparently a couple thousand people just lost many billions of dollars .
1 . Do n't invest in something you do n't understand .
The attraction of Madoff 's investing philosophy was that he employed what is known as a " split - conversion " strategy .
OK .
Stop right there .
I would guess 99 percent of you reading this have no idea what that means .
I did n't .
I had to call a hedge fund manager who runs a very sophisticated computer - based derivative operation to explain it to me .
" It 's not a magic bullet or a secret sauce , " he told me .
" It 's no big deal , but there 's no way to get the returns he did doing this strategy . "
After talking with him for a few minutes I can tell you this stuff is serious gobbledygook .
Greek to us mere mortals .
You want nothing to do with it .
Avoid it like the toxic waste that it is .
2 . There is no such thing as a free lunch .
The beauty of Madoff funds is that they supposedly returned 1 percent a month , every month .
Like clockwork .
They consistently provided above - market returns with no volatility .
They were just as safe as comparable funds , only with higher returns .
Puh - leeze !
That is a financial " push - me pull - you . "
An animal that does n't exist .
3. Diversify .
I know I know ; that 's Investing 101 .
Yet my poor neighbor had all of her retirement money in a Madoff fund .
All of it .
You just can't do that .
4 . Do n't stand for no or low disclosure .
I was looking at my neighbor 's " statements " from Madoff and they were ridiculous .
Nothing in them .
Just " balance at the beginning of period , " " balance at the end " kind of stuff .
Why bother with all the other numbers ?
What 's the matter , you do n't trust us ?
I did note the fund would only let her take money out twice a year .
Nice .
5 . Be wary of no -name operations .
I 'm not saying you could n't lose your dough in a Fidelity or Vanguard fund or a Merrill brokerage account through fraud .
But I will say it is much less likely .
By many orders of magnitude .
And if your money is in a bank under the FDIC minimum , well then , of course it carries a government guarantee .
In the case of Madoff , folks would whisper , " I know this guy who does great .
You 've never heard of him , but he 's better than everyone else . "
Yeah , right .
So there you have it .
Yes , some of this is familiar stuff , but in these times , it bears repeating .
By the way , maybe the Madoff meltdown will actually get folks riled up to regulate hedge funds !
Hedge funds are supposed to only be for " qualified investors " ( read : rich people ) , but gradually more and more small investors have found ways to get in , either through fund of funds , or by other kinds of pools as in the case of Madoff .
I do think some of the investors in Madoff 's funds should have known better .
But many did n't know better .
Either way , here 's the crux :
What in heaven 's name were they doing down at the SEC ?

After Saturday ’s football game , in keeping with tradition , the Notre Dame marching band played the “ 1812 Overture ” as a tribute to its head coach .
For most of the last four years during that song , devoutly loyal students have further honored Charlie Weis by forming a “ W ” with their hands .
On Saturday , for the first time , it felt like an honor for a goner .
Some of those hands formed into fists .
Some cupped around mouths that booed .
Some formed around snowballs and flung them .
Advertisement
Only a handful of those hands formed a “ W , ” with most students instead trying to figure out how to shape an “ F . ”
That ’s the only letter that suits their coach these days .
“ When he came here our freshman year , with all of our blissful Notre Dame pride , we loved Charlie Weis , ” said Joey Brown , Notre Dame senior class president .
“ But now I ’d say he ’s lost us . ”
Thus , when the Super - Bowl - ring - bearing , sarcastic - scowl - wearing boss of college football ’s most mystical program leads Notre Dame into the Coliseum on Saturday against USC , he will be dead Irish walking .
Advertisement
If Weis does n’t coach a competitive game against USC -- and he wo n’t ; his team has already quit on him in ways Rudy never would -- expect Notre Dame boosters to shake a few couch cushions and dig up the $ 15 million or so that it would take to buy him out .
It could be among the most expensive breakups in the history of sports .
But for those who believe Notre Dame can still be a special football place , it could be worth every penny .
Weis ’ perceived arrogance has lost the athletic department and alumni .
His weekly performances have lost the students and fans .
Advertisement
In his first two seasons , he was brilliant with former coach Tyrone Willingham ’s players .
But in the last two seasons , he has been clearly unable to coach his own .
Maybe it ’s because of an aloof NFL attitude caused by years of breathing in the harmful second - hand arrogance of New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick .
Maybe it ’s because he ’s just too darn smart to reach his college kids , or too darn impatient to keep trying .
More likely , it ’s because he ’s a square pro coach trying to fit into a round college game .
Advertisement
It would n’t be the first time an NFL coach has failed at the NCAA level .
It would n’t even be the 100th time .
Whatever the reason , a place that fashions itself as a college football nirvana deserves a college football guy , and Weis is n’t it .
“ It ’s really hard for a Notre Dame student to ever say anything negative about the football team , it ’s such a beloved part of our school , ” Brown said .
“ But many of us agree , Charlie is just not the guy . ”
After two double - digit win seasons , he went 3 - 9 last year , the worst record in Notre Dame history .
This season , he is 6 - 5 , but the team has grown increasingly disinterested and even dysfunctional .
Advertisement
In the last four games , which include three losses , the Irish have been outscored 42 - 10 in the fourth quarter .
There was the blown lead in the last three minutes in an overtime loss to Pittsburgh .
There was a collection of highly recruited offensive players being shut out by Boston College .
There was the blown lead that nearly led to a loss to Navy .
Advertisement
Then came Saturday , when the Irish blew a 13 - point lead and fell to an eight - loss team -- Syracuse -- for the first time in school history .
Worse than even that loss , though , were the quotes that followed it .
Did you hear receiver Golden Tate ?
“ I did n’t feel any emotion on the sideline , ” he told the Chicago Tribune .
“ Even I was kind of , ‘ Eh . ’ ”
Advertisement
Eh ?
Eh ?
Having attended several Notre Dame football functions , I have seen many different emotional expressions on the faces of those moved by the pomp and tradition .
Not one of those expressions has ever been “ Eh . ”
Syracuse football is “ Eh . ” Notre Dame basketball , most years , may be “ Eh . ” Given its budget and reputation , even during its worst years , Notre Dame football should be nothing less than “ Wow . ”
Advertisement
Did you hear tackle Sam Young ?
“ Bottom line , to be kind of blunt , they wanted it more , ” Young told the Tribune .
The last time I felt this apathy from Notre Dame football was at the Coliseum in 2004 .
Walking the sidelines behind the Irish team in its 41 - 10 loss to USC , I was struck by looks of resignation under the face masks .
The players seemed lost .
They appeared bored .
Advertisement
Soon thereafter , with a three - season winning percentage of .583 , then - coach Willingham was fired .
The move caused a national commotion , as Willingham was the school ’s first black head coach , and it was the first time in 40 years that Notre Dame did n’t give a coach five full years to prove himself .
If Weis loses Saturday , he will have a four - season winning percentage of .571 .
So , given more time than Willingham , he has been worse than Willingham , yet he gets to stay ?
Advertisement
You ready for another commotion ?
Given those numbers , the question is not about how Notre Dame can fire him .
It is , how can it keep him ?
“ I think the team has a chance to be pretty darn good next year , ” Weis said this week .
“ I ca n’t worry about my job status .
I ’m the head football coach .
And that ’s what I intend to be . ”
Well , yeah , on Saturday , Charlie Weis will be the head football coach against a talented and motivated USC team that will show little mercy as it begins its final push for national Bowl Championship Series attention .

On the bright side , no snowballs .

But many researchers argue for two ways to think about calmness : you are calm , or you learn how to be .
Imagine two people with equally high measures of neuroticism dealing with the same irascible boss .
One gets yelled at and leaves the boss ’s office perfectly composed ; the other gets yelled at and flees to the bathroom in tears or storms out and kicks the wall .
The difference is that the first person has learned to regulate the neuroticism .
People tend to think that the confrontation produces the reaction ; if you ’re faced with an irrational rant , who can blame you for falling apart ?
But researchers in emotional regulation tease out a factor in between : how we think .
Between the “ a ” of the antecedent and the “ c ” of the consequence , they argue , is the crucial “ b , ” for belief , which in the case of the person melting down might sound something like : my boss hates me , everyone hates me , I ’m a total failure .
That is the opportunity for emotional regulation .
Professor Gross , at Stanford , outlines five methods .
They are situation avoidance ( steer clear of the boss ) ; situation modification ( turn your desk so you do n’t have to look at the boss ) ; attention deployment ( when the boss invites you in for a chat , look at the wall , a picture , anything but his face ) ; cognitive change ( he ’s a jerk anyway , what do I care what he thinks ? ) ; and finally , repression ( concentrate on keeping your face still instead of blinking furiously or twitching in anger ) .
“ Even if you ’re someone who is initially anxious , you can develop tricks and strategies , so someone on the outside would say : ‘ Her , anxious ?
She ’s awesome at cocktail parties , she ’s great at public speaking , ’ ” Professor Gross said .
“ They would n’t understand that if you did n’t have those strategies , you would n’t be able to do those things . ”
This may be easier for some than others .
George Washington , memorialized as an austere and cool leader , was extremely emotional as a young man , said Dean Keith Simonton , a professor of psychology at the University of California at Davis who has studied the personality profiles of presidents and leaders .
“ He cultivated it through sheer willpower . ”
“ It ’s capitalizing on your worst fault so it becomes your greatest strength , ” Professor Simonton said .
The other night at the Cardozo School of Law , a group of distinguished legal minds got together to settle a dispute over a loan default .
The lender was n’t Citibank or Countrywide — it was Shylock , from Shakespeare ’s “ The Merchant of Venice . ”
His last trial , English majors may recall , did n’t go so well .
( He was publicly humiliated , and was forced to convert from Judaism to Christianity ; the authorities handed over his estate and half his money to his enemies . )
Modern audiences tend to view his treatment at the hands of the Venetian court as unfair — the scholar and critic A. David Moody wrote that “ it seems to involve a reversal of the right order of things ” — and so Richard Weisberg , a professor of law and literature at Cardozo ( “ Poethics , ” “ When Lawyers Write ” ) , decided to give him an appeal .
“ Lawyers were one of the first groups , along with theatre directors , to see Shylock ’s position , ” Weisberg , who takes a pro-Shylock reading of the play , said last week .
“ Shylock really has the best lines — there is n’t a lot of argument about that — but in the nineteenth century a prominent German legal philosopher , Rudolf von Jhering , was among the first to argue that he actually had the better legal case . ”
This was an exhibition hearing ( Weisberg arranged a similar one for Melville ’s Billy Budd in 2006 ) , but the legal lineup was extremely legit .
Hearing the case : the First Amendment expert Floyd Abrams ; Jed S. Rakoff , a federal district judge in New York ; Justice Dianne T. Renwick , of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court ; the federal appeals - court judge Richard Posner ; the Columbia literature professor Julie Peters ; Bernhard Schlink , the law professor and novelist ; and Anthony Julius , best known as Princess Diana ’s divorce lawyer .
The appeal was held in the Cardozo moot courtroom , before a sold - out crowd that seemed to be equal parts lawyers and Shakespeare nuts .
Actors did a CliffsNotes version of the play , focussing on the trial scene .
Quick refresher : Renaissance Venice , a different era in Judeo - Christian relations .
Shylock , a Jewish moneylender , lends three thousand ducats to the Christian merchant Antonio , so that Antonio ’s friend can use it to woo the wealthy Portia .
Shylock , who hates Antonio , demands a “ pound of flesh ” as collateral .
Some things go wrong , and everyone ends up in court , where Portia , disguised as a doctor of law , gets Antonio off the hook and gets Shylock charged with attempted murder .
The staging was contemporary : Antonio wore a suit ; Shylock carried a briefcase .
After a short reception — sushi , wine , California wraps — the seven judges took the bench to hear arguments from lawyers for Shylock and Antonio .
They were dressed as if for brunch ( sweaters , turtlenecks ) , and a few jotted down notes .
Michael Braff , a partner at Kaye Scholer , argued , on Shylock ’s behalf , that his client should get his money back , plus interest .
( He did not press for “ specific performance ” — the pound of flesh that Shylock had been shouting about in the play .
“ After four hundred years , my client has had time to reconsider , ” Braff said . )
Daniel Kornstein , a partner at Kornstein Veisz Wexler & Pollard , represented Antonio , and he attacked the validity of the pound - of - flesh agreement .
He brandished a detailed brief that he had written , which compared the agreement to “ a tainted C.D.O. ” and Shylock to a predatory lender .
“ If it please the court , ” Kornstein said , “ this is a case about an illegal contract . ”
“ What ’s illegal about it ? ” Judge Rakoff interrupted .
“ As you well know , there is a virtual obesity epidemic in this country , and to remove a pound of flesh is wholly to the public good . ”
“ Not by a knife wielded by your sworn enemy , ” Kornstein said .
He brought up Shylock ’s ulterior motives — “ the deep hatred ” he had for Antonio .
“ What does that have to do with anything ? ” Floyd Abrams asked .
“ Why should we even consider that in deciding whether to enforce the contract ? ”
“ It adds color , ” Kornstein said .
He went back to the pound of flesh .
“ The contract , on its face , contains a clause that is such a penalty that no civilized society — not even Venice , New York , here — would enforce it . ”
A woman in the audience called out , “ They would in Venice , California . ”
To skip , “ Law & Order ” style , to the rulings : the judges were split , but they came out , five to two , in Shylock ’s favor .
Schlink , Rakoff , Abrams , Peters , and Renwick said that he deserved to be repaid his three thousand ducats , though they differed on the question of interest .
( Schlink , on the pound of flesh : “ It was Antonio ’s obligation to deliver , ” but “ our public policy forbids enforcing a contract in a way that enforcement leads to one party ’s death . ” )
Posner and Julius voted to let Antonio keep the money .
Portia , admired by many readers for her “ quality of mercy ” speech , was reprimanded by the judges for impersonating a doctor of law .
“ The trial was a travesty , ” Abrams said , of Shakespeare ’s litigation scene .
“ Beautiful sometimes , funny sometimes , and ugly sometimes , but that judgment is not something that we sitting here today can enforce . ”
Posner said , “ I ’m particularly critical of Antonio ’s conduct .
His failure to insure his cargoes was completely irresponsible . ”
Renwick said that the whole thing made her think of the rickety deals that got us into the current financial mess — “ the dangers of going into a contract with someone who has covert ideas and interests ” — and suggested that all the parties were at fault .
Posner agreed : “ This is one of those cases in which we ’ve just heard very fine lawyers argue the cases , but the litigants are all disreputable people .
This is often true , particularly in the twenty - first century . ” ♦

FOR the first time , a gene is being linked to increased susceptibility to the placebo effect , the mysterious capacity some people have to benefit from sham treatments .
The gene might not play a role in our response to treatment for all conditions , and the experiment involved only a small number of people .
Nonetheless , the discovery is a milestone in the quest to understand this phenomenon , which often blurs the results of clinical trials “ To our knowledge , it ’s the first time anyone has linked a gene to the placebo effect , ” says Tomas Furmark of Uppsala University …
( CNN ) -- Several samples of infant formula have tested positive for trace amounts of the toxic contaminant melamine or a related compound , the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday .
More than 12,000 children have been hospitalized in China after consuming melamine - tainted formula .
Of 77 samples tested , one contained trace levels of melamine , FDA spokeswoman Judy Leon told CNN .
A trace amount is defined as less than 2,500 parts per billion , she said .
On Tuesday , the agency had said that one sample had tested positive .
But Thursday , the FDA said two tests of a sample of Nestle 's Good Start Supreme Infant Formula with Iron showed melamine at levels of 137 and 140 parts per billion .
In addition , Mead Johnson 's infant powder , Enfamil LIPIL with Iron , had three positive tests for cyanuric acid , at an average of 247 parts per billion , also well below the FDA trace level .
Cyanuric acid is a compound created when melamine breaks down .
The testing program was initiated after contaminated infant formula in China was linked to thousands of illnesses and a number of deaths among infants .

The FDA said it checked with all manufacturers licensed to distribute baby formula in the United States and determined that none of the components in U.S. - sold infant formula are from China .
Leon said the sample that tested positive most likely became contaminated through the manufacturing process or through contact with can liners .
Last month , the FDA set the safety threshold for melamine at 2,500 parts per billion for foods other than infant formula .
The agency said it did not have enough data to set a safety threshold for infants .
A spokeswoman for the Atlanta , Georgia - based International Formula Council , a trade group , said she had not seen the data , but was encouraged that the quantity found was below levels deemed safe in infants by the governments of China , Malaysia , the Philippines , Hong Kong , Canada and New Zealand .
" Apparently these trace levels can be found in lots of food , " said spokeswoman Mardi Mountford .
The FDA also found trace levels of melamine in several samples of medical formula supplements for the elderly , but the amounts posed no health risk to adults , Leon said .

Though U.S. - based companies can import ingredients from China for nutritional supplements for adults , there is an import ban on dairy products and components , she said .
Melamine is an industrial chemical used in the manufacture of can liners , flame retardant , cleaning products , fertilizers and pesticides .
It does not occur naturally in food .
Because it contains nitrogen , its addition to food products can wrongly suggest an inflated protein content .
Ingesting melamine in large doses over an extended period of time could cause kidney stones and other illnesses , though small amounts pose no such danger for adults , agriculture and health experts say .
Its presence in Chinese infant formula has led to the hospitalization of more than 12,000 children and the deaths of several in China , according to the FDA , which said it is not aware of any such illnesses in the United States .
This month , the FDA announced that it was limiting the import of all dairy products from China until they have been proven free of melamine .

Voting rights advocates entered into a shaky truce late Wednesday with Secretary of State Mike Coffman ’s office over his allegedly illegal purge of 30,000 voters in Colorado .
The Advancement Project , a national voter protection group , filed suit against Coffman late last week to force the secretary to reinstate the voters and halt any new purges .
Coffman ’s removals included people who moved , inactive citizens , and newly registered individuals whose voter cards bounced back to county clerks .
The Advancement Project claimed that Coffman ’s removals violated the National Voter Registration
Act because they occurred within 90 days of a federal election .
Coffman denied any wrongdoing .
But with the general election less than a week away , both sides agreed to a preliminary fix during a Wednesday hearing .
After deliberations that stretched more than eight hours , the Advancement Project and its plaintiffs — Colorado Common Cause , Mi Familia Vota and the Service Employees International Union — gave up on restoring purged voters to the rolls .
Instead , they agreed to let them vote by provisional ballot .
“ It was important for these voters to have their voices heard and to not be turned away on Election Day , ” said Grace Lopez Ramirez , director of Mi Familia Vota after the settlement .
“ They ’ll be counted and identified . ”
The crux of the settlement has to do with the way these provisional ballots will be treated .
Under federal law , anyone who shows up at the polls but ca n’t be identified in the state ’s voter database may cast a provisional ballot .
Those forms are investigated in the two weeks after the election .
If it turns out that the person is an eligible voter , then the vote will be counted .
If not , then the ballot is tossed out .
The Wednesday settlement essentially prioritizes the purged provisional voters .
County clerks will have to assume that the voter is eligible until proven otherwise .
In order for the counties to identify the purged provisional voters , the secretary of state will give them an electronic list of voters canceled between May 14 and Nov. 4 , 2008 .
In a small win for the voting rights advocates , those groups got to use their own list of purged voters , rather than rely on Coffman , whose purge list is much shorter .
Though the secretary of state did n’t cop to any wrongdoing with the settlement , U.S. district court judge John Kane on Wednesday said he thinks “ there are places where the state went out of bounds on the removal of these names . ”
But he agreed with the defendant , that changing the voter rolls just days before the election could portend technical problems and even chaos .
During the hearing , the Advancement Project provided witnesses who were wrongly purged from the voter rolls and then never alerted to the fact .
Linda Townsend Johnson and her husband , James Edward Johnson , recently moved to Colorado Springs from Mississippi and registered to vote in May .
The couple — Linda is in a graduate program while James works as a security officer — requested mail - in ballots so they could take more time to learn the issues in their new state .
The mail - in forms arrived .
But soon after , Linda got a call from a woman at the Brennan Center for Justice , a New York public policy institute , asking Linda if she was aware that she had been purged .
“ She said that my name and my husband ’s name had been taken off .
I said , ‘ I have my registration card and mail - in ballot and everything . ’
She said , ‘ It appears that your name has been taken off . ' ”
Linda and James went to the El Paso County clerk ’s office to sort out the problem , bringing their paperwork with them .
A woman at the clerk ’s office told them that they were not registered to vote .
“ I said , ‘ I do n’t understand , ' ” said Linda .
“ ‘ Someone made a mistake . ’
I laid out my voter registration card , and I gave her my social security number .
She said she did n’t understand what happened .
So she fixed it . ”
The woman also told Linda that if she had cast her mail - in ballot without fixing her registration , then the ballot would be tossed .
That assertion , the court hearing revealed , turned out to be false .
No one ever told Linda and James why they were purged .
“ Nobody would explain it to me , ” she said .
“ This is my right .
This is my voice , and I do n’t think it should be taken from me .
I do n’t take this for granted .
I am an African - American , and I am a woman .
I do n’t take for granted that people suffered for me so I could have this right . ”
Later on in the hearing , however , a witness from the defendant ’s side explained exactly what had happened to the Johnsons ’ missing registrations .
Linda and James , it turned out , were canceled because another Linda and James Johnson had registered in the state .
Those registration forms were returned in September rather than May .
They featured a different address than the original Johnsons ’ forms , and they were filled out in strikingly different handwriting .
Yet the El Paso County clerk and recorder ’s office tossed out Linda and James ’ registrations anyway .
According to Hilary Rudy , the witness who serves as a legal analyst with the secretary of state ’s office , things got even more complicated when the second Johnson registrations were tossed out because of the so - called 20 - day rule .
The Colorado law stipulates that if a voter card sent to a newly registered voter bounces back to the county clerk , than that person must be removed from the rolls .
The policy is meant to confirm an applicant ’s address , but the plaintiffs claim that it too violates the NVRA , since it kicks off voters without sufficient notice .
In Michigan , the Advancement Project and the American Civil Liberties Union recently successfully sued to stop a similar practice in that state .
After the hearing , Linda said she was happy to have spoken in court about her registration .
“ I knew I was going to do something about that , ” she said .
“ I teach my kids , ‘ Do n’t stay silent when something is wrong . ' ”
But the voting rights advocates say that not everything is perfect .
“ A settlement is always a partial win , ” said Penda Hair , co-director of the Advancement Project .
“ The case is not over . ”
Hair said that the group plans to contest the 20 - day rule and other purges at a later date .
The UK's Advertising Standards Authority determined today that an Apple TV ad 's claims about its iPhone 3 G 's relative download speeds is misleading and exaggerative , and must be pulled .
The ASA received 17 complaints from television viewers who believed Apple 's " So what 's so great about 3G ? " ad for the company 's latest iPhone inaccurately portrayed the speed of the iPhone 3G .
In the ad , Web pages are loaded in a fraction of a second with a voice - over stating ( four times ) that news , directions , and the Internet are each " really fast . "
According to the ASA , this ad violates three sections of the BCAP TV Advertising Code :
Advertisement
5.2.1 " Licensees must obtain adequate objective evidence to support all claims
, " ( in this case , the accuracy of the portrayal of the 3G iPhone 's speed . )
5.2.2 " Descriptions , claims and illustrations must not imply attributes , capabilities or performance beyond those that can be achieved in normal use . "
5.4.1 : " Advertisements must not use any technique that is likely to give a misleading or unfair impression of the product or service . "
Apple 's response was that the ad was clearly comparing the 3G 's speed against its 2G predecessor , and that the average viewer , as a mobile phone user , would understand the device 's performance would vary .
It said it reinforced that understanding by including the on - screen fine print , " Network performance will vary by location . "
The ASA , however , determined that there was no explicit comparison with the 2G iPhone , and that the visuals in combination with the repeated claim " really fast , " was likely to mislead viewers .
Therefore , it declared , the ad as seen here must no longer be aired in the UK , and must be altered or retired .
Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford was arrested this morning on federal charges and is being held at the federal courthouse , the FBI and other federal officials confirm .
See documents and past stories from the investigation of Langford .
A special grand jury for several months has been investigating county bond deals and Langford 's financial dealings .
Langford was Jefferson County Commission president 2002 - 06 .
Al LaPierre , a close friend of Langford 's who also was part of the federal investigation , will be surrendering today , said his attorney , Tommy Spina .
David McKnight , Montgomery banker Bill Blount 's attorney , said Blount is on his way to Birmingham from Montgomery to surrender .
The Langford , LaPierre and Blount indictments are under seal , so details of the charges are not available .
Langford , LaPierre and Montgomery investment banker Bill Blount are accused in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit of not disclosing $ 156,000 in payments to Langford .
The SEC has accused Blount of paying Langford through LaPierre as part of a plan to secure Jefferson County financial business when Langford was Jefferson County Commission president .
( Read the May 2008 story )
The SEC lawsuit against Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford fails to show how friends ' personal payments to Langford led to $ 6.7 million in government business , their lawyers said in a filing seeking dismissal of the suit this summer .
Former Jefferson County Commissioner John Katopodis was indicted in October on fraud charges stemming from his involvement with Computer Help for Kids , a charity established by Langford when Langford was mayor of Fairfield .
Katapodis was arraigned on those charges in mid-November .
Details of those charges .
This statement was released from the mayor 's chief of staff , Deborah Vance - Bowie . :
What George W. Bush loved best about his job was being a war president .
Playing war , that is , as opposed to making war like a grown - up .
Remember him strutting onto that carrier in his little flight jacket ?
You never saw Eisenhower , a real general , playing out his martial fantasies this way .
You can take the drink out of the drunk , but you ca n’t take the swagger out of a fool .
Compare Bush ’s eight years to Clinton ’s , and you see how much he loved to play the soldier .
No one expected that from a Republican : Reagan and Bush senior were cautious about betting America ’s chips .
Liberals used to make fun of Reagan for picking on tiny helpless nations that could n’t fight back .
Now they are remembering with pure nostalgia Reagan ’s invasion of Grenada , air raids on Libya , and even our 1984 withdrawal from Beirut .
We ’ll never know how far W. would have gone to find himself a war because he had all he needed delivered by air on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Remember how people felt in those days ?
A friend of mine said , “ It was like the aliens had invaded . ”
We needed our president to be a hero and made him into one , even though it was obvious he was n’t up to the job .
He did n’t take the first plane to Manhattan , stand there and say , “ We ’re coming for you bastards ! ”
Instead he sat in a roomful of children , reading The Pet Goat , then dropped off the radar for hours before his handlers got him ready .
Maybe there ’s a lesson here : if the president does n’t cut it in a crisis , we ’re better off admitting that to ourselves and telling him so instead of pretending he ’s a great leader .
When you make a weakling into a hero , you give him a lot of power .
If we ’d kept our eyes open and faced the fact that Bush reacted badly to 9/11 , we might have been able to ask for a little more detail about his big plans .
Those came courtesy of Cheney and his neocon punks .
What a crew these guys were !
Like their boss , they were also woofers , boasters — but of a different variety .
Dubya was your standard frat boy loudmouth , but Cheney , with his talk about “ working the dark side , ” was more like the ultimate Dungeons and Dragons nerd .
And you could n’t ask Hollywood to serve up a goofier selection of dorks than his neocon staffers , who drifted from the universities to D.C. the way has - been pop singers switch to country and western to leech off a new bunch of suckers .
On the one hand , they were scared to death of Arabs and hated all Muslims .
On the other , they were convinced that every Muslim on the planet really wanted , deep in his heart , to be magically turned into an Ohio Republican .
That was their theory : take an anti-American Arab country , add an invading army , and voila !
a nice fluffy democracy soufflé .
So we poured American blood and treasure into the Iraqi dust to prove the half - baked theories of a bunch of tenth - rate professors .
The most expensive experiment in the history of the world , all to learn something any 10 - year - old could have told them : people do n’t take to foreign troops on their streets , and not everybody wants to be like us .
You know those Ig - Nobel awards they hand out to the dumbest science projects of the year ?
The Iraq invasion is the all - time winner .
Retire the trophy with the names of the winning team : Bush , Cheney , Kristol , Wolfowitz , Feith .
But first came Afghanistan — “ the graveyard of empires . ”
Every military - history wannabe was conjuring the ghosts of that Victorian British army slaughtered by the Afghans , along with all the propaganda we ’d been pushing about the invincible mujahedeen who ’d driven out the Soviets .
Looking back , what they had routed was a dying Soviet state , and they did n’t even manage to do that until we took the risk of giving them Stinger anti-aircraft missiles .
But all the pundits ’ knees were shaking about going into the Afghan haunted house .
We started slow , the way American armies tend to do , taking a while to limber up .
There were weeks of bombing the Shomali Plain to no visible effect and a Special Forces raid on Mullah Omar ’s compound that was more “ Naked Gun ” than “ Top Gun . ”
Then Mazar - i- Sharif in the north fell suddenly , and it turned into the kind of war that Northern Alliance fighters and fighter - bomber pilots both love : hunting down a fleeing enemy .
The campaign went so well , so fast , that it taught Bush and Cheney the wrong lessons .
They started exporting democracy to Afghanistan , even hiring a local Pashtun girl to read the Kabul evening news .
When you tell a big , backwards tribe like the Pashtun that you ’re going to turn their whole world upside down for them , you should n’t expect them to be grateful .
But we did , setting ourselves up for a whole lot of trouble later on .

This is depressing :
Lawmakers in Indonesia 's remote province of Papua have thrown their support behind a controversial bill requiring some HIV / AIDS patients to be implanted with microchips -- part of extreme efforts to monitor the disease .
Health workers and rights activists sharply criticized the plan Monday .
But legislator John Manangsang said by implanting small computer chips beneath the skin of '' sexually aggressive ' ' patients , authorities would be in a better position to identify , track and ultimately punish those who deliberately infect others with up to six months in jail or a $ 5,000 fine .
More than one - third of Americans believe that UFOs are real , and many think that witches , ghosts and angels are among us , according to a Harris poll released yesterday .
The survey also found that belief in God is overwhelming .
Eighty percent of people polled think
He exists , and 73 percent believe in heaven , while 59 percent think the devil is real .
According to the survey , only 47 percent of Americans believe in Charles Darwin ’s theory of evolution .
That ’s far fewer than the 61 percent of people who believe in the virgin birth of Jesus Christ .
Ontario pharmacists should soon be able to write and fill prescriptions for minor ailments without need of a doctor 's order , a report released this week by the provincial health ministry suggests .
As well , your local pharmacy could become your first stop for prescription extensions , drug adjustments and medication monitoring through pharmacist - ordered lab tests , the Health Professions Regulatory Advisory Council has recommended .
" We 're very happy ( to ) collaborate with other health professionals and really play our role in delivering health care to patients in Ontario , " says Dennis Darby , head of the Ontario Pharmacists ' Association .
" The good news is the advisory council agreed ... that pharmacists should be tasked with a higher level of care to patients . "
The report , presented to the Ministry of Health and Long - Term Care in September was released publicly Tuesday evening .
The advisory council is comprised of seven members of the public who offer policy recommendations to the minister .
Having prescribing pharmacists would take the pressure off emergency rooms and doctors ' offices .
And while the paper leaves it up to the ministry , doctors , nurses and pharmacists ' organizations to work out limitations and protocols – a job that will doubtless take months – it broadly sets out expanded practice guidelines for druggists .
Perhaps the most intriguing of these is the potential for pharmacists to dispense prescription drugs for some minor ailments .
" For example , things like dermatitis , you come in with poison ivy , and ( the pharmacist ) prescribes a cortisone , " Darby says .
" Or you come in with red eye or pink eye and they would be able to prescribe a short course ( antibiotic ) therapy . "
There are some 11,000 pharmacists in Ontario and about 3,000 drugstore outlets .
Darby , who cites the United Kingdom as a model for such doctorless diagnoses programs , suggests conditions such as urinary tract and yeast infections might also be identified and treated in a pharmacy .
Pharmacists would then report their diagnosis and drug selection to a patient 's physician , reversing the traditional flow of information .
" This is the beginning of a process and something I am eager to work to , " provincial Health Minister David Caplan said , adding next steps include determining if legislative or regulatory changes would be required to allow the new powers .
The report also recommended pharmacists be allowed to :
Adjust prescriptions .
Darby says , pharmacists may be able to change a prescribed gel medication to a liquid form , or adjust dosages .
Extend some refills .
Order lab tests to ensure medications are working properly .
Darby says this might include tests for blood glucose levels to determine diabetes medications are working .

Teach people how to inject themselves with medications and use blood - testing devices .
Initiate smoking - cessation treatments , including the use of prescription addiction suppressors .
Ridgeway , Ont. pharmacist Donnie Edwards praised this last initiative .
" You do n't want to say to the person ` I know you 're ready to stop smoking but you have to make an appointment with your physician and you might not get in for three or four weeks , ' " he says .
Toronto pharmacist Ruth Henry welcomed the potential to expand her practice .
But any newly proffered responsibility would have to be accompanied by appropriate retraining , says Henry , who works out of an Economy Prescriptions facility on Lawrence Ave .
W .
" There are certain things I would not be that comfortable with , like diagnosing urinary tract infections .
You could be missing something much more serious , " Henry says .
Darby says the current crop of students at Ontario's two pharmacy schools will graduate with the skills to perform the new duties they could eventually be allowed to take on .
He says current pharmacists would be offered training appropriate for each new duty .
While no pharmacist would be forced to take on new responsibilities , practice expansion would be especially useful in rural and medically under - serviced areas .
Pharmacists would be paid for extra services , but Darby says it 's unclear if pay would come from OHIP .
Spokespeople for both the Ontario Medical Association and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario said they would like to analyze the entire report before making comments .
The Ontario College of Pharmacists was likewise cautious about judging the proposals .

The chart above shows delinquency rates for business and agricultural loans at all U.S. commercial banks from 1987:Q1 to 2008:Q3 using recently released
Federal Reserve banking data
through the third quarter .
In both cases , delinquency rates for agricultural and business loans are close to all - time historical lows , and especially for business loans ( 1.61 % ) far below the 3.92 % peak in the second quarter of 2002 following the last recession and far below the 6 % peak during the 1990 - 1991 recession .
Although delinquency rates will likely rise in the fourth quarter , the low rates of delinquency for non-consumer loans ( business and agricultural ) through the third quarter 2008 show that we are nowhere close yet to the delinquency rates for business / ag loans during the recessionary conditions of 1990 - 1991 or 2001 .
So before we start making comparisons to the Great Depression and the 1930s , maybe we should first be using the last two recessions as our benchmark comparisons .
Of course , as expected , the major weakness for bank loans is in the real estate sector , and delinquency rates for real estate loans through the third quarter reflect that weakness ( see chart below ) .
Real estate loan delinquencies are approaching 5 % , which is higher than the 2001 - 2002 peak of 2.2 % , but not yet as high as the 7.5 % in 1991 .
Likewise , the delinquency rate for consumer loans ( see chart below ) of 3.8 % is below the 5 % peak in 1991 , and below the rates during the peak of the economic expansion of the 1990s .
I thought this was kind of neat .
It is long and tedious , but kind of cool to see a factory made of legos actually building something , even though it is a lego plane .

Advertisement Dozens of flights at Stansted airport have been delayed or cancelled after more than 50 protesters occupied a secure area near the runway .
Climate action group Plane Stupid said it started the protest at 0315 GMT by breaching security .
The runway was closed for about two hours , but reopened at 0810 GMT .
Delays are continuing and passengers are being advised to contact their airlines .
Airport operator BAA said the protest was " unlawful " .
Police made 57 arrests .
A spokeswoman for Essex Police said 50 people had been accused of aggravated trespass , three of attempting to gain access to a restricted area , and four of conspiracy to commit a public nuisance .
Ch Supt Ian Gruneberg told BBC
News the demonstrators , who were chained together , were " committing a criminal act " and would be dealt with by the courts ' Not a fortress '
A spokesman for Stansted said a total of 56 in and outbound flights had been cancelled , all of them Ryanair .
The airline said the incident was " unacceptable " and demanded an investigation into how it happened .
Stranded Ryanair passengers were advised to go home and re-book , but were warned there was limited availability on all flights for the next three days .
Nick Barton , BAA 's commercial director at Stansted , told BBC Radio 4 he hoped the airport would be able to " recover quite well " from the impact of the protest , but delays were likely for the rest of the day .
He defended airport security and said staff had responded quickly .
" [ The protesters ] were unable to get to the runway , and a second wave of protest was stopped at the fence , " he said .

More from Today programme " You should bear in mind , of course , that the runway 's about 2,000 acres [ 8 sq km ] in size - it is an enormous area - and we do n't intend to run an airport as a fortress . "
Bolt cutters
The BBC's Stephen Chittenden , at Stansted , said protesters had brought concrete blocks and 6 ft - high security fencing with them and erected a " stockade " about 50 m ( 164 ft ) from the runway .
They then chained themselves to the fencing .
One of the activists taking part , Lily Kember , 21 , said they had forced their way in using bolt - cutters while the runway was closed for overnight maintenance work .
Ms Kember said she was " incredibly apologetic " that passengers had been affected , but added : " The effects of climate change are going to be monumental . "
Plane Stupid said on its website that the action was intended to draw attention to CO2 emissions from the aviation industry .
One protester , whose full name was not given , said : " We 're here because our parents ' generation has failed us and it's now down to young people to stop climate change by whatever peaceful means we have left .
" We 're afraid of what the police might do to us , we 're afraid of going to jail but nothing scares us as much as the threat of runaway climate change . "
Ryanair told passengers to go home and rebook online Stuart Meacock , from Peterborough , was due to fly out of Stansted for a trip to celebrate his first wedding anniversary .
He told BBC Radio 5 Live : " It 's disgusting .
I mean , it 's not only breaking all of the safety rules , but it 's disrupting everybody 's lives .
" I hope they throw the book at them . "
Another traveller Jorg Tittel told the BBC : " I am all for fighting for our environment , but these kids have failed already .
They are making thousands of travellers angry . "
BAA said it would investigate the break - in and where necessary , learn lessons from it .
" We respect people 's right to protest within the bounds of the law , " it said in a statement .
" However any unlawful or irresponsible behaviour aimed at disrupting the smooth operation of the airport is unacceptable . "
' Mass movement '
In October controversial plans for an expansion of Stansted Airport were given the go - ahead by the government .
HAVE YOUR SAY
All this does is annoy people who spend all year looking forward to that week or two away somewhere sunny Dee Hooley , Wirral Airport owner BAA wants to increase passenger numbers from 25 million to 35 million a year and flights leaving the airport from 241,000 to 264,000 a year .
Objectors say an expansion would damage the environment , but some unions said the proposal could bring new jobs .
Matthew Knowles , from the Society of British Aerospace Companies , said the protesters were " ignoring the reality around aviation and climate change " .
" Flight numbers have increased at Stansted , but noise nuisance around the airport has actually decreased and aircraft are 70 % more fuel efficient than they were 50 years ago , " he said .
" The industry has also set itself targets for a further 50 % cut in noise and CO2 emissions from 2000 levels in new aircraft by 2050 .
Protesters say they broke through the airport perimeter using bolt cutters " It is time these ill - informed protests stopped . "
In Monday 's Guardian , Energy Secretary Ed Miliband called for " popular mobilisation " to support politicians trying to pressure world leaders into a deal on climate change amid fears of economic repercussions .
He said there needed to be " a mass movement " along the lines of Make Poverty History .
Jeremy Hinton was due to travel from Stansted to a UN conference on energy and climate change in Poland , but his flight was cancelled .
" It 's easy to sympathise with what they 're trying to achieve , but [ I have ] no sympathy with the way they 're going about achieving it , " he said .
" It ca n't be done through illegal means and , from a publicity standpoint , I do n't think this gives sympathy to the people who have been on the runway this morning . "

Along with the ascendancy of the Democratic Party to control of the executive and legislative branches of government has come the repetition of the tired , old mantra of an alleged need for a " new New Deal . "
God help us .
The original New Deal unequivocally made the Great Depression much worse , and much longer - lasting , than it would otherwise have been .
One of the most readable expositions of why the New Deal was an economic debacle is Jim Powell ’s book , FDR ’s Folly .
It summarizes more than a half century of economic research on the actual effects of the New Deal and presents the results in a very readable , conversational style that is suitable to a general reading audience .
And every bit of it is being studiously ignored by the powers that be in Washington .
After his voluminous survey of the ill effects of New Deal interventionism Powell concludes with " lessons for today . "
Every one of these lessons is not only being ignored by Washington policymakers , but the policy proposals coming out of Washington are ominously structured to do exactly the opposite of what Powell suggests .
Lesson Number
One is that " the basic problem with central banks is that like socialist economic planners , they can never have more than a fraction of the vast knowledge needed to make a society work , knowledge that is dispersed in the minds of millions of people .
In addition , when central bankers make mistakes — as they inevitably will , since they ’re human beings — these mistakes harm not just the economy in a city or a region but the entire country .
The Fed ’s response to the current economic crisis , which it created by creating the housing bubble , has been to declare more and more central planning powers for itself . "
Lesson Number
Two is that " deposit insurance must be priced to reflect the risks of the banks that buy it .
Having the federal government provide deposit insurance inevitably introduced political pressures to offer deposit insurance at the same price for all banks , which meant subsidized banks engaged in risky practices and contributed to the instability of the banking system . "
The federal government recently expanded the coverage of federal deposit insurance , thereby guaranteeing more excessively risky lending in the future .
Lesson Number
Three is , " Especially because taxes are the biggest burden millions of people face today , it ’s crucial to cut taxes .
Tax cuts mean expanding economic liberty . . . "
President - elect Obama is promising punitive taxes on the most productive people in America — higher income families and investors and savers , combined with government handouts that he mislabels as " tax cuts " for people who do n’t even pay income taxes .
Lesson Number Four is " efforts to u2018 soak the rich ’ will backfire , because the investments of the rich are needed to create jobs . "
If Obama ’s campaign and , indeed , his entire political career , has been about anything it has been about soaking the rich and " redistributing " income and wealth through the tax system .
Lesson Number Five is " public works and other u2018 jobs ’ programs must be avoided because they increase the cost and burden of government , making it more difficult for the private sector to function . "
All of Washington is foaming at the mouth over the prospect of more pork - barrel spending , laughingly labeled " stimulus package . "
Lesson Number
Six is that " especially during a recession or depression , the government must not enact laws preventing prices from adjusting to circumstances .
Prices are vital signals that help people decide what to produce and consume . "
The government has been doing exactly the opposite .
Stopping prices from adjusting to realistic levels is the whole intent of the Fed ’s policies as well as the Wall Street Plutocrat Bailout Bill .
Lesson Number Seven is that " government must not enact laws preventing wages from adjusting to circumstances . . . .
Labor union monopolies have been major obstacles to adjusting wages . "
One of the first orders of business for the Obama administration will be to strengthen labor union monopolies by passing a law that prohibits secret ballot voting in union certification elections .
Lesson Number Eight is , " only if investors feel private property is secure will they be willing to make long - term financial commitments needed to spur recovery and boost employment . "
The government has been busy charging businesses that have simply gone bankrupt with crimes , promising more of the same , placing price controls on executive pay , increasing the taxation of investment with higher capital gains taxes , and generally demonizing the entire American capitalist system as a means of shifting the blame for the economic crisis that its own stupid policies have created .
In other words , everything going on in Washington today is a recipe for another Great Depression .

I remember loving this game back in the day .
The music , the simplicity , and the fun button tapping .
My computer still had my highscore from years and years ago apparently , which was 280 .
I tried to see if I could match my old record , and after a few disappointing warmup runs , I suddenly got in the zone and banged a 320 .
Lol .
The funny thing is that I felt my muscle memory still remembered this game after all the years .
This game rocks .
Kudos :)
" A promotional deal between the Cincinnati Zoo and the Creation Museum was scuttled Monday after the zoo received dozens of angry calls and emails about the partnership , " reported the Cincinnati Enquirer ( December 1 , 2008 ) .
The promotion involved a package deal for tickets to the zoo 's annual Festival of Lights and to a Christmas - themed event at Answers in Genesis 's Creation Museum .
The museum , which opened its doors in northern Kentucky during Memorial Day weekend 2007 , aims to illuminate " the effects of biblical history on our present and future world " — that is , to evangelize for Answers in Genesis 's particular brand of young - earth creationism .
On November 30 , 2008 , biologist and blogger P. Z. Myers complained about the promotion at his blog Pharyngula , writing , " the Cincinnati Zoo has betrayed its mission and its trust in a disgraceful way , by aligning themselves with a creationist institution that is a laughing stock to the rest of the world , and a mark of shame to the United States , " and urging his readers to write to the zoo to " point out the conflict between what they are doing and what their goal as an educational and research institution ought to be . "
Other bloggers echoed his call , and the zoo was evidently flooded with calls and e-mails , prompting it to cancel the promotion because of the uproar .
No refunds will be necessary , since no packages of tickets had been sold .
NCSE 's previous coverage of the Creation " Museum " includes Daniel Phelps 's review and overview and Timothy H. Heaton 's account of his visit .
NCSE also sponsored a statement , signed by almost one thousand scientists in the three states surrounding the museum — Kentucky , Ohio , and Indiana — expressing their concern about the effect of the scientifically inaccurate materials displayed there : " Students who accept this material as scientifically valid are unlikely to succeed in science courses at the college level .
These students will need remedial instruction in the nature of science , as well as in the specific areas of science misrepresented by Answers in Genesis . "

I had a garden gnome once .
I named it George .
I 'd walk out into my yard every morning and say " Hi George ! " .
One morning George was n't there , though .
A few weeks later I got a letter in the mail that had a picture in it .
It was George at the Grand Canyon .
Oh , hey , when driving from Flagstaff to the Grand Canyon , have you ever stopped at the truck stop that has the playground with the giant Flintstones figures ?
It kicks ass !
I bought a figurine there that had Jesus in the Arizona desert in front of a bunch of cacti .
It had little rabbits in it too .
Oh shit , the stove is on fire !

New Rules .
And finally New Rule , now that you 've lost Republicans have to agree not to waste everyone 's time spending the next four years screaming for investigations of Barack Obama over made up bulls # *t .
Let 's not kid ourselves .
The hard core Republican base is like a stalker .
Rejection just makes them crazier .
You think Matt Drudge was a vindictive p#%ck before .
His headline Wednesday morning was Senior Citizen and Woman Beaten By Black Man . [...]
And wait till you see Ann Coulter 's new book How to Field Dress a Liberal .
You know there 's loyal opposition and then there 's just opposition .
Let 's not do the 90's again except for the part where we have peace and prosperity .
You know there was an entire industry back then dedicated to making Bill Clinton 's life miserable over expensive hair cuts and old land deals and the Lincoln Bedroom and getting blown .
But this ai n't the 90's .
We 've got two wars , a melting planet and the only thing keeping the economy from total collapse is Sarah Palin 's shopping sprees .
But you know what phrase I do n't want to hear used frivolously for the next four years whenever Barack Obama forgets to put the kids in the car seat ?
Disrespect for the rule of law .
Dick Cheney ordered prisoners tortured by name .
That ship has sailed .
I do n't want to hear Sean Hannity say that " Barack Obama announced that his daughters will be getting a puppy .
A puppy from where ?
Probably a chihuahua that came in from Mexico illegally .
And how do we know this is n't a dog that pals around with terriers ?
You know when Obama starts a preemptive war and then f%#ks it up and makes torture our official policy and outs a CIA agent and purges US Attorneys and tries to put his cleaning lady on the Supreme Court and does n't act on global warming and appoints at the head of FEMA an ex-d* # do salesman who was his college roommate , you know , that kind of stuff , believe me I 'll be with you .
But until then I do n't want to see Republicans freaking out if Obama is n't singing the National Anthem loud enough or they find out he gets his suits made in France .
If he puts a moon roof in the Presidential limo , he 's not making himself Fuehrer .
He 's just trying to get the smell of stupidity out of the seats .
And mostly I do n't want to hear about ACORN .
Your guy lost by eight million votes .
Just because you do n't know any black people does n't mean they do n't exist .
About a month ago in Bali , Indonesia , the inaugural 2008 Asian Beach Games came to its conclusion .
Intended to promote sports and culture , the games ( held every two years ) encourage tourism , support local economies and allow host countries like Indonesia to present a more global face to the world .
The 2008 games brought 6,000 athletes to compete in 71 events in 19 sports .
Sports included well - known games like beach volleyball and triathlon , and some sports better known to asians , like sepak takraw , kabaddi and pencak silat .
The next Asian Beach Games are scheduled to be hosted by Oman in the year 2010 .

Kalashnikov turns 89 , a ' happy man ' for creating AK - 47
by Staff Writers
Moscow ( AFP ) Nov 10 , 2008
Legendary former Russian general Mikhail Kalashnikov , who celebrated his 89th birthday on Monday , said he was a " truly happy man " for having created the iconic assault rifle bearing his name .
" I think I am a truly happy man .
I created a weapon for the defence of my country and it continues to serve this cause and develop , " Kalashnikov was quoted as saying by the Ria Novosti news agency .
While the Kalashnikov rifle has become the weapon of choice by dozens of armies and guerrillas around the world , the World War II veteran has barely profited financially from the AK - 47 .
Born in a Siberian village on November 10 , 1919 , Kalashnikov had a tragic childhood during which his father was deported under Stalin in 1930 .
Wounded during combat in 1941 , Kalashnikov started working on his rifle in 1947 , driven to design by Soviet defeats in the early years of World War II at the hands of far better armed German soldiers .
The Kalashnikov quickly became prized for its sturdy reliability in difficult field conditions .
A SHORT HISTORY
The INTERROBANG was created to fill a gap in our punctuation system where writers often used typographically cumbersome and unattractive combinations of the question mark and exclamation mark to punctuate rhetorical statements where neither the question nor an exclamation alone exactly served the writer .
( HOW ABOUT THAT ?!)
Mr. Speckter called his mark INTERROBANG from the Latin for query and the proofreader 's term for exclamation .
Most dictionaries have spelled the word correctly , although several other spellings with no logical genesis have appeared .
At the time the INTERROBANG was introduced in 1962 , a number of graphic designs were sent to the magazine from many sources .
An example from this outpouring is shown above .
Many newspapers and magazines and talk shows reported on the new mark .
In an April , 1962 editorial , The Wall Street Journal deemed this punctuation exactly right for " ' Who forgot to put gas in the car ? ' where the question mark alone just is n't adequate . "
The INTERROBANG can convey in print an attitude , curiosity , and wonder .
American Type Founders issued a metal typeface in 1966 called Americana which included the INTERROBANG .
Remington Rand included the key as an option on its 1968 typewriters , commenting that the INTERROBANG " expresses Modern Life 's Incredibility . "
In 1996 , a New York art studio designed variations of the mark for each of the fonts in its computer library .
You can find an interrobang in Microsoft Word 's Fonts .
Go to Format , choose Fonts , then Wingdings 2 .
You 'll find 4 different versions of the interrobang .
Hit the ` ~ key , the ] } key , the 6 ^ key , or the - _ key .
For a longer history of the INTERROBANG now in production , we would welcome receiving information about uses of the mark that you 've observed .

" Our beaches should be a place where no one is offended , whether it 's their religious or cultural views , " he said .
" If they 've come from a Middle Eastern or Asian country where women never go topless - in fact they usually wear a lot of clothing - I think it 's important to respect all the different cultures that make up Australia . "
The practice was at risk of raising the ire of Muslim men in particular , Mr Nile said .
" I do n't want to have any provocations or disturbances on our public beaches , " he said .
Acting Premier Carmel Tebbutt and the NSW Opposition Leader , Barry O'Farrell , have both said that topless bathing is an issue for local councils , not state governments .
But Mr Nile said he believed most politicians would come around once all the issues were considered .
" I think if you survey Australian women you 'll find a lot of women would be uncomfortable if it became the custom [ to be ] topless at the beach , " he said .
" Australia 's always been a conservative country as far as beachwear goes .
" Once being topless is accepted as lawful the next question will be why can't women go totally nude on a public beach and I do n't think Australians want to go down that pathway . "
NSW Liberal powerbroker David Clarke and Labor MP Paul Gibson have reportedly vowed to support the bill .
AAP reports : Mr O'Farrell said topless bathing was not a matter for Parliament .
" This is a matter for local councils to deliberate , at a time when state parliament should be focusing on roads , public transport , hospitals and education , " he said today .
" It does n't rate on the list of important matters for the Parliament of NSW . "
Up to individuals : Gillard
Speaking to reporters in Melbourne , acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said the topless issue was one of context and clear signage .
" People want to go to the beach and use the beach in a variety of ways .
Obviously family groups want to go to the beach , people who want to get a bit of sun all over also want to go to the beach , " she said .
" As long as people know what the rules are and know what to expect I think it is a matter for the individuals involved . "
Ms Gillard urged topless bathers to be sun smart .
" There is also a stage where people should be getting the hat on , getting the shirt on and getting the sunscreen on , " she said .
Topless bathing not an issue : Bondi mayor Waverley Council Mayor Sally Betts says she is aghast at moves by state politicians to outlaw women from sunbathing topless on NSW beaches .
" We 've got alcohol - related violence , we 've got under - age drinking and anti-social behaviour in the public domain - those are really important issues , " Ms Betts told Fairfax Radio Network .
" If the Reverend Nile really wants to help people he should focus on those issues . "
Ms Betts said she was at the beach on Christmas Day and Boxing Day and did not notice any topless women .
But if it was a problem , she would have heard about it , she said .
" In Waverley , we have a very involved community .
They complain about everything , " she said .
" But nobody has complained to me about topless [ women ] . "
Forrest J Ackerman , who influenced a generation of young horror - movie fans with Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine and spent a lifetime amassing what has been called the world ’s largest personal collection of science - fiction and fantasy memorabilia , has died .
He was 92 .
Ackerman , a writer , editor and literary agent who has been credited with coining the term “ sci-fi ” in the 1950s , died Thursday of heart failure at his home in Los Angeles , said John Sasser , a friend who is making a documentary on Ackerman .
As editor of Famous Monsters of Filmland , Ackerman wrote most of the articles in the photo - laden magazine launched in 1958 as a forum for past and present horror films .
“ It was the first movie - monster magazine , ” Tony Timpone , editor of horror - movie magazine Fangoria , told The Times in 2002 .
Timpone , who began reading Famous Monsters as a young boy in the early ‘ 70s , remembered it as “ a black - and - white magazine with cheap paper but great painted [ color ] covers .
It really turned people on to the magic of horror movies . ”
Primarily targeted to late pre-adolescents and young teenagers , Famous Monsters of Filmland featured synopses of horror films ; interviews with actors such as Boris Karloff , Bela Lugosi and Vincent Price ; and articles about makeup and special effects .
The magazine reflected Ackerman ’s penchant for puns , with features such as “ The Printed Weird ” and “ Fang Mail . ” Ackerman referred to himself as Dr. Acula .
“ He put a lot of his personality into the magazine , ” said Timpone , who became friends with Ackerman .
“ It was a pretty juvenile approach to genre journalism , but as kids that ’s all we had . ”
Among those who grew up reading Famous Monsters of Filmland was author Stephen King .
Other childhood readers included movie directors Joe Dante , John Landis and Steven Spielberg , who once autographed a poster of “ Close Encounters of the Third Kind ” for Ackerman , saying , “ A generation of fantasy lovers thank you for raising us so well . ”
Ackerman was a celebrity in his own right , once signing 10,000 autographs during a three - day monster - movie convention in New York City .
This , after all , was the man who created and wrote the comic book characters Vampirella and Jeanie of Questar and was the ultimate fan ’s fan : a man who actually had known Lugosi and Karloff and whose priceless collection of science - fiction , horror and fantasy artifacts ran to some 300,000 items .
For years , Ackerman housed his enormous cache of books , movie stills , posters , paintings , movie props , masks and assorted memorabilia in his 18 - room home in Los Feliz .
He dubbed the house the Ackermansion .
The jam - packed repository included everything from a Dracula cape worn by Lugosi to Mr. Spock ’s pointy ears and from Lon Chaney Sr. 's makeup kit to the paper - plate flying saucer used by director Ed Wood in “ Plan 9 From Outer Space . ”
For Ackerman , a native Angeleno born Nov. 24 , 1916 , it all began at age 9 .
That ’s when he stopped at a drugstore on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Western Avenue in Hollywood and bought his first copy of the science - fiction magazine Amazing Stories .
Ackerman was helplessly hooked .
By his late teens , he had mastered Esperanto , the invented international language .
In 1929 , he founded the Boys Scientifiction Club .
In 1932 , he joined a group of other young fans in launching the Time Traveler , which is considered the first fan magazine devoted exclusively to science fiction and for which Ackerman was “ contributing editor . ”
Ackerman also joined with other local fans in starting a chapter of the Science Fiction Society -- meetings were held in Clifton ’s Cafeteria in downtown L.A. -- and as editor of the group ’s fan publication Imagination ! , he published in 1938 a young Ray Bradbury ’s first short story .
During World War II , Ackerman edited a military newspaper published at Ft. MacArthur in San Pedro .
After the war , he worked as a literary agent .
His agency represented scores of science - fiction writers , including L. Ron Hubbard , Isaac Asimov , A.E. van Vogt , H.L. Gold , Ray Cummings and Hugo Gernsback .
In 1954 , Ackerman coined the term that would become part of the popular lexicon -- a term said to make some fans cringe .
“ My wife and I were listening to the radio , and when someone said ‘ hi - fi ’ the word ‘ sci - fi ’ suddenly hit me , ” Ackerman explained to The Times in 1982 .
“ If my interest had been soap operas , I guess it would have been ‘ cry - fi , ’ or James Bond , ‘ spy - fi . ’ ”
At the time , Ackerman already was well - known among science - fiction and horror aficionados for his massive collection .
After a couple from Texas showed up on his doorstep in 1951 asking to view the collection , Ackerman began opening up his home for regular , informal tours on Saturdays .
Over the years , thousands of people made the pilgrimage to the Ackermansion .
The Dracula / Frankenstein room featured a casket as a “ coffin table ” and the cape Lugosi wore in the stage version of “ Dracula . ”
A case displayed one of the horror film legend ’s bow ties , which , Ackerman would gleefully note , contained a drop of blood .
Among the collection ’s other highlights : the ring worn by Lugosi in “ Dracula , ” the giant - winged pterodactyl that swooped down for Fay Wray in “ King Kong , ” Lon Chaney ’s cape from “ The Phantom of the Opera ” and “ Metropolis ” director Fritz Lang ’s monocle .
The affable Ackerman would escort his visitors through the priceless warren of books , posters and memorabilia , settling into a chair in each room and answering questions .
“ He was always just a big kid , ” said Fangoria ’s Timpone .
“ I really cherished all the times I ’ve been with him . ”
Ackerman wrote more than 2,000 articles and short stories for magazines and anthologies , sometimes under the pseudonyms Dr. Acula , Weaver Wright and Claire Voyant .
He also wrote what has been reported to be the first lesbian science - fiction story ever published , “ World of Loneliness . ”
And under the pen name Laurajean Ermayne , he wrote lesbian romances in the late 1940s for the lesbian magazine Vice Versa .
Ackerman edited or co-edited numerous books , including “ A Book of Weird Tales ” and “ 365 Science Fiction Short Stories . ”
Over the years , he made numerous cameo appearances in films , including Dante ’s “ The Howling ” and Landis ’ “ Innocent Blood . ”
Landis also had Ackerman eating popcorn behind Michael Jackson in the movie theater scene in his “ Thriller ” video .
Famous Monsters of Filmland ceased publication in 1983 , but returned a decade later with Ray Ferry as publisher and Ackerman as editor .
Ackerman , however , reportedly had a falling out with Ferry and left the magazine .
Years of litigation followed .
In 2000 , after a civil trial , Ackerman won a trademark infringement and breach - of - contract lawsuit against Ferry , though he said a year later that he had not yet collected a penny of the judgment .
In recent decades , according to a 2003 Times story , Ackerman slowly sold pieces of his massive collection in order to survive .
Because of health problems and his still - unresolved legal battle , he put up all but about 100 of his favorite objects for sale in 2002 .
The same year , he moved out of the Ackermansion and into a bungalow in the flats of Los Feliz .
But he continued to make what was left of his collection available for fans to view on Saturday mornings .
“ I call it the Acker Mini- Mansion , ” he said .
Ackerman ’s wife , Wendayne , died in 1990 ; he has no surviving family members .

COMMENTARY :
Americans have been rope - a - doped into believing that global warming is going to destroy our planet .
Scientists who have been skeptical about manmade global warming have been called traitors or handmaidens of Big Oil .
The Washington Post asserted on May 28 , 2006 , that there were only “ a handful of skeptics ” of manmade climate fears .
Bill Blakemore on Aug. 30 , 2006 , said , “ After extensive searches , ABC News has found no such [ scientific ] debate on global warming . ”
U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer said it was “ criminally irresponsible ” to ignore the urgency of global warming .
U.N. special climate envoy Gro Harlem Brundtland on May 10 , 2007 , declared the climate debate “ over ” and added “ it ’s completely immoral , even , to question ” the U.N. ’s scientific “ consensus . ”
On July 23 , 2007 , CNN ’s Miles O’Brien said , “ The scientific debate is over . ”
Earlier he said that scientific skeptics of manmade catastrophic global warming “ are bought and paid for by the fossil fuel industry , usually . ”
The global warming scare has provided a field day for politicians and others who wish to control our lives .
After all , only the imagination limits the kind of laws and restrictions that can be written in the name of saving the planet .
Recently , more and more scientists are summoning up the courage to speak out and present evidence against the global warming rope - a - dope .
Atmospheric scientist Stanley B. Goldenberg of the Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said , “ It is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem there is only a fringe of scientists who do n’t buy into anthropogenic global warming . ”
Dr. Goldenberg has the company of at least 650 noted scientists documented in the recently released U.S. Senate Minority Report : “ More Than 650 International Scientists Dissent Over Man-Made Global Warming Claims : Scientists Continue to Debunk ‘ Consensus ’ in 2008 . ”
The scientists , not environmental activists , include Ivar Giaever , Nobel Laureate in physics , who said , “ I am a skeptic .
… Global warming has become a new religion . ”
Kiminori Itoh , an environmental physical chemist , said warming fears are the “ worst scientific scandal in the history . …
When people come to know what the truth is , they will feel deceived by science and scientists . ”
“ So far , real measurements give no ground for concern about a catastrophic future warming , ” said Jarl R. Ahlbeck , a chemical engineer at Abo Akademi University in Finland , author of 200 scientific publications and former Greenpeace member .
Atmospheric physicist James A. Peden , formerly of the Space Research and Coordination Center in Pittsburgh , said , “ Many [ scientists ] are now searching for a way to back out quietly [ from promoting warming fears ] , without having their professional careers ruined . ”
The fact of the matter is an increasing amount of climate research suggests a possibility of global cooling .
Geologist Don J. Easterbrook , emeritus professor at Western Washington University says , “ Recent solar changes suggest that it could be fairly severe , perhaps more like the 1880 to 1915 cool cycle than the more moderate 1945 - 1977 cool cycle .
A more drastic cooling , similar to that during the Dalton and Maunder minimums , could plunge the Earth into another Little Ice Age , but only time will tell if that is likely . ”
Geologist David Gee , chairman of the science committee of the 2008 International Geological Congress , currently at Uppsala University in Sweden asks , “ For how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is not warming ?
For how many years must cooling go on ? ”
That ’s a vital question for Americans to ask .
Once laws are written , they are very difficult , if not impossible , to repeal .
If a time would ever come when the permafrost returns to northern U.S. , as far south as New Jersey as it once did , it ’s not inconceivable that Congress , caught in the grip of the global warming zealots , would keep all the laws on the books they wrote in the name of fighting global warming .
Personally , I would not put it past them to write more .

This is how i roll
This post was inspired by Montys post about MySQL release 5.1 , and the many discussions it has created both around the web and offline .
The question mainly being - why has nobody made such a post about PostgreSQL yet ?
Is it because it has n't happened , or just because nobody has posted about it .
We all know that there is no such thing as bug - free software .
This obviously includes both PostgreSQL and MySQL , as well as all the commercial competitors - claiming anything else is clearly untrue .
But what I find remarkable from Montys post are mainly :
MySQL 5.1 has been released with known critical bugs ( crash / wrong result ) .
As far as I know , this has never been done with PostgreSQL ( at least if we 're talking " modern times " , since after the product became reasonably stable ) .
And certainly not the number of issues that Monty has listed for MySQL 5.1 - it 's not just one or two !
critical bugs ( crash / wrong result ) .

And certainly not the number of issues that Monty has listed for MySQL 5.1 - it 's not just one or two !
There are also critical bugs that were present in 5.0 , that still have n't been fixed in 5.1 .
have n't been fixed in 5.1 .
We already know that MySQL 5.0 was released " too early " .
We already know that MySQL 5.1 was declared RC " too early " .
It 's remarkable that 5.1 was also released " too early " in that case - and for non-technical reasons again .
In theory , this " ca n't happen " with the PostgreSQL release model , since it 's based only on when the features are " ready " , not when you need a new release for some other reasons .
That 's in theory .
I know in the past we have tried to schedule releases around certain conferences and such , for better announcement effects .
In practice , though , I think this has only led to a release being postponed , never being rushed .

In practice , though , I think this has only led to a release being , never being rushed .
MySQL apparantly keep some bug reports hidden from the public ( the referenced bug 37936 for example ) .
How 's that for open ...
I approve of keeping them hidden for security bugs only - but if that bug is a security bug , it 's clearly taken way too long to fix , given the dates on bugs around it .
I still think they 've designed their version numbering system to deliberately confuse the customers about what is a beta , what is a release candidate and what is a release .
What is so easy with either labeling them as PostgreSQL does ( 8.3beta , 8.3RC , 8.3.0 ) , or using the in open source popular system of using even - numbered releases for stable releases and odd numbers for beta / testing releases ?
It took them over a year to get from Release Candidate to release .
Now , there are several posts I found that are questioning Montys post , saying that the quality is just fine - and backing this up with actual experiences in deploying 5.1 .
I do think both sides are right here - it 's perfectly possible to deploy 5.1 without hitting these bugs , as they are " corner - case " issues .
But that does not decrease the importance of having releases without known bugs in them .
And if there are known bugs , they should at least be listed very clearly in the release notes / announcement .
Not doing this is , IMHO , simply irresponsible .
Especially least for a database server which is supposed to safeguard all your work ...
So how does PostgreSQL measure up
So how does PostgreSQL measure up in all this ?
Well , we aim to never release with known critical bugs in the software .
But that all depends on the definition of " known " .
For example , PostgreSQL does not have a bug - tracker .
For those following our lists , you will know that there is an endless debate started whenever somebody tries to discuss that , so I 'm not going to discuss the topic in general .
I am personally on the side that thinks we should have one .
But I also feel that the MySQL bug - tracker is a clear example of the kind that we do not want to have .
I do n't have any exceedingly high thoughts about the bug- freeness of MySQL , but I have a hard time thinking that all the 41,000 + entries in their tracker are actually bugs .
So it represents exactly the part that I really dislike about a lot of the bug - trackers around for open source projects - it 's full of junk that are n't bugs , which makes it very hard to find what actually are bugs .
( so thanks to Monty for outlining some for us :-P )
That means we can't use " bugs in the bug - tracker " as a metric .
PostgreSQL does keep an " open items list " before each release , which does track things that came up during the development .
It used to just be a static file on Bruce Momjians machine - now it's in the wiki .
It 's a lot less structured , but it does give us a lot of help in the let 's - not - forget - this - bug - before - release department .
But it does n't track bugs past release , and the history is not preserved across versions ( that I 'm aware of at least ) .
Another metric would be to look at what actually changes in the minor versions .
If a full release is not reasonably bug - free , there will be a lot of turnaround after the release , once people put it in production .
We are , as many open source projects , lucky in that we have a lot of people running our betas and release candidates in near - production environments , which means we can iron out a lot of things before release .
But it 's obvious that a lot more people will deploy a product once it 's released ( in fact , that has been quoted as one of the reasons why MySQL 5.1 hit RC so early - " to get more people testing it " ) .
So I decided to pull some statistics from our CVS repository about the latest four major PostgreSQL releases ( 8.0 to 8.3 ) , and the turnaround on their branches after commit .
http://www.smugmug.com/photos/428148379_hX2qs-O.jpg
Update : Since several people asked : the X axis is " minor version number "
This first graph shows the number of commits on the back - branches .
This has been somewhat filtered - I have removed for example commits that are just updates of translations , and the commits that stamp the release itself .
Or rather - I have tried to , with some simple regexp matching .
So do n't take these numbers as absolute , but they should be good enough to show trends .
Also note that due to some problems with cvs not wanting to be nice to me , there are no commit statistics for 8.0.1 , that 's why the blue bar is missing in the first one .
A couple of things I think we can read from this graph .
First of all , the total number of commits in the back - branches after a release are very low .
Only very few of the branches have more than 50 commits going in .
And this includes things that are just whitespace fixes or comment fixes , I did n't manually look through things to determine what were actual code fixes .
It also " kind of " shows that 8.1 had more patches going in early on - which aligns with the general consensus that 8.1 was not one of our best releases .
8.3 had quite a lot of patches going into the first two releases , which can probably be attributed to several of the new features being very complex and thus obviously exposed to corner - case bugs .
And there is ( whew , lucky ! ) a steady decline in the number of fixes as the versions gets older - both because there are less people using them and finding bugs , and obviously because there are less bugs left in them .
So , moving on :
http://www.smugmug.com/photos/428148260_667SB-O.jpg
Update : Since several people asked : the X axis is " minor version number "
This second graph shows the number of lines added and removed .
I used a simple diffstat output and probably ran diff in the wrong mode first , so it all came out as inserts + deletes .
Thus , any changed row actually counts as two in the graph .
The true number of modified rows is therefore much lower than the ones indicated in the graph - but not necessarily half , since there are still pure additions and removals happened .
The first thing that stands out from this graph , is 8.1.1 having almost 10,000 lines changed .
The reason for this , after trolling the cvs logs for a while , is that pgindent was re-run after release .
This is the tool we use to make sure indenting and code formatting is consistent across the source code .
Obviously , this generates a lot of changes , all of which are whitespace only .
We normally do n't run this after release , because it tends to make it harder to track history of the files .
But for some reason that I can't remember ( I 'm sure it can be found in the list archives if somebody cares enough to go digging ) , we did it for 8.1 .
In the 8.0 series , 8.0.2 stands out as having a lot of changes .
This was the release where we pulled out the ARC cache method ( for several reasons ) and replaced it with a completely new one .
8.3 overall shows quite a lot of changes in the early releases , with a large drop for 8.3.5 .
But it 's too early to tell if that 's a permanent drop yet .
But even " quite a lot of changes " is only just over 2,000 lines of code , which is less than 0.3%25 of the code base ( code base size according to Ohloh , and not counting the effect of the add / remove for change as mentioned above ) .
I do n't know the MySQL code base enough to make similar graphs for them - but would be very interested in seeing them if somebody else did !
Finally , another metric :
http://www.smugmug.com/photos/428159720_kpdox-X3.jpg
This is the number of lines modified between the latest release candidate and the release .
This is essentially the number of lines that go into the release without being tested outside the developers .
Before you get all excited about how large this number is - looking through the actual changes , very much of it is actually changes to error messages , comments or whitespace .
The end !
Yeah , that turned out to be a very long post .
If there are more statistics around the code base that you think would be interested , let me know !
I have some of this stuff loaded in a database now , so I can do some more analysis without too much work as long as it fits within that model .

Nobel Prize jurors who accepted all - expenses - paid trips to China to discuss the coveted awards are being investigated on suspicion of bribery , a Swedish prosecutor said Thursday .
Anti-corruption prosecutor Nils - Erik Schultz said he opened the probe to determine whether the trips in 2006 and 2008 were meant to influence the decisions of the Nobel committees .
He declined to name the jurors or say how many were being investigated .
The probe was prompted by a Swedish Radio report that said three jurors from the medicine , chemistry and physics committees were invited to China to explain the selection process and what it takes to win a Nobel Prize .
Chinese authorities paid for their plane tickets , hotels and meals , the report said .
If charged and convicted , the jurors would face fines or up to two years in prison .
However , Swedish prosecutors often drop preliminary investigations without pressing charges .
Gunnar Oquist , the permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , which awards the Nobels in chemistry and physics and the related Bank of Sweden Nobel memorial prize in economics , acknowledged that the trips were inappropriate .
" We should be very careful not to put ourselves in a situation where the Nobel committee 's work can be called into question , " he told the Associated Press by phone .
" I think we should have thought about that here . "
Oquist said he hoped the case would not affect the reputation of the annual Nobel Prizes , which honour groundbreaking achievements in medicine , physics , chemistry , literature and peace .
Five Europeans , four Americans and three Japanese formally received the 2008 awards in a ceremony last week .
" I think that if we had known that the Nobel Prize would be at the centre of this trip , we probably would have discouraged our members from going , " he added .
The last time China claimed a science prize was in 1957 , when two Chinese researchers won the physics award , according to the Nobel website .
In Beijing , Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters on Thursday he had no information about the case .
" I 'm not aware of this , " Liu said .
The Nobels , worth $ 1.6 million each , are handed out every year on Dec. 10 to mark the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel 's death in 1896 .
WHEN Kevin Rudd announced his $ 10.4 billion package of handouts to stave off recession , some said it was a gamble .
The Prime Minister could hardly have known how true that would be .
The millions of dollars handed to pensioners and lower - income families in the second week of December fuelled a betting and gaming binge across Victoria .
" We called it ' Kevin Rudd Thursday ' , " said the manager of one Melbourne Tabaret , revealing just how big a windfall gaming venues struck .
Staff arrived at 8 am on December 11 to find people queueing to play the pokies , cashed up with a minimum handout to single pensioners of $ 1400 .
Although Tabcorp and Tattersalls , which between them control poker machines across the state , will not release figures on this month 's trade until the end of January , The Sunday Age understands December turnover is far above projections .
A source at Tabcorp said : " As soon as Rudd 's handouts started flowing into people 's accounts the pokies business saw a surge .
Nearly all the venues we 're involved with saw an increase in trade and in many cases the spike was very dramatic .
Exclusive
The UK 's second largest ISP , Virgin Media , will next year introduce network monitoring technology to specifically target and restrict BitTorrent traffic , its boss has told The Register .
The move will represent a major policy shift for the cable monopoly and is likely to anger advocates of " net neutrality " , who say all internet traffic should be treated equally .
Virgin Media currently temporarily throttles the bandwidth of its heaviest downloaders across all applications at peak times , rather than targeting and " shaping " specific types of traffic .
The firm argues that its current " traffic management " policy allows it to ensure service quality at peak times for 95 per cent of customers while still allowing peer - to - peer filesharers to download large amounts of data .
The details and timing of the new application - based restrictions are still being developed , Virgin Media 's Kiwi CEO Neil Berkett said in an interview on Monday following the launch of his firm 's new 50 M bit /s service .
They will come into force around the middle of next year , he added .
A company spokesman later declined to provide more detail on the CEO 's comments .
He said : " Broadband has become integral to delivering home entertainment services and with data consumption growing rapidly , we are exploring new ways to enhance our product offering .
Part of this involves intelligent monitoring and understanding the way people use our broadband service . "
Virgin Media has launched its 50 M bit /s broadband package without any form of traffic restriction , but it said it would do so as take - up increases .
Berkett said top package customers would be reined in from the middle of next year ; the same time he proposes to introduce application - based restrictions .
Asked why the firm would ditch its system of choosing who to throttle based on their total usage , in favour of singling out BitTorrent , Berkett said : " I think it 's an issue of fairness . "
BitTorrent is a major problem for network operators , who characterise its heavy users as " bandwidth hogs " .
The US provider Comcast was last year summoned to Congressional hearings over measures it took to reduce the impact of BitTorrent on its network .
The Federal Communications Commission subsequently banned the practice and fined Comcast , prompting celebrations from net neutrality campaigners .
In the UK there has been no regulatory opposition to application - based bandwidth restriction .
Major ISPs including BT and Carphone Warehouse use specialised " deep packet inspection " ( DPI ) equipment to monitor and manage the protocols running over their networks .
As recently as June this year , however , Virgin Media told The Register it had no plans to follow suit .
" Our policy does not discriminate internet traffic by application and we have no plans to do so , " it said .
That statement was made in response to the suggestion that Virgin Media 's purchase of DPI kit from the Israeli firm Allot was a precursor to restricting bandwidth - hungry applications such as BitTorrent .
" Whilst we do use equipment from Allot within parts of our cable network , this is used to build usage metrics and does not affect customers ' service in any way .
It is certainly not used to do any form of packet shaping or change internet traffic priorities , " came the denial .
Italian president and media baron Silvio Berlusconi said today that he would use his country 's imminent presidency of the G8 group to push for an international agreement to " regulate the internet " .
Speaking to Italian postal workers , Reuters reports Berlusconi said : " The G8 has as its task the regulation of financial markets ...
I think the next G8 can bring to the table a proposal for a regulation of the internet . "
Italy 's G8 presidency begins on January 1 .
The role is taken by each of the group 's members in rotation .
The holder country is responsible for organising and hosting the G8's meetings and setting the agenda .
Italy 's last G8 presidency in 2001 , also under Berlusconi , was marred by riots at the annual meeting in Genoa .
Berlusconi did n't explain what he meant by " regulate the internet " , but the mere mention of it has prompted dismay among Italian commentators .
Berlusconi owns swathes of the Italian mass media .
The left - wing newspaper L'Unita wrote : " You can not say that it is not a disturbing proclamation , given that the only countries in the world where there are filters or restrictions against internet are countries ruled by dictatorial regimes : those between China , Iran , Cuba , Saudi Arabia . "
La Stampa reports Italian bloggers are planning to protest against any move by the president to tighten government control over the web tomorrow .
They plan to display anti-Berlusconi banners on their websites .
Any G8 move next year to " regulate the internet " led by Berlusconi is likely to attract criticism .
He has often been accused of using his power to try to silence dissent .
He lost a long - running libel battle against The Economist earlier this year after it said he was not " fit to run Italy " and was this week suing American critic Andrew Stille for defamation * .
However , the governments of industrialised nations have been ramping up their rhetoric against internet content they view as unacceptable .
The UK has introduced new laws and revived arcane ones to clamp down on extremist websites and niche pornography .
Australia is busy implementing filters . ®
* The New York Times published a timely summary on Monday .

What the hell ?
The stores where GOP robocaller / professional Palin shopper Jeff Larson supposedly bought $ 150,000 worth of shit for Sarah to wear to fancy conventions ?
Yes well some stores listed in the records do n't have any receipts proving these purchases , you know , happened .
Which is kinda funny , and helps explain why Governor Palin does not really look $ 150,000 better - dressed than she did before the conventions !
( $ 10 k better maybe . )
So what happened to that money , then ?
Consider also the $ 4,902.45 charge at Atelier New York , a high - end men 's store , presumably for Ms. Palin 's husband , Todd , the famous First Dude .
Karlo Steel , an owner there , said he had gone through the store 's receipts for September , twice , and found no sales that matched that amount , nor any combination of sales that added up to the total .
Because the store carries aggressively directional men's wear , he caters to a small clientèle and knows most of his customers by name , as well as the history of their purchases .
When The Caucus called Mr. Steel back to ask him to also check August sales just in case , Mr. Steel said he found one purchase that came close to the amount in the campaign finance reports but said that he knew who that customer was and it certainly was not Mr. Palin .
Neither was it Jeff Larson , the Republican consultant who showed up in campaign finance records as the one who footed the initial bill before being reimbursed by the R.N.C .
The store carries expensive cut - up T - shirts and tricky suits from avant - garde designers , like Raf Simons , Yohji Yamamoto and Ann Demeulemeester , none of whom typically create beltway - appropriate attire .
" We have no recollection of that sale and no idea what they are talking about , " Mr. Steel said .
Huh !
Also , there were two $ 98 dollar purchases at a fancy store for fancy children in Minneapolis .
One of those purchases went toward outfitting Trig Palin .
The other one was a Ramones t- shirt and striped hoodie and some pants , for a two - year - old .
The Palins do n't have a 2 - year - old .
But honestly someone buying some clothes with the company credit card makes more sense than that first story about these mysterious nonexistent Todd Palin clothes .
Unless , you know , the five grand " spent " by Jeff Larson at Atelier was just five grand given to Jeff Larson , controvercial GOP robocaller .
Honestly , we do n't get it .
The US plans a global shield to protect against " rogue " states US President - elect Barack Obama has not given a commitment to go ahead with plans to build part of a US missile defence system in Poland , an aide says .
He was speaking after Polish President Lech Kaczynski's office said a pledge had been made during a phone conversation between the two men .
But Mr Obama 's foreign policy adviser , Denis McDonough , denied this .
Russia opposes the US scheme and has announced plans to deploy missiles on Poland 's border as a counter - measure .
On Friday , EU leaders said the decision would not contribute to creating a climate of confidence or to the improvement of security .
' No commitment '
In a statement published on his website on Saturday , Poland 's president said Mr Obama had " emphasised the importance of the strategic partnership of Poland and the United States and expressed hope in the continuation of political and military co-operation between our countries . "
His position is as it was throughout the campaign , that he supports deploying a missile defence system when the technology is proved to be workable
Denis McDonough
Foreign policy adviser to Mr Obama
" He also said that the missile defence project would continue , " the statement added .
When asked about the declaration , McDonough said that the US president - elect had had " a good conversation " with Mr Kaczynski about the American - Polish alliance and discussed missile defence , but " made no commitment on it " .
" His position is as it was throughout the campaign , that he supports deploying a missile defence system when the technology is proved to be workable , " Mr McDonough told the Associated Press .
In the past , Mr Obama has said he wants to review the plans for a missile defence system in central Europe to ensure it would be effective and not target Russia .
But the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw says the Russian government believes the plan to locate 10 interceptor missiles in northern Poland and a tracking radar in the Czech Republic will do exactly that .
In his first state of the nation address on Wednesday , Russian President Dmitri Medvedev said Moscow would neutralise the system by deploying short - range missiles in its western enclave of Kaliningrad on Poland 's border .
The US military insists the shield is incapable of destroying Russian rockets and is designed solely to guard against missile attack by so - called " rogue states " , such as Iran .

The Tool For All Your Scanning Needs VueScan has the features you need no matter what you need to scan
It was five years ago when the Sun decided to show us who 's boss .
It was well past the solar max , the time when the twisted magnetic field of the Sun is at its worst .
Things were dying down .
In general , the biggest and most powerful explosions of released magnetic energy do lag the actual solar max by about a year , but we were well past that .
No one expected that in October and November of 2003 the Sun would unleash the most violent flares ever seen in modern times .
One was so huge it was reclassified more than once , upgraded to be the nastiest event ever detected .
The Sun , it seemed , can still surprise us .
NASA has put together some information on the fifth anniversary of this event .
They also put together a video ( it was for Halloween , hence the ghouliness ) .
I wrote about this extensively in my book .
I learned a huge amount about the properties of the Sun , and what sort of damage it can do on Earth .
It 's funny : to the eye you 'd never see a flare ; the Sun does n't get much brighter overall , so you 'd hardly notice .
But it can blow out transformers , melt power lines , and cause billions -- yes , billions -- of dollars in damage .
We 're at the minimum of the solar cycle right now , but things are starting up again .
Things will peak in about 5 - 6 years .
What will happen two years after that ?
Tip o' the transformer to Rani Gran at the NASA / Goddard Space Flight Center Public Affairs Office !
Heads up !
Possibly boring journalism dilemma ahead : Reuters has a story on it's site announcing that Wal - Mart " is holding special in - store sales this Saturday , " to win over consumers .
In other news , McDonalds intends to cook hamburgers to win over the hungry and Starbucks intends to brew coffee to arouse the sleepy .
What on Earth is Reuters doing here ?
The media world is wringing its hands over the death of newspapers , the implosion of the ad market and Reuters is writing stories that equate to advertisements for one of these world 's largest corporations .
Maybe it 's their version of a service piece , but we think this is insane .
And by insane , we , of course , are talking about Wal - Mart 's LOW LOW PRICES !
These are deals you'd be foolish to miss !
Reuters : Wal - Mart Stores
Inc is holding special in - store sales this Saturday as the world 's largest retailer looks to win over U.S. shoppers in what could be the toughest holiday sales season in nearly two decades .
The company , which held similar sales leading up to the holidays last year , has said that it expects its shoppers to begin their gift - buying earlier this year to stretch limited budgets .
U.S. retail chains traditionally launch their big holiday promotions immediately after Thanksgiving Day in late November , but many have started to offer discounts even earlier as the economy weakens .
On its website , Wal - Mart says the sale will begin at 8 a.m. on November 8 .
In - store deals include a Sony PS3 video game console with a $ 100 gift card for $ 399 , a basic Compaq laptop for $ 298 , and a Sanyo 46 - inch LCD high - definition television for $ 898 .
Wal - Mart had already started cutting prices on popular toys to attract cash - strapped shoppers looking for bargains .
Last year in early November , the company began offering the type of holiday discounts it usually reserved for " Black Friday " -- the day after Thanksgiving .

Wolverine : Our Leaked Trailer from Secret Origins Subscribe Posted by Michael Pinto on Dec 14 , 2008 in Comic Books
We just stumbled over this leaked trailer of X - Men Origins : Wolverine on the net !
I have to say that I had my doubts about this film , but it looks like it ’s going to be action packed .
Although the bad news is that when you see it in theaters there will be the same idiots who get to their seats late just like you see in this secret trailer !

Iran , a Middle Eastern country south of the Caspian Sea and north of the Persian Gulf , is three times the size of Arizona .
It shares borders with Iraq , Turkey , Azerbaijan , Turkmenistan , Armenia , Afghanistan , and Pakistan .
The Elburz Mountains in the north rise to 18,603 ft ( 5,670 m ) at Mount Damavend .
From northwest to southeast , the country is crossed by a desert 800 mi ( 1,287 km ) long .
Iran has been an Islamic theocracy since the Pahlavi monarchy regime was overthrown on Feb. 11 , 1979 .
The region now called Iran was occupied by the Medes and the Persians in the 1500s B.C. , until the Persian king Cyrus the Great overthrew the Medes and became ruler of the Achaemenid ( Persian ) Empire , which reached from the Indus to the Nile at its zenith in 525 B.C. Persia fell to Alexander in 331–330 B.C. and a succession of other rulers : the Seleucids ( 312–302 B.C. ) , the Greek - speaking Parthians ( 247 B.C. –A.D. 226 ) , the Sasanians ( 224–c. 640 ) , and the Arab Muslims ( in 641 ) .
By the mid-800s Persia had become an international scientific and cultural center .
In the 12th century it was invaded by the Mongols .
The Safavid dynasty ( 1501 – 1722 ) , under whom the dominant religion became Shiite Islam , followed , and was then replaced by the Qajar dynasty ( 1794 –1925 ) .

Is sustainability a national security issue ?
Politicians , policy makers and academics may be willing to argue sides of that question , but for the U.S. Army , the answer seems to be “ Yes , sir ! ” Following up on earlier announcements of solar arrays and emission reduction goals , the Army released its first annual sustainability report on Friday .
Covering the period of FY 2004 - 2007 , the report notes a number of encouraging trends :
Sixteen Army installations with comprehensive Installation Sustainability Plans in place .
78 % ( 301 ) of FY07 ArmyMilitary Construction projects designed to at least U.S. Green Building Council ’s LEED ® new construction certification standards .
100 % ( 161 ) installations with an Environmental Management System ( EMS ) in place with 31 % in conformance to ISO14001
8.4 % reduction in facility energy useintensity ( KBtu / gross square foot / per year , since FY03 )
Challenges still exist , of course .
Among them :
35 % increase in Hazardous Waste ( HW ) generation as reported for CY03 to CY06 and an 8 % increase in pounds HWgenerated per $ 1000 net Army cost of operations .
11 % increase in absolute Toxic Release Inventory ( TRI ) releases as reported for CY03 to CY06 , but a 13 % decrease in pounds TRI released per $ 1000 net Army cost of operations .
As this is the Army ’s first attempt at such a report , it used the Global Reporting Initiative ’s sustainability reporting framework , the standard for corporate sustainability reports ( and the first use ever of the GRI framework by a branch of the federal government ) .
Additionally , the Army adapted other sustainability concepts to fit its mission : the corporate “ triple bottom line ” of profit , people and planet became “ triple bottom line — plus ” of “ Mission , Environment , Community , plus the economic benefits that sustainability provides by reducing costs and impacts , and accelerating innovation . ”
While the report notes that traditional notions of national security will remain paramount , environmental concerns , such as access to resources , has become an integral part of its mission .
It also notes that future conflicts may well arise from competition for scarcer resources .
We wo n’t look for uniforms made from hemp , or tipis as housing anytime soon , but it ’s good to see that the US military not only recognizes the role the environment and ecological systems play in maintaining national well - being , but that reducing it ’s own “ bootprint ” could ( in theory , anyway ) play a small part in lowering global environmental stress … and the conflicts that arise from that stress .

At the Detroit auto show next month , one of the most highly anticipated new vehicles will be Toyota Motor Corp .'s third - generation Prius hybrid .
It features a roomier interior and better gas mileage than the current model , the best - selling hybrid in the world .
But even these advancements are n't good enough for Daniel Sherwood and Paul Guzyk .
The two green - minded mechanics have been modifying Toyota 's Prius hybrids , which get an impressive 50 miles per gallon , and converting them into plug - in electric vehicles , doubling the ...
Ms Livni's comments echo the position of some of Israel 's most hard line figures Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni has sparked controversy by saying a Palestinian state would provide " a national solution " for Israel 's Arabs .
Politicians from the minority Arab community have demanded she clarify if it means that Arabs citizens will face loss of rights in Israel or expulsion .
Israeli politicians have long grappled with the issue of a growing proportion of ethnic Arabs in the Jewish state .
" Transfer " has been mooted explicitly only by far right - wingers in Israel .
Ms Livni is hoping to become Israel 's next prime minister , and opinion polls suggest she is in a close race with the right - wing Likud party .
There is no question of carrying out a transfer or forcing them [ Israeli Arabs ] to leave
Tzipi Livni Some Israeli politicians have suggested she may be trying to project a hardline image in an attempt to draw votes away from Likud .
Ms Livni tried to clarify her comments on Friday .
" There is no question of carrying out a transfer or forcing them [ Israeli Arabs ] to leave , " she told public radio .
" I am willing to give up a part of the country over which I believe we have rights so that Israel will remain a Jewish and democratic state in which citizens have equal rights , whatever their religion , " she added .
Meanwhile , a prominent far right - wing Likud member , Moshe Feiglin , has been demoted on the party 's candidate list .
Mr Feiglin , a settler who has espoused extreme anti-Palestinian views , was originally 20th but has been moved to 36th , making his election much less likely .
Party officials said the change was for technical reasons relating to the promotion of regional candidates ; Mr Feiglin alleged it was politically motivated .
Election tensions
In remarks to school children broadcast on Israeli radio , Ms Livni 's said her solution for maintaining a Jewish and democratic state of Israel was " to have two distinct national entities " .
" Among other things I will also be able to approach the Palestinian residents of Israel ... and tell them : ' Your national aspirations lie elsewhere . ' "
Arab MP
Ahmed Tibi demanded that Ms Livni be absolutely open about what she meant , as befits a candidate for Israel 's prime ministership .
" She must decide whether she means to leave 1 m Arabs without political rights or a national identity , or whether she really intends to transfer 1 m Arab citizens to the Palestinian state that will be established , " he told Israeli army radio .
" The way to peace is by respecting international legislation .
The Israeli election campaign should not be exploited to create tensions , " said Palestinian presidency spokesman Abu Rudeina .
Israeli Arabs trace their origins to the Palestinians who remained on their property or escaped expulsion in 1948 when Israel was created .
They now make up about 20 % of the state 's population and their numbers are increasing .
On paper , they enjoy equal rights with Jewish Israelis - unlike their Palestinian counterparts in the occupied territories - but they have frequently complained of discrimination .
Creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza is the object of US - backed Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .

Eno has signed on to write the score for the next film by director Peter Jackson ( The Lord of the Rings trilogy ) .
No , not his next Rings film ( THE HOBBIT film , which btw has been delayed until a 2012 release ) , but instead , for The Lovely Bones , an adaptation of the Alice Sebold 's novel .
No elves , aliens or Tintin in it , but the film will have Rachel Weisz and Mark Wahlberg starring .
Eno gets an " Original music by ... " credit in the film , making it one of his rare outings as a film soundtrack composer .
He has appeared in many films , including Trainspotting and Boarding Gate , but he has rarely composed any scores .
The last was in 2005 for The Jacket , starring Adrien Brody .
The film is to be released in December 2009 , giving Eno a bit of time between his work with David Byrne , U2 and Coldplay .
One of the reasons people do n’t want to leave Firefox for Google ’s new Chrome Browser is Firefox ’s Quicksearch feature , which allows you to use single character prefixes to search various sites from Firefox ’s URL bar .
Fortunately , you do n’t have to leave this functionality behind if you decide to move to Chrome .
In fact , Google actually implements Quicksearches in a slicker way than Firefox in my opinion .
When you go to Tools –> Options –> Basics Tab and then click the Manage button , you are presented with this :
I ’ve already modified a few of the keywords to be single characters , but as you can see , all the Quicksearch functionality is already built into Chrome , and it ’s quite simple and intuitive to add new search engines to the list and / or modify the keywords for existing ones .
Above and Beyond
What ’s most interesting , though , is what Google does with Quicksearches that nobody else does .
Here are two examples :
Visual Searches
As you type a keyword in the URL bar and press the spacebar to type in your query , Google visually autocompletes the type of search you ’re doing .
So as you ’re entering your search terms you get the following dialogue box ( based on the search engine you ’re using ) .
Here I used the “ m ” trigger to use Microsoft search :
It ’s a very clean effect .
Automatically Adding New Quicksearches
Perhaps the sickest thing of all that Google ’s browser does with quicksearches is add them automatically .
Try this :
Go into your quicksearch management in Chrome and delete the Yahoo ! search Go to Yahoo ! and perform a search
Go back into your quicksearch management and notice that Yahoo ! has been added back .
That ’s impressive .
You just do your thing and it builds quicksearches in case you want to do it faster next time .
So , even if you decide Chrome is n’t the browser for you , do n’t let the lack of Quicksearches be a reason .
Google has them covered , and arguably in a superior to other browsers .
Parking Meter Bill Passes , Bid Adieu to Free Sundays and Holidays
By Marcus Gilmer in News on Dec 4 , 2008 7:40 PM
Photo by kookybites
Earlier this week , we discussed the insane new parking meter rates that would go into effect if the City Council passed legislation allowing Mayor Daley to lease the meters to a private company .
Well , they passed it by a vote of 40 - 5 .
Ald. Toni Preckwinkle ( 4th ) opposed the measure , claiming she did n't have enough time to review it , prompting this amazing ( and classic ) response from Ald. Richard Mell ( 33rd ) :
How many of us read the stuff we do get , OK ?
I try to .
I try to .
I try to .
But being realistic , being realistic , it 's like getting your insurance policy -- it 's small print , OK ?
Yes , Dick , it 's just like an insurance policy .
Why would you need to read the entire thing ?
We will give him this , though : at least he 's being honest .
The bill also had opposition from Ald. Billy Ocasio ( 26th ) who seems to still have something of a connect with reality , saying , " I 'm sorry , but there are too many people in our city living paycheck to paycheck . "
Another tidbit about the new bill ?
Free Sundays and holidays are now a thing of the past and some meters will even require 24 - hour payment .
So explain to us again how the City can afford 2,000 new SUVs
An " overbearing " husband left his wife with three pork pies and some water when she got wedged down the side of the bed , a court heard today .
David Hargest , 65 , who admitted neglect and ill - treatment , said he could not free wife Cheryl because of his bad back .
The pork pies were still sitting on the mattress in their packet when police arrived at the couple 's flat , the court was told .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Cardiff Crown Court , where Hargest was given a 36 - week suspended sentence , heard how he failed to look after Mrs Hargest properly when he should have been caring for her .
Prosecutor Jon Holmes said the relative of a neighbour , a nurse , became concerned about Mrs Hargest .
" Mr Hargest was overbearing and domineering and she suggests that Mrs Hargest is , to a degree , afraid of him , " Mr Holmes said .
On one occasion she found the flat in Butetown , Cardiff , in a poor state with an " overwhelming " smell of urine .
In April , Hargest said his wife had " managed to get herself wedged between the mattresses " .
It had happened before , he said , but this time he could not get her out because of his back .
" He said he had left her some pork pies on the mattress so she had something to eat and a bottle of water , but he had clearly left her there , " Mr Holmes said .
Police could not see Mrs Hargest in the bedroom at first .
They found her lying on the floor between the bed and a chest of drawers .
" The police did notice there was a packet of three unopened pork pies on the mattress near to where Mrs Hargest was on the floor , " he said .

At hospital doctors said she was confused , dehydrated , had pressure sores on her back and showed signs of neglect .
Hargest accepted his wife had a history of schizophrenia and epilepsy , Mr Holmes added .
The couple met in 1993 and married in 1996 .
He started looking after her in 2000 .
But he stopped collecting the medication for her epilepsy and was told last December that he needed to bring her in for a review .
Jennet Treharne , mitigating , said at that time his " level of care fell short of what was required " .
" Why did he not go to find appropriate medication for her ?
The reason being that she was in denial herself , " she said .
" She was adamant that she would refuse to go , either to the surgery or have a home visit . "
She said Hargest accepted he should have gotten help when he could not move his wife .
" It perhaps shows the naivety of his approach that he left the pork pies for her , " she added .
" It was not a deliberate assault .
It was neglect and it is perhaps against a background of many , many , years of looking after his wife who had considerable problems . "
Sentencing Hargest for ill - treating or wilfully neglecting his wife at a time when she lacked mental capacity , Judge Isabel Parry said : " For a period of four months you failed to obtain , as you should have , your wife 's medication for her epilepsy . "
She added : " The fact that she was uncooperative and unable to do things at your request was a marker to the extent that she needed care , if not from you then from outside agencies . "
His sentence was suspended for two years and he will be supervised by a probation officer .

" Santa 's gone home .
Santa 's fucking dead . "
As theme park slogans go , it 's a winner .
Sadly , it was n't the official tagline for Lapland New Forest , the temporary Christmas attraction that was forced to close last week after furious visitors demanded their money back .
Instead , the " Santa " line was shouted at a Sun reporter and a " handful of queuing families " by a member of staff disconsolately closing the gates for the last time .
Lapland New Forest sounds like a barrel of laughs .
The publicity material promised a glorious winter wonderland replete with animal attractions , an ice rink , log cabins , a nativity scene , a snowy " tunnel of light " , and , of course , Santa 's grotto .
But according to incensed visitors , it turned out to be " little more than a mud-covered car park " .
They complained that the generator for the ice rink had malfunctioned , turning it into a pool of water , the " tunnel of light " was actually a few fairy lights dangling from trees covered in artificial snow , the nativity was an amateurish billboard , the log cabins were green sheds , and the animal attraction was a handful of reindeer and several " thin - looking huskies chained up in a pen " .
To keep the kids happy , there was apparently a four - hour queue for Santa 's grotto , at the end of which families were charged £ 10 for a photo with the man himself .
Oh , and refreshments were n't cheap either .
Five drinks and a baguette would set you back £ 17 .
Many visitors , who 'd paid around £ 25 per ticket , were n't especially impressed , and the mood quickly turned ugly .
One of the security guards told the BBC he'd quit , partly because he was " really , really ashamed " to work there , and also because of the level of violence he and the rest of the staff had been subjected to by irate customers .
" Santa got attacked , " he explained .
" One of the elves got smacked in the face and pushed in a pram . "
So now it 's closed , which is a shame , because it sounds great to me .
I love underwhelming theme parks .
Slick , showy ones with hi-tech rollercoasters may be entertaining on the day , but really they 're all the same .
I 've been to Euro Disney , Alton Towers and several others in that snazzy corporate vein , but they all blend into one in my memory .
Mostly , I remember the queues .
Give me a ramshackle DIY attraction any day .
Those are the ones that stay with you .
I 'll never forget the Concrete Menagerie , for example .
Picture Madame Tussauds , but with the celebrity waxworks made out of concrete .
And instead of stunning likenesses of the rich and famous , imagine a group of misshapen figurines that were scarcely recognisable as human beings , painted by an especially hamfisted group of GCSE art students in a hurry .
That was the Concrete Menagerie .
It was housed in the back garden of a house in Northumberland .
A full - scale model of Jaws ( the shark , not the Bond villain ) which resembled a giant grey phlegm glob with eyes was one highlight .
Another was a figurine of Lawrence of Arabia sitting astride a camel .
Lawrence had a set of real false teeth stuck in his mouth , leaving him with an unsettling rictus grin .
Recently , a friend excitedly recounted a family trip to Collector 's World , " a highly popular tourist attraction in Norfolk " , according to its website .
He , his wife and their offspring got lost on a driving trip and found themselves drawn mysteriously towards it .
It consisted of room upon room of bizarre , apparently unrelated artefacts .
There was a " Pink Room " dedicated to Barbara Cartland , a telephone museum , a collection of antique cars , some sort of hideous - sounding " gynaecological chair " , and best of all , a hall filled solely with memorabilia relating to the actor Liza Goddard , which apparently included pullovers and a mug she 'd once drunk out of .
Exhilarating and frightening in equal measure , I 'd imagine , especially if you 're Liza Goddard yourself .
So popular are skewwhiff theme parks , in fact , that there are two whole books devoted to collecting the best of them : Bollocks to Alton Towers and Far From the Sodding Crowd , which contain opening times and travel information for a veritable goldmine of enchanting and / or eccentric attractions , including the British Lawnmower Museum , Gnome Magic , the Margate Shell Grotto , and Cuckooland ( a collection of 550 vintage cuckoo clocks ) .
That Lapland New Forest has closed its gates before the team had a chance to include it in a third volume is almost - almost - a national tragedy .
Besides , if they 'd somehow managed to keep it going , the weight of publicity its sheer thudding , sprawling crapness has generated over the past week could surely have turned things around , at least in terms of ticket sales .
Thousands of people would doubtless have made the ironic pilgrimage , and the worse they 'd found it , the better .
A disappointing trudge through a car park to be ripped off by a man in an ill - fitting Santa costume .
It 's hard to think of a more appropriate Yuletide experience .
It 's the thought that counts .

Squat , bull - necked and sullen - looking , Enrique Portocarrero hardly seems a dashing character out of a Jules Verne science fiction novel .
But law enforcement officers here have dubbed him “ Captain Nemo , ” after the dark genius of “ 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea . ”
They say the 45 - year - old has designed and built as many as 20 fiberglass submarines , strange vessels with the look of sea creatures , for drug traffickers to haul cocaine from this area of southern Colombia to Central America and Mexico .
Capping a three - year investigation that involved U.S. and British counter - narcotics agents , Colombia ’s FBI equivalent , the Department of Administrative Security , arrested Portocarrero last month in the violent port city of Buenaventura , where he allegedly led a double life as a shrimp fisherman .
A day later , they descended on Portocarrero ’s hidden “ shipyard ” in a mangrove swamp 20 miles south of here and destroyed two of the vessels , which police say were each capable of carrying 8 tons of cargo .

“ He had a marvelous criminal vision , ” Colombian navy Capt .
Luis German Borrero said .
“ He introduced innovations such as a bow that produced very little wake , a conning tower that rises only a foot above the water and a valve system that enables the crew to scuttle the sub in 10 minutes .
He is very ingenious . ”
Authorities say they know little about Portocarrero except that he was arrested in 2003 on drug charges and soon released , a fact he relayed with a smirk when he was nabbed last month .
Most important , he once worked at a dry dock in Buenaventura , where he apparently learned his craft .
Portocarrero was living well .
Police , who reported finding $ 200,000 hidden in the spare tire of his car , say he had invested his reputed $ 1 - million - per - vessel fees in the purchase of five shrimp boats .
Administrative Security officials allege that Portocarrero helped invent “ semi- submersibles , ” as the narco - vessels are called , because they do n’t dive and resurface like true submarines , but cruise just below the surface .
Advertisement
Portocarrero ’s craft are difficult for counter - narcotics officials to detect on the open seas because their tiny wake creates a negligible radar “ footprint . ”
Also , authorities say , the exhaust is released through tubing below the surface , frustrating patrol aircraft ’s heat - sensing equipment .
“ He knew the rudiments of boat design , but probably had help from a naval engineer along the way , ” Borrero said .
Portocarrero developed a signature design , police say : a sleek V - shaped hull ; a sturdy keel , which is the boat ’s backbone ; and an exhaust system that makes the boat look like a monster from the deep .
There has been a quantum leap in detection and capture of semi-submersibles in the last two years .
Fifteen have been seized , destroyed or scuttled this year in the Pacific and Caribbean , compared with only one in 2006 , said Rear Adm .
Joseph Nimmich , head of Joint Interagency Task Force South , the Pentagon ’s anti-narcotics command center , based in Key West , Fla .
Advertisement
He estimated that as many as 60 of the vessels have slipped past patrols to deliver cocaine to Mexico and Central America .
Colombian agents say Portocarrero may have been in charge of building as many as a third of the subs this year .
The trend has U.S. security officials concerned because of the craft ’s potential for ferrying weapons and terrorists .
“ If they ca n’t make money transferring drugs , they could always turn to something else to transfer , other illicit cargoes , ” Nimmich said .
A conference on the issue last month in the Colombian city of Cartagena was attended by authorities from 26 countries , including Venezuela , which has forsworn cooperation with U.S. counter - narcotics agents .
Advertisement
The development is the latest in the cat - and - mouse game between drug traffickers and counter - narcotics officials .
Authorities believe tighter controls on Colombian and Ecuadorean fishing vessels , often used to move drugs , were a factor in the shift to subs .
Since mid-2007 , all fishing boats in the region have been required to carry GPS devices so police can track their movements .
The Colombian navy and police also say that so - called Midnight Express speedboats , supplied by the U.S. , have improved their chances of chasing down “ go - fast ” outboard boats , once the preferred mode of transport .
“ Speed was no longer winning the day , ” said a high - ranking U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration official based in Colombia who noted the “ exponential increase ” in the use of stealthy semi-submersible vessels in the last few years .
He spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns .
Police say several cocaine traffickers , looking to regain the advantage , got together to combine their cargoes and buy Portocarrero ’s boats , which took about six weeks each to build , said an informant who led Colombian coast guard officials to Portocarrero ’s mangrove shipyard .
Each vessel was designed according to the load of drugs , the informant said , with the maximum cargo of 10 tons of cocaine , worth $ 250 million in street value .
Advertisement
Portocarrero ’s vessels measured up to 60 feet long and were outfitted with complex ballast , communications and power systems , officials said .
They were typically powered by 350 - horsepower diesel engines , and the four - man crew had state - of - the - art radio , GPS and satellite telephone communications .
The subs have a range of 2,000 miles , more than enough to get from here to Mexico ’s Bay of Tehuantepec , a favored destination , Borrero said .
Although the subs are taxing counter - narcotics officials ’ ability to keep up , DEA officials say they are getting better at detecting the subs , thanks to computerized systems in British patrol aircraft .
Law enforcement has also been helped by a law the U.S. Congress passed in October making it possible to convict a boat ’s crew on the basis of visual evidence that they were manning the subs .
Before , crews avoided prosecution by simply scuttling the craft and sinking the drugs , depriving law enforcement of the evidence they needed .
Advertisement
Colombian authorities say they expect Portocarrero to be extradited to the United States , though no U.S. charges have yet been filed against him .
Some officials fear it ’s only a matter of time before traffickers take the next “ logical ” step : the use of real submarines .
Although no true submarines have ever been stopped with cocaine , authorities discovered one in 1995 near Bogota being built according to Russian plans .
“ As the interdiction rate against semi- submersibles increases , as it has , will traffickers revert back to the ubiquitous ‘ go - fasts , ’ or will they take it to the next level -- a fully submersible craft , unmanned with remote guidance capability ? ” the high - ranking DEA official said .
“ The latter has a lot more agencies than just DEA concerned . ”

With the consumer economy in the toilet , it 's no surprise the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas -- early next month -- is shrinking .
The Consumer Electronics Association says it 'll be smaller than the 2008 or 2007 shows , which were its biggest ever .
And something unheard - of is actually happening now : discounts on hotel rooms .
CNBC's Jim Goldman : Yes , you read that correctly .
Hotels on the Strip are actually slashing prices ahead of the big show .
In the 15 years I 've been covering these shows , I have never seen anything like this , and it may just go to show just how soft this economy really is .
In years ' past , hotels often jacked up their rates during the week of CES because they knew they could .
Rooms that ran $ 75 or $ 125 the week before and week after CES suddenly jumped to $ 350 , $ 450 , or over $ 500 .
The " CES Premium " all of us stuck paying it lamented .
This year , attendees are being tempted by an unheard - of CES discount !
In an email to registered attendees , the Consumer Electronics Association writes , " Those who have attended CES over the years and are accustomed to peak rates ... may be pleasantly surprised when they book rooms this year . "
" More affordable than ever , " the email adds .
The show is also offering discount airfares , free registration , and free hotel rooms for some groups , CNBC adds .
But that 's not enough to prevent many companies from ditching or downsizing their booths .
The economy is one problem .
Another : Boring trade shows .
Show us something that 's actually exciting at CES next year -- besides yet another big TV , yet another Blu-ray player -- and we 'll eat our words .

Welfare at Slaughter
Around the world , millions of animals are killed for human consumption every day .
Although slaughter forms only a brief period within an animal ’s life , it is arguably the time when the potential for poor welfare is greatest .
Over the last 100 years the HSA has been responsible for many of the animal welfare improvements seen at slaughter .
The HSA ’s first major project was aimed at replacing the pole - axe , a crude and inefficient implement used for stunning animals , with the captive - bolt stunner , a humane , mechanically - operated stunner .
In the early 1920s it carried out an eight month demonstration of the effectiveness of the captive - bolt stunner at a slaughterhouse in Islington , London .
As a result of the HSA ’s efforts , a bye - law requiring the use of humane stunners was adopted by 28 London boroughs , and later by 494 other UK local authorities .
When the HSA was founded , there were no laws protecting animal welfare at slaughter .
The HSA has worked with local , national and international authorities to develop legislation to protect animal welfare .
The HSA has also offered practical assistance in times of need , such as providing almost 500 captive - bolt stunners to licensed slaughtermen across the UK during the Second World War , and assisting during the UK foot and mouth crises of 1966 and 2001 .
The HSA is a leading source of support and funding for essential scientific research within its field and has assisted the application of many advances into the working practices of the meat industry .
The HSA helped to develop the first hand - held , low voltage electrical stunner for poultry ; it arranged for the first high - throughput automatic poultry stunner to be trialled in the UK in 1960s ; and it spearheaded the development of a prototype mobile slaughterhouse in the 1990s .
More recently , the HSA has promoted the use of humane stunning equipment for farmed fish , and is currently supporting the development of a new device for the humane killing of chickens in emergencies .

By : ISS Science Officer Don Pettit Growing Plants in Zero-G
Growing plants in the weightless environment of an orbiting spacecraft is much harder than meets the eye .
Having a supply of tomato and basil seeds I tried my hand at growing them with results proving that it is not as easy as the first time I tried this for science class in second grade .
I do not have the necessary ingredients to grow healthy plants to fruition .
We have no dirt on space station .
I have no soil or soil substitute and no fertilizer to supply the necessary macro and micronutrients throughhydroponics .
However , it is possible to investigate sprouting where the new plant structures live off the nutrients from their seed starch .
The best I could expect is to have healthy seedlings for a few days and then have them turn yellow , wither , and die as they starve for the lack of potassium , fixed nitrogen compounds , and all the other micronutrients .
With this end in mind , I set out to construct a 0g sprouter .
Lacking soil , you need some sort of substrate that will retain both seeds and water .
I considered using an old shirt or sock but decided the Russian supplied toilet paper was best .
This toilet paper is not like what you normally think of as toilet paper .
It consisted of two layers of coarsely woven gauze , 4 by 6 inches in dimension sewn together at the edges with a layer of brown tissue sandwiched in - between .
It works very well for its intended purpose .
It also makes a wonderful sprouter .
It retains water well and the seeds can be anchored under the gauze weft .
My first thoughts were to arrange the seeds in little rows on the rectilinear squares of toilet paper .
Only then did it occur to me that being on space station could offer new possibilities .
Why not a spherical planter ?
Every direction is the same as the rest and a sphere would offer some interesting possibilities .
The limited lighting , both from window and artificial sources , can be shared by the spherical surface if the sphere is attached to a string and allowed to freely rotate in the air currents .
It will then be constantly moving and bobbing around like a helium balloon on a string and thus share the lighting with all its surfaces .
The plants can enjoy the 1 / R^2 potential given by spherical geometry .
A spherical geometry gives increasing surface area as the plants radially expand , surface area needed for leaves and photosynthesis .
They will not have to partake in foliage fights like plants do when grown on a rectilinear flat plane where surface area for foliage becomes limited as the plants grow upwards .
It also allows one small spherical volume in which to circulate hydroponics via capillary action .
A spherical geometry for growing plants in limited volume makes good sense if you have weightlessness .
To construct my planter , a spherical core is needed .
An old pair of underwear worked well .
We have supplies on station sufficient to change our underwear perhaps once every three to four days so I figured there might be a few nutrients in there as well .
An old pair of underwear was folded into a sphere and held in place with a few well - placed stitches using needle and thread from our sewing kit .
The toilet paper was sewn to the outer surface .
A drinking straw was sewn so that its opening was in contact with the fabric and could thus be connected to a drink bag to provide a continuous water drip via capillary action .
Seeds were planted with a pair of tweezers by carefully working each seed between the weft of the gauze .
The sphere was initially watered and then attached to the water bag by a long thin plastic tube , which also functioned as a string and hung by a light in the node .
It bobbed around in the air currents .
I became concerned , when after a few days , no sign of sprouting had occurred .
The water bag was working well in keeping the sphere moist and was consuming about 100 ml a day .
I touched the sphere .
It was cold .
The cabin air temperature was warm at 28 degrees centigrade .
I measured the sphere at 18 C. Evaporative cooling was acting like a refrigerator and slowing germination .
A plastic enclosure was constructed out of plastic bags that made the planter sphere into a miniature greenhouse .
A few holes were poked through the side for ventilation just like you did in the jar lid when you were in second grade .
The plastic enclosure slowed the rate of evaporation and resulted in temperatures around 30 C .
Within two days there were sprouts .
However , not all was well on the planter sphere .
Gravity plays an important role in sending roots down and stems up .
Without gravity , every direction is the same .
Roots and stems were exiting the seed and growing in any direction within the plane of the spherical surface .
The lighting provided an outward growing cue however its effects were small compared to the effects of capillary forces .
Capillary forces , subtle in nature and derived from the water interface on the damp layers of gauze , convinced the sprouts to ignore the outward direction of the light and to grow in the surface plane of the sphere .
Each sprout had deployed its cotyledons , two miniature leaves that jump - start photosynthesis and provide for the growth of its real leaves .
Cotyledons are the drogue chute equivalent before the main canopy is deployed in a parachute system .
The capillary forces were overpowering the effect from the outward direction of light .
Without gravity 's direction , it was as if the sprouts were lazy and decided to give into the subtle capillary forces instead of standing upright to light 's beckoning .
The cotyledons , constantly covered with a warm layer of water , rapidly molded and withered .
Without a drogue chute , the main canopy will not deploy and you will have a hard landing .
Without cotyledons , the sprouts died .
It is imperative to make the sprouting leaves grow through the water film as quickly as possible , thus surrounding them with fresh air .
It was too late to save this batch of sprouts so a new batch was started .
This time , as each sprout deployed its cotyledons they were carefully pulled by hand out from the grips of surface tension and allowed to freely spread their leaves in the surrounding air .
This batch of sprouts did as well as you could expect having only their starchy seedpod as a source of nutrients .
After an inch or so of growth with budding main leaves forming , they turned yellow and died .
When you live inside of a metal can filled with machines and electronics , a small splash of growing green is a pleasant reminder from where we came ; we all have our roots .
I could not help but feel a small sadness for these living creatures that were giving me so much delight while I was powerless to help them grow strong .
In these credit - crunching times , many people are trying to raise extra money .
Some people clear out the garage and have a sale , while others drop their unwanted items on eBay .
If your purchases are digital in nature , do n't worry .
A new site has appeared where you can sell your unwanted MP3s .
Times are tough right now .
Unemployment is rising , many businesses are in serious trouble and it looks like Christmas spending will leave little for retailers to be cheerful about either .
With credit becoming more difficult to acquire and future potential for funds looking less than healthy , many people are looking for second and third jobs .
Those that have no time may consider selling items in order to raise extra funds , but for those whose unwanted items are digital rather than physical , options have been limited – until now .
Enter Bopaboo .
That ’s right .
Got a few unwanted MP3 ’s cluttering your hard drive ?
Accidentally bought the same track , two , three , four times or received a duplicate song as a gift ?
Do n’t worry !
Offload your unwanted MP3s at Bopaboo and delight in all the extra cash and hard drive space you just created .
It ’s a win - win - win situation .
So how does it work ?
Currently in private - beta to United States - based users , Bopaboo seems easy to use .
According to the site , after registering the user is given his very own MP3 store .
Here he simply uploads his unwanted MP3s ( no DRM allowed ) and selects the sales price .
The user can upload as many MP3s as he likes , there is no limit .
Bopaboo handles the order taking and payment processing and as soon as a buyer buys an MP3 , the site transfers the file to the customer and the money to the seller .
Of course , Bopaboo has to make its money , and it does so by taking a percentage of the sales price .
Initially , money is placed in the user ’s ‘ bopaBank ’ but it is available for withdrawal or further purchases on Bopaboo .
Potential buyers can search in all the usual ways , with a feedback and seller rating system to help with choosing a supplier .
Tracks can be purchased for as little as $ 0.25 each and major credit cards are accepted .
Bopaboo state that their service is completely legal with their tagline – “ Stop illegally sharing and start legally selling ! ”
In their FAQ they further state that “ Unlike , peer - to - peer file networks – bopaboo never creates duplicates of your music . ”
We contacted Bopaboo and asked for more information but they have n’t responded so far .
So in the meantime , I ’m off to see how much space I can clear on a couple of 500gig hard drives – these MP3s are simply gathering dust and this Bopaboo opportunity is too good to miss .
Decisions , decisions ……
Needville Independent School District Violates State Law With Suspension Of Five - Year - Old
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
HOUSTON – The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Texas today filed a lawsuit against the Needville Independent School District ( NISD ) for punishing a five - year - old American Indian kindergarten student for practicing and expressing his family 's religious beliefs and heritage by wearing his hair long in violation of school rules .
School officials have forced A.A. into isolated in - school suspension because he and his family refuse to abide by a district mandate that he stuff his long hair , part of his American Indian religious and cultural heritage , down the back of his shirt while at school - a requirement that would cause A.A. shame , embarrassment and physical discomfort .
" A.A. 's parents have raised him to practice and be proud of his religion and culture as an American Indian , which includes wearing his uncut hair in two long braids , " said Lisa Graybill , Legal Director for the ACLU of Texas .
" NISD recognized that A.A. 's religious beliefs exempt him from its dress code requirement that boys have short hair , but the alternate policy they adopted for him is still unlawful . "
A.A. 's parents , Kenny Arocha and Micelle Betenbaugh , have raised their son according to his father 's American Indian religious beliefs .
Kenny and A.A. Arocha believe that one 's hair should only be cut for life - changing occasions , such as the death of a loved one .
They believe their long hair is a sacred symbol of their own lives .
The five - year - old 's hair has never been cut .
Nearly eight months after A.A. 's parents first requested an exemption from the district 's dress code , and only after the family appealed the Needville School Board 's initial denial , the district finally conceded less than a week before school started that A.A. 's long hair is part of his religious heritage and that he can not be forced to cut it .
But instead of simply exempting him from that part of the dress code , NISD officials are requiring that A.A. keep his thick , foot - long hair " tightly woven " into a single braid and stuffed down the back of his shirt at all times , and to re-prove his religious sincerity to NISD officials every school year .
A.A. 's parents have refused to subject their son to this degrading and impracticable policy .
His mother , Michelle Betenbaugh , said , " Asking a five - year - old to keep a foot of hair shoved down his shirt is not just humiliating , it is impractical and unhygienic in Houston 's sweltering climate . "
As punishment for non-compliance with its dress code policy , NISD has segregated A.A. from his kindergarten class and assigned him to in - school suspension every school day since Sept.
3 . In - school suspension is the harshest discipline the law permits for a child his age .
" NISD is trying to force A.A. and his parents to choose between practicing and expressing his religion and identity , and obtaining a public education , " said Fleming Terrell , staff attorney for the ACLU of Texas .
" But Texas law and the First Amendment both prohibit the district from forcing parents and students to make this choice . "
The lawsuit , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas , charges that NISD 's actions violate Betenbaugh 's and Arocha 's rights to raise A.A. according to their family 's religion , heritage and identity , as well as A.A. 's constitutional and statutory rights to free exercise of religion and free expression .
Courts have held that the First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution protect students ' rights to dress in conformation with their religious beliefs .
Texas ' Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) provides additional protections .
" The Constitution protects the right of all people in this country to express their religious beliefs as they see fit , " said Daniel Mach , Director of Litigation for the ACLU Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief .
" The same law protects Catholic students who wear a rosary , Christian students who wear a cross or Jewish students who wear a Star of David .
Yet the school board has ignored this basic principle by punishing this young child 's expression of his faith and heritage . "

One visitor to the park , where entry costs £ 25 per person , said the nativity scene had everyone she met laughing .
Welcome to Wired 's 11th annual Vaporware Awards , our annual roundup of the tech industry 's biggest , brashest and most baffling unfulfilled promises .
This year , handset makers were exhaling more vapor than anyone – eager to compete with the iPhone and to cash in on the excitement around Android and GPS - enabled services , the mobile sector was ripe with empty vows .
Gamers had it rough again this year , too , as several key titles failed to ship on time .
We selected from readers ' submissions the top 10 products that were supposed to ship in 2008 but ended up delayed , derailed or otherwise rendered in absentia .
Hardware , software , games and vehicles were all fair game .
Beta releases count , but as in years past , we gave Gmail a pass – it's branded " beta , " but it 's widely used by millions .
Like " Google " and " Twitter , " " Gmail " has even become a verb .
A surprisingly high percentage of last year 's winners actually shipped this year ( Chinese Democracy , the Tesla Roadster and the world 's most expensive and useless keyboard among them ) , clearing the decks for a whole new stack of suckage .
So here it is : Vaporware 2008 .
Prepare to taste the waste .
10 . Sony PlayStation Home
* Screenshoot * Sony 's virtual world for PlayStation 3 users , Home , earns a top slot , even though the service finally launched as an open beta in early December .
But beta ai n't shrinkwrapped – so it 's fair game .
Home was originally announced in March 2007 , but was repeatedly sidelined .
And now that it ’s kinda here , it 's woefully incomplete .
Promised features like video sharing are absent , Sony has removed voice chat until further notice , and users from different countries can't interact with one another – a major problem for an international platform .
Home does n't even succeed as a Second Life rip - off , owing to the fact that there simply is n't much to do .
You can walk around in the mall and spend real money on virtual clothes branded with advertisements , or you can hang out at the bowling alley and play crappy video games .
That 's about it .
Even the avatar creation system is incredibly scaled - down .
Sony keeps promising
Home will get more features later , relying on the " it 's only a beta " line whenever somebody points out that it is a completely useless piece of crap that no one would ever use .
" There is of course no place like Home , " quipped reader Bob Krupinski .
9 . Myka
Photo courtesy MykaA set - top box with a built - in BitTorrent client , the Myka had the Pirate Bay crowd salivating when it was first announced in March .
And rightly so when you consider a tiny box with HDMI connections , H.264 and Blu-ray support , embedded Linux , a 160GB hard drive and the ability to suck all of Hollywood 's top hits directly from the file - sharing networks , no purchase required .
But the pirate 's dream appliance remains a pipe dream , and it looks likely to stay that way .
As reader Chris Lindley points out , Myka 's website is still taking pre-orders , even though the user forums are overrun with spam and requests for refunds .
Even if it eventually arrives , the Myka 's missed the boat .
Any potential customers have already picked up the like - minded HD set - top box from Popcorn Hour , or they just bought Apple TVs and installed Boxee .
8. Hero's Journey
Image courtesy Simultronics ** Duke Nukem had better watch his back .
This graphical MMOG – made by Simutronics , the people behind cult fave MUDs like Gemstone IV and DragonRealms – has been in the works for almost a decade .
Hero's Journey 's promise of an open game world that responds to player decisions earned raves at the gaming trade show E3 .
That is , it earned raves at E3 2005 .
The official FAQ claims that the game is " actively in production and does not have a set release date . "
The hold - up seems to be that development focus has shifted from the game itself to its engine , HeroEngine , which Simutronics has licensed out .
Bioware is using it to power its upcoming Star Wars : The Old Republic .
As reader Kuro suggests , " If Old Republic gets released before Hero's Journey , that will probably be the final nail in the game 's vaporware coffin . "
7. ZAP-X
Image courtesy ZAPWith all eyes on climate change , roller - coaster gas prices and Detroit 's ineffable ineptitude , few technologies more eagerly awaited than a sensible electric car .
At an estimated $ 60,000 , Zap's ZAP -X EV SUV may not be all that affordable , but it 's an important step towards an alt fuel future .
The all - electric SUV promises a 350 - mile range , 644 horsepower , a top speed of 155 mph – the power of a Porsche Cayenne at around half the price , and only costing around a penny per mile to drive .
Originally promised for 2008 , the ZAP - X's arrival has been pushed back to 2010 .
But even experts question Zap 's ability to pump out an electric with such sexy specs before the end of the decade .
" This is vaporware , " Aaron Bragman , an auto industry analyst at Global Insight , told Wired.com earlier this year .
" I 'd take it with a grain of salt . "
6. Microvision Pico projector

It 's a tiny projector for your mobile phone – a super - small projection module that can be embedded in phones , laptops , cameras and portable media players .
A miniature wonder that lets you show off your boring home videos and pirated DVD rips in stunning high - resolution on the back of the nearest stained white t- shirt .
" Guaranteed to make you sick of looking at other people 's crappy quality family photo albums , " says reader Grady Root .
But while Microvision generated lots of buzz for its tiny " Pico P " laser light device at CES in January 2008 , it has n’t yet shown up .
So far , all we 've seen are hyped - up reviews of prototypes .
Meanwhile , other companies , including Toshiba , have managed to ship their own pico projectors this year .
Microvision has since partnered with Motorola to build a phone with a built - in projector .
Hello Vaporware 2010 ?
5. Garmin nüvifone
Image courtesy GarminThis 3G - enabled handheld will be the first dip into the smartphone fray from the GPS device manufacturer Garmin – if , of course , it ever arrives .
The nüvifone was first announced in January of 2008 , boasting a list of features to make map - geeks drool : preloaded world maps , real - time traffic stats , Google Maps and local search .
Plus , a built - in camera that automatically geo-tags photos , integration with Google Panaramio photo sharing services and voice - prompted directions .
There 's even a feature that pinpoints the place on the map where you last removed the nüvifone from its dashboard mount so you 'll always remember where you parked .
But the promised release date of Q3 2008 came and went , and the nüvifone is now expected during the first half of 2009 .
Says disappointed reader Elio Manetti : " I do n't believe anymore it will ever be released . "
The boys and girls in Wired 's Gadget Lab were ready to write off the nüvifone , believing it would never ship , until documents suggesting it is currently being tested by the FCC surfaced on the web .
In the meantime , we 'll stick to our Signal the Frog antenna ball when we want to find our parked car .
4. StarCraft II
Image courtesy Blizzard Entertainment
If the previewed gameplay videos and cut scenes are any indication , Blizzard Entertainment 's sequel the 1998 sci- fi strategy game StarCraft looks like an epic multi-player frag - fest .
Much like the company 's wildly successful Warcraft III , StarCraft II will let users edit campaigns , create their own maps and modify the game play to their hearts ' content .
Sounds like a doozy , but so far , it 's a snoozy .
StarCraft II has been in development since 2003 , was teased and demoed throughout 2007 , promised in 2008 , and now it 's been pushed back until at least 2009 .
Reader Ray Keller is fed up with the wait .
" I 'm stuck watching the videogame elite play on YouTube , " he writes .
Says reader John Epperson : " I 'm not the only one who has been waiting for this installment for more than five years !!
And I 'm not even a Starcraft fanboy ! "
Bad enough that Blizzard has a slow , methodical " It 's ready when it 's ready " attitude , the company has now announced the game will be carved up into several pieces that will be sold separately .
So , we wait forever for the game to come out , and then when it finally does , it 'll just be a first installment ?!
Grrr ...
3. Android phones other than the T - Mobile G1
Image courtesy Open Handset AllianceGoogle 's open - source Android operating system for mobiles is one killer bundle of tech .
It has a real web browser , some awesome GPS capabilities , support for touch screens and the flexibility to run on all kinds of hardware .
Which makes the first Android phone , T - Mobile 's G1 , that much more of a bummer .
An Android phone could be so much more than a clunky iPhone knockoff with a slide - out keyboard .
There are nine major handset manufacturers in the Open Handset Alliance , and all of them are committed to bringing out Android phones .
So where are they already ?
There is one beacon of hope from down under .
Australian company Kogan Technologies plans to release the Agora , the world 's first non-G1 Google phone , in January of 2009 .
We look forward to reading the reviews on our iPhones .
2. Internet Explorer 8
ScreenshotWired.comLove it or hate it , Microsoft Internet Explorer commands the lion 's share of the world browser market .
Previous versions of the browser were much maligned by the web elite – IE7 is capable but flawed , and IE6 was a gigantic piece of crap – but even the Firefox - using snobs of the blogosphere saw something to look forward to in early builds of Internet Explorer 8 .
And continue to look forward they shall .
After pegging the browser for a late 2008 ship date , Microsoft has pushed its estimated arrival back into 2009 .
The browser is currently available as a public beta , and the first release candidate was sent out for private testing in December .
The betas look great , but final code is still months away – cold comfort for OEMs and corporations who can't adopt a new browser until it 's been thoroughly tested and approved .
Meanwhile , older versions of IE continue to instill fear in IT managers and web developers everywhere as new security flaws pop up and new compatibility problems are exposed .
Hurry up , Microsoft .
Countless Windows desktops need IE8 badly .
Come to their rescue before they all wise up and switch to Firefox .
And the Vaporware 2008 winner is ...
1. Duke Nukem Forever
Image courtesy 3 - D RealmsReally , is there anywhere else you expected this to end up ?
After some twelve ( 12 ! ) years in development , we had given up all hope of ever seeing Duke Nukem Forever hit the shelves .
We even held a high - level meeting in the Wired newsroom where we agreed to end the agony and , some vague promises to the press about a 2008 release notwithstanding , leave Duke off the Vaporware list this year .
Even the best jokes get old eventually .
Says reader Dennis Murphy : " My nominations for DNF got printed in 2001 & 2002 .
Here we are , 7 years later , and it 's still on the list .
How about one more chance ?
If we do n't see it by 2010 , I promise I 'll stop submitting !
( Well , at least till my grandkids are born ... ) "
But then , in May , Jace Hall of Crackle.com scored an on -camera interview with the Dukefathers , George Broussard and Scott Miller of 3 - D Realms .
At the end of their sit - down , the DNF developers even let him demo an actual , working version of the game .
The resulting hand - held footage of the first - person shooter was all the proof we needed – the game is still inching towards reality .
So congrats , Duke .
You 're the King of Vaporware once again .
When pressed to explain the delay , Broussard and Miller , aside from blaming " hookers and cocaine , " offer a classic excuse .
" There 's a lot of mistakes and lessons we had to learn , " Broussard says .
" But most of all , there 's also been a lot of World of Warcraft . "
OK guys , we get it .
You love playing games so much , you can't be bothered to finish building your own .
Put down the bong and get it DONE .
Tell you what – we 'll give you one more year .
A number of major national women ’s groups have endorsed Maloney for that position .
Their leadership has been uncharacteristically quiet since Caroline entered the fray .
But Marcia Pappas , president of the New York State chapter of the National Organization for Women told me , politely : “ We can have a number of people who are qualified and we have to be very respectful of people and their talents , but when it comes down to it , we have to be grown - ups .
We think this position should go to someone who ’s paid her dues , who ’s done the work . ”
That ’s the operative word : “ work . ” I do think that the next United States senator from New York ought to be someone who has worked for the honor .
Clearly , Caroline can’t , for the sake of her political viability  or her likability with people like me  suddenly remake herself into someone who has worked for a living .
But at this point , with so many people struggling so arduously just to get by , any effort at all would be appreciated .
True campaigning  at the appropriate time  would prove her mettle pretty fast .
It might even be liberating .
It ca n’t be fun to live your life defined  in the public eye at least  by your tragic past .
At age 51 , having still to be the “ lucky little girl with a pony and an impossibly handsome father , ” our “ tragic national princess , ” as The Washington Post ’s Ruth Marcus put it last week , ca n’t be too great , no matter how many strangers say they like you .
( “ I like her ...
There ’s magic in the Kennedy name that attracts power and support and love , ” wrote radio host Rob Kall on The Huffington Post . )
Such love is a bit unseemly .
Even embarrassing .
“ Confusing Politics With the Lifetime Channel , ” Andrew Sullivan ’s Daily Dish blog headlined the subject this week .
Caroline does n’t have to be a fairy - tale princess anymore .
She can be her own white knight , vaulting the Kennedys proudly into the 21st century , if only she plays by the rules and waits her turn .
For an ongoing project I am implementing basic advertising functionality , where I define a number of positions in the page and advertisers can self - serve to create an advertisement to fit those positions .
Each ' Position ' can have different attributes turned on or off .
For example , a ' sidebar ' ad may permit an image and link text , however a ' footer ' ad may only contain link text .
When the user creates their own ad , I wanted a single form that morphed itself based on the Position being used so that fields were enabled or disabled , and made mandatory as required .
To get started , here are excerpts from the two models I 'll use to demonstrate how I achieved this :
# models .py from django.db import models class Position ( models .
Model ) : title = models .
CharField ( max_length = 100 ) description = models .
Text Field ( ) has_title = models .
BooleanField ( blank = True , null = True ) has_summary = models .
BooleanField ( blank = True , null = True ) has_link = models .
BooleanField ( blank = True , null = True ) has_image = models .
BooleanField ( blank = True , null = True ) class Advertisement ( models .
Model ) : position = models .
ForeignKey ( Position ) internal_name = models .
CharField ( max_length = 150 ) image = models .
ImageField ( upload_to = ad_image_path , blank = True , null = True ) link_url = models .
URLField ( blank = True , null = True ) link_text = models .
CharField ( max_length = 100 , blank = True , null = True ) ad_text = models .
CharField ( max_length = 100 , blank = True , null = True )
The trick here is to ensure that when creating an Advertisement , the image , link_url , link_text and ad_text fields are turned on and off based on the related Position .
First things first : I created a ModelForm instance for my Advertisement model :
class AdvertisementForm ( forms . ModelForm ) : class Meta : model = Advertisement
This basic form shows all fields from the Advertisement model to the user , which was n't exactly what I wanted .
My final AdvertisementForm class made use of the __init__ ( ) method to remove irrelevant fields , and make any remaining fields required .
# forms.py class AdvertisementForm ( forms .
ModelForm ) : def __init__ ( self , * args , ** kwargs ) : self .
position = kwargs [ ' position ' ] del kwargs [ ' position ' ] super ( AdvertisementForm , self ) .
__init__ (* args , ** kwargs ) if not self .
position .
has_title : del self .
fields [ ' link_text ' ] else : self .
fields [ ' link_text ' ]. required =
True if not self .
position .
has_summary : del self .
fields [ ' ad_text ' ] else : self .
fields [ ' ad_text ' ]. required =
True if not self .
position .
has_link : del self .
fields [ ' link_url ' ] else : self .
fields [ ' link_url ' ]. required =
True if not self .
position .
has_image : del self .
fields [ ' image ' ] else : self .
fields [ ' image ' ]. required =
True class Meta : model = Advertisement exclude = ( ' position ' ,)
You 'll notice that I am using the position keyword argument to the form to determine which fields to show and make required .
Obviously this turns the usage of this form into a two - step process :
Firstly the user must select a position , then the relevant form is displayed to them based on their selection .
This means that the in - view usage is slightly different to how we usually use forms in Django :
# views.py def create_ad ( request ) : if request .
REQUEST.get ( ' position ' , None ) : # This matches both request .
GET and request .
POST position = Position.objects.get(slug=request.REQUEST.get(' position ' ) ) if request .
method == ' POST ' : post_data = request .
POST.copy ( ) del( post_data [ ' position ' ] ) if position .
has_image : form = AdvertisementForm( post_data , request .
FILES , position=position ) else : form = AdvertisementForm( post_data , position=position ) if form.is_valid( ) : ad = form.save(commit=False ) ad.position = position ad.save ( ) return HttpResponseRedirect( reverse( ' ad_listing ' ) ) else : form = AdvertisementForm( position=position ) return render_to_response(" create_ad.html " , RequestContext ( request , { ' position ' : position , ' form ' : form , } ) ) else : positions = Position.objects.filter ( ) return render_to_response(" select_position.html " , RequestContext ( request , { ' positions ' : positions , } ) )
This view shows the two - step process that 's now involved for the user :
They are shown select_position .
html , a very simple template : < ul > { % for position in positions %} < li > < a href= './? position= {{ position . slug }} ' > {{ position .
title }} </a></li> { % endfor %} </ul >
The user selects a position , and the slug is passed back into the view as a GET parameter .
The view grabs the Position object from the database based on the slug
The form is initialised , passing the position keyword paramater
The form sets self .
position to save the position within the Advertisement Form instance , then deletes the parameter from the keyword options .
Normal form initialisation then occurs ( via the Super call )
The position is then checked to see if the has_title paramater is set .
If it is , then the link_text field is made mandatory .
If it is n't , then the link_text field is deleted from the form .
This happens again for the ad_text , link_url and image fields .
The form is rendered to the user with a neat little loop within the create_ad .
html template : < form method= ' post ' action= './' { % if form.is_multipart %} enctype= ' multipart/form - data ' { % endif %} > < dl > { % for field in form %} { % if field .
is_hidden %} {{ field }} { % else %} < dt > {{ field.label_tag }} </ dt > < dd> {{ field }} </dd > { % if field .
help_text %} < dd class= ' help_text ' > {{ field .
help_text }} </dd > { % endif %} { % if field .
errors %} < dd class= ' errors ' > {{ field.errors }} </dd > { % endif %} { % endif %} { % endfor %} < dd > < input type= " submit " value= " Add Item " /></dd > </dl > < input type= " hidden " name= " position " value= " {{ position . slug }} " /> </ form >
When the user clicks ' Submit ' , the form initialisation is again run before the form is validated , using the POST ed ' position ' variable ..
This means that validation will be run against the modified form , not against the base form .
This is all pretty straightforward , but it seems to be missed by many people trying to build custom forms .

7. Cholesterol Drugs : New Questions
A medical mystery emerged at the beginning of 2008 :
Why did a drug that lowers cholesterol fail to reduce plaque in the arteries ?
The FDA has approved drugs based on their ability to lower cholesterol -- but only because this is supposed to cut the risk of clogged arteries and heart disease .
But Vytorin , a combination of the cholesterol - lowering statin drug Zocor and the cholesterol - blocking drug Zetia , did n't seem to work better than Zocor alone .
As the year went on , cholesterol - lowering drugs called statins ( such as Zocor ) looked better and better .
Researchers dispelled fears they might raise cancer risk .
And they found that statins cut the risk of heart disease in half for people with normal cholesterol levels but high levels of C - reactive protein in the blood .
Here 's how WebMD covered these stories :
G.M. is in trouble , according to the latest news .
The company has some contracts and other obligations that it ca n’t afford .
What can the government do to help ?
Answer :
The government has already done everything that it needs to in order to help G.M.
The government established bankruptcy courts so that a company like G.M. can go through a Chapter 11 reorganization .
During the Chapter 11 process , a judge has the power to adjust the company ’s obligations so that they can be paid from the company ’s likely future revenue .
Chapter 11 was designed specifically so that employees can keep their jobs , albeit possibly at lower salaries , while shareholders and creditors suffer and / or are wiped out .
The stockholders , creditors , and employees of G.M. do not deserve to be spared the pain of the recession .
The rest of America will be taking pay cuts , losing jobs , giving discounts to customers , etc .
What is special about G.M. that they should be able to live as though 2008 never happened ?
[ Note that the current market capitalization of G.M. is only about $ 2.8 billion ( compare to over $ 100 billion for Google ) .
The shareholders have already lost almost 100 percent of their investment .
The world wo n’t come to an end if these shareholders go from losing 95 percent to losing 100 percent .
An evaporation of $ 2.8 billion will barely register compare to the losses that the S&P 500 holders suffer nearly every day . ]
Sometimes the best way to learn how the brain works is to watch what happens when it goes awry .
When one part — a clump of neurons or a brain - building gene — does n’t do what it is supposed to , the brain may fail in an illuminating way .
Its failure may even expose some of the hidden foundations of the mind .
Neuroscientists have recently become fascinated with a particularly telling pair of rare brain disorders .
One was identified in 1965 by English physician Harry Angelman , who was struck by the faces of three children he treated .
These children were always smiling and often laughing .
This disorder , now known as Angelman syndrome , affects around 1 in 20,000 children .
Along with the smiles and laughs come other symptoms , some of which overlap those of severe autism .
Many children with Angelman syndrome never learn to speak or read .
They also keep their bodies in motion , often flapping their hands .
When they nurse they suckle desperately , thrusting out their tongue .
Another similarly rare condition , called Prader - Willi syndrome , produces a different set of symptoms .
Babies with Prader - Willi nurse very little — so little that they often have to be tube fed .
However , once Prader - Willi children get to be a few years old , they develop an insatiable appetite .
They will try to get around any obstacle put between them and food .
Their fierce hunger is driven by a malfunctioning hypothalamus , a region deep in the brain that governs hunger and growth .
Instead of autism , many people with Prader - Willi syndrome develop schizophrenia by adulthood , hearing voices and generating paranoid delusions .
Despite their differences , Prader - Willi and Angelman are two sides of the same coin .
Scientists have searched for the genetic basis of the two syndromes and have tracked most cases of both to defects on the same spot of the human genome , a stretch of DNA on chromosome 15 .
Which disease a child gets depends on which parent ’s chromosome 15 carries the defect ( every person ’s cells contain two genetic copies , one from the mother and one from the father ) .
Prader - Willi syndrome is caused by a mutation in a father ’s genes that deletes a chunk of DNA on chromosome 15 .
Angelman syndrome is associated with a mutation on the mother ’s chromosome 15 .
If you think back to the genetics you learned in school , this pattern makes no sense .
A gene is a gene is a gene .
Two identical stretches of DNA ought to have the same effect on a child , regardless of which parent it comes from .
But sometimes our genes break the rules of high - school genetics .
The effects of dozens , perhaps hundreds , of genes depend on whether you inherited them from your mother or your father .
Dissimilarities arise because not all genes are actively expressed in our cells .
Some of the genes get switched off , or silenced .
Each time a cell divides and makes a new copy of its DNA , special enzymes attach caps at certain spots along the copy ’s length .
Those caps make it impossible for a cell to read the specific genes they are attached to .
As a result , those genes ca n’t make the corresponding proteins .
In some cases the caps are attached to only one parent ’s copy of a gene .
The other parent ’s copy remains uncapped , free to produce proteins .
This parental silencing is known as gene imprinting , and it is turning out to be important to our health .
Mutations that change the pattern of imprinting can have a big effect on our bodies .
If a cell fails to imprint one of the two parents ’ genes , for example , it will have two genes producing a protein instead of just one .
The cell will make twice as many copies of the protein .
The discovery of gene imprinting in 1984 raised a big question :
Why should genes from one parent be silenced in the first place ?
In 1999 , David Haig of Harvard University offered a startling hypothesis .
Gene imprinting , he proposed , is the result of the evolutionary struggle between mothers and fathers for reproductive success .
This fight does n’t take place between mothers and fathers themselves but between the genes that they pass down to their offspring .
Natural selection favors genes that can make more copies of themselves .
But the best strategy for the genes of fathers is not the same as the one that ’s best for the genes carried by mothers .
For millions of years , mothers have had to invest a huge amount of time and effort in their children .
The investment starts in the womb as mothers supply growing fetuses with nutrients .
Haig noted that the demands of reproduction have forced mothers into an evolutionary trade - off .
If they invest a lot in one child , he or she gets bigger and healthier and more likely to survive to adulthood .
But investing too much in one child can undermine the well - being of any siblings and can put a mother ’s own health at risk .
The most successful solution is to invest a lot — but not too much — in each child .
Fathers do not face this trade - off .
As a result , natural selection should favor a different strategy for their genes .
From a dad ’s perspective , the more nutrients his child can get from the mother , the more likely it is that the child will grow up healthy and pass on his or her father ’s genes .
Haig argued that the process of natural selection would favor mutations in the genes of fathers that boost the amount of nutrition babies get from their mothers .
The genes might govern the speed at which a fetus grows , or they might make the placenta more aggressive as it penetrates the mother ’s tissues .
As fathers passed down these growth - stimulating genes , Haig continued , mothers would benefit from counterstrategies .
They might evolve genes that slow the rapid growth of their children , in order to preserve their own long - term health .
Moms could also evolve to imprint ( deactivate ) their copies of the genes that increase growth .
Haig ’s imprinting hypothesis still generates a lot of debate , but there is now considerable evidence to back it up .
What is particularly remarkable about imprinted genes is that a lot of them play a role in shaping the brain .
Some of them , in fact , are active only in the brain .
How could the conflict between mothers and fathers play out in our heads ?
Two evolutionary biologists , Bernard Crespi of Simon Fraser University in Canada and Christopher Badcock of the London School of Economics and Political Science , have been exploring imprinting disorders like Angelman and Prader - Willi syndromes to get some clues .
They have come up with a bold idea :
Our minds , too , are shaped by conflict between our parents ’ genes .
Crespi and Badcock extend Haig ’s ideas beyond birth by arguing that imprinting brain genes can influence the behavior of children , and this behavior can be beneficial to mothers or fathers .
Mothers have to spread limited resources among all their children , and so favor offspring with moderate demands .
If a mother spends all her time nursing and caring for one child , any other children she has will suffer .
Fathers , meanwhile , can boost their reproductive success if they pass to their children genes that cause them to get more resources from their mothers .
The children may nurse more , for example , or demand more attention .
Imprinting and silencing those genes can benefit mothers , because they can blunt the demand .
Fathers could also silence brain genes for their own evolutionary benefit .
Each of these new adaptations is like a tug in the tug - of - war between parents .
Under normal conditions , each tug can bias a child ’s behavior only a little toward one parent .
But sometimes mutations arise that disable entire genes from one parent .
It is as if one of the parents suddenly let go of the rope and it flew toward the other side .
Angelman and Prader - Willi syndromes arise from mutations to imprinted genes — and they alter behavior in just the ways Crespi and Badcock would predict .
In Angel­man syndrome , the mother ’s genes are silenced , allowing the father ’s genes to act without any restraint .
Children with Angelman try to nurse more than average children do .
The smiles and laughter that are associated with Angelman may also come from attention - grabbing strategies encoded by paternal genes .
Prader - Willi emerges from an opposite breakdown , in which the father ’s DNA in the same segment of chromosome 15 is deleted .
Many symptoms of Prader - Willi make sense as exaggerated versions of strategies that benefit mothers .
Babies with Prader - Willi syndrome make few demands on their mothers — so few that they risk starving themselves .
Only after they finish weaning does their insatiable hunger emerge .
Crespi and Badcock have identified several other imprinting disorders that have a similar mother - father symmetry ( including Klinefelter ’s syndrome , in which the body contains one or more extra copies of the X chromosome ) .
What is striking about them is that the father - leaning disorders tend to produce autistic symptoms , while the mother - leaning disorders tend to produce schizophrenic ones .
It is possible that autism and schizophrenia themselves are partly the result of conflicts between parental genes , Crespi and Badcock say .
Children with autism , which shows signs of being a father - dominated imprinting disorder , are more likely to have had placentas that grew aggressively in the womb , for example .
Schizophrenia appears to be influenced by mother - dominated genes , some studies associating schizophrenia with low birth weight and slow growth , both of which can benefit mothers .
One of the most striking contrasts between autism and schizophrenia is how they affect the ability to understand others .
Autistic people have a difficult time figuring out what other people are feeling .
Schizophrenic people , on the other hand , sometimes do too good a job .
They may come to believe that a refrigerator is talking to them , for example , or that people are conspiring against them .
Crespi and Badcock propose that these symptoms result from the genetic conflict .
Empathetic children can see how frazzled they ’re making their mothers and how much attention their siblings need .
Maternal genes should therefore boost our abilities to get inside other people ’s heads .
Paternal genes , on the other hand , may benefit by reducing these distractions from the business of getting more resources from mothers .
What about the rest of us ?
“ Between these extremes would sit normal cognition , ” Crespi and Badcock say .
The same conflict that gives rise to autism and schizophrenia may be at work in all of us , nudging us one way or another on the spectrum from father - brain to mother - brain .
Last I checked , Mac OS X had around a 5 % market share , and Linux had much less than that ( among consumers ) .
I can feel that many PHBs look at this small number and think " 5 % ?
Why should I support a whole new platform when I could just blow some more money on brand advertising ? "
Obviously supporting Mac OS X and Linux means you tap into another platform and expand your potential market base .
That much is clear .
But surely adding an extra 5 % is negligible , right ?
Wrong .
Not all five percents are created equal .
I 'm not an economist , just a humble engineer , but let me take a stab at an explanation .
First , here 's a breakdown of Lugaru sales by platform :
From a short sighted , graph reading viewpoint , supporting Mac OS X and Linux directly increased sales by around 122 % .
However , this seemingly unbelievable number is actually understated .
Here 's my attempt at an explanation in five points :
1 . It 's good to be a big fish in a small pond
As a pretty niche independent game , Lugaru was never covered by PC Gamer , IGN , and other behemoth media publications .
However , it was just large enough to get covered in a variety of Mac journals .
One website , Inside Mac Games fell in love with it and posted about it all the time .
If you support Macs , even a small indie video game can rapidly spread throughout the community whereas the huge Windows market might just ignore you .
2 . More platforms means more opportunities
As an indie video game studio , we do n't have many resources in the way of marketing .
It 's embarrassing how much we rely on serendipity , for example , getting posted on fun-motion right when the admin decides to take a break , or getting called up by Igromania randomly .
We have had more than our fair share of Mac serendipity though .
A recent example : Lugaru was promoted in MacHeist 's Giving Tree .
This generated the equivalent of like three diggings worth of traffic .
We were up to 30 requests / second at its peak and dwarfed any event in the history of our Google Analytics .
If we did n't have a Mac OS X build , we simply would n't have had this opportunity .
3. Vocal minorities
Having a Linux build meant coverage on Slashdot .
This of course generated huge interest in not just the Linux version of Lugaru , but the Windows and Mac versions too .
Lugaru also made an appearance in a few Linux magazines .
A lot of people heard about and supported Lugaru simply because we had a Linux build .
4 . You can't choose your evangelists
If you 're familiar with Guy Kawasaki 's philosophy of evangelism , this should n't be any surprise .
You 'll notice that a small minority of your users will go crazy with your game and spread it all over the place .
On the internet , all it takes is one thread on a popular forum , and you 've literally got hundreds or thousands of new visitors .
Basically , a small amount of your users can make a huge difference for you , and they might be Mac and Linux users .
A notable number of the Wolfire fans who hang out in IRC and spread Overgrowth like crazy are Mac users and we would be much smaller without them .
5 . You can't choose your power users
In the same vein as the above , you never know who the movers and shakers are going to be in your community .
In Wolfire 's case , we are forever indebted to Wolfire forum regular , Silb .
He actually reverse - engineered portions of Lugaru and made a kick - ass , extremely popular replacement campaign for the game , providing a huge amount of extra content to other people .
His single , epic thread has been viewed over a hundred thousand times .
Oh yeah .
He 's a Mac user .
To conclude , if you 're not supporting Linux and Mac OS X from a philosophical standpoint or for the fans , at least do it for the money .
If you do n't support non-Windows platforms , you 're leaving a lot of cash on the table .
I do n't know about you , but I 'm not in a position to just say f--- it to a large community of people who want to support us .
I read a fascinating article this weekend by a writer called Malcolm Gladwell , whose new book “ The story of success ” looks at what creates success in many walks of life .
He describes some studies by psychologists into music students and concludes that however much talent someone has at something , what makes the difference between them becoming a stand out or an also ran is practice and opportunity .
Amazingly the studies could n’t find any “ naturals ” – people whose natural ability allowed them to be better than the rest on a fraction of the practice .
It ’s talent and practice which make a genius .
By the age of 20 all top musicians had done 10,000 hours of practice and those that had n’t were already doomed .
Delving deeper , he finds that the same is true of sportsmen and women too , that magic figure of 10,000 hours comes up again and again .
It is the number required to hit true expertise in a field .
It is a huge amount of time , equivalent to twenty hours per week for ten years .
It got me thinking about racing drivers , especially modern ones .
Since the rules were relaxed to allow children to start karting at the age of 8 , many drivers have been able to focus their lives on racing from a very early on and are hugely practiced by the time they arrive in F1 at 21 or 22 .
And that is why drivers like Hamilton and Kubica can perform as they do from the start of their F1 careers .
A loan is something that some people will just take out without much thought .
They may just put things on their credit card , go overdrawn or take out a loan without really thinking about the consequences but others are really worried about borrowing any sort of money at all and would rather not do so .
These are too extremes though and many people fall in the middle where they sometimes borrow money but not often .
Taking out a loan should not be something you rush in to .
You should think hard about the decision and there is a selection of things that should be considering before taking one out .
When considering a loan you should really be thinking about what you need the money for and whether it is necessary for you to have it .
A loan costs money and can be really expensive so you need to decide whether you are prepared to pay that extra money to be able to afford the item that you are using the loan to buy .
Consider whether you might be better off saving up for the item rather than paying to borrow the money to buy it .
It is always worth taking a long time to make this decision .
You need to start by deciding whether the loan is the right thing to do , but then look at the different types , see which is most suitable and calculate the cost of the loan as well as the repayment amounts .
This cost should be something which you calculate and decide whether you are prepared to pay .
Think about how much more you are paying for the item as a result of having to pay the loan costs and whether you still think that it is worth having .
You also need to take a look at the repayment amounts and see whether you will be able to afford them .
Consider the term of the loan and whether you think that you will be able to afford to pay it for the whole term .
If you are not sure then it will be worthwhile calculating what you expenses and income is and seeing how much you have left and whether you would have enough to cover those repayments .
If you have savings then it would usually be cheaper to use those rather than borrow money .
The interest on savings accounts usually tends to be a lot less than what is charged for borrowing money .
Check if this is the case and if it is , then it will be better financially to use savings rather than borrow money .
Sometimes the item that you want to buy is just too expensive to consider getting without a loan .
This can include things such as buying a home , car or university fees .
These items are often seen as essential or a way to getting higher pay in the future .
This means that they could almost be seen as an investment and so the loan would be considered to be worthwhile .
Of course , with all of these they would only be essential in certain circumstances .
So if the home increases in value so that when the mortgage is paid off it has increased in value more than the cost of the loan , then this would be considered to be a really good investment .
However , there are some occasions when a house may not increase in value , such as if the area becomes undesirable , there are floods , the house becomes structurally unstable or the house prices generally fall .
With a car , you may need the vehicle to get to work .
Therefore the income is reliant on you having it and so it would seem worthwhile .
However , if there are alternative and cheaper ways to get to work or the car purchased is unnecessarily expensive , then this may not seem like such a good idea .
Borrowing for education could be a way to a better paid career and so be worth it .
However , if the course does not lead to a job then it may not be worth the investment .
So there are advantages and disadvantages to getting loans with some being more worthwhile than others .
It is worth considering what you are using the money for , how much risk you are taking and the full cost of the loan ; before you make up your mind .

A man using the pseudonym Matthew Alexander has written a truly remarkable op - ed for the Washington Post discussing effective interrogation of enemy combatants -- which most decidedly does not include torture :
I refused to participate in such practices , and a month later , I extended that prohibition to the team of interrogators I was assigned to lead .
I taught the members of my unit a new methodology -- one based on building rapport with suspects , showing cultural understanding and using good old - fashioned brainpower to tease out information .
I personally conducted more than 300 interrogations , and I supervised more than 1,000 .
The methods my team used are not classified ( they 're listed in the unclassified Field Manual ) , but the way we used them was , I like to think , unique .
We got to know our enemies , we learned to negotiate with them , and we adapted criminal investigative techniques to our work ( something that the Field Manual permits , under the concept of " ruses and trickery " ) .
It worked .
Our efforts started a chain of successes that ultimately led to Zarqawi .
Over the course of this renaissance in interrogation tactics , our attitudes changed .
We no longer saw our prisoners as the stereotypical al - Qaeda evildoers we had been repeatedly briefed to expect ; we saw them as Sunni Iraqis , often family men protecting themselves from Shiite militias and trying to ensure that their fellow Sunnis would still have some access to wealth and power in the new Iraq .
Most surprisingly , they turned out to despise al - Qaeda in Iraq as much as they despised us , but Zarqawi and his thugs were willing to provide them with arms and money .
I pointed this out to Gen. George Casey , the former top U.S. commander in Iraq , when he visited my prison in the summer of 2006 .
He did not respond .
Perhaps he should have .
It turns out that my team was right to think that many disgruntled Sunnis could be peeled away from Zarqawi .
A year later , Gen. David Petraeus helped boost the so - called Anbar Awakening , in which tens of thousands of Sunnis turned against al - Qaeda in Iraq and signed up with U.S. forces , cutting violence in the country dramatically .
Our new interrogation methods led to one of the war 's biggest breakthroughs :
We convinced one of Zarqawi's associates to give up the al - Qaeda in Iraq leader 's location .
On June 8 , 2006 , U.S. warplanes dropped two 500 - pound bombs on a house where Zarqawi was meeting with other insurgent leaders .
Vancouver , with its snowboarders and kayak tours and great produce and Benetton ad - inspired hipster scene , can seem on the surface a little removed from “ global issues ” .
Issues such as Israel ’s bombing of Gaza these last few days .
Not to mention the worldwide fury stirred by conflict in the Holy Land .
But , for a primer on Vancouver ’s connection to the “ big picture ” , you could n’t beat this afternoon ’s ( December 29 ) pro-Palestinian protest on West Hastings Street .
Palestinian flags were out in force .
So were those of Israel , across the street at the small counter - demonstration .
The rhetoric was exact , pungent , fierce , furious , and emotional .
Speaker after speaker encouraged the 250 - strong crowd to shout .
“ Free , free Palestine , ” Omar Shaban , vice president of the Canadian Arab Federation , chanted .
The crowd returned , “ Free , free Palestine . ”
Demonstrators also chanted :
“ Stop the bombing , stop the siege .
Stop the bombing , stop the hate . ”
“ Occupation is a crime , from Iraq to Palestine . ”
“ From Canada to Palestine , occupation is a crime . ”
“ Free , free Palestine .
Long live Palestine . ”
“ Long live the intifada .
Long live the resistance . ”
“ Justice for Palestine .
Freedom for Palestine . ”
“ Viva , viva intifada . ”
“ Occupation is a crime .
Israel out of Palestine . ”
“ Fight the power , turn the tide .
End Israeli apartheid . ”
“ I want all the Zionists to hear you .
Viva , viva intifada .
Long live Palestine . ”
“ From the river to the sea , Palestine will soon be free . ”
Many of the demonstrators were in their teens and 20s .
Asif Husain , who attended the event to represent Muslim solidarity , explained to the Straight why he supports Hamas .
“ They ’re in a difficult position , ” he said .
“ There is no solution to the peace problem so far .
Sixty years have gone by with no end in sight . ”
Across the street , a yarmulke - bedecked Stephen Burgher agreed there is no obvious solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
“ They [ Palestinians ] want to be ” ˜free to the sea ’ so they want no Israel left , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think anyone over here is calling for the destruction of Palestine .
For peace , you ’ve got to start off with somebody who ’s a partner .
You ’ve got to start off with someone who is willing to talk to you about coexistence .
If they want to destroy you , it ’s not negotiation time ; it ’s war time .
And I think it ’s necessary , it ’s sad to say . ”
Video of the December 29 demonstration captured by Vancouver photographer Kris Krug .
Hanna Kawas of the Canada Palestine Association blamed the ongoing conflict on the United Nations and the U.S .
“ Yesterday was the 43rd veto in support of Israel , ” Kawas said .
“ No other country in the world has been protected as Israel .
And they ’re doing it basically to cover the war crimes of the Israeli government .
The U.S. is complicit in these war crimes .
The M16s are American , the ammunition is American , and Israelis doing it on behalf of the U.S. Without them , Israel does n’t exist . ”
If those who turned up at the demonstration proved that some Canadians are vehemently engaged , the flip side is also true .
Erika Del Carmen
Fuchs blamed the relatively small turn - out at today ’s demonstration on a listless Canadian public .
She normally works with Justicia for Migrant Workers B.C. , but spoke on behalf of herself only .
“ In many parts of the world , the struggles of Palestine is very important to people , ” Del Carmen Fuchs told the Straight , mentioning Latin America and Mexico ’s Zapatista movement , specifically .
“ Exploited people feel that instinct of connection .
Here , we ’ve been lulled into complacency ....
It seems that when you are aware of your own exploitation you act in solidarity with other people .
Here , we go shopping on Boxing Day , even though there are many people who are suffering here .
Many new immigrants , people of colour that have lived here for decades , the First Nations population , the migrant workers , a growing poverty in the working class — we ’re all turning a blind eye to that .
We all need to be more aware of our own oppression .
When you recognize your own oppression , you act in solidarity with others . ”
Again , the opposite of listless was represented on West Hastings Street .
At the end of the demonstration , when the crowd dissipated into the sleet , Husain found Shaban and said : “ You should have mentioned jihad .
It ’s the only way . ”

The Factory recreates conditions in a concentration camp I can't remember the last time I cried , well certainly not from sheer terror .
But , after going to see The Factory , I have joined a list of people , men included , who have been broken down to blubbering , weeping wrecks during the Fringe performance .
I managed to last 12 minutes as an " Auschwitz victim " in a dark tunnel under The Pleasance before I made my escape .
I actually feel quite sick even recounting the experience and admit that I declined a phone conversation the next day with the lead character because I felt , irrationally , absolutely terrified of him .
The Factory , a production by Badac Theatre Company , recreates the last hour in the life of prisoners at Auschwitz - Birkenau .
I knew to expect suffering but this was too realistic .
We were surrounded by the actors , there was no safety zone or distance between the audience and them .
I was rooted to the spot and I remember trying hard not to flinch or even breathe in case my movement caught their attention
Angie Brown
We were made to stand in two small rows , one in front of the other , in a long , dark tunnel in the venue 's vaults before a metal roller door was closed down behind us .
About six men and a woman then started screaming and swearing and ordering us about .
They were behind us , in front of us and all around us .
They had shaved heads , were brandishing metal clubs and were extremely menacing .
The actors then started smashing the clubs against sheets of metal attached to the stone walls , which made a deafening noise for 10 minutes .
And , while we were in this noise - like torture , the men were also taking turns to march up and down and come up to members in the audience in a threatening and terrifying manner .
Relentless fear I was rooted to the spot and I remember trying hard not to flinch , or even breathe , in case my movement caught their attention .
I tried to reason with myself by thinking , " they are just actors " , but they were just too convincing and I could actually feel my heart pounding .
The noise and the intimidating men enveloped me and I became more and more anxious until I suddenly managed to make a run for the door , which was being opened for a man who was also fleeing .
And then I just started to cry from the sheer shock of the experience .
After the show , my colleague told me she was taken down some steps into smaller and smaller rooms while being screamed at before some of the actors took all their clothes off and ordered the audience against the wall as the onslaught of fear and intimidation carried on relentlessly .
The Factory is an hour - long show I have since learned from a leading clinical trauma psychologist , Dr Matthias Schwannauer of Edinburgh University , that my reaction was not weak or wimpy as I have feared people would think .
He said : " If you flood people with noise and move towards them it increases their physical threat as the brain is subjected to a multi-sensory impact .
" This does not evoke sympathy because there is acute threat and , instead , the reflective part of the brain is shutdown and you can't reason that it is not real .
" The extreme noise causes the brain to feel confused and I know some people who would be tipped over the edge from this show .
Your reaction has been similar to that of a trauma victim . "
A spokesman for the show said : " This is a violent , very brutal and noisy show and people have found it too much and left .
" The aim of the piece is to make people feel how these prisoners must have felt .
" It is a very confrontational piece of theatre and is very realistic so we have asked the box office to warn people when they buy tickets . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Apple Inc has named a former IBM executive , Mark Papermaster , to head its iPod and iPhone development team , a hire that IBM has vowed to fight in court .
Apple on Tuesday said it hired Papermaster as senior vice president of Devices Hardware Engineering , replacing Tony Fadell , who will stay on as an adviser to Chief Executive Steve Jobs .
Papermaster was until late October vice president of International Business Machines Corp ’s Blade Development unit , which develops powerful computers for corporate data centers .
IBM last week filed a lawsuit to prevent the hiring , saying that as a top manager , Papermaster had access to IBM secrets and that he had agreed not to work for a competitor for a year .
IBM spokesman Doug Shelton said the case is proceeding .
“ Mr. Papermaster ’s employment is a violation of his agreement with IBM against working for a competitor should he leave IBM , ” he said .
“ We will vigorously pursue this case in court .
Apple ’s statement made no mention of the court case .
It said Tony Fadell and his wife Danielle Lambert , who is vice president of Human Resources at Apple , are “ reducing their roles ” to devote more time to their family .

The Problem : Every plan results in his own car getting bashed to pieces .
That means every time he scores a kill , he has to come back and rebuild the engine , put in a new suspension , get new brakes , shocks , axles , rebuild the transmission and who knows what else .
All of this is after he 's released from the hospital , of course .
But that does n't touch on the most obvious problem : his insurance premiums .

NASA is once again trying to reboot the Hubble Space Telescope , agency officials said Thursday .
The telescope ’s instruments have been shut down since the end of September , when a router that formats science data for transmission to the ground suffered an electrical failure .
Last week , the telescope ’s managers succeeded in turning the router back on , using a backup electrical and data channel that had not been used in the 18 - year life of the telescope .
A pair of electrical anomalies , however , sent the telescope back into “ safe mode . ”
One of the anomalies , an incorrect voltage in Hubble ’s Advanced Camera for Surveys , was the result of a timing problem between a pair of software routines in the camera and has been corrected , said Art Whipple , an engineer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .
The second anomaly was apparently a temporary short circuit or some other ghost electrical signal that caused the telescope ’s payload computer and the router to reset themselves .
The payload computer handles Hubble ’s scientific data and commands the instruments .
There was apparently no lasting harm and no fuses were blown .

An Obama presidency in the United States could pave the way for a common North American approach to environmental issues and any differences on trade could be worked out , Canadian Conservative Party officials said in a recent interview .
Canadian Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon said that the Canadian government has quite a bit in common with Obama and sees the two countries as strong partners in protecting the environment .
“ On the environment issue , I ’m pleased to see a similar approach between Canada and the United States , and that probably augurs well for a common North American approach to the environment , ” said Cannon .
But can the Canadian federal government , now run by the Conservative Party , shed its reputation as somewhat of a laggard in the realm of environmental policy and help forge a new way forward in North American environmental policy ?
Despite its schizophrenic treatment of the climate change issue — and environmental protection more broadly construed — the Canadian government has made strides in recent years and now claims it has a plan to reduce carbon emissions .
For that reason officials believe they will find common ground with an Obama administration that has pledged to make aggressive cuts in carbon emissions and increase federal investments in clean energy technologies .
A new paradigm in North American environmental policy ?
The United States , for all intents and purposes , invented modern environmental policy .
With the opportunity to learn from their neighbors to the south , the Canadian national government largely ignored policy developments in the U.S. , preferring to delegate authority in environmental policy to the individual provinces .
But times have changed .
The U.S. is no longer considered a leader in environmental protection , and as compared to their European peers , they could even be considered laggards .
While the U.S. has stumbled , Canada is moving in the opposite direction .
According to the Yale Environmental Performance Index , a quantitative gauge of pollution control and natural resource management results , Canada ranks 12th overall among 149 countries , largely on the strength of provincial stars like British Columbia .
The same index ranked the U.S. at a disappointing 39th .
Both Canada and the United States ultimately rejected the Kyoto Protocol on climate change , arguing that the cost on the economy would be too great .
While the U.S. is not a signatory , Canada was one of the earliest to sign the protocol .
But Canada has since reneged on its obligations under Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s Conservative government , which declared the targets dead last year .
But Conservatives now say they have a plan to lower greenhouse gases three percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
Officials told the Canadian Press that the Conservatives are waiting for the Obama government to take over from U.S. President George W. Bush before beginning work towards an integrated carbon market .
Several Canadian provinces ( as well as U.S. states ) are already working towards regional cap - and - trade programs that could potentially be scaled - up to encompass a North American cap on greenhouse gases .
In July , Ontario joined the Western Climate Initiative , a market - based cap - and - trade emissions program expected to be in operation by 2010 , that already included Quebec , Manitoba , British Columbia and seven states in the U.S .
But some argue that the biggest potential for disagreement between the two countries is not on the issue of climate change , but rather in Obama ’s stated desire to reopen the North American Free Trade Agreement to strengthen labor and environmental protections .

SOCIALISM in Britain died in 1983 .
Its demise can be dated to that year 's Labour Party election manifesto , branded “ the longest suicide note in history ” .
This document combined ideological purity ( highlights included the creation of a planning ministry , withdrawal from the European Community , exchange controls to stop capital fleeing overseas and unilateral nuclear disarmament ) with a lunatic disdain for what voters wanted .
Today questions are being asked about the health of the European left , as the deepening recession fails to boost Socialist parties across the European Union .
This baffles many .
After all , the Anglo - Saxon obsession with untrammelled markets has been exposed as madness — or so leftist bigwigs claim .
Across the capitalist world , once - strutting tycoons are begging for state bail - outs .
Yet voters are not flocking to mainstream centre - left parties .
A recent column in Libération , a leftish French newspaper , moaned that this was not just a “ paradox ” but an “ injustice ” .
For a clue to what is going on , consider the manifesto adopted earlier this month by the EU 's centre - left parties for next June 's European election .
It is punchy enough , accusing conservatives of “ blind faith in the market ” .
Under the banner of the Party of European Socialists ( PES ) , the left touts lots of new regulations on finance , including limits on “ excessive risk - taking and debt ” .
( Just how regulators would detect “ excessive ” risk in advance is left unexplained — plenty of banks would love to know the answer . )
A motif runs through the PES manifesto , offering a move away from “ unregulated markets ” towards the regulating wisdom of public authorities .
And there lies the left 's problem .
For the real argument is not one of markets v state .
Even before the crash , that was a false choice : every capitalist economy has a mix of regulation and liberalism .
Now the boundary lines are blurred everywhere , as banks are nationalised and cash is shovelled to favoured industries .
Instead , the big divide is over globalisation , and whether to resist or embrace competition between different countries .
On that front , the PES manifesto is a muddle .
Indeed , it could be dubbed one of history 's longer letters of resignation .
As successive European economies tumble into recession , the thing that most frightens and angers workers is the risk of losing their jobs to lower - cost rivals .
The PES manifesto dances around this issue .
It talks of “ managing ” globalisation for the benefit of all and using Europe 's combined size and wealth as a labour market to defend “ high social standards ” .
But it does not promise to stop factory closures or lay - offs .
This silence has two explanations .
First , Europe 's centre - left parties are split over how best to protect jobs .
At a meeting in Madrid to draft the PES manifesto , some west European parties wanted language about limiting the free movement of workers within the EU , says Denis MacShane , a British parliamentarian who represents the Labour Party in the PES .
But representatives from new , lower - cost EU countries like Hungary , Poland and Lithuania rejected these ideas , insisting “ free movement is one of the best things about the EU . ”
In the end , PES leaders fudged it , with a clause saying merely that reduced social standards and wage cuts should not give one country a “ competitive advantage ” over another “ at the expense of workers ” .
In Britain and the Nordics , centre - left politicians have moved away from protecting existing jobs towards protecting individual workers ( through things like retraining if they are made redundant ) .
Elsewhere , socialists still claim that the might of the state can be used to shield workers directly .
In France some want laws to ban companies that are in profit from making workers redundant .
Portugal , one of the four EU countries with a majority centre - left government , has unveiled plans to subsidise wages in the car industry for up to a year , as production lines are idled .
Such strategies are , alas , fated to collide with the second explanation for the PES 's silence : that efforts to resist globalisation rarely work for long .
In their guts , European voters know this .
When factories are earmarked for closure , workers may protest , and may even hope that leftist leaders will join the picket lines .
But the factories tend to go anyway .
Driving the social model into the ground
The proudest trophy of the left is the European social model , a web of labour and welfare laws offering a “ high degree of social protection ” .
The model emerged during the post - war boom , when living standards soared across western Europe .
In his book “ Postwar ” , Tony Judt , a New York - based British academic , lists many causes : governments turned away from protectionism , people started having lots of babies , energy was cheap and Europe had much catching up to do ( in 1957 only 2 % of Italian homes had a refrigerator , but by 1974 94 % did ) .
Crucially , the European social model also enjoyed an amazingly low degree of external competition .
In 1960 a West German car worker had little to fear from Eastern Europe or Asia .
Skodas and Nissans were pretty horrid ; Chinese workers were lost to the madness of Mao .
When China , India and the ex-Soviet block joined the capitalist world three decades later , the global labour pool grew from 1.5 billion to 3 billion : an explosion called the “ great doubling ” by Richard Freeman , a Harvard economist .
Never again will west European workers live in a world with so little competition .
Honest European politicians know this — and so , deep down , do most voters .
That is why trade unions are still shedding members .
It is why the mainstream left cannot credibly promise to reverse globalisation , preferring instead to blame the crisis on ill - regulated markets .
But attacking market follies is hardly a distinctive position ( listen to Nicolas Sarkozy , France 's supposedly centre - right president ) .
Europe 's centre - left is struggling because its 20th century rationale is dying .
If it cannot find a less muddled message that explicitly embraces globalisation , this economic crash could deliver it a fatal blow .
Excellent post by Ryan Holiday on the mechanics of fear ( read the whole thing ) .
Once as Pericles shoved off a 150 ships in the Peloponnesian War , the sun was eclipsed and his men were thrown into fear .
To prevent their paralyzation , he walked up to a lead steersman , removed his cloak and held it up around the man 's face .
He asked if he felt particularly afraid of this and of course the response was no .
So what does he matter , he said , when the cause of the darkness differs ?
You read this and you smile .
The Greeks were so clever .
Or , like Von Clausewitz , you dismiss it as self - serving translation - a way to use history to say something obvious .
But that very much belies the incredible implications of the idea .
Beneath the quaint leadership - in- action anecdote is the fundamental notion that girds not just Stoic philosophy but cognitive psychology .
It 's the idea that if you can break apart something , it loses its power over you .
In cog psych , only when you 're aware of a bias or conditioned response can you circumvent it .
It 's the same with the current crisis .
We 're stuck and can't see a way through the crisis given our conditioned responses .
The crisis is way , way bigger than we are .
So , it 's little wonder that we are fearful .
Of course , if you break down the crisis , the entire situation becomes manageable .
Fix what you can control .
The local is the first place to start .
Eliminate dependencies .
Grow networks .
Make the local productive .
By embracing materialism , the atheist has destroyed the possibility of knowledge , as well as science and technology .
Keywords : atheism , worldview , Richard Dawkins , materialistic , knowledge , logic , irrational , God , law of non-contradiction , conventions
Atheists are “ coming out of the closet ” and becoming more vocal about their message that “ there is no God . ” Professor Richard Dawkins ( Britain ’s leading atheist ) is encouraging those who share his views to express their opinion .
Author of The God Delusion , Dawkins says he wants to “ free children from being indoctrinated with the religion of their parents or their community . ” 1 Will Christians be prepared to “ give an answer ” to the atheists ’ claims ?

Materialistic atheism is one of the easiest worldviews to refute .
A materialistic atheist believes that nature is all that there is .
He believes that there is no transcendent God who oversees and maintains creation .
Many atheists believe that their worldview is rational — and scientific .
However , by embracing materialism , the atheist has destroyed the possibility of knowledge , as well as science and technology .
In other words , if atheism were true , it would be impossible to prove anything !
Here ’s
Why
Reasoning involves using the laws of logic .
These include the law of non-contradiction which says that you ca n’t have A and not -A at the same time and in the same relationship .
For example , the statement “ My car is in the parking lot , and it is not the case that my car is in the parking lot ” is necessarily false by the law of non-contradiction .
Any rational person would accept this law .
But why is this law true ?
Why should there be a law of non-contradiction , or for that matter , any laws of reasoning ?
The Christian can answer this question .
For the Christian there is an absolute standard for reasoning ; we are to pattern our thoughts after God’s .
The laws of logic are a reflection of the way God thinks .
The law of non-contradiction is not simply one person ’s opinion of how we ought to think , rather it stems from God ’s self - consistent nature .
God can not deny Himself ( 2 Timothy 2:13 ) , and so , the way God upholds the universe will necessarily be non-contradictory .
Rational reasoning would be impossible without the biblical God .
Laws of logic are God ’s standard for thinking .
Since God is an unchanging , sovereign , immaterial Being , the laws of logic are abstract , universal , invariant entities .
In other words , they are not made of matter — they apply everywhere and at all times .
Laws of logic are contingent upon God ’s unchanging nature .
And they are necessary for logical reasoning .
Thus , rational reasoning would be impossible without the biblical God .
The materialistic atheist can’t have laws of logic .
He believes that everything that exists is material — part of the physical world .
But laws of logic are not physical .
You ca n’t stub your toe on a law of logic .
Laws of logic cannot exist in the atheist ’s world , yet he uses them to try to reason .
This is inconsistent .
He is borrowing from the Christian worldview to argue against the Christian worldview .
The atheist ’s view cannot be rational because he uses things ( laws of logic ) that cannot exist according to his profession .
The debate over the existence of God is a bit like a debate over the existence of air .3
Can you imagine someone arguing that air does n’t actually exist ?
He would offer seemingly excellent “ proofs ” against the existence of air , while simultaneously breathing air and expecting that we can hear his words as the sound is transmitted through the air .
In order for us to hear and understand his claim , it would have to be wrong .
Likewise , the atheist , in arguing that God does not exist must use laws of logic that only make sense if God does exist .
In order for his argument to make sense , it would have to be wrong .
How Can the Atheist Respond ?
The atheist might say , “ Well , I can reason just fine , and I do n’t believe in God . ”
But this is no different than the critic of air saying , “ Well , I can breathe just fine , and I do n’t believe in air . ”
This is n’t a rational response .
Breathing requires air , not a profession of belief in air .
Likewise , logical reasoning requires God , not a profession of belief in Him .
Of course the atheist can reason ; it ’s because God has made his mind and given him access to the laws of logic — and that ’s the point .
It ’s because God exists that reasoning is possible .
The atheist can reason , but within his own worldview he cannot account for his ability to reason .
The atheist can reason , but within his own worldview he cannot account for his ability to reason .
The atheist might respond , “ Laws of logic are conventions made up by man . ”
But conventions are ( by definition ) conventional .
That is , we all agree to them and so they work — like driving on the right side of the road .
But if laws of logic were conventional , then different cultures could adopt different laws of logic ( like driving on the left side of the road ) .
So , in some cultures it might be perfectly fine to contradict yourself .
In some societies truth could be self - contradictory .
Clearly that would n’t do .
If laws of logic are just conventions , then they are not universal laws .
Rational debate would be impossible if laws of logic were conventional , because the two opponents could simply pick different standards for reasoning .
Each would be right according to his own arbitrary standard .
The atheist might respond , “ Laws of logic are material — they are made of electro - chemical connections in the brain . ”
But then the laws of logic are not universal ; they would not extend beyond the brain .
In other words , we could n’t argue that contradictions cannot occur on Mars , since no one ’s brain is on Mars .
In fact , if the laws of logic are just electro - chemical connections in the brain , then they would differ somewhat from person to person because everyone has different connections in their brain .
Sometimes an atheist will attempt to answer with a more pragmatic response : “ We use the laws of logic because they work . ”
Unfortunately for him , that is n’t the question .
We all agree the laws of logic work ; they work because they ’re true .
The question is why do they exist in the first place ?
How can the atheist account for absolute standards of reasoning like the laws of logic ?
How can non-material things like laws exist if the universe is material only ?
As a last resort , the atheist may give up a strictly materialistic view and agree that there are immaterial , universal laws .
This is a huge concession ; after all , if a person is willing to concede that immaterial , universal , unchanging entities can exist , then he must consider the possibility that God exists .
But this concession does not save the atheist ’s position .
He must still justify the laws of logic .
Why do they exist ?
And what is the point of contact between the material physical world and the immaterial world of logic ?
In other words , why does the material universe feel compelled to obey immaterial laws ?
The atheist cannot answer these questions .
His worldview cannot be justified ; it is arbitrary and thus irrational .
Conclusions
Clearly , atheism is not a rational worldview .
It is self - refuting because the atheist must first assume the opposite of what he is trying to prove in order to be able to prove anything .
As Dr. Cornelius VanTil put it , “ [ A ] theism presupposes theism . ”
Laws of logic require the existence of God — and not just any god , but the Christian God .
Only the God of the truth and the transcendent can be the foundation for knowledge ( Proverbs 1:7 ; Colossians 2:3 ) .
Since the God of Scripture is immaterial , sovereign , and beyond time , it makes sense to have laws of logic that are immaterial , universal , and unchanging .
Since God has revealed Himself to man , we are able to know and use logic .
Since God made the universe and since God made our minds , it makes sense that our minds would have an ability to study and understand the universe .
But if the brain is simply the result of mindless evolutionary processes that conveyed some sort of survival value in the past , why should we trust its conclusions ?
If the universe and our minds are simply the results of time and chance , as the atheist contends , why would we expect that the mind could make sense of the universe ?
How could science and technology be possible ?
Rational thinking , science , and technology make sense in a Christian worldview .
Rational thinking , science , and technology make sense in a Christian worldview .
The Christian has a basis for these things ; the atheist does not .
This is not to say that atheists cannot be rational about some things .
They can because they too are made in God ’s image and have access to God ’s laws of logic .
But they have no rational basis for rationality within their own worldview .
Likewise , atheists can be moral , but they have no basis for that morality according to what they claim to believe .
An atheist is a walking bundle of contradictions .
He reasons and does science , yet he denies the very God that makes reasoning and science possible .
On the other hand , the Christian worldview is consistent and makes sense of human reasoning and experience .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Hardly a day goes by without an announcement from a big company taking an axe to its payroll .
But guess who wo n't be laying off people anytime soon ?
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
Faced with what the likelihood of even more bank failures in 2009 , the nation 's top banking regulator has ramped up its hiring in recent weeks .
Over the next three months , the agency plans to add about 125 new employees , according to a FDIC spokesman .
The majority of those positions are aimed at dealing with struggling or failed institutions in Western states .
Nearly all of those workers will be headquartered out of Irvine , Calif .
Last month , the FDIC announced it had signed a three - year lease on a 200,000 square - foot building there , representing its first temporary satellite office in more than a decade .
" [ The FDIC is ] fully expecting , over the course of the next 12 to 18 months , [ that ] there is going to be a rash of failures , " said Nick Ketcha Jr. , a former director of supervision at the FDIC who now serves as a managing director at the New Jersey - based financial services consulting firm FinPro .
Bank failures have climbed in recent months as the industry continues to grapple with a myriad of problems , including rising mortgage delinquencies and a deterioration in the quality of banks ' credit card portfolios .
Twenty - three banks have failed so far this year .
The most recent collapse was First Georgia Community Bank , which was placed into receivership by the FDIC last Friday .
With the economy in a full - blown recession that shows no sign of relenting , industry observers are bracing for more failures to follow as hard - hit banks try to keep up with loan losses .
John Douglas , a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings and former general counsel at the FDIC who served during the height of the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s , warned that easily 200 banks , if not more , could fail in the next two years .
The FDIC has hinted at more failures as well .
It estimates that the deposit insurance fund , which is used to cover deposits when a bank fails , will suffer about $ 40 billion in losses through 2013 .
Last summer 's collapse of the California - based mortgage lender IndyMac wiped out $ 8.9 billion from the fund .
Experts are quick to point out , however , that the number of failures are unlikely to approach the more than 1,000 institutions that failed during the S&L crisis .
What is distinctly different this time around is that banks were better capitalized and did not to hold many mortgages on their books , instead selling them to entities like government - controlled mortgage financing firms Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
" Nowadays a lot of the exposure is spread out in a lot of different places , " said Douglas .
" That 's good and bad , but at least for the banking industry that 's on the good side . "
A problem with the problem list
Of the more than 8,400 banks that the FDIC covers , only a small fraction are currently on the agency 's watch list for potential failure .
There were 171 institutions on its so - called ' problem bank ' list as of the end of the third quarter .
That is the highest level since 1995 .
In the second quarter , 117 banks were on the list .
But many have wondered whether the problem list is an accurate picture of the health of the nation 's banking sector .
A survey of nearly 1,300 chief financial officers released Wednesday by Duke University revealed that 75 % had fundamental concerns about the health of the financial institutions they do business with and that more banks should be on the problem list .
" CFOs ' concerns suggest this is at best a low - ball number , and at worst highly unrepresentative of the health of American financial institutions , " said Campbell Harvey , a professor of finance at Duke 's Fuqua School of Business .
The FDIC has maintained in recent quarters that it expects the number to climb and pointed out that the problem bank list is a lagging indicator .
At the same time , most banks on the problem list never actually reach the point of collapse .
" The problem bank list is not a barometer of the health of the banking industry , " the agency said in a statement .
Gearing up for 2009
Still , it looks like " resolution or receivership specialists " , workers who are well - versed in bank failure procedures , are at the top of the FDIC 's wish - list for hires .
Such positions typically last for two years or more , and come with a salary of as much as $ 156,000 , according to postings on the FDIC Web site .
A " resolution and closings manager " is eligible for of annual salary of nearly $ 178,000 .
With the banking and financial industry continuing to hemorrhage jobs at an alarming rate , there is a deep pool of talent for the FDIC to draw from .
But experts note that in all likelihood , many of the available jobs at the agency will go to former or existing FDIC employees or employees of failed institutions .
If the latest hiring trend bears out , the banking regulator could boast more than 5,000 workers by early next year .
At last count , the agency 's workforce numbered just over 4,600 .
It remains unclear , however , just how much the FDIC wants to expand beyond that level .
The agency said there are no plans at this time to open any other temporary locations around the country to cope with future failures .
Typically , all failed bank activity is handled out of the FDIC's Dallas regional office .
At the same time , there is no indication how big of a budget the agency is requesting for 2009 .
Last year , the FDIC had an annual budget of nearly $ 1.2 billion .
Its board is scheduled to vote on the matter later this month .
Former Mr Gay UK 'slit lover 's throat then marinated his diced flesh with fresh herbs '
A gay chef murdered his lover , cut out part of his leg , seasoned it with herbs and fried it , a court has heard .
Anthony Morley , 35 , chewed one of the pieces before throwing it into his kitchen bin .
Morley , a former holder of the Mr Gay UK title , then walked to a nearby takeaway restaurant and told horrified staff : ' I have killed someone , call the police ' .
Former Mr Gay UK Anthony Morley ( l ) allegedly murdered Damian Oldfield before chewing part of his thigh
Officers found the naked body of 33 - year - old Damian Oldfield on the floor of Morley 's bedroom , Leeds Crown Court was told .
He had been stabbed 20 times and his throat cut .
Morley later claimed Mr Oldfield had tried to rape him .
Prosecutor Andrew Stubbs QC , warned jurors that details of the case were ' unpleasant and disturbing . '
He added : ' In carrying out your task in this trial you must not allow the horror of what took place to cloud your calm assessment of the evidence . '
He said the two men had known each other for some years .
Mr Oldfield was openly gay and worked selling advertising space for a homosexual lifestyle magazine .
He was described as ' flirtatious , promiscuous , naturally outgoing and bubbly ' .
Morley was ' less sure about his sexuality ' and had had relationships with both men and women .
He had won the first Mr Gay UK contest in 1993 .
On the day of the murder , in April , the two exchanged text messages during the afternoon and later met in a bar in Leeds , where they both lived .
In the texts Morley told Mr Oldfield he had ' never been properly happy being gay ' .
Mr Oldfield replied : ' Try me ... I 'm not your average poof . '
They exchanged increasingly affectionate messages and arranged to meet , with Morley stressing he ' wanted to take it slow ' .
Later that night they ended up in Morley 's bedroom , the court heard .
They had been drinking beer and were both around three times the legal limit for driving .
Forensic experts later found evidence that there had been sexual activity .
Mr Stubbs said Morley used two knives taken from the kitchen downstairs to kill Mr Oldfield .
He slit his throat , cutting a vein and an artery in the process , stabbed him with great force in the chest and 19 times in the back .
The evidence indicated that Mr Oldfield had been lying under the duvet when he was attacked from behind .
Mr Stubbs said that after Mr Oldfield died Morley cut a section of flesh from his thigh , took it down to the kitchen and cooked it .
The jury heard that Morley was wearing only a bloodstained dressing gown and flip - flops when he arrived at the takeaway .
His face and hands were spattered with blood .
He later told police : ' I know what I have done is wrong , he tried to rape me , at least he wo n't be able to do it again . '
Morley denies murder .
The court was told he was 'at the very least ' guilty of manslaughter , but the jury would have to consider issues of provocation and diminished responsibility .
The case continues .

The new trailer for Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves brought us more than just another peek into the peril that awaits Nathan Drake .
First , the trailer confirms Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves will be released exclusively on Playstation 3 next fall .
Until now we had simply assumed this time frame so it is good to see some official confirmation .
The trailer depicts a nasty train wreck which Nathan awakes to find himself a victim of .
This scene is likely a prequel to the first Uncharted 2 teaser trailer in which Nathan is seen slogging through a vast snowy environment by himself .

More Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves media should begin to trickle out as we head into the new year .
Today the life which we all are living , we do n’t have so much time in that , as we are very busy with our hectic schedules .
If we consider this in our daily business , then to lead , we need to be in touch with our customers and for this , we need to communicate to them .
For this , various modes are available such as phone , mail , chat , letter etc . but the most convenient mode is talking to them on a phone as it makes things between two people clear at the same time and removes confusion .
But what to say , entrepreneurs are so busy that they do n’t even like to hold their phone in their hands for so long as it disturbs them .
However , talking to customers is also important , so if there is any device which allows them to receive their calls without holding mobile phones in their hands and they can talk on same for so long to lead their business , what is better than this .
So , here comes Bluetooth Headset .
Bluetooth Headset
A Bluetooth is a very common term , definitely you all heard somewhere .
Now see Bluetooth headset , it is considered as a device which permits you to connect with others via your mobile phone , smartphone .
Rather than using cables or wires , it makes use of radio waves to enable connectivity between two devices .
It is a wireless technology meant for short range communication between two devices .
It is very popular these days as it is found in almost every product which we use in our daily life .
These including smartphones , mobile phones , laptops , headsets and portable speakers .
Bluetooth headset is a product having Bluetooth technology , contains a computer chip of very small size inside of it .
This computer chip contains the Bluetooth radio and software that allows devices to enable connection between each other .
Thus , products such as smartphones , mobile phones in which Bluetooth is enabled when comes closer to each other , connection or pairing is formed between them .
And now you are able to enjoy the music or can talk on the phone without using cords , cables or wires .
After understanding this , now you want to know , how it works .
See how …
Pair with a Phone
If you wish that your Bluetooth headset will work with your smartphone or other phone , you need to pair or connect both devices i.e.
Bluetooth headset must be paired with your phone .
Now you need to follow given steps :
First of all you must be sure that your Bluetooth headset is completely charged , if not , charge first as without being charged , task can not be completed .
Then make it turn on and after this check its compatibility with smartphone with which you wish to connect .
Next , your phone must be turn on .
After this , go to Settings option as mostly feature of Bluetooth is given in Settings .
When you found feature , select same .
( Important note ;
When your feature of Bluetooth is turn on , a signal will be sent by the phone and it began scanning for those devices in which Bluetooth is enabled and turn on , for instance , your headset . )
As we are discussing here for Bluetooth headset , so continue with the same .
When headset is founded by your phone , in list of devices you can see option of headset also .
Then you are required to enter a PIN number so that both devices can be paired or connect with each other .
The PIN number which we are discussing here is the number which comes with your headset .
Mostly it is seen that the pin number is 0000 .
When both devices connect to each other , all your incoming and outgoing calls will be automatically connected or transferred to your Bluetooth headset , only , if it is turned on and you can easily talk to the second person without using your hands .
And you are not required to repeat the same process .
Tips for Troubleshooting
If anything happens wrong , first turn off everything and then repeat pairing process .
Next you are required to check your headphone batteries and if they are not charged , completely charged them .
Check the compatibility between your phone and headset .
If still your problem persist , check headset manufacturer ’s instruction manual or their website .
At last , I like to say that this device allows you to form good and proper communication with your customers at your convenience , which leads to good .

The final two weeks of a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœforgettableÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ year will be highlighted once again by random volatile markets with very little substance and liquidity .
Traders just want to Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœcloseÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ the shop and start again in the New Year .
In such periods , liquidity drains and single flows have a big impact on price moves , sometimes making very little sense , its best to watch from the sidelines .
The US $ is mixed in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 9 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœvolatileÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
The IMF says that CBankers are not spending enough .
Most headlines have different governments willing to pledge billions to one industry or another .
Policy makers are aggressively battling global deflation by manipulating their central borrowing rates .
Like the US and Japan when you are close or at Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœzeroÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ percent , one has to print more moneyÃ¢â‚ ¬
Â¦. and keep on printing .
In theory , that is fine , but , the credit cycle has both financial institutions and the consumer ( who by the way is afraid of loading up on further debt when they are in danger of loosing their jobs ) hoarding cash balances at the moment , technically not putting anything to work .
US bailing out the auto industry , billions , Canada ditto , billions , the Irish government propping up three of its biggest banks , billions , UK government and its Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœnationalizedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ banks , billions .
It is all Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœfine and dandyÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , but nothing seems to be working yetÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¦Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¦President - elect Obama has already revised his month old objectives as the short , medium and long - term economic forecasts have worsened since Nov. 22 and his inauguration is the end of next month .
The US$ currently is lower against the EUR + 1.06 % and CHF +0.84 % and higher against GBP - 0.37 % and JPY - 0.55 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.09 % and AUD + 0.44 % .
On Friday , the Canadian core-inflation rate ( ex - food and energy ) unexpectedly advanced ( +0.7 % vs. - 0.2 % m / m ) .
This data reveals that the BOC will find it much harder to continue slashing rates as aggressively as the Fed has been doing .
But , analysts believe similar to other economies , inflation will ease in the coming months and will not be a barrier to stimulus cutting .
The loonie managed to pare some losses after the report despite the greenback aggressively rallying across the board .
The loonie despite plummeting commodity prices has hung in very well at these levels .
But , on a cross related basis the loonie is very much struggling .
With liquidity issues , do not be surprised to see the currency retrace back towards the 1.3000 level in the short term .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not necessarily the genuine strength of the loonie but the demise of the greenback that gave the CAD $ its lift earlier in the week .
Year - to - date the currency has shaved 17 % off its value against its largest trading partner as a global recession reduces demand for commodities , which generate about 50 % of the country Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s export revenue .
The AUD $ rebounded in the O/N session due to the US bailout of the auto section .
It has given some investors confidence to once again purchase high - yield currencies for now ( 0.6866 ) .
Crude is little changed O/N ( $ 42.34 down - 5c - new contract ) .
The market is bigger than OPEC and Russia .
Crude continues its downward spiral as investors speculate that the drop in global demand because of the deepening recession will outpace OPEC supply cuts .
Couple this with stockpiles at Cushing , Oklahoma ( + 21 % rise w/w ) , has left the market little room to store supplies for delivery next year .
OPEC is hinting that they may meet again next month to discuss further production cuts .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s expected that that they will continue to reduce output as demand falls .
The world is currently awash with the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœblack - stuffÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
The US Energy department provided no support when it announced late last week that consumption will be lower next year because of the contraction .
Analysts are quickly revising their target levels and many now see the black stuff retreating towards $ 25 a barrel .
The market technically has no confidence in OPECÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ability to manipulate prices .
OPEC has done little to elevate prices that have dropped 75 % from their record highs during the summer .
This deep recession has had a profound effect on global consumption .
Since the last imposed cut in Oct. of - 1.5 b , the rate of compliance by members has been more than 85 % .
The weekly EIA inventories report climbing for an 11th consecutive week has not helped to boost prices .
Inventories rose +525 k barrels to 321.3 m last week .
It is believed that inventories have gained because the oil market is in Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœcontang oÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ ( crude for future delivery is more expensive than near - month ) , this has let to increased stockpiles and greater demand for oil tankers to store the inventory .
With the greenback rebounding aggressively on Friday , we witnessed the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ prices fall the most in nearly 3 - weeks as traders liquidated profitable positions .
But , this morning with the USD under renewed pressure , investors are happy to once again own the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœyellowÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ metal ( $ 848 ) .
The Nikkei closed 8,723 up +135 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,617 down - 79 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,257 down - 29 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year Treasury yields remained unchanged on Friday ( 2.13 % ) , but prices managed to gain for a 7th consecutive week .
Treasuries rose , pushing yields to record lows after the Fed slashed funding costs to a range of Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœzero to +0.25 % Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ earlier last week and enforced that they Ã¢â‚ ¬Ë œwill do whatever is necessary Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ to ease the longest recession in 25 - years .
Investors are sacrificing returns to ensure the safety of their principal amid the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
Traders are concerned that the FedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s actions are added proof that this Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœongoingÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ credit crisis is far from over .
The demand for the safety of principal continues to outweigh prospects for record debt sales by the US Treasury .

Illinois Gov. charged with ' selling ' Obama Senate seat Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday December 9 , 2008
Print This Email This Caught on FBI wiretap saying seat is ' a f*cking valuable thing ' Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was unexpectedly taken into federal custody Tuesday morning on corruption charges related to his appointment of President - elect Barack Obama 's replacement in the Senate .
" Governor Blagojevich has taken us to a truly new low , " US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said in a news conference Tuesday , accusing the governor of overseeing a " political corruption crime spree . "
Referring to Illinois ' most famous political export , Fitzgerald said Blagojevich 's exploits " would make Lincoln roll over in his grave . "
A 76 - page FBI affidavit reveals a scheming and rather profane Blagojevich ( he dropped variations of " fuck " 18 times in the conversations detailed ) who was consumed with using his ability to fill Obama 's seat to advance his own goals .
Blagojevich is furious at his apparent inability to squeeze any perks from the president elect .
The affidavit recounts a Nov. 10 phone call where the governor tells his chief of staff and other aidesthat he had been told to " ' suck it up ' for two years and give this " motherfucker [ the President - elect ] his senator .
Fuck him .
For nothing ?
Fuck him . ' "
Fitzgerald announced the details of the charges in a press release ( pdf ) Tuesday morning .
" The breadth of corruption laid out in these charges is staggering , " the federal prosecutor said .
" They allege that Blagojevich put a ' for sale ' sign on the naming of a United States Senator ; involved himself personally in pay - to - play schemes with the urgency of a salesman meeting his annual sales target ; and corruptly used his office in an effort to trample editorial voices of criticism .
The citizens of Illinois deserve public officials who act solely in the publics interest , without putting a price tag on government appointments , contracts and decisions . "
The FBI arrested Blagojevich , a Democrat , and his chief of staff , John Harris , on charges alleging that the governor essentially attempted to sell Obama 's vacant Senate seat .
A wiretap on Nov. 3 recorded the governor exclaiming to an advisor that the seat " is a [ expletive ] valuable thing , you do n't just give it away for nothing . "
Obama cancels FBI meeting According to an FBI affidavit , Blagojevich discussed with a deputy the possibility of obtaining a cabinet position in the Obama administration , such as Secretary of Health & Human Services or Energy , or of being appointed as an ambassador .
Blagojevich also reportedly sought a high - paying position with a union - affiliated group or a nonprofit in exchange for the Senate appointment .
" I should make clear the complaint makes no allegations about the president - elect , whatsoever , " Fitzgerald said in a press conference Tuesday .
It 's unclear whether any transition associates were in any of these discussions , but Obama and Blagojevich are not close and there are indications that some representatives of the president - elect 's team refused to play ball .
Blagojevich reportedly told Harris on Nov. 11 that he knew Obama 's team wanted a particular candidate to be appointed to fill the seat .
But , he said , " They re not willing to give me anything except appreciation .
[ Expletive ] them . "
Obama had been scheduled to meet with the Chicago FBI Tuesday morning before proceeding to a meeting with Vice President Al Gore , but that meeting with the FBI was suddenly canceled , according to a pool report .
It 's unclear whether the meeting or its cancellation was related to the governor 's arrest .
Obama and Gore are expected to appear for a brief photo - opportunity following their sit - down this afternoon .
Blagojevich also allegedly tried to get members of the Chicago Tribune 's editorial board who had criticized him fired .
The two were charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud along with solicitation of bribery .
Both Blagojevich and Harris are expected in court later Tuesday .
A 78 - page FBI affidavit ( pdf ) outlines the benefits Blagojevich discussed soliciting when he was captured on wiretaps in the course of the investigation , which came as part of Operation Board Games , a five - year public corruption probe of pay - to - play schemes in Illinois .
According to Fitzgerald 's press release :
At various times , in exchange for the Senate appointment , Blagojevich discussed obtaining :
> a substantial salary for himself at a either a non-profit foundation or an organization affiliated with labor unions ;
> placing his wife on paid corporate boards where he speculated she might garner as much as $ 150,000 a year ;
> promises of campaign funds  including cash up front ; and
> a cabinet post or ambassadorship for himself .
The Chicago Tribune , which first reported Blagojevhich 's arrest , documented the expansion of a three - year pay - for - play probe aimed at the governor .
The paper reported that the probe was focusing on appointing Obama 's successor and that some Blagojevich associates were wearing wires in cooperation with the probe .
The governor , who has made headlines in recent days for cutting off Bank of America on behalf of laid off workers conducting a sit-in , disputed allegations of corruption when he spoke to reporters Monday at the Republic Window & Doors plant in Chicago .
The arrest appeared to be unreleated to Blagojevich 's intervention on behalf of the workers .
More details are expected to emerge at a noon press conference and throughout the day .

Thanks to Tina Fey , Sarah Palin is n’t just a target of jokes – she ’s been swift - butted .
Some political scientists contend that Fey ’s “ Saturday Night Live ” skewering of the Alaska governor is playing a large role in spoiling the McCain / Palin ticket .
“ Presidential impersonators do influence elections , and in this one , Tina Fey is well on her way to ruining Sarah Palin ’s political career , ” said Jerald Podair , a professor of American Studies at Lawrence University .
“ In a political culture that takes its cues from popular culture , a good impersonator may be worth a million votes , ” Podair said .
Click here to watch Fey as Palin on ‘ SNL ’
Not since Chevy Chase made many viewers perceive Gerald Ford as a clumsy stooge has a television impersonation been credited with altering the political narrative to such a degree , said John Pitney Jr. , a professor of American Politics at Claremont McKenna College .
“ The parodies may have done a bit of damage .
People remember Gerald Ford through the prism of Chevy Chase , ” he said .
“ Ford was among our most athletic presidents , and he had a wide - ranging knowledge of public - policy issues .
But because of ‘ SNL , ’ many came to think of him as a buffoon . ”
A recent Washington Times poll found that independent voters are crediting the “ Tina Fey effect ” with turning them off to the McCain ticket .
But some experts argue that comedy sketches are not changing voters ’ minds .
“ Jokes and impersonations only leave lasting damage if they resonate with existing narratives the voter internalized , ” said Dorothy James , a professor of Government at Connecticut College .
“ Most people who strongly identify as Republicans have internalized the narrative that Gov. Palin is a breath of fresh air , a maverick .
Tina
Fey ’s impersonation only angers them , and may increase their support for Palin , ” James said .
“ Those who strongly identify as Democrats have an alternative narrative – that she is grammatically chaotic , tied to party talking points , ignorant and unprepared .
Fey ’s impersonation only reinforces existing attitudes there . ”

Last week the cat dragged Rosie Live to the TV screens of millions of viewers .
They took a quick peek , a wiff , held their noses while their eyes watered , ears folding back into the head in protest and quickly threw Rosie and her show in the garbage .
Wraped in a double layered , bio degradable poop bag with safety seal .
Next to all the other soft to the touch poop bags containing the stinkaroos the loony left wing nuts of NBC have been trying to feed the public but no one wants to see .
The hype around Rosie O’Donnell had been building for months , carefully cultivated by the American left .
Every Mainstream Media standard bearer had been breathlessly promoting her variety show as being cutting edge , raw , politically savvy , the bane of conservative thought and the mainstay of the new NBC season .
It was going to be the equivalent of the New York Times , Huffington Post and Late Night with David Letterman all rolled up into the shinning beacon of comedy , thought , analysis , opinion and celebrity worship missing on TV screens .
Oprah , dare they say , should be worried .
It was going to be glorious !
Who were they kidding ?
Truth be told Rosie O’Donnels show was cancelled because no one saw it .
Sorry , let me correct myself in the name of objectivity .
Do n’t want to give you the wrong impression !
Five million people saw Rosie Live , about the same number of people that think Barack Hussein Obama really IS the Messiah .
Nah , bad comparison .
63.7 million Americans bought the Obama ’s song and dance extravaganza and believed he was the Messiah , the One , the Almighty , the Black Superman to borrow a phrase from the 1975 song by Johnny Wakelin And The Kinshasa Band .
Some are starting to get buyers remorse but that is a topic for another time .
Guests were many and varied , from a retired Minnelli to a gay as a three dollar bill Aiken , but for whatever reason they had something in common that night and I do n’t mean being Barack Obama supporters .
Most were talentless as in having lost their talent at home and not finding it before leaving the house .
So bad in fact that if bad taste and a poor performance were a crime they would all be serving time working as hotel staff at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai , India .
Among the worst offenders we find : Liza Minnelli , Harry Connick Jr. , Conan O’Brien , Jane Krakowski , Alec Baldwin , Clay Aiken , and Alanis Morissette .
I guess that by her stint at The View the people know what a far - left - wing kook O’Donnell has become and no one outside the knife - wielding , loony toon left wants anything to do with her .
Except Obama central , NBC , of course .
Not withstanding the Mainstream Medias disengenuous pre-airing hype , Rosie Live was dead on arrival .
A POS and no , I ’m not talking about my newly found passion , EVE Online .

Report : Military may have to quell domestic violence from economic collapse RAW STORY
Published : Monday December 29 , 2008
Print This Email This Deepening economic strife in the US could lead to civil unrest and violence that would require military intervention , warns a new report from the US Army War College .
" Widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security , " writes Nathan Freier , a 20 - year Army veteran and visiting professor at the college .
A copy of the 44 - page report , " Known Unknowns : Unconventional ' Strategic Shocks ' in Defense Strategy Development , " can be downloaded here .
Freier notes that his report expresses only his own views and does not represent US policy , but it 's certain that his recommendations have come before at least some Defense Department officials .
The author warns potential causes for such civil unrest could include another terrorist attack , " unforeseen economic collapse , loss of functioning political and legal order , purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency , pervasive public health emergencies , and catastrophic natural and human disasters . "
The situation could deteriorate to the point where military intervention was required , he argues .
" Under these conditions and at their most violent extreme , " he concludes , " civilian authorities , on advice of the defense establishment , would need to rapidly determine the parameters defining the legitimate use of military force inside the United States . "
While the scenario presented is " likely not an immediate prospect , " Freier concedes , it deserves consideration .
Prior to 9/11 , no one in the defense establishment would have envisioned a plot to topple skyscrapers with airliners , and the military should not be caught so off - guard again , he says .
To the extent events like this involve organized violence against local , state , and national authorities and exceed the capacity of the former two to restore public order and protect vulnerable populations , DoD would be required to fill the gap , " he writes .
" This is largely uncharted strategic territory . "
Freier 's report has merited some concern as it comes alongside revelations that the Defense Department has assigned a full - time Army unit to be on - call for domestic deployment .
An article in Monday 's El Paso Times notes that military and police officials in Texas are unaware of team - up efforts such as those suggested in the report .
Arizona authorities told the Phoenix Business Journal they are similarly unaware of any new plans , although the Phoenix Police Department made clear its officers " always train to prepare for any civil unrest issue . "
The Posse Comitatus
Act restricts the military 's role in domestic law enforcement , but it does not completely preclude involvement in cases of emergency or when emergency law is declared .
As of now , though , such scenarios seem unlikely .
The bulk of Freier 's report recommends refocusing Defense Department strategy toward thinking outside the box , in general , and the unlikely possibility of domestic deployments is just one longshot example he uses to illustrate a worst case scenario .

About the time when TweakTown started pumping out technology content , ABIT produced the best motherboards on the market .
They always included the very latest in technologies , they were the first to create a jumperless motherboard and were the pioneers of creating the overclocking revolution .
A few years ago now , ABIT started its shocking fall from the top .
Its management were excused and charged for bad financial practices , key staff walked away from the company , engineers jumped shipped - ABIT , as we knew it , would never to be the same as it once were .
Fast forward to this year and ABIT were left with a single product line to try and keep the company from collapsing - digital picture frames with the ability to print .
They did n't work out as planned , there were rumors of ABIT re-entering the graphics card market once again , but those rumors did n't eventuate .
Computer enthusiasts join me in bidding farewell to the once mighty strong ABIT - they are going to close the company once and for all on December 31st .

The rising cost of college  even before the recession  threatens to put higher education out of reach for most Americans , according to the biennial report from the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education .
Over all , the report found , published college tuition and fees increased 439 percent from 1982 to 2007 while median family income rose 147 percent .
Student borrowing has more than doubled in the last decade , and students from lower - income families , on average , get smaller grants from the colleges they attend than students from more affluent families .
“ If we go on this way for another 25 years , we wo n’t have an affordable system of higher education , ” said Patrick M. Callan , president of the center , a nonpartisan organization that promotes access to higher education .
“ When we come out of the recession , ” Mr. Callan added , “ we ’re really going to be in jeopardy , because the educational gap between our work force and the rest of the world will make it very hard to be competitive .
Already , we ’re one of the few countries where 25 - to 34 - year - olds are less educated than older workers . ”

The loss of coral reefs around the world is being blamed on the mass amounts of CO2 in our planets oceans , and the resulting acid that is keeping the reefs and other crustaceans from calcifying .
When I was a kid , my favorite television program was The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau .
I knew every thing there was to know about him ( or so I thought ) .
I even did a report , in which I stood at the front of the class , talking about his invention of the Scuba Tank .
All these years later , I still remember that it is an acronym for “ Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus . ” [ social_buttons ]
Because of that series , and the silent , beautiful seas that it introduced me to , I decided to become a Marine Biologist when I grew up .
Alas , life had other plans for me , but it disheartens me to see that our last frontier is changing , and changing quickly .
Rod Salm , says that his were the first human eyes to see many of the remotest reefs at a time when we could really describe them a pristine .
But sadly , there are more and more that look like something from the dark side of the moon .
“ These degraded reefs have been ravaged by destructive fishing , bad land use practices that smother them with silt , and pollutants that foster disease and overgrowth by seaweeds ” he explains .
He continues , “ More alarmingly , there are large areas that are killed off and degraded by warming seas linked to climate change . ”
Throughout his article , he goes on to explain that the specific problem that reefs are suffering from , is excess amounts of CO2 .
You see , the oceans normally absorb about one - third of the CO2 entering the atmosphere , but in recent times , we ’ve upset the balance and our oceans are absorbing more of it and at faster rates than ever before , causing a much greater amount of acidity .
This acid removes carbonate from the water and it ’s this carbonate that is essential for calcifying organisms , like corals , mollusks , sea urchins , and many other important creatures that live on reefs or help them build .
In a nutshell , it ’s as if the acid in the water , caused by CO2 , is keeping the skeletons of these sea creatures from growing .
The Nature Conservancy recently convened leading climate change experts , top marine scientist and prominent coral reef managers from around the globe for a “ meeting of the minds ” session .
The key findings and recommendation were compiled into the Honolulu Declaration on Ocean Acidification and Reef Management , which outlines in greater detail than I can in this article , the root causes , consequences and steps that we can take to help solve the problem .
Perhaps the best way to care for our planet is to do exactly what you are doing right now , learning about the issues and not giving up .
Sharing your knowledge with others , and sharing comments or questions with us , are all easy steps in the process of changing our world .

Happy people spend a lot of time socializing , going to church and reading newspapers  but they do n’t spend a lot of time watching television , a new study finds .
That ’s what unhappy people do .
Although people who describe themselves as happy enjoy watching television , it turns out to be the single activity they engage in less often than unhappy people , said John Robinson , a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland and the author of the study , which appeared in the journal Social Indicators Research .
While most large studies on happiness have focused on the demographic characteristics of happy people  factors like age and marital status 
Dr. Robinson and his colleagues tried to identify what activities happy people engage in .
The study relied primarily on the responses of 45,000 Americans collected over 35 years by the University of Chicago ’s General Social Survey , and on published “ time diary ” studies recording the daily activities of participants .
“ We looked at 8 to 10 activities that happy people engage in , and for each one , the people who did the activities more  visiting others , going to church , all those things  were more happy , ” Dr. Robinson said .
“ TV was the one activity that showed a negative relationship .
Unhappy people did it more , and happy people did it less . ”
Here are some kick ass independent games to play while you are waiting in - between alphas of Overgrowth !
Why should you check out indie games ?
I think Ron Carmel of 2D Boy says it best : " The video game medium has been in a bit of a rut for about a decade .
Many truly great games have come out in the last 10 years , but the market is dominated by big - budget photorealistic sequels and movie tie-ins produced by large public companies .
Many of these games are the equivalent of second rate airport novels , straight - to - DVD movies , formulaic TV , and synthetic tween pop . "
There are a lot of truly awesome independent video games and as an independent video game company , at Wolfire , we play so many video games for " research " that we think we have come up with a pretty good list .
Remember , when you are buying or giving away one of these games , be sure to get it from the creator 's website directly , which could mean the difference between the author getting 100 % of your sale or 30 % depending on where you find it .
1. World of Goo
This game kicks ass .
For an in - depth look at what makes it great , check out David 's design tour .
World of Goo is available for Mac , Windows , and ( almost ) Linux , but the Nintendo Wii version is possibly the most fun .
You can play four player co-op !
This game is one of the most successful indie games in recent history , so it is worth looking at very carefully for that reason alone .
2. Braid
Braid is the other indie behemoth of 2008 .
It offers an exciting twist to 2D platforming by incorporating the element of time travel .
Some of Braid 's puzzles will seem daunting at first but wrapping your brain around the game 's time manipulation system to beat levels is very rewarding .

There 's something very satisfying about landing a dropship on a group of soldiers and watching the guts and gears go flying .
9. Droid Assault
Droid Assault is a retro arcade game for Mac , Windows , and Linux .
I have to admit I 'm the only guy at Wolfire who had heard of it , but I 'm a huge fan and got totally addicted to it .
Basically , you are a little robot and you must shoot or " take over " other bigger robots .
You can amass an army of robots who help you out along your journey .
10 . Schizoid
Shizoid is another XBLA title that we 've really enjoyed .
It 's a top down cooperative game .
One player controls the red ship and can only kill red enemies and will die if touched by blue monsters .
The other player has the blue ship and can only kill blue enemies and must run from the red ones .
Sounds simple , but when you account for Schizoid 's twisted level designs and devious AI , you and your friend end up on the edge of your seats screaming survival strategies at each other .
Just in case the regular co-op challenge is n't hard enough , you can also play the Uberschizoid mode where you have to orchestrate the whole two - ship ballet by yourself .

Pakistan feared India was planning to launch a military strike at the height of tensions over the Mumbai attacks , a senior Pakistani diplomat has said .
Pakistan 's High Commissioner to London said there was evidence that India wanted " to teach Pakistan a lesson " .
Islamabad denies involvement in the attacks which left at least 170 dead , but some of the gunmen are said to have had links to Pakistani militants .
Both sides have taken care not to openly inflame the situation .
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hassan told the BBC World Service 's Newshour programme that he had received the information in the wake of the three - day siege of key sites in Mumbai .
" This is what we were told by our friends that there could possibly be a quick strike at some of the areas they suspect to be the training camps , an air raid or something of that sort , " he said .
Mr Hassan said he alerted his president , Asif Ali Zardari , to the danger and Pakistan urgently passed on its concerns to high level US and British officials , who intervened to calm the situation .
How would we have reacted ?
That could be anybody 's guess
Wajid Shamsul Hassan
High Commissioner
" There was circumstantial evidence that India was going to make a quick strike against Pakistan to teach her a lesson , " he said .
Mr Hassan said that in his opinion it was unlikely the two countries , which both possess nuclear weapons and have fought several wars since partition in 1947 , would have ended up in all - out conflict .
" We would n't have gone , and I 'm sure India would n't have gone for full - scale war , " he said .
" But then , on the other side , how would we have reacted ?
That could be anybody 's guess .
We are a smaller country , we have to defend ourselves . "
India has so far made no comment on Mr Hassan 's comments .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice embarked on a diplomatic mission to ease tensions - flying to Dehli and Islamabad for talks this week .
She also called on both countries to show moderation in their response to the Mumbai attacks .
Analysts say that despite both sides ' rhetoric , there has been no concrete signs by either side of heightened military activity , such as troop movements to border areas .
Hoax call denied
In an earlier indication of how strained relations had become during the attacks , the Pakistani Dawn newspaper reported that the country had been put on high alert during the crisis after what the paper called a hoax call was made to President Zardari .
India says the surviving gunman , Azam Amir Qasab , is Pakistani A caller claiming to be Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee spoke to the Pakistani leader in a threatening manner on 28 November , Dawn reported .
The newspaper said Mr Zardari 's staff had bypassed usual verification checks for a call to the president .
But Pakistan 's Information Minister Sherry Rehman later denied it could have been a hoax .
" It is not possible for any call to come through to the president without multiple caller identity verifications , " she said in a statement .
" In fact the identity of this particular call , as evident from the CLI ( caller 's line identification ) device , showed that the call was placed from a verified official Phone Number of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs . "
In another development , Indian police have arrested two men in the eastern city of Calcutta suspected of handling mobile phone cards later used by the Mumbai attackers .
Nine of the 10 militants believed to have mounted the attack on 26 November died .
Indian media have named the surviving gunman as Azam Amir Qasab , a Pakistani , and say he has links to a Pakistan - based Kashmiri militant group , Lashkar - e - Taiba .
The group denies involvement .

Ever have one of those old jalopies you just can't seem to get rid of ?
It chugs along , but the wheels keep coming off , the transmission 's making a disturbing ka - thunka - thunka noise , and there 's a viscous oily substance oozing from the crankcase ?
Yet its creators keep telling you that it just needs a little wax job and everything will be fine .
No , I 'm not talking about the McCain campaign ; I 'm talking about Windows and its latest emergency patch , issued Thursday more than two weeks ahead of the usual Patch Tuesday release .
Something has apparently gone terribly wrong with the network file and print sharing services for Windows XP , 2000 , and Server 2003 .
( The flaw also affects Vista and Server 2008 , but less severely . )
Microsoft is not only issuing an out - of - cycle patch for the first time since April 2007 , it 's fixing a critical flaw that has n't been reported by any of the usual suspects in the security community .
So it must be HUGE .
Per BetaNews :
... the list of services that could be affected by this latest hole , is astounding .
Most importantly , anything that relies on Server Message Block ( SMB ) including the Common Internet File System ( CIFS ) , any kind of file or print sharing , remote group policy enforcement , the print spooler , the indexing service , and network logon -- all of these are among the items impacted by a potential hijacking of the Server service .
Essentially , anything that need [s ] sharing or to be shared goes through the SMB protocol , which is managed by the Server service .
As IDG 's Bob McMillan reports , security wonks needed just two hours to come up with code that could exploit the flaw using that old hacker chestnut , the stack overflow exploit .
There was a time when Microsoft would sit on this sort of thing for weeks , waiting for an exploit to occur .
So give them credit for being proactive .
Still , it 's kind of like GM issuing a warning saying your Chevy 's engine may suddenly explode when you hit 60 mph , so you might want to bring it in for a tuneup .
Is it finally time to trade in that old jalopy for something you can rely on ?
And if so , what would it be ?

" " Alcohol affects areas of the brain that control emotions , including anger and aggressiveness , which can sometimes lead to bad results .
miodrag ignjatovic / Getty Images
The cerebral cortex is the highest portion of the brain .
The cortex processes information from your senses , does your " thought " processing and consciousness ( in combination with a structure called the basal ganglia ) , initiates most voluntary muscle movements and influences lower - order brain centers .
In the cortex , alcohol does the following :
Depresses the behavioral inhibitory centers :
The person becomes more talkative , more self - confident and less socially inhibited .
Slows down the processing of information from the senses :
The person has trouble seeing , hearing , smelling , touching and tasting ; also , the threshold for pain is raised .
Inhibits thought processes :
The person does not use good judgment or think clearly .
These effects get more pronounced as the BAC increases .

The limbic system consists of areas of the brain called the hippocampus and septal area .
The limbic system controls emotions and memory .
As alcohol affects this system , the person is subject to exaggerated states of emotion ( anger , aggressiveness , withdrawal ) and memory loss .
The cerebellum coordinates the movement of muscles .
The brain impulses that initiate muscle movement originate in the motor centers of the cerebral cortex and travel through the medulla and spinal cord to the muscles .
As the nerve signals pass through the medulla , they are influenced by nerve impulses from the cerebellum .
The cerebellum controls fine movements .
For example , you can normally touch your finger to your nose in one smooth motion with your eyes closed ; if your cerebellum were not functioning , the motion would be extremely shaky or jerky .
As alcohol affects the cerebellum , muscle movements become uncoordinated .
In addition to coordinating voluntary muscle movements , the cerebellum also coordinates the fine muscle movements involved in maintaining your balance .
So , as alcohol affects the cerebellum , a person may lose their balance frequently .
At this stage , this person might be described as " falling down drunk . "
The hypothalamus is an area of the brain that controls and influences many automatic functions of the brain through actions on the medulla , and coordinates many chemical or endocrine functions ( secretions of sex , thyroid and growth hormones ) through chemical and nerve impulse actions on the pituitary gland .
Alcohol has two noticeable effects on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland , which influence sexual behavior and urinary excretion .
Alcohol depresses the nerve centers in the hypothalamus that control sexual arousal and performance .
As BAC increases , sexual behavior increases , but sexual performance declines .
Excessive drinking also inhibits the pituitary secretion of anti-diuretic hormone ( ADH ) , which acts on the kidney to reabsorb water .
Alcohol acts on the hypothalamus / pituitary to reduce the circulating levels of ADH .
When ADH levels drop , the kidneys do not reabsorb as much water ; consequently , the kidneys produce more urine .
The medulla , or brain stem , controls or influences all of the bodily functions that are involuntary , like breathing , heart rate , temperature and consciousness .
As alcohol starts to influence upper centers in the medulla , such as the reticular formation , a person will start to feel sleepy and may eventually become unconscious as BAC increases .
If the BAC gets high enough to influence the breathing , heart rate and temperature centers , a person will breathe slowly or stop breathing altogether , and both blood pressure and body temperature will fall .
These conditions can be fatal .
The discovery of a massive virus that suffers from another virus has reignited debate over whether the microscopic agents of infection should be considered living things rather than bags of genes .
Earlier this month scientists reported a new strain of giant virus called mamavirus , which was first detected in amoebas from a water - cooling tower in Paris .
In a recent study , electron microscopy revealed a much smaller virus attached to the mamavirus , which the study authors say made the host virus grow abnormally and damaged its ability to replicate .
The tiny satellite virus , dubbed Sputnik , is the first described virophage — so named because its behavior resembles that of bacteria - targeting viruses known as bacteriophages .
A team led by microbiologist Didier Raoult from the Université de la Méditerranée in Marseille , France , published the findings earlier this month in the online edition of the journal Nature .
In an accompanying commentary , Jean - Michel Claverie , director of the Mediterranean Institute of Microbiology in Marseille , said of Sputnik 's victim : " There is no doubt that this is a living organism . "
But other microbiologists are n't enthusiastic about tying the discovery to a redefinition of life , with at least one expert calling speculation over whether viruses represent living organisms a red herring .
Related Video : Watch How Life Develops From One Cell
To Be , or Not To Be ?
Fundamentally , viruses are bundles of genetic material surrounded by a protein shell called a capsid .
To reproduce , a virus binds to a host cell , which mistakes the virus for a protein and replicates its genetic code .
The cell then bursts , releasing hundreds of copies of the virus into the host .
Classic definitions hold that viruses are not life - forms , because they lack living cells of their own and must hijack those in animals , plants , and bacteria .
According to Merriam - Webster 's Unabridged Dictionary , viruses " are regarded either as the smallest microorganisms or extremely complex molecules . "
In 2003 Claverie and Raoult described the first known giant virus , called mimivirus , which had originally been mistaken for a bacterium because of its size .
Raoult later co-authored a paper in Nature Microbiology that challenged the cell - based definition of life and proposed redefining viruses as " capsid - encoding organisms . "
Claverie also put forth a new way of interpreting viruses :
They are a " transitory cell into the cell , hence more like regular living organisms , " he said .
" Virologists focused too much on viruses as ' particles , ' where I proposed that they should be considered an intermediary stage [ to cellular life ] — the same role spores or seeds play for plants , for instance , " he said .
Research by Claverie and his colleagues further suggests that giant viruses may predate the emergence of living organisms with a nucleus , or eukaryotes .
" In fact , there are many arguments that suggest that these giant viruses may be the ancestor of the modern cell nucleus , " the French scientist added .
The virophage Sputnik apparently harms the newly described mamavirus as it exploits its reproductive mechanism , bolstering the notion that giant viruses are on par with recognized life - forms as hosts for viruses and should be reclassified .
Raoult notes , however , that such ideas might not be met with universal approval .
" People can hate … when you try to change very basic definitions , " he said .
Certainly Biological
Eddie Holmes of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University said that it has long been known that viruses can infect other viruses .
" The difference here is that Sputnik is supposedly ' bad ' for [ the mamavirus ] , " Holmes wrote in an email .
" However , I think this aspect of the study is rather tentative and needs more work . "
Holmes added that he thinks " the debate over whether viruses are ' alive ' is an entirely pointless one and of no scientific importance .
It all depends on how you define life . "
Eugene Koonin , a co-author of the new study at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Maryland , echoed Holmes 's comments that the question of whether viruses are living creatures is a nonissue .
" Is not a scientific question or , in any case , a question of any interest to scientists , " Koonin stated .
What happened
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin defended herself against critics who accuse her of sinking John McCain 's presidential bid .
In an interview with FOX News ' Greta Van Susteren , the former Republican vice - presidential candidate said that she will " plow through that door " if she has a chance for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012 .
( FOX News online )
What the commentators said
" After her brutal transformation by the McCain campaign into a shopaholic , whack - job diva , " said Maureen Dowd in The New York Times , " Palin is now trying to unmake that makeover . "
So she 's throwing open her door to the national press , " letting them hang in her Wasilla kitchen as she makes moose chili and cake and baby formula and hefty servings of spin . "
This " PR offensive " is important for Palin 's future , said Foon Rhee in The Boston Globe online .
She 's trying to get across the bottom - line message that " the sweeping Republican loss last week is n't her fault , " before her GOP rivals pin the defeat on her .
Palin is sure making up for lost time , said Jay McDonough in Examiner.com .
While she was " riding shotgun " for McCain , her boss largely kept her from talking to the press , but now she " ca n't get enough of the media . "
With legions of supporters hoping she 'll run in 2012 , " I reckon we should get used to seeing a lot more of Sarah Palin . "
Palin might not have been ready for prime time this year , said Mona Charen in Townhall.com .
But do n't believe all the nasty " backbiting " by McCain aides who are calling her dumb .
She 'll be a contender if she " spends the next couple of years using her obvious smarts to bone up on national and international issues . "
Here I thought it was impressive that I won a regional science fair at the age of 12 .
But now comes the story of M.Lavinashree , a girl from the Tamil Nadu state in India , who has passed the Microsoft Certified Professional exam at the age of 9 .
I first read about this on Engadget last week and was really impressed , but now that I 've looked into it a bit further I 'm not so sure about it .
First of all , I can't quite tell how old she is :
All the various articles about her say she 's 9 , but the website dedicated to her says she 's 8 , as does Wikipedia .
The video below says she 's 9 , and appears to be a news report from India , so I 'm inclined to believe it .
But , the question of her age aside , why do none of the articles about her suggest that she 's being pushed too far ?
She 's obviously a very smart kid , and that 's great .
But how many kids that age decide to take the MCP exam on their own ?
And how many families who claim never to force their kids to study put up websites crowing about their kids ' achievements the way this kid 's family has ?
Could they repeat the words " child prodigy " a little more often , maybe ?
Seriously , whether she 's 8 or 9 , no matter where she comes from , she deserves to be able to be a kid without too much pressure from her family and , possibly , her government .
It does n't help that this story is being bounced around all over the world .
Lavinashree must know that she 's become famous , and surely that contributes to the pressure on her to succeed .
Here 's hoping that she 'll ask her family to ease off , and to let her spend some time being a kid — she 'll have plenty of time to do all these things when she 's older .
Being a " child prodigy " is n't always all it's cracked up to be , especially if it involves the word " Microsoft . "

When a new drug is approved and enters the marketplace , often the only safety and efficacy information available is based on a few thousand people who took the drug during strictly controlled clinical trials .
Not surprisingly , these trials are designed to focus on the drugs ’ benefits , and may not include a large enough sample size to elicit serious adverse effects .
Once the drug is available for widespread use , we are able to better evaluate the real safety profile of the drug .
A recent study published in JAMA evaluates the issue of post - marketing surveillance related to biologic agents .
Biologic agents are a relatively new class of drugs , and include recombinant products , monoclonal - antibody - based products , and recombinant vaccines .
Recombinant insulin was the first biologic agent approved in the US in 1982 , and now there are more than 250 agents that have received approval .
Many of these agents are invaluable in cancer therapy today .
However , since 1995 , nearly 25 % of biologic agents approved in the US and Europe have had safety - related regulatory actions issued against them .
More than 1in 10 of the agents had black - box warnings placed on the prescribing information .
Most safety problems were related to immunomodulatory effects , and more than half of the safety issues involved system organ classes , including infections , immune system disorders , and benign and malignant neoplasms .
From January 1995 to June 2007 , 174 biologic agents were approved for use in the US and Europe .
A total of 41 agents received safety - related regulatory actions , including 46 “ dear healthcare professional ” letters , 17 direct healthcare professional communications , and 19 black box warnings .
The first - in - class agents that obtained approval were nearly 4 times as likely to receive safety - related regulatory actions versus agents receiving later approval .
The agents most likely to receive a black - box warning in the US included monoclonal antibodies , cytokines , enzymes , growth factors , hormones , and interferons .
Adverse events that may trigger regulatory action from the FDA may occur as infrequently as 1 in 50,000 or more .
Also , many adverse events are not seen initially , but appear with a drug ’s long - term use .
Last , once a drug enters the market , it can be used for off - label purposes , which were never studied in clinical trials to evaluate safety and efficacy .
For these reasons , post - marketing surveillance is paramount to making drug safety a top priority .
The data for post - marketing surveillance comes from voluntary reporting systems .
Healthcare providers , consumers , and pharmaceutical companies submit nearly 500,000 reports of adverse events to the FDA each year .
Most of the reports come from healthcare providers , but 90 % of the reports are routed through the drug manufacturer before being sent to the FDA .
The FDA estimates that the submitted reports represent only 10 % of the actual adverse events experienced .
There is no system in place for the FDA to track how many people are taking a particular drug or how it is being used .
In addition to its insufficient voluntary reporting mechanisms , the FDA lacks federal authority to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct any post - marketing surveillance .
They can request studies , but there is no consequence for noncompliance .
If the FDA calls for additional warnings , labeling changes , patient education , patient registries , or restricted advertising , there is no procedure for enforcement .
The current JAMA article underscores the need for more transparency in the oversight of drug approval and drug safety .
Many politicians and independent organizations have suggested the formation of autonomous safety oversight boards , or the development of a pharmacist - led adverse event reporting system , but none of these proposals have gained traction to date .
Currently , the best scenario involves increased evaluation of new drugs during the approval process to better predict possible adverse events that may occur , as well as increased monitoring in the post - marketing period .
Even with the safety of a handful of agents possibly in question , however , people are still better off with most of these drugs than without them .

If your New Year 's resolution is to lose weight , you are n't alone .
( Although given the lack of follow - through among many of us , it should be named a New Year 's dissolution . )
But this year , the ranks of tens of millions of adults trying to shrink the ever - expanding waistlines are swelling with an increasingly larger ( no pun intended ) population - overweight and obese children .
Case in point : the January issue of Pediatrics .
The majority of articles touch on the staggering consequences of overweight / obese pediatrics and adolescents , and their future looks anything but rosy .
Anyone with children under 5 years of age , take note of research reported by Daphne Gardner , et. al. , evaluating whether early weight gain ( 0 –5 years ) is an important contributor to childhood obesity and consequentlymetabolic risk .
The authors found that most excess weight before puberty is gained before5 years of age .
" Weight at 5 years of age bears little relationto birth weight but closely predicts weight at 9 years of age , " the abstract states .
If metabolic status at9 years of age means future risk , diabetes / cardiovascular preventionstrategies might better focus on preschool - aged children , becausethe die seems to be largely cast by 5 years of age , and a healthyweight early in childhood may be maintained at least into puberty .
" Elisabeth Kvaavik and colleagues extended their studies of childhood physical fitness and activity into adulthood in the Oslo Youth Study .
The authors measured physical fitness , physical activity , and CVD risk factors at ages 13 , 15 , 25 , 33 ( self - reports of weight and heightonly ) and 40 years .
Interestingly , while theinverse relation between physical fitness and BMI present atage 13 was also apparent at 15 , 25 , and 33 years of age , the authors found that the gradients progressively diminished in magnitude with increasingfollow - up time such that the association was lost at 40 yearsof age .
" There is a suggestionthat higher physical fitness may confer protection against laterobesity and raised BP , although these effects diminished overtime , " the authors conclude .
Early intervention seems to be a crucial step in the fight against childhood weight problems , but what if doctors are n't diagnosing children properly ?
Lacey Benson et. al. found that although the numbers of overweight children are already frighteningly high , they should actually be higher .
" Although clear BMI definitions of pediatric weightproblems exist , a large percentage of overweight and obese patientsremain undiagnosed .
Diagnosis increased during the study periodbut remained low among overweight children , for whom early interventionmay be more effective .
Identification of overweight and obesepatients is the first step in addressing this growing epidemic .
" So what are some of the problems overweight and obese children experience ?
Obstructive sleep apnea , for one , leading to excessive daytime sleepiness .
What can we do to help mitigate the growing obesity trend ?
Exercise , of course , is one solution .
Walking is an easy way to build up physical fitness without major stress on joints and bones , but what if you just had to guess at how far you were walking ?
Would that impact your confidence , your fitness level , your weight loss ?
Naim Mitre and others from the Mayo Clinic investigated the accuracy of measuringwalking steps with commercially available pedometers and anaccelerometer - based step - counter .
" Commerciallyavailable pedometers do not correlate well with walking steps , and this may not satisfy expectations , especially when offeringthem to obese children as tools to assess physical activity , " the authors say .
The pedometers showed significantly greater error in overweight children compared with normal children , perhaps because of slower walking speeds and the angle at which the pedometer is worn .
The step - counter was more accurate , with no significant difference between the two groups .
A more extreme option is gastric bypass , which has reduced CV risk factors in adults .
Thomas Inge and colleagues discuss significant weight loss and remission of type 2 diabetes mellitusafter Roux - en - Y gastric bypass in extremely obese diabetic adolescents , including improvements in insulin resistance , β- cell function , and cardiovascular risk factors .
This study is a hit in the lay press - Inge said in a HealthDay News article in the Washington Post that " These early surgical research findings suggest that diabetes may not be a diagnosis kids have to live with for the rest of their lives .
...
They may not have to face diabetic retinopathy , progressive coronary heart disease and renal failure .
In fact , there is good reason to be optimistic about their future cardiovascular health .
" I thought the HealthDay reporter , Steven Reinberg , did a fantastic job addressing the counterpoint : that while bariatric surgery will definitely help these kids , should n't we try to prevent the need for the surgery in the first place ?
Reinberg quotes Dr. David Katz , director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University School of Medicine , as saying that a " large and growing proportion of all children and adolescents are subject to obesity , and its complications .
...
Surgery can mitigate those complications , but can we really condone ushering more and more young people through the OR doors for a major surgical procedure to fix what policies and programs that foster healthful eating and regular activity could have prevented in the first place ?

Money Morning / The Money Map Report
For anyone who still doubted the growing global influence of such emerging powerhouses as China , consider this :
The U.S. government 's decision to take control of foundering mortgage giants Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) was driven not by worries about the fading U.S. housing market , but by concerns that foreign central banks in China , Japan , Europe , the Middle East and Russia might stop buying our bonds .
As the bailout announced Sunday is currently structured , more than $ 1.3 trillion worth of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt currently held by the central banks and other investors in those regions will be guaranteed by the U.S. government – even if one or both of the two government - sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) were to fail .
That means that U.S. taxpayers – government parlance for you and me – will ultimately foot a big part of the bill for making sure those foreign bondholders are " made whole . "
The government apparently felt it had no choice .
As speculation about the possible collapse of the two firms spiraled higher in recent weeks , central banks , sovereign wealth funds and foreign investors throughout the world were reportedly threatening to halt their purchases of Fannie and Freddie debt , grousing that the mounting risk was making them leery of buying any more bonds .
And that would make it virtually impossible for the two mortgage operators – and by extension , the U.S. mortgage market – to function effectively .
" It was the mounting evidence that central banks , sovereign wealth funds , and other global investors were growing [ increasingly ] reluctant to invest in the debt that was the catalyst for the Treasury Department 's actions , " Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody's / Economy.com in West Chester , Pa. , wrote in a recent research report .
" Fannie and Freddie debt is now effectively U.S. Treasury debt , ensuring that holders will remain whole . "
Fannie and Freddie together own or guarantee about half of the country 's $ 12 trillion in mortgage debt .
On Sunday , however , Federal Housing Finance Agency Director James Lockhart said the two companies ' market share of newly issued mortgages had actually exceeded 80 % earlier this year , before falling off recently .
And yet , that was n't the mortgage market itself that forced the hand of U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. " Hank " Paulson :
It was the $ 5.2 trillion in so - called Fannie and Freddie " agency debt " – of which more than $ 1.3 trillion , or about 25 % , was held by foreign investors .
Total U.S. agency debt of all types was said to be slightly more than $ 1.5 trillion .
Without the bailout , China 's financial position may have been damaged :
Of that country 's $ 1.8 trillion in foreign currency reserves , as much as 70 % is held in dollar - denominated assets .
With $ 376 billion in GSE debt , China was also the top holder of the bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
If China were to lose confidence in the U.S. currency – dumping the dollar – it's hard to say with certainty just how bad things could get .
Should foreign investors rampantly discard the dollar , the greenback would plunge against other currencies .
And that would be highly inflationary , translating into what would effectively be big price increases on such key imports as oil , steel , electronics , and other wares .
That could finally force the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates – a move the central bank has been trying to avoid , due to concerns that markedly higher rates would shove the U.S. economy into a deep recession .
So it 's not surprising that the Treasury and Fed took very seriously any concerns about the Fannie - and - Freddie debt situation that were expressed by central bankers from around the world .
In an interview with The Washington Times , Council on Foreign Relations Geo-Economics Fellow Brad Setser said the federal bailout proposal is a remarkable development .
" I suspect this is the first case where foreign central banks exercised their leverage as creditors to push the U.S. government to make a policy decision that protected their interests , " said Setser , who has tracked rising foreign investment in Fannie , Freddie and other debt issued by U.S. agencies .
It 's certainly an odd development :
The bailout takes great pains to protect foreign investors – even though common shareholders will be wiped out .
However , the consequences of a default on the debt " would have been devastating , " former Treasury Secretary John Snow – Paulson 's predecessor – told the Washington - based daily newspaper .
" There is [ now ] relief around the world that the U.S. government is standing behind this paper ( debt ) , " Snow told The Times .
Two major China - based banks that together held $ 8 billion in Fannie and Freddie debt early this week lauded the U.S. government 's decision to back the debt issued by the two mortgage firms .
" We think this is good for Fannie and Freddie because the U.S. government used to be ' invisibly ' guaranteeing them , but now it is taking explicit action to [ tacitly ] guarantee them , " Wang Zhaowen , a spokesman for the Bank of China Ltd. , told CNNMoney.com .
Tine Olsen , an economist with Moody 's / Economy.com , wrote in a recent research note that because " the debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is now essentially backed by the U.S.
Treasury , holders no longer need to fear losing their investments .
A great sigh of relief will have reverberated through the markets in Asia when the U.S. Treasury injection of capital was announced . "
Such views of approval are by no means universal , however .
Capital to finance the bailout will have to come from somewhere , and that somewhere is from taxpayers ' wallets .
Estimates of the bailout 's cost to taxpayers range from $ 100 billion to $ 300 billion .
John Hussman , a fund manager and president of Hussman Econometrics Advisors – and a financial - sector expert I often cited as a news story source during my years as a business journalist – this week said that $ 250 billion was " a fairly conservative estimate . "
The problem , of course , is that the U.S. government has established what could be a costly and ill - advised precedent – the bailout .
First it was The Bear Stearns Cos. , now it 's Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and tomorrow it could be Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ( LEH ) .
And it 's not just the direct costs of the bailouts that are a cause for concern .
By backing the $ 5.2 trillion in Fannie / Freddie indebtedness , the United States has essentially doubled its public debt load .
That 's not just an idle worry , either .
Once privatized , even slimmed - down versions of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac wo n't be anywhere near as easy to package and sell - off as was busted investment bank Bear Stearns , which was bought out by JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) .
Some have actually warned that the U.S. government could end up being in the mortgage business – literally – for years .
The other option would have been to let Fannie and Freddie fail and to take the economic pain now – instead of spacing it out over a period of years , or even a decade .
In a recent interview with Money Morning , investing guru Jim Rogers warned that the U.S. government has no business being in the bailout business .
FreedomWorks , a conservative non-profit organization that 's based in Washington , characterized the Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac bailout as a deal by politicians that 's nothing more than a transfer of " possibly hundreds of billions of U.S. tax dollars to sophisticated investors and governments overseas . "
According to FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe , " the prospectus for every GSE bond clearly states that it is not backed by the United States government .
That 's why investors holding agency bonds already receive a significant risk premium over Treasuries … a bailout of GSE bondholders would be perhaps the greatest taxpayer rip - off in American history .
It is bad economics and you can be sure it is terrible politics . "

But that is about where his similarity with other Jewish settlers in the West Bank ends .
Among his close friends , the rabbi counts not only Mr. Arafat , who was reviled by most Israelis by the time of his death in 2004 , but also a wide array of Muslim sheiks .
He believes in making peace with his Palestinian neighbors and has engaged in “ thousands of hours ” of dialogue , he said , with Palestinian leaders , including Mr. Arafat ’s rivals in the militant Islamist group Hamas .
Rabbi Froman used to travel to Gaza for talks with Sheik Ahmed Yassin , the spiritual leader of Hamas who was killed in an Israeli missile strike in 2004 after his group spearheaded a years - long suicide bombing campaign that killed scores of Israelis .
The rabbi said he used to shout at the sheik and tell him , “ you will go to hell because you are taking Islam , a religion whose name has connotations of peace , and turning it into a religion of terror . ”
The sheik would reply that he was only defending himself , Rabbi Froman said .
He still maintains contact with figures in Hamas .
And while he clearly has no following among his fellow West Bank settlers , he has many acquaintances in the Israeli establishment and has direct access to several leaders , including President Shimon Peres and senior figures in the Defense Ministry .
LAST February , together with a Palestinian journalist from Hebron , he drafted a comprehensive truce agreement for Israel and Hamas that called for the release of Cpl. Gilad Shalit , who has been held for more than two years by the Islamist group in Gaza , in exchange for a substantial number of Palestinian fighters , and eventually , the release of all prisoners on both sides .
Biofuels have really taken a beating this year in the court of public opinion , as concerns mounted over the impact of biofuel production on everything from biodiversity to food prices to water supplies .
IEEE Spectrum reader Luc Rolland of Preston , England captured the sense of disillusionment in his letter to the editors this summer : “ Valuing biofuel is very controversial — it impoverishes developing countries , and the true energy cost of biofuel is not worth it . ”
But there are low - hanging fruit that respond to all of Rolland ’s concerns .
Today , at MIT ’s TechReview.com , I take a look at the biofuel that appears to hang the lowest : dimethyl ether produced via gasification of black liquor .
That ’s quite a mouthful , so let ’s define our terms :
black liquor : the blend of caustic inorganic chemicals and dissolved wood generated in pulp and paper mills
gasification : subjected to high heat and pressure , organic matter breaks down into a stream of principally hydrogen and carbon monoxide called syngas that can be catalytically reassembled into chemicals and fuels
dimethyl ether or DME : a clean - burning substitute for diesel fuel and liquid petroleum gas ( LPG ) that ’s easily synthesized from syngas
Note that this is very similar in principle to the synthesis of methanol via coal gasification .
In fact methanol is an intermediate in the synthesis of DME .
Production of both methanol and DME from coal is exploding in China , and provides substantial local air quality benefits .
Gasifying black liquor to generate DME , or bio-DME for short , adds ecological and climate benefits , which is why the European Renew study released in July called it one of “ the most advanced concepts for fuel production . ”
Net conversion efficiency on a lifecycle basis of 69 % , the highest for any biofuel , means that for every hectare of agricultural production this fuel delivers the biggest energy bang .
Greenhouse gas emissions , meanwhile , are on the order of 1/20th that of conventional diesel .
Bio-DME alone will not render personal transportation sustainable .
Gasification of all of the black liquor generated in US mills would supply enough DME to displace just 3 % of total fuel demand in the U.S. , according to Jonas Rudberg , CEO of Swedish biomass gasification developer Chemrec .
( For Canada , which has a higher pulp to car ratio , bio - DME could satisfy 7 % ) .
But bio-DME ’s potential looks much larger if one views it as a forerunner to broader application of gasification to solid biomass feedstocks such as switchgrass .
Solid biomass tends to gum up gasification plants , as Germany ’s Choren Industries may be learning as it seeks to start up the 18 million liter / year biomass - to - diesel plant it finished building in April .
Mass application of black liquor gasification would invariably accelerate the diffusion of the technology .
If it does , biomass gasification could deliver more than a fifth of Europe ’s transport fuel by 2030 according to Volvo Group , which is coordinating a European bio -DME R&D consortium .
Of course , how low all that fruit will hang remains to be seen .
For more on bio-DME , see the TechReview article : “ Taking Pulp to the Pump ” .

Chemilines workers are demanding decent pay and dignity at work ( Pic : Roger Cox )
Some 120 mostly Asian women workers mounted a mass picket this morning at the Chemilines pharmaceuticals factory in north west London on the first of three strike days over pay .
The workers – who are demanding a decent pay rise and the reinstatement of 25 colleagues who have been laid off – turned back several delivery vans including the Royal Mail .
There was a constant stream of car horns from people driving past the site .
The mood was lively and militant , with workers chanting , ' Chemilines are greedy !
Management are greedy !'
The strength of the strike clearly rattled the managers , who called the police to the picket line .
There was anger at the fact that managers tried to bring in temporary workers on the strike day .
' They had people laid off because they said there was n't enough work – but now they bring in temps , ' said one striker .
GMB union rep Hiten Vaidya told Socialist Worker that he was very pleased at the solidarity shown by drivers who refused to cross the picket line .
' As workers they are standing shoulder to shoulder with Chemilines workers , ' he said .
There will be another day of strike action on Monday of next week , 22 December , and a third on Wednesday 7 January .
Picket lines start at 8 am outside the Chemilines plant on Alperton Road , Wembley , Middlesex HA0 1DX .

I once had a post - doctoral fellow who , upon discovering we had grown up a quarter mile from each other in a small town in Pennsylvania , commented on our shared experience with , “ Well , you know what they say about Pennsylvania ?
There 's Philadelphia , there 's Pittsburgh , and there 's the state of Alabama in between . ”
That blunt assessment ( attributable to James Carville ) certainly resonated when I first read about the Kitzmiller et al. v. Dover Area School District case in late 2004 .
Dover , indeed , is a small town in south central Pennsylvania .
At that time , the Dover school board instructed 9th grade biology teachers to read a statement that evolution is only a theory for the origin of species and to proffer an alternate explanation called “ intelligent design ” ( ID ) .
Tammy Kitzmiller , the mother of two students in the Dover public schools , together with a number of other plaintiffs and assisted by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , sued the Dover school district for an injunction against the statement and use of materials in science class as a breach of the First Amendment of the US Constitution .
At the bench during this remarkable trial sat the Federal Judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania , the Honorable Judge John E. Jones , III ( see Image 1 ) .
Jones , a Republican and a Bush appointee , was assumed by many and feared by others to be inclined to rule for the defendants .
However , in a stunning Memorandum Opinion ( see http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf), Jones excoriated intelligent design , waxed eloquent about the meaning and practice of science , and , for the skeptics , restored faith in the fairness of the judicial system .
My call to the Judge 's chambers in request for an interview was answered in vivo by his assistant , who suggested simply e-mailing the Judge directly .
I did , and back came an immediate reply of “ Happy to do it . ”
On the appointed July day , in near 100 - degree heat , I drove from my father 's home in Pottstown along country roads through the corn-laden , cow - dotted agricultural landscape that I love .
But as I got closer to my destination , the state capital of Harrisburg , billboard outcroppings disrupted the fields ' quiet beauty with warnings such as , “ It 's your choice – heaven or hell . ”
It appeared that I had arrived at the crux of the matter .
Gitschier : I am very excited to meet you .
There are roughly three areas I want to talk to you about .
Jones :
Do my best .
Gitschier : One has to do with your background — your thinking about evolution , intelligent design , creationism — going into the trial , your experience during the trial , and then afterwards — how this might have changed you .
The second is to help me through the legal stuff .
I 'm not a lawyer and I 'm going to be writing this for an audience of geneticists .
The third is a shorter question — the ramifications of this decision on public education in the US .
So , let 's first cover a little background .
Jones : I 'm from Pottsville , PA , which is in the anthracite coal region of northeast central Pennsylvania .
And I was raised in Orwigsburg , a little town of about 2,000 not far from there .
It 's in an old industrial coal county .
I went to Dickinson College and Dickinson School of Law , and returned there to practice .
My family roots are very deep there .
It occurred to me that I 'd probably be able to start a successful law practice back there and I was , happily , right about that .
Gitschier : What kind of law did you practice ?
Jones : I was a general practitioner , which increasingly is a dinosaur .
I used to say that I was a half - an - inch deep and a half - mile wide .
I needed to know a little about a lot of different things .
I was the quintessential country lawyer .
Gitschier : So — wills , small disputes ?
Jones : Everything .
I did a lot of litigation .
I liked to go to court .
I became a lawyer because of the allure of the courtroom , not necessarily to be chained to an office desk .
Gitschier : I 'd like to deal with some of the legal stuff I do n't understand .
Kitzmiller was a suit .
What does that mean ?
I usually think of suing for money or restitution .
Jones :
That 's a very good question .
There is a statute , known as section 1983 , in the Federal Law , and in layman 's terms , it 's an enabling statute and it allows you to bring suit in federal court if you believe that a constitutional right has been violated .
And notably , in the context of the Dover case , it allows you to recover your fees and costs if you prevail .
When this suit was brought in December of 2004 , although the statute also allows you to seek money damages , that was not the request .
The request was for an injunction .
An injunction is a legal ruling that stops something , typically , from happening .
The plaintiffs asked for an injunction to stop the policy from being implemented in the first instance .
It was to be implemented in January of 2005 after it had been enacted in 2004 .
That 's why it was a bench trial , and not a jury trial , to anticipate a question you may have , because when you ask for an injunction , only a judge can grant an injunction .
Had they [ the plaintiffs ] asked for money damages , it would have been brought to a jury .
They were never interested , it appeared to me , in money damages .
They were interested in stopping the policy from being implemented .
That was their real goal throughout the litigation .
Gitschier :
You 're right , I was going to ask you about why this was a bench trial .
Jones : Everybody does .
Gitschier : Because the Scopes trial [ in 1925 ] was a jury trial .
Jones :
Well , that was a criminal prosecution .
John Scopes was prosecuted under a Tennessee statute , which had been little used , that prohibited the teaching of evolution .
Gitschier : Little used because nobody taught evolution in Tennessee back then !
Somebody put him up to it , did n't they ?
Jones :
As I read it , Scopes , who was certainly pro-evolution himself , was kind of dragged into the fray and set up to teach evolution with the understanding that he would be defended .
And the punishment that he was exposed to was essentially fines , so there was n't much risk to Scopes , and of course , the benefit to Scopes was that he would be the centerpiece of this spectacular trial .
The marked difference , for historical purposes , is that Clarence Darrow , who represented Scopes , wanted to inject some scientific testimony into the trial , and the trial judge would not allow that testimony .
So , it was really on the statute itself — did Scopes violate the statute itself ?
Gitschier : Which he did .
Jones :
He did .
And the most memorable moment , as you may recall , is when Darrow called his opposing council , William Jennings Bryan , as a witness .
That would never happen today .
Bryan did n't have to take the stand , even then , but filled with excessive hubris , he took the stand and was eviscerated and embarrassed by Darrow .
And the post - script was that Bryan died within a week of the trial .
Gitschier : I 'm having trouble figuring out why we keep having this battle about fundamentalist beliefs in our public schools .
I keep asking the question : Did n't we solve this problem already ?
Jones : No .
Gitschier :
And cutting to the chase , have we now solved the problem ?
Jones : No .
Gitschier : OK , so let 's talk through some of the background and figure out why not .
Jones : Scopes took place 80 years ago , and the matter was fairly dormant after that .
Gitschier : Why ?
Jones :
For decades afterwards , evolution was not substantially taught or taught at all .
Gitschier : In Tennessee or anywhere ?
Jones : Anywhere .
But by the '50s in the US , with Sputnik and the Cold War , there was a belief that we were falling drastically behind in science education and in other things , and you began to see a much more dedicated science component of education .
However , in certain pockets of the United States , particularly the South , there were anti-evolution statutes still on the books , and starting in the late 1960s , there was a progression of cases …
Gitschier : Starting with Epperson v. Arkansas ?
Jones : Well , Susan Epperson 's case .
Susan was a young biology teacher who was involved in a lawsuit that had to do with a law prohibiting the teaching of evolution .
It was the same thing as Scopes , but now we 're going to go after the statute itself .
And Susan , whom I 've met — a marvelous woman — was the prototypical plaintiff .
She was a person of faith .
She was young .
She was telegenic , articulate , and she agreed to be the plaintiff in that case , which went all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States .
The result of Epperson was that a law that banned the teaching of evolution is struck down .
Gitschier :
That law was in the State of Arkansas , and it was ruled that the Arkansas statute on the banning of teaching evolution was unconstitutional .
Did that immediately , though , translate to other state laws ?
Jones : Yes .
It did n't “ translate ” to other state laws , but the Supreme Court , the highest court in the land , had spoken .
Not per se ; it ruled on the statute it had before it .
But to the extent that other statutes were analogous to the Arkansas statute , the ruling meant that the wind had gone out of them .
You could n't enforce them .
Gitschier :
So did it mean that evolution was now taught in Alabama or Tennessee , for example ?
Jones : Not necessarily .
It was still up to the school board whether they wanted to teach it or not .
But then , what states did was this :
They said , “ OK fine , we understand that we can't prohibit the teaching of evolution , ” so they developed what has been called a “ balanced treatment ” statute , which said that if you are going to teach evolution , then you have to teach creationism next to it .
The states said , “ We must live with the Supreme Court 's decision in Epperson v. Arkansas , so now we 're going to try to figure a way around it and get the best deal we can .
We 'll hold our nose , we do n't like this , but if we 're going to teach evolution , we 're going to teach creationism at the same time , as an alternative to evolution . ”
You 've got a succession of cases , and I 'm not trying to be encyclopedic , but again the Court said , “ You 're not listening .
You can't teach creationism and call it what it is not . ”
Gitschier :
These were federal court rulings ?
Jones :
These were all federal court rulings because they deal with the Constitution .
Then following that was , “ How about this , we 'll have you teach ‘ creation science ’ . ”
And after drilling into that , the Court [ in Edwards v. Aguillard ] said , “ No , a studied examination of creation science indicates that it is nothing more than creationism labeled in a different way . ”
Gitschier :
So , once creationism or creation science is struck down in one case , then what happens to all the other places that teach creation science ?
Jones : Well , when the Supreme Court of the United States speaks , they can't do it .
The bottom line is that as that line of cases concluded , you knew that you could n't ban the teaching of evolution , you knew that you could n't pass a “ balanced treatment ” statute , and you knew that you could n't re-label creationism as creation science and have it pass constitutional muster .
Which then set the stage for intelligent design .
Gitschier : I read that you learned about this suit on the radio while driving home from work one day .
Jones : I was leaving this courthouse in Harrisburg , and I heard on the news from a local radio station that a very large lawsuit had been filed .
There was a press conference at the state capitol rotunda , right across the way , by the plaintiffs ' attorneys and that the suit was an establishment clause .
Gitschier :
When you say “ large , ” you do n't mean financially large .
Jones : Large , meaning impactful , notable , involving a big issue .
And lawyers for the plaintiffs , the ACLU and a firm from Philadelphia , Pepper Hamilton , and the plaintiffs all appeared in the capitol rotunda .
And they said that the suit had been filed in the Middle District of Pennsylvania , which is my district , and I 've joked since then that I had two thoughts then .
One , although I consider myself reasonably well - read , I could not remember hearing about ID before , so I really did n't know what it was .
And two , I wondered who would get the case .
And then forgot about it until I got into my Williamsport Chambers the following morning and looked at my new cases .
Gitschier : How many Middle District judges might have seen the case ?
Jones :
At the time there were five of us .
I got it by the luck of the draw .
It rotates in a sequence .
I 'd like to tell you it 's because I 'm so good , but it was just random .
Gitschier :
Tell us about your education for this case .
Although you had n't heard of ID , you likely had heard of creationism or creation science .
Had this been a field that you followed at all ?
Jones :
No , not other than popular culture .
When I went to law school in the late ' 70s , I followed the progression of cases that we talked about before .
I understood the general theme .
I 'd seen Inherit the Wind .
Gitschier :
So now it 's on your docket , and you must have been curious .
Did you Google intelligent design ?
Jones : No . I got what I needed in the context of the case .
And it was the monster on my docket .
To your question : I think laypersons apprehend that when we get a case , it 's incumbent upon us to go into an intensive study mode to learn everything about it .
Actually that is the wrong thing to do .
The analogy is that when I have a jury trial in front of me , I always instruct jurors , particularly in this day and age when you can Google anything , not to do that .
I do n't want you to do any research or investigation .
Everything you need to decide this case you 'll get within the corners of this courtroom .
So it is with me .
And I knew that by the time the case went to trial and during the trial , that I would get expert reports .
Gitschier : From whom ?
Jones : Everybody .
The way expert opinion works is that I get a summary of their testimony first , and that I can read in advance .
So I have a flavor for it .
So then the question is , why also have them testify ?
That is because they are subject to cross examination and everything they say may not hold up that well .
And , as it turned out , some of it did n't during the trial .
In any event , I was taken to school .
From the earliest point in the litigation to the time the briefs were filed , it was the equivalent of a degree in this area .
Folks who disagree with my opinion will tell you I never got it right , but I 'm confident that I did .
Go back to your last question .
It 's very critical .
I have to decide cases on the facts that are before me .
I can't decide a case based on my own opinion , gleaned from outside the courtroom .
That 's why I do n't engage in my own independent investigation .
If you look at other systems in other countries throughout the world , they do that .
But in our system of justice in the US , we let the parties try their cases and we find the facts from what is presented to us in the courtroom .
And the law , presumably we know and we apply the law .
That 's our job .
But the facts that we apply the law to are covered at that time .
Gitschier : I do n't know if you 're even allowed to answer this .
Before this case landed on your lap , did you have any thoughts about creationism or evolution , or the debate ?
Jones :
The precursor to my answer is that it does n't matter .
A judge could be an avowed creationist , but he 's got to rule based on the facts and the law .
In that event , he'd have to hold his nose and do his duty as a judge .
I am a person of faith .
I 'm certainly not an atheist or an agnostic and I see some divine force somewhere .
That said , having had a pretty good education , a great liberal arts education at Dickinson College , I must say that I never had any substantial doubts about evolution generally .
I had forgotten , admittedly , a lot of what I had learned about evolution back in college .
Moreover , a lot had happened since the ' 70s , so my understanding was rudimentary .
But I never had a crisis of confidence about evolution or a reason to doubt that it constituted a valid theory and good science .
Gitschier : Regarding the Memorandum Opinion itself , I found parts of it astonishing .
You used words like “ mendacity , ” “ sham , ” “ breath - taking inanity of the board 's decision . ”
Jones :
You should have been there .
Gitschier : I wish !
Going into this you are impartial .
What were some of the highlights ?
What were the transformational points in the trial that then allowed you to say , “ OK , I 'm going to rule this way ” ?
Jones : I do n't think there was an epiphany .
The very first witness for the plaintiffs was Ken Miller .
He is very invested in this issue .
He writes a textbook that is used substantially in high school biology classes throughout the country .
And I think it 's fair to say that the plaintiffs knew what they had in terms of their judge .
They knew that I was not a scientist , but hopefully that I had a reasonably good head on my shoulders , that they were going to need to take me to school .
So their first witness did just that .
I will always remember Ken Miller 's testimony in the sense that he did A–Z evolution .
And then got into intelligent design .
And having laid the foundation with the description of evolution , got into why intelligent design does n't work as science , to the point where it is predominantly a religious concept .
Gitschier :
Is the other side objecting all the time ?
Jones :
They can object to a question that is truly objectionable .
But there were n't a huge amount of objections .
I let both parties try their case .
They knew they'd have their turn .
Which gets me to the next point .
Another remarkable moment on the science side was Michael Behe , who was the lead witness for the defendants , and a very amiable fellow , as was Ken Miller , but unlike Miller , in my view , Professor Behe did not distinguish himself .
He did not hold up well on cross-examination .
So on the science side those were the two remarkable witnesses , although there were many expert witnesses in the field of theology , paleontology , biology , pedagogy .
Gitschier :
It 's almost like a command performance !
There 's no jury , it 's not televised .
All of these knowledgeable people …
Jones : Playing to an audience of one .
Which was fascinating .
In the realm of the lay witnesses , if you will , some of the school board witnesses were dreadful witnesses and hence the description “ breathtaking inanity ” and “ mendacity . ”
In my view , they clearly lied under oath .
They made a very poor account of themselves .
They could not explain why they did what they did .
They really did n't even know what intelligent design was .
It was quite clear to me that they viewed intelligent design as a method to get creationism into the public school classroom .
They were unfortunate and troublesome witnesses .
Simply remarkable , in that sense .
Gitschier : Did Miller talk about molecular evolution , DNA sequences , etc . ?
Jones :
To the extent that he needed to .
Gitschier : Because the evidence is amazing .
Jones :
It is stunning when you get into it .
Broadly , as the trial progressed , what was remarkable to me , as you go back — you well know this in your field — people called it Darwin 's theory of evolution .
Here 's Charles Darwin , who had not the benefit at all of genetics , and yet from my view , almost every subsequent discovery tends to bear out Darwin 's theory and has only made it stronger , including the field of genetics .
But Ken Miller went into the immune system , the blood clotting cascade , and the bacterial flagellum — all three are held out by intelligent design proponents as irreducibly complex , and in effect , having no precursors .
He [ Miller ] knocked that down , I thought , quite effectively — so comprehensively and so well .
By the time Miller was done testifying , over the span of a couple of days , the defendants were really already in the hole .
But I can't decide the case until I hear all the evidence , and I did n't .
Gitschier : I want to address a very specific part of your Memorandum Opinion , which is defining science .
What were you trying to do here ?
Jones :
First of all , both sides presented ample scientific testimony , and they asked me to decide that .
Gitschier : Both parties wanted you to address the question of what is science ?
Jones :
Well , not what is science , but whether intelligent design is science .
Why else would they have presented all those expert witnesses ?
Gitschier :
Do they explicitly say that ?
Jones :
Sure they do .
Gitschier : Is that part of the original suit ?
Jones :
Yes , part of the analysis — the second prong of the Lemon test and the collapsed endorsement test [ see Sidebar ( Box 1 ) ] — is the effect on the intended recipients .
My view , and I 'll always believe that I was right about this until somebody convinces me otherwise , is that if you 're going to measure the effect of a particular policy , in this case juxtaposing intelligent design with evolution , on the intended recipients , you have to delve into what the policy is about .
What was it about ?
It was about intelligent design .
And to try to determine the effect on the recipients you have to determine what does that concept or phrase stand for ?
Hence , we got into a search and examination of what exactly does ID say , what is its basis , what are its scientific bona fides or lack thereof .
That opens the door for a determination of whether ID is in fact science .
And that is what that part of the opinion was .
People should n't mischaracterize it and say that I am the arbiter of what science is broadly .
It 's not what I wrote about in the opinion .
I wrote about whether ID , as presented to me , in that courtroom from September to November of 2005 , was science , and I said it was not .
That it was the progeny , the successor to creationism and creation science .
That it was dressed - up creationism .
Gitschier : Nonetheless , you have captured the essence of science in your opinion .
Box 1 . Sidebar : The Judge Provides a Primer Gitschier :
There are a number of things in your Memorandum Opinion that I want you to flesh out for our readers .
One is the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment .
Second is the Lemon test and the prongs of the Lemon test .
And the third thing that I really was n't clear on was the endorsement test .
Jones :
Lot of lawyers are n't clear on that either ; it 's very complex .
The Establishment Clause as contained in the First Amendment , simply stated , says that Congress shall pass no law that , in effect , favors an established religion .
It 's been the subject of a great deal of debate .
Initially , in its inception , it was applicable only to Federal government , but with the Fourteenth Amendment , it was made applicable to the states , and hence , applicable to any governmental or quasi - governmental body including a school board .
So there is no debate that the school board was subject to strictures of the establishment clause of the First Amendment .
There is a vigorous debate that takes place , to this day , as to whether there is a wall of separation between church and state , as Thomas Jefferson opined .
That phrase does n't appear anywhere in the Constitution .
However , the Supreme Court of the United States has clearly set out , in its decisions over the past 60 years , that there is a wall , porous at times , but a wall nonetheless .
So the common theme of their decisions is that they are going to look with a high degree of scrutiny on government activity that seems to favor a particular religious concept .
Hence the line of cases we talked about before .
Now the devil is in the details , and so it then fell to the Justices to develop , as they typically do in cases like this , tests — overlays , if you will — that they put against the facts that are found by judges , so that the judges can decide whether a violation has occurred .
As you might expect , because every case is so intensively fact - specific , sometimes these tests are really hard to apply .
So the first test that the Court came up with is the Lemon test , Lemon v. Kurtzman [ another Pennsylvania case regarding the reimbursement of Catholic schools by the state superintendent of schools ] .
What came out of Lemon were three prongs that judges have to look at .
The first is : what is the purpose of the enactment ?
The second is : what is the effect of the enactment ?
And the third is : is there an excessive entanglement between religion and government ?
I 'll come back and be specific to my case [ in a minute ] .
As time went by , it was apparent that the Lemon test was somewhat difficult to apply in certain factual situations .
In particular it was found to be difficult to apply in cases where , for example , the Ten Commandments were bolted onto the side of a courthouse or government building .
So Former Justice Sandra Day O'Conner then penned the “ endorsement test . ”
The endorsement test , boiled down to its essence , takes the first two prongs — the purpose and the effect prongs — and collapses them together , and just makes it easier to apply , although it is always hard to judge these cases .
To go back to the Lemon test .
If the judge finds that the purpose is predominantly religious , you can stop ; you do n't have to go to the other prongs .
But if you find it 's OK , you can go to the effect prong — what is the effect on the intended recipients of the policy ?
How do they view it ?
If you find a violation there , you need n't go to the excessive entanglement prong .
In my case [ Kitzmiller ] , it failed the purpose prong , and the excessive entanglement prong was never at issue , by agreement of counsel on both sides .
But for the sake of completeness , because I had to believe that my decision would be appealed , I did the effect prong as well .
And I also did the endorsement test .
But the endorsement test is just a variation on the Lemon test , and is in some ways a duplication of the Lemon test , with a twist .
Jones :
Well , you could read it that way if you chose to .
What it does contain is something that you could utilize as a portable mechanism to look at other concepts and decide whether they were science .
But the question I decided was whether ID was science .
And you use tools like — is it testable ?
Is it peer reviewed ?
Is it generally accepted in the scientific community ?
And the answer to all three of those things is “ No . ”
Gitschier : Let 's talk about what happened downstream of this decision .
How will this change affect the landscape of education in the US ?
Jones :
The short answer is that I do n't know .
In the two and a half years since the opinion was released , no one has tried to teach ID in the US .
Remember , the opinion does n't have precedential effect outside of Pennsylvania .
In other words , I am a Federal District court with jurisdiction over this big middle of Pennsylvania , but I 'm not the Supreme Court of the United States .
So , it 's unlike the mandates from the Supreme Court that we were discussing earlier such as Epperson and Edwards .
Those are the final words for now , and everyone must adhere to them .
I suppose a school board in another state could still pass a law mandating the teaching of ID , and in fact some were considering doing so at the time of this trial , but later pulled them down .
But I do think that many consider my opinion persuasive , if not binding , and that 's why you have not seen these policies enacted .
Gitschier : Such as in Kansas ?
Jones : Such as in Kansas .
Kansas at that time was having [ state - wide ] school board elections .
And this became an issue in Kansas , and Kansans did not elect proponents of ID , utilizing my decision I think , saying that it was improvident to do this .
In Ohio , they had begun steps that would have allowed the teaching of ID , and the school board ruled the policy back because of my decision , not because they had to , but they thought it was persuasive .
Florida had a debate last year , into this year about changing some of their standards or adopting new standards of science , again citing my decision .
The hotbeds today — and this is re-emerging — Texas has a very strong desire to get into something like teaching intelligent design .
Louisiana just passed a stature that seems like it could be used as a vehicle for teaching ID .
This is speculation on my part — I do n't think that the concept of ID itself has a lot of vitality going forward .
The Dover trial discredited that thing that is ID .
To the extent that I follow it — I 'm curious about it , but it does n't go any further than that — the likely tack going forward is something like teach the controversy , talk about the alleged flaws and gaps in the theory of evolution and go to that place first .
They gave me the last word in “ Judgment Day ” [ a NOVA program on the trial ] and I said this is not something that will be settled in my time or even in my grandchildren 's lifetimes .
It 's an enduring , quintessentially American , dispute .
If you poll in the US today , you 'll find that approximately half of our fellow citizens believe in creationism and think that creationism ought to taught .
Gitschier : I had no idea !
Jones : Believe me .
Remember , the Dover School Board was comprised of young - earth creationists .
They believe that the Bible is the Word .
They either can't explain or like not to explain the evidence to the contrary .
Then there are the mixed - bag creationists — creationists who accept that the world is as old as it is but do n't accept evolutionary mechanism .
Gitschier : How has this trial changed your life ?
Both externally and in the way you think about the world .
Jones :
It 's changed my life forever .
You can't go through something like this that has such notoriety without being changed .
Federal Judges at any level lead quite cloistered existences , and I was thrust onto the stage in a way that I would never have thought possible .
And I have been speaking all around the US , but I do n't go and try to say what I did in the opinion .
What I developed was a passion for the concept known as “ judicial independence , ” meaning that concomitantly with the science education issue that I just raised , I do n't think Americans understand how judges operate .
I had a lot of criticism after this decision ; a lot , I think , was born out of ignorance about how we do things .
People did n't understand there was a Lemon test or an Endorsement test .
People thought I made this up as I went along .
They think judges rule according to their own philosophical biases or predilections .
I thought it was incumbent upon me to get out and talk about that and say , “ Well , you do n't quite have this right , ” and I 've been very well received across the country .
But from the NOVA show to the now four books that have been written about the case , to being on the cover of Time magazine , for someone born and raised in a town of 2,000 in upstate PA — all this is fairly miraculous stuff that I never thought I would do .
So , it certainly has changed the fabric of my life , that I have had this interval .
It will die down , I know .
When I take my last breath and they publish my obituary , the first line will say that I presided over the intelligent design trial .
I can't top this , I do n't think , and I 'm fine with that , if this is what I 'm remembered for .
I 'm proud of what I did .
I thought I discharged my obligations and my duties well .
Going forward , has it made me more curious about the issue ?
Yes , and I think I 'll always have that enduring curiosity .

type animation_op = ParticleTrans .
transformation * float * ( Transition . trans * Transition . ease )
type camera_op_list = ( camera_op list ) * float * ( trans * ease )
The float value is the total number of frames the animation will use .
The ( trans \* ease ) value allows you to customize different type of transitions , from Linear , None to Quad , EaseInOut .
More information about this is in the camera_model post .
ParticleTrans.transformation is a function that applies a transformation to a frame .
You can define custom functions in that module and then apply them to the visualization .
I only defined a couple of functions , but you can define any other animation you like .
You just have to define a function that receives a frame as input and returns a frame as output .
The interface for ParticleTrans is : type transformation = | Idle | Project of float * float * float | Random val idle : ' a -& gt ; ' a val project : transformation -& gt ; VertexType .
depth_vertex list -& gt ; VertexType .
depth_vertex list val random : VertexType .

A while ago Radiohead published their House of Cards video data in form of CSV files .
Each CSV file contains information about the 3D position of the points for each frame .
I wrote a couple of previous posts that covered how to render and save that data with OpenGL and OCaml and also how to customize camera movement in OpenGL .
This post shows how to customize particle animations for Radiohead 's House of Cards video .
A proof of concept for camera movement + particle animation is shown in this youtube video :
If you want to generate the video , you have to download Radiohead 's HoC music video data here .
Also , you can download the source code for this project here .
This small project is organized in a way that is easy to add new features , camera animations and particle transformations in order to easily code new videos with different effects using the HoC data .
Radiohead 's HoC data is a set of CSV files .
Those files are rendered in OpenGL with OCaml and then saved in bmp or jpeg files to be merged into a video using ffmpeg .
If you want to know more about this you should probably read part 1 of this " trilogy " .
The Camera Model class allows you to make custom camera movements that can be handled and defined in a Timeline object in the main .ml file .
If you like to know more about this , you can read part 2 of this " trilogy " .
This last post shows how to customize particle interpolation and movement by using the Particle Model class , the ParticleTrans module and the Timeline object .
The particle_model class handles particle animations .
Somewhat like the camera class , particle_model stores the initial frame and the last frame along with some extra information about the timing of the animation .
The particle_model then performs an interpolation from the initial_frame to the last_frame , rendering the state of the transformation in the draw function .
A possible interface for the particle model could be something like this : Particle animations have a special type , that ressembles the camera model transition type .
This type is defined as follows : Just to make a comparison , the camera model transition type is :
This type can be divided into three main parts :
The timeline object ( described in the previous post ) holds information about the camera and particle transformations beeing applied at each stage of the animation .
This class - less object is defined in the main .ml file and looks like this :
The particle_timeline and camera_timeline variables hold the transformations to be performed at different stages of the animation .
You can download the project here .
You can compile the project by typing :
Any comment about the Video or the OpenGL / OCaml implementation is very welcome !
All music genres go through a very similar life cycle : birth , growth , mainstream acceptance , decline , and finally obscurity .
With black music , however , the final stage is never reached because white people are work tirelessly to keep it alive .
Apparently , once a music has lost its relevance with its intended audience , it becomes MORE relevant to white people .
Historically speaking , the music that white people have kept on life support for the longest period of time is Jazz .
Thanks largely to public radio , bookstores , and coffee shops , Jazz has carved out a niche in white culture that is not yet ready to be replaced by Indie Rock .
But the biggest role that Jazz plays in white culture is in the white fantasy of leisure .
All white people believe that they prefer listening to jazz over watching television .
This is not true .
Every few a months , a white person will put on some Jazz and pour themselves a glass of wine or scotch and tell themselves how nice it is .
Then they will get bored and watch television or write emails to other white people about how nice it was to listen to Jazz at home .
“ Last night , I poured myself a glass of Shiraz and put Charlie Parker on the Bose .
It was so relaxing , I wish I had a fireplace . ”
Listing this activity as one of your favorites is a sure fire way to make progress towards a romantic relationship with a white person .
Along with Jazz , white people have also taken quite a shine to The Blues , an art form that captured the pain of the black experience in America .
Then , in the 1960s , a bunch of British bands started to play their own version of the music and white people have been loving it ever since .
It makes sense considering that the British were the ones who created The Blues in the 17th Century .
Today , white people keep
The Blues going strong by taking vacations to Memphis , forming awkward bands , making documentaries , and organizing folk festivals .
Blue and Jazz music appeal mostly to older white people and select few young ones who probably wear fedoras .
But that does n’t mean that young white people are n’t working hard to preserve music that has lost relevance .
No , there are literally thousands of white people who are giving their all to keep old school Hip Hop alive .
Even as you read this , white people are telling other white people about the golden age of Hip Hop that they experienced in a suburban high school or through a viewing of The Wackness .
If you are good at concealing laughter and contempt , you should ask a white person about “ Real Hip Hop . ”
They will quickly tell you about how they do n’t listen to “ Commercial Hip Hop ” ( aka music that black people actually enjoy ) , and that they much prefer “ Classic Hip Hop . ”
“ I do n’t listen to that commercial stuff .
I ’m more into the Real Hip Hop , you know ?
KRS One , Del Tha Funkee Homosapien , De La Soul , Wu Tang , you know , The Old School . ”
Calling this style of music ‘ old school ’ is considered an especially apt name since the majority of people who listen to it did so while attending old schools such as Dartmouth , Bard , and Williams College .
What it all comes down to is that white people are convinced that if they were alive when this music was relevant that they would have been into it .
They would have been Alan Lomax or Rick Rubin .
Now the best they can hope for is to impress an older black person with their knowledge .

The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has put out a report from Madagascar saying along the coasts , there has been a dramatic decrease in all marine life due to excessive demand of shark fin and sea cucumbers from China .
According to the report , sea cucumbers have disappeared , octopus populations have been severely impacted , many fish species have simply disappeared , and shark populations have been severely effected as natives slaughter every shark they can find to feed the lucrative shark fin market .
[ social_buttons ]
The coral reef system along Madagascar ’s southwestern coast is one of the largest in the world and every month these reefs become more barren .
Local fishermen say they are so poor that they cannot stop fishing , yet they will be forced to stop once there is nothing left .
The decline of the predator could unbalance the entire marine food chain .
Studies in the Caribbean have shown that too few sharks mean other carnivorous species increase and eat too many other useful fish , which can endanger the entire reef ecosystem .
Madagascar has a long way to go in protecting its marine resources .
“ These fishermen are poor and the attraction of fishing for sharks and sea cucumbers is huge , ” said Man Wai Rabenevanana , director of the Institute of Marine Science in Toliara .
“ If we truly want to protect our resources we must address the market .
We must do more to discourage the Chinese from eating shark fin soup ; perhaps we can even find an alternative . ”
Demand for shark fin in China , where the meat is considered a delicacy , and for sea cucumbers , which are believed to be an aphrodisiac , have become major sources of income in Madagascar , which exports up to 20 tons of shark fins every year .
Alibaba Seafoods , the company owned by Yahoo is one of the leading corporations responsible for diminishing shark populations .
“ It ’s a strange world , where an internet company like Yahoo is responsible for the destruction of the world ’s shark populations , ” said Captain Paul Watson .

This one I actually caught myself thinking several times throughout the week ( thanks to NaNo ) : Of course I will !
According to the list of things I feel that I will be able to accomplish during the weekend , mine last about , I dunno , three months or so . ;)
It 's all part of the thrill of working from home .
Only I have n't been lately .
I 've been doing some onsite work for some clients .
Onsite as in " not at home in pyjamas , able to work on whatever I want , when I want . "
Onsite as in " they expect me to focus on the tasks at hand while I 'm here between 9 and 5 .
" Sometimes I forget , since I 'm used to taking breaks at the home office .
Sometimes they last for a day or two ... And that 's frowned upon in those corporate - type offices .
You know , the ones with supervisors in them .
So I 've been struggling with getting words on the page for my current WIP so that I can hit 50,000 words by the end of the month , struggling with reworking another manuscript 's synopsis so it kind of resembles the revised novel and struggling to simply get stuff done , like laundry and meal preparation .
DH is a saint and can do the laundry , but his kitchen skills are limited to soup or breakfast foods .
A woman cannot live on waffles and noodles forever , no matter how tempting .
To combat this " save it for the weekend " mentality , I 'll break a task down into smaller steps , and then promise myself to tackle at least one step before I can postpone the rest of it until I have another spare moment .
This tactic normally works for me , since , to make it easy on myself , I 'll break something down into so many steps , each one only takes about five minutes .
Then I 'll end up doing two or three steps , and soon enough , I 'll just plow through the whole darn thing , just to get it off my list .
Of course , when facing 50,000 words , I 've broken it down into 250 - word allotments .
I only have to do that 200 times ( actually , it 's only 184 now ) before the end of the month .
It 's totally doable , just like the commercial - break squats I try to remember to do while watching TV instead of going to the gym .
Ugh , I 'll have to make up for that on the weekend . ;)

Israel is increasingly worried about the threat of a nuclear , missile - equipped Iran .
So the Israeli military is working on " a high - fly­ing , long - endurance unmanned in­frared sensor " that can tell the difference between " nuclear war­heads amid doz­ens of decoys sent to confound na­tional missile defenses , " Defense News ' Barbara Opall - Rome reports .
" If implemented , the Israeli program will mark the first use of an unmanned platform for [ n ] uclear warhead hunting . "
A prototype of the long - range , high - resolution target - discrimination sensor has already been tested aboard a business jet under a closely held Israeli - German program called Bluebird ...
[ D]etails about the demonstrator remain classified ...
“ There ’s nothing comparable .
Air­borne versions have been used as research tools , but nothing has ever been integrated into an active na­tional defense sensor network ...
Certainly , there ’s never been any­thing like this mounted on a UAV [ unmanned aerial vehicle ] , ” an international industry consultant said .
The U.S. military experimented with putting infrared sensors on a Boeing 767 , an effort called the Air­borne Optical Adjunct .
It was quietly killed in the 1990s as the Pentagon sought to move all its missile defense sensors to space .
Picking out a war­head from sophisticated decoys is " if not the most challenging , one of the most challenging problems that missile defense people are working , " GlobalSecurity.org director John Pike tells * * Defense News .
But it 's not impossible .
* He point­ed to the U.S. Navy ’s Cooperative Engagement Capability program , which overcame initial bugs and now allows Aegis cruisers to co­ordinate their radar tracks into an integrated picture of incoming missiles . *

The attack on the EU office earlier this month caused no casualties
A Kosovan judge has ordered three Germans suspected of throwing an explosive device at the EU headquarters in Pristina to be held for 30 days .
The three reportedly deny involvement in the attack on 14 November , saying they were detained while investigating it themselves .
Windows in the glass - fronted building were shattered but nobody was hurt .
German and Kosovo media report that the men are German intelligence agents but officials in Berlin refuse to comment .

The German weekly Der Spiegel said the men worked for the German intelligence agency BND , and that they told investigators they had been examining the scene of the explosion , but had not been involved in it .
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in February after nine years under UN stewardship and is recognised by more than 50 countries , including Germany .
Four days before the bomb attack , Kosovo 's Albanian majority rejected an agreement between the UN and Serbia on the deployment of the much - delayed EU police and justice mission Eulex .

The same could now be said for the hapless 43rd President of the United States as the daylight draws mercifully in on his reign of misfortune and calamity .
How is he bearing up , one wonders , as the candidate from his own party treats him as the carrier of some sort of infectious political disease ?
How telling was it that the most impassioned moment in John McCain 's performance in the final debate was when he declared : " I am not George Bush . "
Where , O where are you , Dubya , as the action passes you by like a jet skirting dirty weather ?
Are you roaming the lonely corridors of the White House in search of a friendly shoulder around which to clap your affable arm ?
Are you sweating it out on the treadmill , hurt and confused as to why the man everyone wanted to have a beer ( or Coke ) with , who swept to re-election four years ago , has been downgraded to all - time loser in presidential history , stuck there in the bush leagues along with the likes of James Buchanan and Warren Harding ?
Or are you whacking brush in Crawford , where the locals now make a point of telling visitors that George W never really was from hereabouts anyroad .
Whatever else his legacy , the man who called himself " the decider " has left some gripping history .
The last eight years have been so rich in epic imperial hubris that it would take a reborn Gibbon to do justice to the fall .
It should be said right away that amid the landscape of smoking craters there are one or two sprigs of decency that have been planted : record amounts of financial help given to Aids - blighted countries of Africa ; immigration reform that would have offered an amnesty to illegals and given them a secure path to citizenship , had not those efforts hit the reef of intransigence in Bush 's own party .
And no one can argue with the fact that since 9/11 the United States has not been attacked on its home territory by jihadi terrorists ; though whether or not that security is more illusory than real is , to put it mildly , open to debate .
Bet against that there is the matter of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian casualties , more than 4,000 American troops dead , many times that gravely injured , not to mention the puncture wounds and mutilations inflicted on internationally agreed standards of humane conduct for prisoners - and on the protection of domestic liberties enshrined in the American constitution .
If the Statue of Liberty were alive , she would be weeping tears of blood .
If Bush himself has been largely kept out of sight , his baleful legacy has been visible in the McCain campaign .
McCain has made much of his credentials for independence of mind , a claim which once was credible given his support for immigration reform and opposition to Bush 's tax cuts .
But somewhere along the road to the Republican nomination , all of this became less important than the lessons of the Reagan - Bush - Rove political playbook which , with the exception of the Clinton election of 1992 , seemed to have a track record of unbroken success .
McCain knew this from bitter personal experience , having been on the receiving end of Bush lowball politics in the South Carolina primary in 2000 .
Coming out of a convincing win against George Bush in New Hampshire he was stopped in his tracks by a smear campaign conducted through push - poll phone calls in which people were asked whether they knew that the daughter McCain had adopted from Sri Lanka was in fact the illegitimate child of an affair with a woman of colour .
Now you would think McCain could never reconcile himself to a politician capable of those kinds of tactics .
But there he was in the campaign of 2004 , stumping the country for the incumbent , ingratiating himself with the conservative base he knew he would need , even as his old Vietnam buddy , John Kerry , was being coated in slime by the Swift Boaters .
Whatever misgivings McCain might have had about adopting the hardball tactics of his 2000 adversary have long since disappeared before the blandishments of classic Bush - style operatives like Rick Davis and Stephen Schmidt .
" Do you want to be pure , or do you want to win " ?
they must have asked right after the nomination .
Ditching Joe Lieberman as a running mate and unleashing pitbull Palin was his answer .
So even while George Bush is kept at arm 's length from the campaign , his campaign style lives on as Obama is stigmatised as a terrorist - friendly stealth - socialist , too deeply unAmerican to be let anywhere near the Oval Office .
" He just does n't see America as we do " says Sarah Palin trying to wink her way into Dick Cheney 's seat .
McCain is betting the house that this way of doing politics has at least one more hurrah left in it , and we will find out on in the early hours of Wednesday morning whether he is right .
The Bush presidency is the spectre haunting the feast in more than tactics .
Although every conservative administration since Ronald Reagan has promised to deliver , through supply - side stimulation , economic growth without bloated deficits , they have never been vindicated in their blind faith in what Bush senior once rashly called " voodoo economics " .
Consistently , they have brought the US Wall Street crashes and recessions along with massive deficits ; and yet somehow , the stake that history attempts to drive through the heart of their economic theology never puts the ghoul away .
No weight of evidence to the contrary has ever shaken the totemic belief that tax cuts can grow the economy robustly enough to compensate for drastic shortfalls in revenue .
George W Bush clung to this belief even as the Clinton budget surplus was converted into a mountainous deficit , and John McCain continues to parrot the same belief with the shining face of a true believer .
Not even Gibbon could supply a story as fatefully bizarre as the ultimate consummation of Reagan - Bush conservatism , its last act : the most massive shift of financial power from the private to the public sector since the New Deal .
Rather like the Pope deciding that all along he really wanted a barmitzvah .
If you look at this saga as the history of a dynasty ; it 's come full circle .
For , believe it or not , there once was a time when Bush politics was about centrist moderation .
Dubya 's revered granddad , Prescott Sheldon Bush , son of an Ohio railroad executive and senator for Connecticut from 1952 to 1963 , was punished in the Catholic towns of industrial Connecticut for his connection with Planned Parenthood .
Not only that , but he was a trustee of the United Negro College Fund , the kind of institution that made the eventual career of Barack Obama conceivable .
But the Bushes have always been selective about idealism .
And even at the height of the Kennedy - Johnson apogee , Prescott and George Herbert Walker Bush were turning the pages of Barry Goldwater 's Conscience of a Conservative .
They could smell the wind direction changing .
The future of Republican money and Republican power lay elsewhere ; with Texas oil .
Hence the migration to Midland Texas of George Herbert Walker Bush and his makeover into a Texan who knew the ways of the corporate world ; and how to bring about the Great Cosiness between government and business that seemed like the perfect feedback loop : money to power , power to money ; tax breaks for the corporations ; donations to those who might command the heights .
This is the politics George W Bush inherited , and he has been its faithful disciple ; to the point of purging it of any remaining traces of pragmatism .
It is astounding to hear rightwing talkshow bloviators rant about the predicament of the Bush administration being caused by its failure to carry out the true conservative agenda .
For there never has been and never will be a more doctrinally faithful instrument of the creed .
Never mind the hanging chads of 2000 , the Cheney - Bush administration seized the moment to bring on the Goldwater - Reagan Rapture in which government was once and for all got out of the way of business .
So it has n't really been all George Bush 's fault , the stupendous American fiasco .
He came to power armed with an ideology that was about to crash and burn ; that was , years before the present tumult , already fatally disconnected from historical reality .
It was on his watch that American government needed reinventing .
It was responsible government that was needed in Iraq and Afghanistan ; government that was desperately needed in New Orleans after Katrina , while all George Bush could manage was a fly - by .
It is government that this most anti-governmental of all American administrations is learning that is needed now to save the United States from a second Depression .
In his heart of hearts I actually think the shell - shocked Dubya , somewhere in the bowels of his presidency knows this .
But he is nowhere to be found , and so on goes the mad rant that health care reform and progressive taxes are the Trojan horse for socialist revolution .
To which those who have another view altogether might want to say , fear not , for yours , as a Republican president once said , is a government of the people , by the people .
And really it will not perish from the earth .

We know that Barack Obama and his allies identify themselves as " progressives , " and that they aim to implement the big - government liberalism that originated in America 's Progressive Era and was consummated in the New Deal .
What remains a mystery is why some conservatives want to claim this progressive identity as their own -- particularly as it was manifested by Theodore Roosevelt .
The fact that conservative politicians such as John McCain and writers like William Kristol and Karl Rove are attracted to our 26th president is strange because , if we want to understand where in the American political tradition the idea of unlimited , redistributive government came from , we need look no further than to Roosevelt and others who shared his outlook .
Progressives of both parties , including Roosevelt , were the original big - government liberals .
They understood full well that the greatest obstacle to their schemes of social justice and equality of material condition was the U.S. Constitution as it was originally written and understood : as creating a national government of limited , enumerated powers that was dedicated to securing the individual natural rights of its citizens , especially liberty of contract and private property .
It was the Republican TR , who insisted in his 1910 speech on the " New Nationalism " that there was a " general right of the community to regulate " the earning of income and use of private property " to whatever degree the public welfare may require it . "
He was at one here with Democrat Woodrow Wilson , who had in 1885 condemned Americans ' respect for their Constitution as " blind worship , " and suggested that his countrymen dedicate themselves to the Declaration of Independence by leaving out its " preface " -- i.e. , the part of it that establishes the protection of equal natural rights as the permanent task of government .
In his " Autobiography , " Roosevelt wrote that he " declined to adopt the view that what was imperatively necessary for the nation could not be done by the President unless he could find some specific authorization to do it . "
The national government , in TR 's view , was not one of enumerated powers but of general powers , and the purpose of the Constitution was merely to state the narrow exceptions to that rule .

December 22 , 2008
The unknown cost of economic stimulus is somewhere down the unmeasured road , while stimulus 's close cousin , public works , would appear to be the next Keynesian cluster bomb to be fired at the yet defiant real world .
Illusion enablement aside , a public works infrastructure concept is a modest improvement over naked stimulus .
In public works there 's at least tangential acknowledgement that it may be a good idea to have some sort of output -- contrasted with stimulus which has an even closer cousin , the broken window fallacy .
Public works has a more hopeful sound .
Stimulus could be just a giveaway to Wall Street .
Public works is stuff ' concrete and steel .
If Wall Street is going to get hold of public works money , at least they 'll have to work to come up with a twisted scam - - it wo n't be just ' injected ' onto their balance sheets .
But if we can't keep that concept of output always uppermost -- and the evidence so far is that we can 't -- the happy , hopeful sound of public works will be another money pit .
The base assumption is already glib -- that public works are just something the government does in tough times ( and easy times and medium times ) , to create jobs , stimulate the economy , build infrastructure and give people hope .
But what are we talking about ?
It 's not like we can put together teams of unemployed stock analysts and drywallers and send them off to build bridges .
Subtleties like this can get lost in politics , but bridges , I 'd point out , are best built by those who know how to build them .
Most such people are not hanging around the doughnut shop waiting for Congress 's call -- they 're out there now , building and repairing bridges at the rate society had previously chosen .
Stomping on a bridge building accelerator will have a lot of slippage -- as for example , when a previously active engineer is lured away to teach due to an accelerated demand for new engineers .
If there 's a big ramp up , someday there will be a ramp down .
Some of the ' created ' jobs will be uncreated , and ripple effects will cause other loss .
( And we should n't get too excited that only some of the created jobs will be lost .
We can't know if it 's a gain over jobs that would have been created by some other plan , or by no plan .
However , the more splashy and political a job creation plan becomes , the less probable the sustainability becomes . )
A subtle ramping up in infrastructure is n't going to be the payoff that politicians will be looking for .
They 'll want a voter attention grabbing splash .
The reaction in politics to a slower than wishful expectations infrastructure start will be to stomp on the accelerator even harder .
( Hopefully in the case of bridge building , we wo n't get the splash literally . )
New projects have an unfortunate high profile over repairs and maintenance .
It seems rather muddled to consider ourselves caroholics and in need of more road infrastructure at the same time , but contradictory rationalizations are becoming an American specialty .
Thinking about interest groups now fine tuning their ' infrastructure ' proposals is frightening .
Congress appears to be at least as confused as anyone else .
And we can always be sure that whoever they decide to listen to , it will be based not on common sense persuasion , but on political connectedness and popularity .
Robert Poole in a Wall Street Journal piece , ' Stimulus Should n't Be an Excuse for Pork ' , focused on U.S. Conference of Mayors requests , and concluded that , ' It is clear that any infrastructure stimulus money given to the country 's mayors will lead to thousands of tennis centers to nowhere . '
Other advocates , public and private , are n't going to have any more trouble than the mayors in seeing their porkish proposals as ' infrastructure ' and ' job creation . '
That tradition -- incorrectly considering pork spending as if it 's economically additive , has moved from the realm of the disgusting to the dangerous .
( Especially if all those tennis courts distract us from the study of safe , proper food rioting techniques . )
Consequences for off the charts government spending and borrowing are somewhere between uncertain , and certainly bad -- so justifiability for public works projects on their own merit , ex any consideration of ' stimulus ' or ' job creation ' , should be a bare minimum for any infrastructure proposal .
Bush shoe-ing worst Arab insult Thousands of Iraqis have demanded the release of a local TV reporter who threw his shoes at US President George W Bush at a Baghdad news conference .
Crowds gathered in Baghdad 's Sadr City district , calling for " hero " Muntadar al - Zaidi to be freed from custody .
Officials at the Iraqi - owned TV station , al - Baghdadiya , called for the release of their journalist , saying he was exercising freedom of expression .
Iraqi officials have described the incident as shameful .
A statement released by the government said Mr Zaidi 's actions , which also included him shouting insults at President Bush , " harmed the reputation of Iraqi journalists and Iraqi journalism in general " .
Correspondents say the protesters are supporters of Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr - a leading critic of the US presence in Iraq .
Smaller protests were reported in Basra and Najaf .

The Iraqi government has demanded an on - air apology from his employer .
An Iraqi official was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that the journalist was being interrogated to determine whether anybody paid him to throw his shoes at President Bush .
He was also being tested for alcohol and drugs , and his shoes were being held as evidence , said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The Cairo - based al - Baghdadiya TV channel said Mr Zaidi should be freed because he had been exercising freedom of expression - something which the Americans had promised to Iraqis on the ousting of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein .
He [ George Bush ] deserves to be hit with 100 , not just one or two shoes .
Who wants him to come here ?
A Baghdad resident " Any measures against Muntadar will be considered the acts of a dictatorial regime , " the firm said in a statement .
The programming director for al - Baghdadiya , Muzhir al - Khafaji , described the journalist as a " proud Arab and an open - minded man " .
He said he was afraid for Mr Zaidi 's safety , adding that the reporter had been arrested by US officials twice before .
" We fear that our correspondents in Iraq will be arrested .
We have 200 correspondents there , " he added .
' Proud Arab '
Mr Zaidi leapt from his chair at Sunday 's news conference and hurled first one shoe and then the other at Mr Bush , who was joined at the podium by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki .
Mr al - Zaidi said his actions were for Iraqi widows and orphans
The shoes missed as Mr Bush ducked , and Mr Zaidi was immediately wrestled to the ground by security guards and frogmarched from the room .
" This is a farewell kiss , you dog , " he yelled in Arabic as he threw his shoes .
" This is from the widows , the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq . "
Arabic TV stations have been repeatedly showing footage of the incident , which was also front - page news in many papers .
Correspondents say the journalist 's tirade was echoed by Arabs across the Middle East who are fed up with US policy in the region .
" He [ George Bush ] deserves to be hit with 100 , not just one or two shoes .
Who wants him to come here ? " said a man in Baghdad .
But his view was not expressed by everyone .
" I think this incident is unnecessary , to be honest .
That was a press conference , not a war .
If someone wants to express his opinion he should do so in the proper manner , not this way , " said another Baghdad resident .
Courts criticised Also on Monday , Human Rights Watch accused Iraq 's main criminal court of failing to meet basic international standards of justice .
The New York - based group said torture and abuse of prisoners before trial appeared common , and legal representation was often ineffectual .
Human Rights
Watch said some of the court 's failings showed disturbing similarities to those that existed during the Saddam Hussein era .
The group called on Iraq to take immediate steps to protect detainees from torture , and ensure they had access to proper defence and received a prompt hearing .

Muxlim 's online world reaches from prayer mat to shopping centre
A trial version of the first virtual world aimed at the Muslim community has been launched .
Called Muxlim Pal , it allows Muslims to look after a cartoon avatar that inhabits the virtual world .
Based loosely on other virtual worlds such as The Sims , Muxlim Pal lets members customise the look of their avatar and its private room .
Aimed at Muslims in Western nations , Muxlim Pal 's creators hope it will also foster understanding among non-Muslims .
" We are not a religious site , we are a site that is focused on the lifestyle , " said Mohamed El - Fatatry , founder of Muxlim.com - the parent site of Muxlim Pal .
" This is for anyone who is remotely interested in the Muslim culture and the Muslim lifestyle , " he said .
" From what we have seen from our market research is that most Muslims have a lifestyle that is not so different from everybody else , " he said .
" They all share the core values which are from Islam then beyond that they actually have made identities , they have many interests . "
Mr El - Fatatry said Muxlim.com had 26 different categories of content , only one of which was religion .
He said he hoped it would help Muslims meet and talk to others that shared their interests .
This is nowhere near the vision of where it will be someday
Mohamed El - Fatatry , Muxlim.com
Those joining the site will get to control the life of a cartoonish avatar or pal that they can then use as a proxy to explore the Muxlim Pal virtual world - which has a beach bar , arena and shopping areas .
Character development
The pal or avatar that members control has several " meters " governing its happiness , fitness , knowledge and spirituality that change when the character carries out tasks in the social world .
" How it differs from The Sims is that it is social , " said Mr El - Fatatry .
" So you can actually be with other people at the same time , interact , and see what their characters are doing . "
The browser - based virtual world can be used for free but alongside will go some premium services that will help users do more with their avatar and personal room .
Those joining Muxlim
Pal get a few virtual coins to spend in the online world 's shops - to clothe their avatar or decorate their room .
Real cash can be used to buy more virtual coins .
So far no exchange rates have been given for swapping real for virtual coins .
The site hopes to foster understanding among Muslims and non-Muslims alike Mr El - Fatatry said the impetus to create Muxlim Pal grew out of observing what Muxlim.com 's 1.5 m monthly users spent most time on .
He said : " We were seeing that our users were enjoying certain character developing elements of Muxlim.com , and as no other virtual world offers a family - friendly environment for our community , we felt there was a need to cater for the people who were being left out . "
Mr El - Fatatry said because the trial version was only six months old it was likely to change significantly before the public launch in 2009 .
Muxlim was investigating whether members want to be able to create their own content , such as chairs or clothes , and be able to share those with other users .
" This is nowhere near the vision of where it will be someday , " he said .
" It is very important to put things out and listen to how people interact with it .
What feedback they give us and then that will play a big role in which direction we take the product in . "

Blu - Ray Players get benchmarked : PS3 smokes em ’ All !
If I keep coming on PS3 superiority on handling Blu-ray materials , I might get flamed with fanboyism .
May be it is better if I state the opposite first .
Why PS3 is not a good standalone ?
PS3 is loud , the noise tops my projector runs at high beam mode .
Bluetooth remote sucks , additional IR dongle requires to add PS3 on Universal remote control .
Hardware constraints ; no multichannel audio support on analog output , advanced audio codec limits on LPCM though HDMI .
Last but certainly not least , it ’s awfully ugly !
But truth hurts ; we ’ve seen how PS3 leads loading time in a small group test , here ’s another victory for PS3 fans – An exclusive Blu-ray player benchmark test from Blu-ray.com –
The dreadful beast once again crowns the best in system booting , disc loading and operation .
It is not only stands out among 12 Blu-ray players in test , but performance trumps contestants in Blu-ray Disc Java department by a large margin .
No surprise there , the results reflect the superiority of cell power processing in comparing with hardware - based units .
The best - equipped standalone can’t even come close to the level of PS3 achieved ; on the other hand , user has to deal with cooling noise works against the excessive heat resulting from the cell processor .
Test in question did n’t cover audio quality or image reproduction in legacy DVD upscaling or blu - ray disc , but unit ’s ability to handle intensive Java content and interactive menu .
You can visit Blu-ray.com to see more information on how the test was conducted and categorized .
While watching the Capitals game tonight , a 5 - 1 trouncing of the Ottawa Senators , I heard the announcers talking about the backup goaltender , a web site producer for the team .
They even interviewed him during the intermission .
With an injury to Jose Theodore , the Capitals rushed in Simeon Varlamov from the Hershey Bears .
However when he was unable to arrive in time for the game , the Caps turned to their web guy .
We ’ll let the AP ( via ESPN ) fill in the details :
A 6 - foot - 7 Web site producer for the Washington Capitals dressed as the team ’s backup goalie for Friday night ’s game against the Ottawa Senators because of an injury to Jose Theodore .
Brett Leonhardt , a Division III goalie in college , signed an amateur tryout contract before the game .
If he had actually played , he would have tied Ben Bishop of the St. Louis Blues as the tallest goalie ever to see action in an NHL game .
Theodore suffered a hip flexor injury during the Capitals ’ morning skate , and Simeon Varlamov was recalled from Hershey , the team ’s AHL affiliate , to back up starter Brent Johnson .
But Hershey happened to be on the road in San Antonio , and Varlamov did n’t arrive in time for the 7 p.m. faceoff .
So the Capitals received special dispensation from the league to dress three goaltenders .
Leonhardt had a spot on the bench until Varlamov arrived midway through the first period .
By the end of the second period , Leonhardt was back in a suit and tie and in his usual spot in the press box , preparing for his regular job of handling the camera during postgame interviews .
But first , of course , everyone wanted to interview him .
NHL.com has a good story up as well , which includes quotes from the intermission interview :
Leonhardt said he was told during the morning skate that he might be filling a different function than he usually does on game nights .
“ Jose had a short practice , ” he said during a between - periods interview during the Caps ’ game telecast .
“ George ( McPhee , the Caps ’ GM ) , kind of came into my cubicle , tapped me on the shoulder and just told me , ‘ Make sure your gear is down at Verizon and be ready to go at five . ' ”
… ” It did n’t cross my mind , ” he said of the possibility of actually facing shots in an NHL game .
“ Before the game , I was talking with ( goaltending coach ) Dave Prior , and he was telling me tendencies of the ‘ D ’ and communication , and I was like , ‘ Dave , let ’s hope we do n’t have to worry about that . ' ”
The AP Story continues :
“ Every dream come true , ” Leonhardt said .
“ Growing up in Canada , playing since I was 4 .
It was just very surreal .
It was a blur , went by real quick . ”
Although he did n’t play , Leonhardt — whose nickname is , you guessed it , “ Stretch ” — enjoyed the thrill of his life as he dressed in jersey No. 80 and went through the usual player ’s pregame routine , including having his skates sharpened .
Teammates greeted him warmly during pregame warmups as he fended off shots from superstar Alex Ovechkin and others while tending goal at the Verizon Center .
“ It was a great view .
Usually I ’m up here with you guys in the press box , ” Leonhardt said .
“ Mike Green started laughing his head off . ”
During the first half of the first period , Leonhardt sat at the end of the bench in a white baseball cap .
He looked down sheepishly when shown he was shown on the huge replay screen along with the caption : “ 1st NHL game . ”
The crowd roared .
The crowd cheered again later in the period when Varlamov — also new to the big league — was shown on the screen along with the same caption .
The 26 - year - old Leonhardt played two years for Oswego State in New York and two years for Neumann College in Pennsylvania before graduating in 2007 .
He has worked for the Capitals ’
Web site for about a year and has taken part in drills during practices when the team needed an extra goalie .
He wore one of his college masks from Neumann during warmups .
His chances of playing Friday were n’t exactly remote .
Johnson had a sore hip from a fall during Wednesday night ’s victory over the Boston Bruins .
Even if he had played , Leonhardt would n’t have received an NHL check .
The special amateur contract pays nothing .
“ I should pay them for being able to do this , ” he said .
In his post - game press conference , Coach Bruce Boudreau was asked about the situation : “ Once I left the arena it was all done and I did n’t think about it until I got back and found out ( Varlamov ) was n’t going to make it here , and then you start worrying about it again .
To me it ’s a moot point .
We either have Brett , yes , or we do n’t , and we have Varley , and I ca n’t let that consume 90 percent of my day when it ’s only maybe 10 percent of the problem at this point .
Now if Brent could n’t go , then I might have been a little worried .
But Brett was tossing pucks to the crowd like he knew what he was doing , so I had no fears . ”
The Neumann College Knights covered one of LeonHardt ’s previous stints in goal for the Caps earlier this year , including this quote from the Capitals Insider Blog ( Washington Post ) : “ With Kolzig skipping the morning skate , Caps media staffer Brett Leonhardt , an Ontario native and former college goaltender at Neumann College , took shots in practice .
The highlight of his day — and perhaps life — was a nice glove save on Ovechkin . ”
That WAS the highlight of this young man ’s life , until tonight .
See the photos below from that appearance at a practice in February :
If you would like to congratulate Brett , give him a yell over on Facebook .
The NHL has even made him a Player page on NHL.com .
Will he be the next to get Sean Avery ’s sloppy seconds ?

So I was looking for some excuse to learn OCaml +
OpenGL , and I run into Radiohead 's House of Cards video dataset hosted at google code .
The dataset is made of many CSV files , one for each frame of the HoC video .
The data is also shipped with an application that uses Processing to create an image for each frame of the video .
I decided to do the same program in OCaml +
OpenGL : for each CSV file , the program loads it , renders it in OpenGL , and then saves that rendered data into a jpg ( or bmp ) image .
You can merge the generated image frames with the sample mp3 provided at google code , by usingAnyway , the result is quite interesting , and it gives us a good ground to build better visualizations :
( This youtube video quality is pretty lame , I 'd recommend you to right click here and save link as ... ) .
This post is going to be about the making of this simple application .
Further posts on this " project " will cover advanced camera movement and particle transformations .
This app was made in one single file , but it contains two important parts :
A data object containing information about the location of the CSV and generated image files , along with some methods to load CSV files and save OpenGL rendered pictures into image files ( bmp and jpeg formats ) .
This object uses camlimages for saving images in different formats , and the OpenGL / GLUT bindings provided by lablGL
This object is included in the main .ml file , which is the main entry point for the OpenGL application .
This file defines functions for initializing and binding events to the main openGL app .
You 'll find this code familiar if you know some OpenGL .
You can download the source here .
You can compile the files with the bytecode compiler : .
Just remember that you have to install OCaml + lablGL + camlimages to be able to use this .
Any comment about the code will be well appreciated , since I 'm an OCaml beginner :) .
Project : Passive Passive cooling consept case .
Author : Ville ' Willek ' Kyrö Published : 03.03.2008

Intro I have wanted to build a fully passively cooled computer case since I had my first Athlon Thunderbird 800 MHz .
That time the fan noise was amazingly high , and manufacturers didn´t much care about the noise levels , and did n't offer products for building a quiet PC .
Nowadays a quiet PC is not much of a challenge to build , but totally silent ?
It would require that there were no moving parts at all .
But of cource there has to be the compromise of a hard - drive .
One could buy a SSD drive , but at least I do n't have that kind of money to spend . :)
First of all , I have to apologize to our readers , as I have been extremely lazy writing this article .
This project was well finished in the summer of 2007 , and I have even built couple of computer cases after that .
I hope this in partly explains the " old " components used in the project .
Opteron 170 @ 2,4 GHz
GeForce 6800GT
Asus A8N -VM CSM
Kingston 400 MHz DDR ECC
Seagate Barracuda 320 GB
Getting started
Through a friend of a friend , I got my hands on some very heavy - duty heatsinks , so I was ready to start building .
When designing passive cooling , first thing you have to have is lots of surface area to dissipate the heat that a modern computer produces .
The second thing to take into account is the airflow .
Without fans , the airflow rests solely on convection that is a very low force .
This means that the places the air must go , must be open , and clear of obstacles .
Convection means that hot air goes up .
This would suggest that the heatsinks are lined vertically .
This in turn , suggests that the case be modeled like a tower .

Republicans are getting very nervous about Minnesota Sen .
Norm Coleman 's re-election chances , now that the lowly , humiliating , obviously undeserving comedian [ / wingnutspeak ]
Al Franken has pulled into the lead in their recount , according to the Star - Tribune , which puts Franken 's lead at " about 250 " .
Sam Stein reports that analyses now project that Franken will win when the dust settles :
As it stands now , it seems likely that Franken will end this process with a lead wider than even his campaign expected .
Earlier projections , from the Associated Press , Star Tribune and Franken himself , suggested that Coleman would lose the race by roughly 20 votes or less .
And this tally does n't even take into consideration the legal and political battle being waged over wrongfully rejected absentee ballots , which the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled , on Thursday , should be counted .
That decision , another loss for the Coleman campaign , could mean even more votes flowing into Franken 's tally , though the Court also stressed that the state and both campaigns come up with a uniform standard for identifying these absentee ballots before they are counted .
I wonder how those Senate Democrats who were telling some talking heads anonymously last month that they might be relieved not to have " that comedian " in the Senate are feeling .
Poor babies .
The best part of all this is that Franken 's election will absolutely drive the wingnuts batty .
This will make for some good high comedy in the weeks and months to come , no doubt .
At Chinese buffets , overweight people were observed to more often use larger plates , face the food , chew less and otherwise endeavor to overeat .

Editor ’s note :
The story below includes research from Brian Wansink .
On Sept. 20 , 2018 , Wansink resigned from Cornell University , after an internal investigation found that he had " committed academic misconduct in his research and scholarship , including misreporting of research data , problematic statistical techniques , failure to properly document and preserve research results , and inappropriate authorship , " according to a statement from Cornell University Provost Michael Kotlikoff .
At an all - you - can - eat buffet , heavier people are more likely to use larger plates , chew less and engage in other behaviors that lead to overeating , a new study finds .
Brian Wansink , director of Cornell University 's Food and Brand Lab , investigates the psychology behind common eating behaviors , especially those that lead to overeating .
The current obesity epidemic has been linked to the prevalence of affordable , accessible food doled out in large portions .
Author of the book " Mindless Eating : Why We Eat More Than We Think " ( Bantam , 2006 ) , Wansink and his colleagues were interested in examining food - related behaviors at all - you - can - eat buffets , which have been multiplying along with the rise in obesity .
" It 's so hard at a buffet to know when you 're full , " Wansink said .
The researchers sent trained observers to watch 213 randomly - selected patrons of 11 all - you - can - eat Chinese buffets across the United States .
The observers also noted the approximate age , height and weight of each patron they studied .
They found that heavier patrons , whether overweight or obese , were more likely to :
Sit at a table vs. a booth .
Face the buffet while eating , rather than have their side or back to it .
Begin serving themselves immediately instead of surveying the buffet .
Pick up a larger plate vs. a smaller one .
Use a fork instead of chopsticks .
Put their napkin on the table or tucked into their shirt vs. on their lap .
Leave less food leftover on their plate
Chew fewer times per bite .
Many of these habits have to do with allowing for greater ease in eating .
For example , chopsticks mean less food per bite and more effort to pick up food .
Likewise , booths tend to be further away from the buffet and are more difficult for heavier people to sit in .
" Anything that reduces the convenience of eating has a huge biasing effect , " Wansink told LiveScience .
Such behaviors are " something that heavy people or obese people were unlikely to do . "
Using smaller plates would tend to indicate eating less food , the researchers said .
Chewing more per bite has also been linked to lower BMIs ( Body Mass Index , which compares a person 's height and weight ) , because chewing influences satiety .
For heavier people to sit close enough to a table to eat comfortably , their stomachs usually touch the table , Wansink said , " so putting your napkin in your lap , it does n't really work . "
But like the proverbial chicken and egg , Wansink and his colleagues do n't know which comes first : a person 's behavior , or their weight .
As Wansink put it : " Is that what made them thin , or is that what thin people do ? "
Either way , it shows a link between certain behaviors and overeating .
While people are generally unaware of the behaviors , they can become more attuned to them and might be able to control them to change their eating habits , for example , by picking up a smaller plate instead of a large one .
The findings will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Obesity .

It could n't have been easy last March for Time Warner to throw down $ 850 million to buy Bebo , the third - largest social networking site .
Between market share growing pains , heated competition between the dueling titans Facebook and MySpace , AOL 's struggles , and increasingly skeptical advertisers , even Time Warner 's CEO Jeff Bewkes admitted that Bebo was the " riskiest acquisition " of the year .
Nevertheless , Bebo is back today with a new , more open social dashboard approach , attempting to meld the most promising social media content and tools with AOL 's global reach that could dwarf even Facebook and MySpace .
Easily the most interesting aspect of Bebo's redesign today is a new " social inbox " that allows users to pull in e-mail and social activity from a variety of competing services .
Front and center in Bebo users ' profiles now is a panel that can display e-mail previews for Yahoo Mail and GMail , in addition to AOL Mail .
Below that is an area awkwardly called " Changes " which can collect friend activity from popular services like Twitter , YouTube , AIM , Delicious , and more .
This panel takes advantage of technology from AOL 's acquisition of SocialThing , though as of this writing , none of these new features are working very well .
Aside from a number of design quirks across the site like out - of - place menus , neither the Yahoo nor GMail modules are actually displaying messages .
Only Twitter and Flickr can be added to the Changes panel right now , but Twitter is n't displaying updates from friends , and the Flickr option thinks our username is incorrect .
Bebo's new , somewhat spartan main page features a spotlight carousel and more video content
Despite some launch problems , Bebo faces quite the uphill battle when it comes to garnering the eyeballs that advertisers need to see .
In October , MySpace clocked over 76 million unique monthly visitors .
Facebook saw 46 million of its own , while internationally it recently cracked over 130 million unique international users .
What 's worse , as the Wall Street Journal ( subscription required ) notes , is that ad spending on social networks remains small due to skepticism over user engagement .
People typically focus more on the e-mail and social networking tools as they use them , and less on advertising peppered around the content .
Bebo's personal profile page which features external e-mail and social activity ,
though many of these new features were n't working for us at time of publication
The bulk of Time Warner 's new bet on Bebo is composed of the AOL community , being more open with new applications and integration of competitor 's services , and bringing more mainstream media to the site .
Perhaps most importantly , the barrier to signing up with yet another social network Bebo has been significantly lowered now that AOL and AIM users can log in with their existing credentials .
In fact , flipping that switch on AOL 's existing base of 100 million users gives Bebo a potential global reach of 124 million users .
And with more media tightly integrated into the site , Bebo is hoping to better engage users and spark more advertising interest and revenue .
In a way , the new Bebo combines some of the best advantages from competing social networks , such as Facebook 's news feed of friends ' activity across external social services and MySpace 's signature partnerships with mainstream media .
Bebo already supports both Facebook and Google OpenSocial application platforms , too , boasting over 13,000 apps that can enhance user profiles .
Still , the site will need to clean up today 's launch and design quirks , provide more engaging features like interaction from the social inbox , and feature more premium content .
All of this is necessary to have a shot at convincing any reasonable portion of users to make a switch .
Unfortunately for AOL , it may be too late for that .
Understanding Among Africans
There is something depressing in watching two Africans trying to communicate by gestures , when one , a Rwandan – with Kinyargwanda as his mother tongue – has made the effort of assimilating Swahili and French , and the other , a Nigerian , is capable of using , besides the Agatu of his native village , three languages as important as Hausa , Arabic and English .
The total of languages spoken by the two of them amounts to seven , and they have devoted many hours for many years to drilling themselves in the correct handling of difficult rules of grammar and inconsistent vocabularies .
Yet they stand together as though separated by an insuperable barrier .
At a time when there is so much talk of international co-operation , contacts among peoples and intercultural communication , would this problem of mutual understanding not deserve a thorough analysis ?
Another example comes to mind .
Some time ago , a seminar was organized in Switzerland for radio people from a number of countries .
Before the first session , everybody noticed the only two African members spontaneously walk up to one another .
It was their first stay in Europe .
Alas , the expression of interested expectation that lit up their faces when they first saw each other from a distance was soon replaced by one of deep disappointment when they realized that they could not understand each other .
One had come from Tanzania , the other from Gabon .
These two men , who were drawn to one another by so many common realities – same black skin among a majority of white people , many aspects of cultural background , life on the same continent , solidarity of ex-subjects of colonialism – could relate as little effectively as if they suffered from a brain handicap .
For two weeks they lived together without ever being able to communicate directly .
They always needed a white man fluent in both English and French to act as an interpreter .
Do you think they told each other the same things as if they had been able to talk alone , face to face ?
To imagine that , you ’d have to know very little about human psychology .
Nevertheless both belonged to an intellectual elite .
How much time had they spent to learn the language of their former colonizers ?
This experience is typical of Africa ’s language tragedy .
Schoolchildren in Black Africa first learn to read and write in their local language , or in a widespread African language , or in the language of the former colonial power , according to where they live .
But whatever the first stage , the second one , for those who are lucky enough to go on studying , always consists on devoting long hours for many years to a written language full of difficulties , whether they be French subjunctives , Portuguese irregular verbs or the enormous stock of the English vocabulary , which , because the language has tapped both Germanic and Romance sources , is almost double that of an average tongue .
Whatever the language taught in school , since it is not the same one everywhere , this huge investment of time and effort in the conquest of linguistic elements unrelated to African traditions does not solve the problem of direct communication .
Is there a chance that all African countries might agree to teach the same language , either English or French , everywhere ?
It is highly unlikely , nor is it advisable .
Cultural pressures are already enough of an alienating factor .
To give them a monopoly would be intolerable .
Should one envisage the adoption of a great non-European language , such as Arabic , Swahili or Hausa ?
For many Africans , the difficulties would not be smaller and the drawback of unduly favoring one culture over the others would not be avoided .
Would perhaps the solution to the problem lie in devising a pan-African conventional tongue , along the lines of what has been done in New Guinea ?
Difficulties are already so numerous when one endeavors to create a national intertribal language that they would almost surpass human capabilities if the challenge came from a whole continent with all kinds of extremely different linguistic structures .
On what basis should the vocabulary be selected ?
How could one conceive a grammar in such a way that all users might feel at ease ?
Such an undertaking , while not impossible – experience shows that planned languages are really capable of living – would be an extremely slow and painstaking task if it were to be carried out effectively with due regard to the requirements of ethnic and cultural equality .
The following examples show how varied the African linguistic reality is .
Although they are limited to a small sample of vocabulary and to one single point of grammar – the plural – they will give the reader some idea of Africa ’s language diversity .
Vocabulary
English Fulani Hausa Yoruba Swahili man gorko mutum okunrin mwanamume woman debbo mace obinrin mwanamke market luumo kasuwa oja soko house suudu gida ile nyumba
Plural
a. Fulani
Plural is expressed by complex variations in which , quite often , a prefix and a suffix are modified :
gorko ‘ man ’ ; worgbe ‘ men ’
rawaandu ‘ dog ’ ; dawaagdi ‘ dogs ’
ngeelooba ‘ camel ’ ; geloogdi ‘ camels ’
ndamndi ‘ he - goat ’ ; damgdi ‘ he - goats ’
kamiong ‘ truck ’ ; kamiongji ‘ trucks ’
b. Hausa
In principle , plural involves a change of ending , but the system is not at all consistent , so that for all practical purposes it is necessary to memorize the plural of every noun :
mutum ‘ man ’ ; mutane ‘ men ’
kare ‘ dog ’ ; karnuka ‘ dogs ’
akwiya ‘ goat ’ ; awaki ‘ goats ’
dutse ‘ stone ’ ; duwatsu ‘ stones ’
zobe ‘ ring ’ ; zobba ‘ rings
c. Yoruba
Usually no distinction is made between singular and plural .
If necessary – but this is quite exceptional – you can use the plural pronouns awon or won ‘ they ’ : okunrin ‘ man ’ or ‘ men ’ ; awon okunrin ‘ the men ’ .
d. Swahili
Every Swahili noun belongs to a class characterized by a prefix .
To form the plural , the singular prefix is replaced by the plural one of the relevant class ( for one of the six classes , the prefix does not vary ) :
mtu ‘ man ’ ; watu ‘ men ’
mtoto ‘ child ’ ; watoto ‘ children ’
mbwa ‘ dog ’ ; mbwa ‘ dogs ’
kitu ‘ thing ’ ; vitu ‘ things ’
jicho ‘ eye ’ ; macho ‘ eyes ’
One of the characteristics of Bantu languages is that the prefixes of depending words agree with the prefix of the chief noun :
Kisu kidogo kimoja kitatosha ‘ a small knife will be enough ’
Visu vidogo vitatu vitatosha ‘ three small knives will be enough ’ .
Considering the wide variety which appears at all levels of language , it would be impossible to find a common denominator even in the limited field of the chief African languages .
Decades would be needed to work out a satisfactory project , and two or three generations would be necessary to give it life .
Towards a realistic solution
The most satisfactory solution to the problem appears to consist of a bi- , tri- or quadrilingualism acquired by successive stages according to the following scheme :
1. first two educational grades : learning to read and write in the local dialect or in the regional or national African language ;
2. third and fourth grades : continued study of the first African language , beginning study of the international language Esperanto , the study of which will be maintained all through the following grades ;
3. secondary school : for the students who so desire , or according to national requirement , study of one or two languages such as Swahili , English , French , Arabic or others , not as a means of communication ( Esperanto will serve that purpose ) , but in order to broaden the cultural outlook of the youth .
This formula presents several advantages .
Pedagogically , it is realistic , as will be explained in the following pages .
It solves easily the communication problem among African peoples .
It confers the role of inter-African tongue to a language devoid of any colonial , neocolonial , ideological or religious links .
It fully respects cultural values at their different levels .
It entails no loss of identity , either for linguistic reasons ( Esperanto is not , structurally , an Indo - European language ; its flexibility and inter-ethnic tradition enable it to adapt to every mentality ) , or for cultural ones ( literary life in Esperanto is made up of contributions from the most varied sources : e.g. Japanese and Hungarian writers have played an important role in its development ) .
The system advocated above is based on three facts , which , although objectively verifiable , are usually unknown or misinterpreted .
The words objectively verifiable must be stressed , because in discussions on these questions it is not infrequent to find individuals of good will who nevertheless jump to conclusions without having carefully considered the facts .
This attitude s understandable .
It involves all the same a serious lack of respect for the populations and the individuals whom babelism reduces to an inferior status , and who deserve more than a superficial judgment .
The facts in question are the following :
a . Because of its structure , Esperanto leads more deeply and more rapidly than any other language to the perception of grammatical and semantic relationships , which is the basis of any language learning .
This is the reason why it allows considerable economy of time in the later assimilation of foreign tongues .
b . The time required to assimilate a language and the ease with which it can be used depend on various objective features .
The more a language is handled with ease , the less foreign it is felt to be .
c. Esperanto is a living language , both rich and expressive , with a long tradition – more than a century – of intercultural and interethnic communication .
Pedagogical advantages of Esperanto
Leaving aside the problem of communication in limited areas , where bilingualism or trilingualism in local languages is quite frequent , a large number of Africans will have to learn a language other than their own if they want to take part in communication at an interregional or pan-African level .
The adoption of an African language would not dispose of the pedagogical problems .
If Swahili was chosen , for instance , Africans speaking a Sudanese language or a Hottentot dialect would still have to assimilate the extremely different structures of a Bantu language , and the distance between those languages is greater than between Portuguese and Bengali .
The same pedagogical problem arises if the language to be learned is chosen outside Black Africa ( English , French , Arabic ... )
Learning a foreign tongue always involves two operations : decoding and recoding .
Apart from exclamations such as hm ! oops !
ha ! , language necessarily implies an analysis of a series of relationships .
Obviously , even an expression of emotional life such as " I love you " must include linguistic means of distinguishing the subject from the object .
Otherwise , it might mean ‘ You love me ’ , which is , of course , completely different .
What is called here ‘ decoding ’ consists in making explicit this unconscious analysis .
It is a crucial phase , and if a third language is learned more easily than a second one , it is because this stage has already been dealt with to a large extent .
Esperanto facilitates the decoding process because it consists exclusively of invariable units , so that the grammatical and semantic analysis of words and sentences is both consistent and transparent .
For instance , once you have learned that the past tense of a verb is expressed by the ending –is , you can yourself - consistently – form the past tense of any verb : mi estis ‘ I was ’ , Patro faris ‘ Father did ’ , vi iris ‘ you went ’ .
Moreover , every time you meet a word with the –is ending , you know – transparency – that it is a verb in the past tense .
Such consistency and transparency pervade the whole language .
Once you have assimilated the endings and particles , you can at first glance , even without knowing the meaning of a single word , make out the grammatical analysis of a sentence .
Esperanto also makes semantic analysis explicit , i.e. it analyzes complex concepts .
Let us consider for example the Esperanto equivalent of incurable .
It consists of six units .
The central element is san ‘ healthy ’ .
Ig means ‘ make ’ , ‘ render such or such ’ , so that sanig means ‘ to make healthy ’ .
Since re shows repetition or returning , resanig means ‘ make healthy again ’ , ‘ restoring health ’ and thus ‘ to heal ’ .
If you add ebl , which conveys the idea of possibility , you get resanigebl , ‘ can be healed ’ , ‘ curable ’ .
With the ending –a , which corresponds to the adjective function , you know that the idea is expressed as an adjective : resanigebla ‘ curable ’ .
To negate an idea you use the word ne , so that neresanigebla is ‘ incurable ’ .
If you want to express the concept as a noun , you just replace –a by –o : neresanigeblo ‘ incurability ’ .
By replacing the ending by –is , which , as we just saw , indicates that you use the word as a verb in the past tense , you can form li neresanigeblis ‘ he was incurable ’ ( the same idea can also be expressed , of course , by a literal translation of the English sentence : li estis neresanigebla ) .
Perhaps it should be added that the prefix re- ‘ back ’ , ‘ again ’ is not always necessary .
In many cases nesanigebla is quite enough .
Whether you consider vocabulary or grammar , Esperanto is a language in which relationships appear concretely :
frata / frato = onkla / onklo
fratino / frato = onklino / onklo
Frata ‘ fraternal ’ has with frato ‘ brother ’ the same relationship as onkla ‘ avuncular ’ has with onklo ‘ uncle ’ .
Fratino ‘ sister ’ ( and fratina ‘ sisterly ’ ) has with frato ‘ brother ’ the same relationship as onklino ‘ aunt ’ ( and onklina ‘ relating to an aunt ’ , ‘ pertaining to an aunt ’ , ‘ typical of an aunt ’ ) has with onklo ‘ uncle ’ .
The fact that in Esperanto every grammar rule , every ending , every prefix or suffix , in fact every linguistic trait , can be immediately generalized increases to an extraordinary extent the productivity of any effort .
Once he has learned the pattern hundo / hundino ‘ dog ’ / ‘ bitch ’ , the child will himself " invent " all nouns of females : kamelino ‘ she - camel ’ , bubalino ‘ female buffalo ’ , porkino ‘ sow ’ , kaprino ‘ she - goat ’ , simiino ‘ she - monkey ’ , etc .
Similarly , generalizing the case of hundejo ‘ kennel ’ , he will easily form porkejo ‘ pigsty ’ , kaprejo ‘ enclosure for goats ’ , kamelejo ‘ place where camels are kept ’ , and so on .
( The plain root , in nouns referring to animals , is used as a general term ; the forms with vir- ‘ male ’ and –ino ‘ female ’ are used only when the sex is emphasized : chevalo ‘ horse ’ , chevalino ‘ mare ’ , virchevalo ‘ stallion ’ ; porko ‘ pig ’ , porkino ‘ sow ’ , virporko ‘ boar ’ ) .
Since the word or suffix ido designates the young of an animal , the student has no trouble expressing the idea of a ‘ puppy ’ ( hundido ) , a ‘ piglet ’ ( porkido ) or a ‘ kid ’ ( kaprido ) .
A great number of people who have studied and practiced English for many years – including the writer of this article – do not know if there is an English word for the young of a camel , but the reader who has no knowledge at all of Esperanto apart from the few examples just given will readily produce the corresponding noun : kamelido .
In Esperanto , unlike most other languages , vocabulary acquisition proceeds by multiplication , rather than by addition .
One single new element can multiply the vocabulary already assimilated in an impressive proportion .
This system enables the user of the language , not only to translate accurately and without difficulty words from his mother tongue , but also to coin new words which are immediately understood by speakers of Esperanto all over the world .
For instance , once you have assimilated the sam ----- ano pattern of samlandano ‘ compatriot ’ ( land - ‘ country ’ ) and samreligiano ‘ coreligionist ’ ( religi - ‘ religion ’ ) , you can coin such words as samvalano ‘ person from the same valley ’ ( val - ‘ valley ’ ) , samrasano ‘ person of the same race ’ ( ras- ‘ race ’ ) , sametnano ‘ person of the same ethnic group ’ ( etn- ‘ ethnic group ) , etc .
Esperanto represents a synthesis , exceptional in the spectrum of languages , that harmoniously integrates rigor and freedom .
Rigor , since any grammatical function must be expressed .
Freedom , since within the framework of a small number of strict rules , you are free to phrase your thoughts the way you please .
Few languages are based on such a perfect integration of both brain hemispheres , the left one ( in right handed people ) dealing with rigor , the right one with creativity and freedom .
In English , you have to say you obey him .
Saying you obey to him or you him obey would be unacceptable .
In French you must say vous lui obéissez ; forms like vous l’obéissez or vous obéissez lui , although perfectly understandable , are incorrect .
Esperanto allows you to say equally , without making a mistake , vi lin obeas , vi obeas lin , al li vi obeas , vi obeas al li , etc.
Rigor : subject and object of the action have to be clearly distinguished .
Freedom : whether this distinction is made by a preposition or an ending is irrelevant , as is the word order .
Here is another example .
Provided you respect the precise meaning of prepositions and endings ( rigor ) , you generally have the choice of expressing the same idea through an adjective , verbal , adverbial or substantive form ( freedom ) .
Esperanto for ‘ train ’ is trajno ( aj is pronounced approximately like the pronoun I ; stress , as in Swahili , always falls on the last syllable but one ) .
In the sentence ‘ He came by train ’ , the concept ‘ train ’ can be expressed by a noun : li venis per trajno , an adverb : li venis trajne ; a verb : li trajnis or an adjective : lia veno estis trajna .
This high degree of freedom , which actually results from the rigor , is obviously an important advantage for style and expressiveness .
The extent to which this advantage is exploited by writers strikes all those who read original Esperanto literature , especially poetry .
Furthermore , it has great pedagogical value for those who , having learned Esperanto , study other languages .
Familiarity with Esperanto as spoken and written in today ’s world acquaints the user with a wide variety of linguistic forms that are nevertheless always clearly understandable .
It is thus an introduction to linguistic expression in general , which frees the learner form the constraints of the mother tongue without immediately imposing the rigid structures of a foreign language .
In the sequence " mother tongue / Esperanto / foreign language " , the Esperanto phase is the stage of discovery and creativity .
Those who go no further will have acquired an instrument of world - wide communication which is very useful in practice and has great cultural and human value .
The freedom with which words are formed will have stimulated creativity and developed a feeling for nuances .
Those who are capable and willing to proceed further will discover that the assimilation of foreign languages is made remarkably easier by the pleasant and entertaining linguistic training of the Esperanto stage .
They will have learned more about the universal structures or human linguistic expression than by the theoretical study of grammar or by proceeding without an intermediate phase to the study of a national or ethnic language .
Factors governing the ease with which a new language can be learned and used
The more consistent the structures , the easier the language .
Contrary to what is often believed , consistent structures are much more important in acquiring a new language than similarity with the mother tongue .
The Esperanto verb system is quite different from the verb system of the Romance languages .
Does that mean that a French speaking person will find it more difficult to use Esperanto verbs than Spanish ones , considering that the Spanish conjugation presents a wealth of forms and inconsistencies comparable to that of French ?
By no means .
From the first lesson on , the students know how to use all verbs in all persons in the present tense .
Once the relevant ending is assimilated , they proceed to the next one , so that an average of twelve lessons is all that is needed for the Esperanto verb system to be fully assimilated .
Spanish is quite different .
The correct use of only two verbs – ‘ to be ’ and ‘ to have ’ – requires more than the same number of lessons .
Obviously , this reasoning applies to the African situation as well .
In Hausa , as in French , nouns have a gender , every one being either ‘ masculine ’ or ‘ feminine ’ .
Does that mean that French will be easier than Esperanto , a language without genders , for a speaker of Hausa ?
No .
While the structure is similar in Hausa and French , it is consistent in neither .
Madara ‘ milk ’ is feminine in Hausa , whereas its equivalent lait is masculine in French .
Viande ‘ meat ’ is feminine in French but the corresponding word nama is masculine in Hausa .
Their translations in Esperanto , and in English , are easier to handle for a Hausa , even if the language is more different in that respect .
Let us consider a still clearer example : plural .
In Yoruba , the concept of plural is extremely vague , as in Chinese .
Although it is possible to express it , it is not a linguistic necessity and it is done only if deemed really indispensable .
In Esperanto , as in English , you have to use a form which indicates whether you speak of one or several things , of one or several persons .
That fact implies a real difficulty for speakers of the Yoruba language .
But what is their choice if they want to enjoy a system of communication that goes beyond the local level ?
The languages with which Esperanto might compete in Africa are English , French , Swahili , Arabic , and perhaps another important African language like Hausa .
Not only have all these languages a clear opposition singular / plural , but also plural is in none of them expressed in a thoroughly consistent way .
In both Arabic and Hausa , the plural form must be learned with the singular of practically every word .
In Swahili , the plural varies according to the complex system of " classes " among which all nouns are distributed .
In French , there are a number or irregular forms ; for example , many , but not all , words ending in –al and –ail change this to –aux in the plural and there are such deviant forms as oeil / yeux ‘ eye ’ / ’ eyes ’ ; plural forms of verbs can also be complicated .
In English , irregular forms are not numerous , but they still exist : foot / feet , woman / women , sheep / sheep , child / children , mouse / mice , etc .
In Esperanto , there is only one ending to be learned - -j pronounced as y in boy – and it is used in all cases .
The Yoruba who learns one of the languages mentioned above must learn two things : ( 1 ) the correct use of the category " plural " ; ( 2 ) the various forms in which it is concretized in the relevant language .
In Esperanto , only the first of those requirements exists , since the question of form is disposed of in a fraction of a second .
Experience gained in Japan and China shows that the difficulty with plural , though real , should not be exaggerated .
Learning a language always involves difficulties .
What distinguishes Esperanto from most other languages is that its difficulties are not arbitrary .
A Yoruba who has learned the Esperanto plural will have assimilated a linguistic concept useful for communication , whereas the formal difficulties of its potential rivals in Africa have no relevance for transmitting ideas or feelings .
People would understand one another just as well if they said mouses instead of mice , chevals ‘ horses ’ instead of chevaux .
The observation of children ’s speech shows that consistency is more natural than inconsistency .
The spontaneous tendency of linguistic expression is to use consistent structures .
The examples given above were taken from the field of grammar , but vocabulary also deserves to be considered , since inconsistent lexical structures are also a source of difficulties .
French people say concevable ‘ conceivable ’ , but perceptible ‘ perceptible ’ , imprenable ‘ which cannot be taken ’ , ‘ impregnable ’ , but incompréhensible ‘ incomprehensible ’ .
Knowing the verbs concevoir , percevoir , prendre , comprendre is of no avail when you need the corresponding adjectives ( consistency would require to say * conceptible and * impréhensible , or * percevable and * incomprenable ) .
In Esperanto , koncepti / konceptebla , percepti / perceptebla , preni / prenebla , neprenebla , kompreni / komprenebla , nekomprenebla is a consistent system where finding the word you want is a matter of intelligence , or of reflex , rather than memory .
While one of the difficulties of English for many non-European people derives from the numerous shades of meaning expressed in conjugation ( forms such as he went , was going , has gone , would go , used to go , had gone , had been going , has been going , etc. are not easy to handle for people whose language has just one past tense ) , another lies in the astonishing heterogeneity of the vocabulary .
Such a series as country , national , foreigner , fellow - citizen imposes on memory a heavier burden than its Esperanto equivalent lando , landa , eksterlandano .
samlandano .
Similarly , the forms tooth and teeth do not help you when you want to express such concepts as dental and dentist .
Compare with Swahili : meno ‘ teeth ’ , ( w ) a meno ‘ dental ’ , daktari wa meno ‘ dentist ’ .
The following table shows to what extent the consistent structures of Esperanto favor the memorization and retrieval of words , and thus ease in expressing oneself , in cases where English requires more effort because it often derives an adjective from Latin or French even though the corresponding verb has a Germanic origin :
English Esperanto Swahili avoid
inevitable ( un- avoid - able ) evit -i
ne - evit - ebla ku-epuk -a
isiyo - epuk - ika destroy
indestructible detru-i
ne - detru-ebla ku-harib-u
isiyo - harib - ika win , overcome
invincible venk -i
ne - venk - ebla ku-shind -a
isiyo - shind - ika see
invisible vid-I
ne - vid - ebla ku-on-a
isiyo - on - ekana
( Hyphens are included here just to emphasize the invariability of the Esperanto and Swahili verbal morphemes ; they are not used in standard writing ) .
Esperanto is not the only language in which both grammar and vocabulary have such a high degree of consistency .
Chinese , Caribbean Creoles , Malay , Malagasy , etc. are also composed of invariable elements that combine freely to express the speaker ’s ideas .
Swahili roots are also mostly invariable .
But those languages have features that make them less adapted than Esperanto to inter-ethnic use in today ’s world .
Haitian Creole , for instance , lacks many abstract words and replaces them either with long cumbersome phrases or with words borrowed from French .
Chinese has a phonetic system which most foreigners find difficult to adapt to , because of the so - called tones : the word transcribed as shiyan means ‘ experiment ’ , ‘ salt ’ , ‘ test ’ , ‘ rehearsal ’ , or ‘ pledge ’ according to whether the voice is ascending or descending on this or that syllable , as well as according to the relative pitch .
Tones exist also in many African languages , but it is easier for somebody accustomed to a tone language to use a toneless one – i.e. a language in which the melody of a sentence is a matter of style , emotional expression or regional accent rather than meaning - than to use a language with a different tone system .
In Bantu languages , the system of classes makes it more difficult for the speakers of non-Bantu languages to express themselves spontaneously .
It requires less drilling to learn , and less practice to use spontaneously , the Esperanto preposition de ‘ of ’ than the Swahili –a which has the same function , but varies according to the class of the preceding noun :
Esperanto Swahili English pordo de domo mlango wa nyumba house door pordoj de domo milango ya nyumba house doors muroj de domo kuta za nyumba house walls libro de infano kitabu cha mtoto child ’s book libroj de infano vitabu vya mtoto child ’s books
In Esperanto it is also possible to use a simple word combination , similar to its English equivalent except that it is written as a single word and that the first element usually loses its vowel ending : dompordo ‘ house door ’ , dommuro ‘ house wall ’ , infanlibro ‘ child ’s book ’ , etc .
Esperanto , a living language
The idea , quite widespread in the West , especially in Europe , that there cannot be a cultural , really human language without all sorts of exceptions and inconsistencies is a pure ethnocentric prejudice .
Chinese is a highly consistent language , from which the very concept of irregular verbs or plurals is completely absent .
It has nevertheless a beautiful and rich literature : cultural richness is independent of grammatical complications .
As for the idea , equally widespread , that Esperanto is an Indo - European language , it stems from an insufficient analysis of facts .
Structurally , Esperanto has more features in common with isolating and agglutinating languages than with the flexional languages of the Indo - European and Semito - Hamitic families .
Word roots were borrowed from European languages , but this does not change the deep structural reality .
The spirit of a language is determined by its structure rather than by the shape of its words .
Caribbean French Creole is evidence that a language can have a vocabulary etymologically closer to Romance tongues than Esperanto and still stand , structurally , outside the Indo - European family .
Nobody would dare to pronounce a judgment on a car , a restaurant or the poetic flavor of this or that African dialect without having driven that car , eaten in that restaurant or become acquainted with the relevant poetry .
Intellectual honesty requires the same restraint in the case of Esperanto .
Those who have heard speakers of Esperanto from 20 countries laughing at the same second while listening to one of their humorists know that humor can have a universal quality that can be conveyed by that international language .
Those who have attended a debate in it , read Esperanto cultural journals , discovered its songs an poetry and heard how children use it in playing know that it meets all the requirements of a modern language , both popular and literary .
There is nothing surprising in that fact .
Expression is all the more fluent as the speaker is less inhibited by grammatical and lexical difficulties or by the fear of making mistakes .
Whoever reads the poems written in Esperanto by Miyamoto Masao or the rendering in that language of Omar Khayyam ’s Rubaiyat marvels at the simplicity of Zamenhof ’s language , in which the finest of non-European sensibilities express themselves with an ease and an art without rival in the realm of intercultural communication .
There are people who blame Esperanto – without being familiar with it – for being " artificially constructed " or " the work of just one man " .
Again , this stems from an ignorance of facts that are not difficult to check .
What Zamenhof published in 1887 with the name " International Language " was only an embryo : 16 grammar rules , a few hundred morphemes and a few examples of texts .
The meagerness was intentional .
He had understood that a language is a social , collective and anonymous phenomenon .
He had the wisdom to realize that only practice could give life to this slender skeleton , and he also succeeded in giving this linguistic nucleus a structure suited to bringing about its natural development through simple contact with the demands of life .
History has proved him right .
A number of people in quite different cultural settings adopted this embryonic new language to communicate freely with one another .
As anticipated by Zamenhof , the linguistic nucleus , simply through being used , developed into a full - fledged language .
Besides the modest and anonymous community of first users , there appeared talented writers and poets whose contribution to the growth of the language was extremely important .
The publication of Esperanto versions of the Bible , the Bhagavad Gita and the Koran , as well as of several texts belonging to the Confucianist tradition , have also helped people from various cultures to find answers to a number of linguistic questions .
As a matter of fact , Esperanto is the product of the collective will of a number of people , scattered in a bit more than a hundred countries , to communicate with as few inhibitions as possible across language barriers .
Many of the features or the language have come about unconsciously by the process that linguists call " the influence of the substratum " with the peculiarity that the substratum is the most intercultural that ever existed in the history of language .
Africans who join the Esperanto diaspora can only bring to its evolution an original contribution which will be a new cultural enrichment for the whole world .
Conclusion
Esperanto is hardly known in many regions of Africa .
This is the result of various historical factors .
It was in the interest of the colonizers to tie to their own culture the people they were colonizing .
France is still carrying out in Africa an extremely active policy designed to maintain its influence through the French language and the culture linked to it .
The old maxim of " divide and conquer " has never become obsolete .
Some members of the African elites will probably be reluctant to consider seriously the suggestion made in this paper .
They may see in it a threat to the privileged position that goes with a real mastery of difficult languages such as English and French .
But all those who have the interests of the African populations really at heart have the moral duty to inquire seriously into the possibilities offered by Esperanto for effective communication across the language barriers of Africa .
Africans need to communicate among themselves .
Why should they use for that purpose languages which , besides being associated with cultural pressures from powerful countries , are full of complications that are totally irrelevant to the African context , not to mention the fact that using European languages can only perpetuate divisions stemming from the colonial past ?
If Esperanto were introduced into elementary schools all through Africa , every one could retain his dialect or language and the culture associated with it , and still be capable of communicating with fellow Africans – and with many people all over the world , many of them not belonging to the socially privileged – whatever their respective mother tongues .
Instead of spending years of painstaking efforts to master the intricacies of French past participles or the elusive subtleties of English grammar and usage , would it not be a benefit for all African children to acquire an easy but expressive language which , belonging to no people in particular , belongs equally to all ?
Dear Mikaela ,
I forgive you .
You probably never realized , perhaps until now , that government hurts people .
I do not know you , but from listening to what you ’ve said on the radio and reading about you on the Internet , I imagine that like many people , you believe that government is a handy tool you can use to make life better for people .
While your intentions may be pure , the method is not .
Government is force .
Were you oblivious to that fact ?
After all , you are one of the people calling themselves part of the “ City of Keene ” , so whether you knew or not , that ’s the tool you advocate .
I ’m guessing you did n’t know , as you did say on 08/09/08 ’s “ Talkback ” :
“ I would n’t advise aggressing against anybody . ”
I really appreciated when you said that !
I think people working together voluntarily is a great thing .
However , threatening people with violence is not a nice way to build a community with mutual respect .
Based on your statement on Talkback , I thought you understood that .
Imagine my surprise when I discovered it was you who snitched me out to the “ code enforcers ” over my tenants ’ couch .
You said you would n’t advise aggressing against your neighbor , then the very same week you initiated aggression against me !
I do n’t know whether you realized that what you did was aggression ( It is , in the same way that hiring a hitman makes you responsible for the hit , even though you did n’t actually pull the trigger . ) , but either way I forgive you .
Additionally , you need n’t be afraid of me snitching you out for something about your property that I do n’t like , as I do n’t believe your property is any of my business .
Perhaps fear of retaliation was why you were afraid to come and meet me like a good neighbor would have instead of running to the “ code enforcers ” and having them threaten me into complying with your “ city ” ordinances .
Did you realize at any point that men with guns would actually throw me into a prison cell over this ?
That ’s exactly what happened , because force is the only tool government has at its disposal .
Of course the irony of the entire situation is that it would only cost a few bucks to take the couch out to the dump , but instead your friends in the “ City of Keene ” were willing to spend thousands of taxpayer dollars to lock me in a cage for several months over this issue !
How does that make any sense ?
To answer my own question , the reason they were willing to hurt me and my family ( my wonderful companion Julia was made quite ill by my absence , and could n’t work ) is because it ’s not about the couch , but about being obedient to the arbitrary dictates of the people calling themselves the government .
So , you were either ignorant about the coercive nature of the agency that employs you , or you ’re completely aware of government ’s coercive nature and you embrace it .
I will presume the former , because I like to believe that people are generally good , and I believe that you are probably a very good person , just misled .
I can relate as I was also ignorant to the violence of the system at one time .
Then I discovered the ideas of liberty and allowing others to be free .
I forgive you for hurting me and my loved ones , Mikaela .
You have no obligation to do so , but an apology from you would sure go a long way to healing the wounds and proving to the world ( I imagine you ’ve gotten a few emails and phone calls from those watching this situation . ) that you understand that what you did was wrong .
I also hope to hear that you have embraced the idea of honoring your neighbors ’ choices , even if you disagree with them .
Do n’t hesitate to get in touch .
I do n’t bite !
Your peaceful , down - the - street neighbor ,
Ian Freeman
I asked the guy at Circuit City for the computer that can get onto Web 2.0 but I 'm still not sure how to get there .
I spent like $ 3500 on it but I do n't see any difference !!
Do I need a new Internet Explorer ?
I saw that the new internet is 2.0 in Time magazine and I 'm really excited .
Is it out yet ??
BlackBerry maker Research in Motion sued Motorola over claims the mobile phone maker is improperly blocking it from offering jobs to laid - off Motorola workers , Bloomberg said .
RIM , in a complaint filed in state court in Chicago , asked for an order invalidating an agreement the companies reached this year not to solicit each other 's employees , the news agency said .
The agreement expired in August and is no longer enforceable , the agency said , citing the complaint .
Motorola is improperly trying to expand the agreement " to prevent the RIM entities from hiring any Motorola employees , including the thousands of employees Motorola has already fired or will fire , " RIM was quoted as saying in the complaint by the agency .
The lawsuit comes three months after Motorola sued RIM in Chicago in violation of the agreement , according to the agency .
In that case , Motorola asked a judge to bar RIM from using Motorola 's confidential information or soliciting or hiring any Motorola employees , the agency said .
The agreement is part of a February nondisclosure accord under which the companies agreed to exchange information about a confidential matter , the agency said , citing the complaint .
RIM and Motorola could not be immediately reached for comment .
One of our readers kindly emailed to let me know they were doing a documentary on an intersex person named Adele .
Maxx Ginnane ( Director ) emailed me with this :
" I am now making a full length film about intersex , including the stories of what is happening to the babies born visibly intersex and gender variant children as they grow up and approach puberty .
There 's currently still a debate in the medical community about how these young people should be treated .
I 'm seeking the input of doctors , parents , and of course , other intersex people in this project .
If you would like to get in touch , my address is palya@hotmail.com "
Below is a clip of the film and a little bit of info about the documentary :
When Adele was born they could n't tell if she was a girl or a boy .
A series of childhood genital operations ' corrected ' her into a boy but as she grew up it became apparent a mistake had been made .
Now at 29 Adele is trying to transition into a woman , only to find she belongs somewhere in between .
1 in 2000 babies are born like Adele and she asks if it is n't time to make room in our society for more than two genders .

I have officially given up trying to figure these big furless cats out .
Look , you can see the apathy sneaking into my eyes in the picture .
Purr .
Then Fark picked up the story .
Can you imagine my embarassment ?
Actually , you probably can .
God knows the furless on the Interweb are feline abusers of the worst kind .
Just use Google Image Search .

Erp. What are you going to do , eh ?
Ah , well , at least the other humans in the house are nice to me .

We have looked closely in the past at the importance of post-election audits and the essential role that they play in guaranteeing election integrity .
Many state and local governments have been slow to institute adequate audit procedures , but that could soon change .
Colorado's Boulder County has taken a big step forward with a comprehensive auditing strategy that leverages open source software to boost election integrity .
Boulder County adopted ElectionAudits , an open source software program that implements a " risk - limiting " audit system modeled after the concepts described in Principles and Best Practices for Post Election Audits — a guide that is endorsed by the Brennan Center for Justice , Verified Voting , and a number of various state - based election integrity advocacy groups .
In a risk - limiting audit , the sample size of randomly selected ballots in each precinct is based on the margin of victory .
A higher volume of records will be analyzed in tight contests where the winner 's lead was narrow .
Experts say that this kind of audit is more reliable and statistically rigorous than audits that use a predetermined fixed percentage of ballots for every precinct .
ElectionAudits supports several different techniques for computing sample sizes in risk - limiting elections , including the " negative - exponential " method ( NEGEXP ) and the " probability proportional to error bounds , with replacement " method ( PPEBWR ) .
Boulder County used NEGEXP , which was first introduced in a paper that was published earlier this year by Northeastern University researcher Javed A. Aslam and MIT researchers Ronald L. Rivest and Raluca A. Popa .
Their paper , On Auditing Elections When Precincts Have Different Sizes , compares several different methodologies and suggests that NEGEXP " appears to have near - optimal efficiency . "
Presentation slide by Raluca A. Popa
The ElectionAudits software , which was largely developed by Neal McBurnett , is built with the Python programming language and the Django framework .
The source code is available for download from the project 's version control repository and is distributed under the MIT license .
Some of the source code for the election computations was adapted from a Python script written by Rivest , who is best known for his role in creating the RSA encryption algorithm and is a member of the Election Assistance Commission 's technical guidelines development committee .
ElectionAudits was used in Boulder following the general election to conduct what election officials say could be the most extensive risk - limiting audit in history .
The county plans to encourage broader adoption of the methodology and hopes that it will be endorsed by the Colorado Election Reform Commission .
" The overall results give us more confidence than ever in the reported results for this election , based on the close agreement between the hand counts and machine counts , " a representative of Boulder County said in a statement .
" The audit also set new standards for transparency and verifiability .
All the detail on results to be audited was published on the web before the random selection of batches to be audited was done .
Peer - reviewed procedures for ensuring verifiably random dice throws and selections were used . "
The development of the ElectionAudits software is a big step in the right direction for election integrity and accountable democracy .
Modern voting technology poses significant challenges , but it is clear that open software and collaborative innovation can make a big difference and help ensure that the election process remains transparent .

9:57 p.m. Eastern | Wrap - up From Magdalena Sharpe , inside the NBA restaurant at the Target Center : For Sean Klein , 25 , and his brother Sasha , 22 , from Hollywood , Fla. , the message of Mr. Paul — and the entire day — was clear .
“ Holding the government responsible to abide by their own rule book , the Constitution , ” Sean said .
Both brothers said they believe the only logical way Americans can fulfill their basic wants — health , happiness and prosperity — is by restricting the powers of the government , which is what they feel Mr. Paul is trying to do .
The brothers said they worry about the economy , mostly American monetary policy , and the war in Iraq , as well as the possibility of other military interventions on the horizon .
“ The status quo is not working , ” Sasha said .
8:25 p.m. Eastern | Real Change Ron Paul finished up a wide - ranging address to an adoring crowd looking to where both go from here , and assuring his supporters that they would go somewhere .
“ When an idea ’s time has come it can not be stopped by any army or any country , ” Mr. Paul said .
Mr. Paul said that his “ Campaign for Liberty ” was the real “ change ” campaign , in apparent reference to Barack Obama ’s campaign theme , and that John McCain and Mr. Obama shared essentially the same philosophy on foreign policy .
But Mr. Paul made no further mention of the Democratic or Republican presidential candidates .
The latter parts of Mr. Paul ’s speech focused instead on two themes , thanking his supporters for their past work and rallying them to carry on the cause .
“ Can you imagine going from those 12 spammers we had in the beginning to what we have here tonight , ” Mr. Paul said .
“ I firmly believe that our day is coming , ” Mr. Paul said .
7:45 p.m. Eastern | Paul Speaks Magdalena Sharpe and Micah Cohen report that Representative Ron Paul has taken the floor .
The crowd had swelled to its largest number of the day , and Mr. Paul noted it : “ It confirms my conviction that freedom brings people together , ” he says .
The lights dim each time Mr. Paul speaks only to be turned all the way up along with the applause .
Mr. Paul , a slight man , speaks broadly about what he sees as the dangers of an over - reaching federal government .
“ There is nothing in the Constitution that says the federal government should be involved in government , at all , ” he says .
Mr. Paul cheers on his younger supporters , thanking them for their responses to his campaign .
He mentions how many of his young supporters , many 14 or 15 , bring their parents in to meet him .
The “ revolution ” will not end after the election , Mr. Paul says , and adds that he hopes that his campaign for the Republican nomination , though unsuccessful , moved ahead changes he believes were inevitable anyway .
On his losing campaign , Mr. Paul does not necessarily admit defeat ; he does say that he believes he was not taken seriously as a candidate and did not get all the attention his candidacy warranted .
However , he said , “ The more that the establishment ignored us , the more it energized you . ”
The crowd reacts with a roar , and the lights flicker on .
8:43 p.m. Eastern | Just Like Dad Barry Goldwater Jr. , got a warm welcome here , and an even warmer response when he started his speech asking , “ Are you ready for Ron Paul tonight ? ”
Mr. Goldwater called for the Ron Paul Revolution to take back the Republican Party , likening it to what his father had done in the 1960s .
The younger Goldwater also dismissed the buzzword of the 2008 presidential election , change , as code for “ more of the same . ”
Mr. Paul is “ our messenger , our leader , our inspiration , ” Mr. Goldwater said .
Mr. Goldwater went on to say that Mr. Paul ’s “ courage , his revolution and his candor have set this nation on course . ”
Mr. Goldwater concluded , “ Ron Paul campaigned with my father back in the ’60s , and now another Goldwater is campaigning with Ron Paul . ”
( Senator John McCain , the presumed Republican nominee , has always claimed the mantle of former Senator Goldwater , especially as he assumed Mr. Goldwater ’s Arizona seat . )
7:15 p.m. Eastern | Blimp Sighting !
Ron Paul has celebrity supporters , too , or at least celebrity performers .
Aimee Allen , a pop music star , is on stage revving up the crowd for Mr. Paul ’s speech , set to take place in a couple hours .
Sara Evans , country music star , will perform after he speaks .
The weather has cleared up outside and the crowd seems to have grown , both in size in and in volume .
There has also been a blimp sighting .
Well , to be fair , its not the blimp , but a smaller blow - up model hanging high center stage , with the same message as the full - size one Paul supporters floated earlier this year , “ Ron Paul Revolution . ”
7:04 p.m. Eastern | Less Is More Joby Weeks , 27 , from Denver is here “ playing hooky ” from his role as a Republican delegate , he said .
He said he is both a strong Ron Paul supporter and an anti-government activist .
He thinks that the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks were a government conspiracy and that the federal government is too large .
During Jesse Ventura ’s speech , Mr. Weeks chanted , “ inside job , ” when Mr. Ventura called for a reinvestigation into 9/11 , though later he said he would be concerned about who carried out the new investigation .
Mr. Weeks said he also favors abolishing about half of all federal government agencies , most especially the Federal Reserve and the IRS to allow a free and unfettered market economy where competiton thrives .
As for Mr. Paul , he admires his foreign policy positions , he said .
“ America has become a big arms deal and Ron Paul believes in non-interventionism .
I want to bring state sovereignty back , and reinstating the Constitution is what Ron Paul believes . ”
Stephanie Stolba , who accompanied Mr. Weeks , said , “ We need to quit focusing on rights being seen as privileges . ”
6:19 p.m. Eastern | Ready to Rumble
And now the marquee speakers are starting to come out , starting with Jesse Ventura , the former Minnesota governor , pro-wrestler and all - around political gadfly .
Mr. Ventura , sporting a tattered yellow T - shirt under he sports coat , blue jeans and baseball cap ( which he did remove when addressing the crowd ) , came out fighting .
He started his speech by encouraging the crowd to boo : “ Booing does not bother me , remember , I see it as a sign of affection . ”
And so the crowd booed , loudly and often .
Mr. Ventura proudly identified himself as neither Republican or Democrat and ignited praise ( boos ) when he yelled out to the crowd that both parties are destroying the country .
His litany of complaints : Both the Democrats and Republicans share responsibility for the nation ’s state ; the national debt is inexcusable ; the Constitution is being trashed ; 9/11 must be re-investigated .
His overall message :
It is time to stand up and take the country back .
How ?
By coming to conventions like these and by holding both your heart and your conscious responsible .
And , he said , when you support independent candidates , never let a Republican or a Democrat tell you that you have wasted your vote .
5:50 p.m. Eastern | Family Outing As Conrad Mulcahy reports , families are in no short supply at the Rally for the Republic .
The Keagle family — all 10 of them — from South Central Iowa , about 30 minutes south of Des Moines , were excited as they arrived at the Target Center in downtown Minneapolis this afternoon .
Although the family was there mostly to enjoy an afternoon of speakers , Christa Keagle , the matriarch , said she was a strong supporter of Ron Paul , in particular his stand on the importance of the Constitution .
“ We like how he is bringing up the issues that too many people have been ignoring , ” Ms. Keagle said as she held the youngest of her eight children , Rebekah , who was born a little over two months ago .
“ He ’s lighting fires to get people motivated to try to get our country back to where it was founded , ” she added .
When asked why she and her husband David decided to bring their children to the event today , Ms. Keagle explained that she wants them to see a grassroots political movement firsthand .
Children today , she said , seem to have lost hope and lost track of the idea that individuals can make a difference .
“ You do n’t have to sit back and let everyone tell you what to do .
You can make changes , ” she said , addressing both her children and the question .
That message , it seemed , was already registering with her children .
After a passer - by stopped , patted Timothy , 11 , on the shoulder and told him to “ save the Constitution ” , he was asked how he felt about that kind of responsibility .
“ I feel Ron Paul ’s message on that is exactly perfect , ” he said .
“ I like it here , ” he added enthusiatically .
4:39 p.m. Eastern | Twin Fans Joyce Morrell from Indianapolis and Joan Lewis from Winslow , Ariz. , two sisters , have made it to Minneapolis to meet with fellow Paulites .
The women describe themselves as Constitutional Republicans , meaning more conservative thinkers who want more emphasis on the Constitution in public policy .
The sisters lament the loss of rights , which they said are part of the legacy of both major parties .
Of Mr. Paul , they say , “ We believe about 99.9 percent of what he is saying ; he is a man of value and has a lot to teach us about the Constitution . ”
One issue that particuarly worries them is the lack of education being provided about the Constitution , something they said they believe would improve under Mr. Paul .
By the way :
One commenter has pointed out that Mr. Paul is actually Dr. Paul , and indeed he was a practicing physician .
But he is not speaking as a physician here , so in Times style he is referred to as “ Mr . ”
4:15 p.m. Eastern | Mr. Hope Bill Kauffman , an author with a conservative / libertarian take on the state of the nation , speaks and takes a quick swing at both the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees , saying Americans cannot look toward either of them to find hope .
Singing a quick verse from the Ray Charles song , “ Hit the road , Jack , ” he tells the major party ’s nominees , “ do n’t ya come back no more no more no more no more . ”
He attacks Senator Barack Obama , accusing him of seeing people in small town America as losers ( apparently picking up on Mr. Obama ’s “ bitter ” comments at a California fund - raising event this spring ) .
Cheers erupt when Mr. Kauffman refers to Mr. Paul as a man worthy of 1776 .
That is where the nation ’s hope lies , he seems to say .
3:29 p.m. Eastern | Welcome , Republicans Jeff Palmer , an alternate delegate from Durham , N.C. , has been a Ron Paul supporter since Mr. Paul announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination .
Mr. Paul is still a Republican and refused to continue his candidacy as an independent or Libertarian ( though he also has yet to endorse his party ’s nominee , Senator John McCain ) .
“ I am amazed at this event and how this campaign has grown organically , ” Mr. Palmer said .
Indeed , Mr. Paul ’s popularity caught people by surprise , but many people who became supporters identified with him during the early , crowded Republican debates .
Before anyone knew it , Ron Paul lawn signs were popping up all over America and his Web site ( and those of his supporters ) was bringing in gobs of cash .
Alternate delegates have been encouraged to pass out V.I.P passes to delegates at the Republican National Convention to encourage Republicans to cross the river to this event .
The goal is to “ amaze them with Representative Paul ’s message , ” Mr. Palmer said .
Clarification : Alternate delegates to the R.N.C. who are Ron Paul supporters are being encouraged by the Paul campaign to pass out V.I.P. passes to their fellow Republican delegates , to entice them to visit the Rally for the Republic .
2:10 p.m. Eastern | Who is Ron Paul ?
More from Magdalena Sharpe :
The crowd continues to trickle in .
The hall des n’t look jam packed , but perhaps many of us have a distorted view after Senator Barack Obama ’s acceptance speech before nearly 80,000 people at Invesco Stadium last Thursday .
A little off schedule , but full speed ahead , Tucker Carlson starts things off , at around 1:15 p.m .
He ticks off three things the crowd should know about Mr. Paul .
1 . He does n’t care what those in Washington think .
His point of view is ‘ adults disagree and that ’s just a fact . ’
2 . He is a sincerely decent human being who is kind to people around him .
3 . He has absolutely zero interest in controlling the government .
( We ’re not sure what that means , but the crowd ate it up . )
1:45 p.m. Eastern Colonial Spirit
Is the Rally for the Republic also an excuse to dress - up ?
The mood is Colonial , with no wigs but plenty of Tricorne hats and bonnets .
The Davis family , here from Springfield , Mo. , have gone all - out for the occasion .
Charity and Aaron Davis and their 4 children : Zion , 8 ; Zacaharia , 7 ; and twins ( enter twin city pun here ) Alma and Auloria , 10 , are all decked out in their finest colonial duds .
“ The Constitution is a big part of our home - schooling curriculum , ” says Mrs. Davis , and their attire is meant to evoke that time - period .
So does this visit officially constitute a field trip ?
1:15 p.m. Eastern | Rain or Shine Magdalena Sharpe reports from the Target Center :
The rainy weather has done nothing to stop Paul supporters from coming out in large numbers to participate in the Rally .
Mr. Paul has not run the most traditional of campaigns , and it appears so far that his RNC counter convention will also follow its own off - the - beaten - path schedule .
The speakers are set to begin momentarily , with Tucker Carlson opening things up .
— –
MINNEAPOLIS —
Here in the other Twin City , the wait today is not for President Bush , not for Gov. Sarah Palin , not even for Senator John McCain .
No , the wait is for a man who until this year was a little - known congressman from Texas .
We speak of none other than Ron Paul .
Mr. Paul ’s unsuccessful candidacy for the Republican nomination — from which he has since retired — spawned a national movement .
And that movement is coalescing here in Minnesota today , as Paulites , libertarians and others with anti-war , low - tax and pro-privacy leanings gather at a “ Rally for the Republic , ” at the Target Center here .
The event , which is expected to attract as many as 18,000 , is a counter convention to the Republican doings in St. Paul .
The events are set to begin soon , with a long list of speakers , including Mr. Paul himself later tonight .
The day will not end with any nominations ; Mr. Paul , who is merely running for re-election to Congress , is no longer seeking the presidency or any other national seat .
But it ’s sure to be filled with fiery speeches , colorful characters and rebellious rhetoric .
A team of Times reporters will be reporting on the “ Rally for Liberty ” throughout the day .
Stay tuned .
As explosions echoed in the distance and Israeli aircraft roared overhead , many residents in Gaza City were hunkered down in their houses yesterday , praying the bombs would spare them and worrying about how to feed their families and keep them warm should they survive .
" We still do n't dare go outside .
Nowhere feels safe , " Faysal Shawa , a construction engineer , said by telephone from the house where he lives with his wife and three children .
" Gaza is so small that when the Israelis bomb us it feels like they are bombing our own houses .
There is a government building about 100 metres from where I live and it has been hit a number of times .
My children are completely terrified .
" People in Gaza are used to dealing with hardship , but this time the bombings are absolutely terrifying , and what makes this attack worse is that for the past 18 months we have been living with little electricity , water and food .
For the children it is like living in hell .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" This has to stop and it must stop now .
Both sides are making the same mistakes again and again and it is the Palestinian people that suffer , " Mr Shawa said .
At that point , an explosion was heard close to the house and the engineer said he had to end the call to take his children to the cellar .
Gazan hospitals were running out of medical supplies to treat the wounded , and residents who had escaped unscathed were running out of basic foods and fuel .
" It is completely impossible to get any commodities now , " said Sameh Habeeb , 23 , an aid worker .
" There is little electricity , all the bakeries and shops are shut and you cannot get any cooking gas .
It 's getting cold at night which means those families that do n't have any gas will just have to use blankets to keep warm . "
Like many Gazans , Sameh Habeeb was adamant that far from diminishing Hamas as a fighting force , the Israeli attack that dealt Palestinians one of their bloodiest days , would simply bolster support for the group among ordinary Palestinians .
" The Israelis seem to have widened their targets .
They are clearly trying to destroy Hamas 's entire infrastructure but my guess is that Hamas will just wait for the bombing to be over .
This will not weaken them . "
Six Circles Theorem
Starting with a triangle , draw a circle touching two sides .
Then draw a circle tangent to this circle and two other sides .
Continue in the same direction .
The result is a chain of circles in which the sixth circle is tangent to the first .
In August , the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , a government - sponsored panel of medical experts , issued new recommendations regarding prostate cancer screening : Men ages 75 and over should no longer be screened for prostate cancer with the PSA blood test or digital rectal exam .
An unexpected benefit may be an improvement in the doctor - patient relationship .
The rectal exam can be one of the odder moments between a patient and his doctor .
Not long ago , for example , I saw a 75 - year - old for his routine annual visit .
Things were not going well for him .
His wife ’s dementia was worsening daily .
She would leave the stove on , accuse him of stealing her things , holler at him day and night .
And yet he could not imagine putting her in a nursing home .
His eyes , usually sparkling with delight , were dull .
As I examined his heart and lungs , neck and belly , ankles and feet , he heaved a long sigh .
I felt gloomy about his wretched situation .
Advertisement
I must have been preoccupied , because when it was time for the rectal exam , I bumbled my words .
I asked him to lower his pants , but instead of saying “ Lie on the table , ” I told him to lie on the floor .
The patient and I burst out laughing .
Still chuckling , I stepped out of the room so he could get ready .
To be sure , my bumble had brought levity to a traditionally awkward moment -- but why , I asked myself , did this encounter have to end with an examination of his anus ?
I was drawn to primary - care medicine by the human connection that comes with the white coat and stethoscope , the prospect of people willing to share their everyday thoughts and deepest secrets , and their expectation that I would use this information to help them .
What I did n’t fully grasp was that this intimacy also had a critical physical component -- one that came gloved and lubed .
Advertisement
I ’d never imagined that performing rectal exams would become a daily reality .
Most of my patients are men over 50 , which means that I ask them if they ’d like to be screened for prostate cancer .
Some inquire whether the PSA ( prostate - specific antigen ) blood test alone will suffice .
I explain that it ’s most informative to have both the PSA and the digital exam :
Some cancers hide in prostate nodules in men whose PSA readings are normal .
So for men under 75 and over 50 ( earlier for higher - risk men ) who wish to be screened , just as important as the PSA is the old - fashioned , low - tech way with a pair of rubber gloves , a foil packet of lubricating jelly and an index finger .
For years I did n’t feel confident in my ability to do a good rectal exam .
In medical school , we spent about two months learning the heart exam , maybe one month on the lungs .
The rectal exam was granted a single session .
Advertisement
Not surprising :
It ’s one thing for a parade of students to line up , stethoscopes ready , at the bedside of a chatty patient with a heart murmur ; it ’s quite another to find a patient willing to roll over and endure a series of rectal exams by unskilled , anonymous fingers .
The result : a culture of squeamishness .
During residency , I did a lot of rectal exams and tried to get a sense of the prostate ’s normal size and consistency .
But often I was n’t sure of myself .
Was a slight asymmetry a normal variant or something worrisome ?
I probably sent too many patients to urologists earlier in my career because of my self - doubt , but that was better , I suppose , than missing something .
And although plenty of men will hop onto the exam table without hesitation , there ’s no shortage of reluctant and nay - saying patients , of awkward silences followed by excuses .
Advertisement
One patient I recall stole a glance at my hands , the muscles in his face relaxing ever - so - slightly when he looked at my fingers .
“ My old doctor , ” he said , “ had thick fingers , like sausages . ”
Another said , “ My other doctor did one a few months ago , I think . ”
And another , “ Next time , I promise . ”
Many opt for the PSA without the rectal exam .
Back in my exam room , the patient lay on the exam table in a fetal position , pants down , buttocks exposed , testicles dangling .
I examined his rectal area for internal hemorrhoids , the subtle edge of an anal fissure , the flat cauliflower of an anal wart , and found none .
Advertisement
I touched the precise spot of the anal skin that elicits the mischievously named “ anal wink reflex , ” a test of nerve function .
I dabbed my finger with the jelly and eased it in against the muscular resistance until I touched the prostate .
To feel the whole prostate and distinguish between its two lobes , I bent my knees , turned my arm upside down and swiveled my finger to reach the other side of the gland .
It was the size of an apricot , smooth and rubbery .
As usual , I grimaced :
The rectum has muscles that clench and unclench at the slightest sensation , and it always feels odd to have my finger locked in that tight embrace .
It does n’t get more intimate than this .
Then I closed my eyes and focused on all of the nerve endings packed closely in my fingertip .
As my finger swept the prostate gland , I felt its normal consistency , its symmetry and , to my relief , not a single nodule .
Advertisement
It was almost a Zen moment : worlds of otherwise hidden information uncovered through careful probing -- earlier , via conversation ; now , via a digit .
I wiped my finger on the stool - sample card and discarded my gloves .
The old man looked over his shoulder from the table , the twinkle in his eyes returned .
“ Does this mean we ’re friends ? ”
There ’s nothing like an awkward joke to defuse an awkward moment .
But thanks to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , there may now be fewer of both .

Says Hindu zionists and Mossad behind attacks meant to imitate 9/11
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Wednesday , Dec 3 , 2008
A renowned Pakistani strategic defence analyst has described last week ’s terrorist attacks in Mumbai as a “ botched ” false flag operation designed to imitate the 9/11 attacks on the United States .
Zaid Hamid , a security consultant who routinely appears on Pakistani television , told reporters of the News
One channel that the attacks were state sponsored by Indian military intelligence and carried out by Hindu zionists aided by Mossad , the Israeli intelligence agency .
Hamid contends that the motive is to shift attention away from India ’s domestic terrorists , and to justify Western intervention in Pakistan .
“ They look like Hindus .
No Pakistani speaks the language they chatted in , ” said Hamid , claiming that the attackers wore saffron Hindu Zionist wrist bands .
“ The Americans executed the 9/11 attack perfectly . ” Hamid continued .
“ They managed the media very well .
The Indians tried to repeat the formula but goofed up .
The idiots made a complete mess of it , ” he argued .
Video of Hamid ’s comments have been uploaded to youtube .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Hamid , who also hosts his own “ Brasstacks ” show on the News One channel , has long asserted that the U.S. wishes to eliminate Pakistan ’s nuclear facilities which are seen as a direct threat to Israel ’s sovereignty .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Hamid also told viewers that during the first five minutes of the attack , three Indian counterterrorist officers were killed by authorities in order to halt their investigations of a terror network within India ’s security agencies .
One of those men was India ’s top antiterrorist officer Hemant Karkare , who was shot three times in the chest as he led his men at the Taj Mahal Palace .
Karkare was on the verge of uncovering the home - grown terror franchise of the Hindu extremists .
He had also received death threats just hours before the attacks .
Karkare was investigating a bomb attack that killed at least six people near a mosque in the western city of Malegaon on September 29 .
In early November his Anti-Terror Squad arrested senior Military Intelligence officer Colonel Srikant Prasad Purohit on suspicion of involvement in the attack which was carried out by Hindu extremists .
Colonel Purohit was also under investigation for the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings , which killed 68 people , mostly Pakistanis .
Investigations into this will now likely be halted .
Analysts claim that the Mumbai bombings represent a desperate move on behalf of separatists within the Indian establishment who want to shift the country away from independence and into the new world order model .

Police have prevented two marches by anti-government demonstrators in Moscow and St Petersburg , detaining at least 100 protesters .
Police trucks ringed two Moscow squares where protesters were to gather , and officers arrested dozens of people .
In St Petersburg , police blocked 100 protesters from marching on the city 's main thoroughfare , arresting 10 people .
The protests were the latest organised by former chess champion Garry Kasparov 's Other Russia movement .
Other Russia has tried to stage several protests it calls dissenters ' marches .
Among those arrested on Sunday was Mr Kasparov 's fellow leader , Eduard Limonov .
The Moscow authorities had warned that Sunday 's demonstration , which had not been given permission , would be " firmly stopped by law enforcement officers within the framework of the law " .
The latest protests follow the founding on Saturday of a new umbrella movement for Kremlin opponents , called Solidarity .
It is named after the Polish trade union that first breached the communist dominance in the former Soviet bloc .
' Impossible to reform '
Mr Kasparov said on Saturday that Solidarity 's goal was " dismantling the Putin regime " .
" It is impossible to reform this regime , " he told more than 100 delegates at the founding congress in the Khimki area of Moscow .
Other leaders include a former deputy prime minister , Boris Nemtsov .
A pro-Kremlin youth movement , Young Russia , set off smoke bombs outside the conference hall .
Some wore monkey masks and taunted delegates by tossing bananas at them .

Facts are Facts
I ’m a rationalist .
I depend on evidence , not rumors , and not blind faith .
A recent matter has come to my attention , and needs a definitive statement .
The International Astronomical Union is the group internationally recognized to have the authority to name astronomical entities – such as moon craters and stars – that other fly - by - night , totally invented , commercially - designed agencies only purport to have .
They sell craters and novae to just anyone , but when the IAU assigns a name , that 's official !
A few readers have been chortling over the fact that asteroid 3163 Randi – formerly known as 1981 QM – has now been joined by rocks named in honor of P. Z. Myers , Rebecca Watson , Mike Stackpole , and even JREF president Phil Plait !
Now , these folks obviously have their rights to fame , but my enjoyment of this honor is somewhat dimmed by the fact that asteroids are being so easily handed out , left and right …
Mind you , luminaries such as Arthur C. Clarke , Isaac Asimov , and Martin Gardner – in whose collective reflected glory I often revel – have their own assigned asteroids , too , but I searched about for some aspect of this process in which I might find some specific relief , particularly in respect to JREF associates .
And there is satisfaction to be had !
I assigned my trusty personal aide , Sean McCabe , to look up the data on the pertinent rocks , and he came up with these interesting figures .
The names shown are those assigned by the IAU :
PERSON
Asteroid ’s new name
Former name Size Myers 153298 Paulmyers 2001 FC122 2.6 km Watson 153289 Rebeccawatson 2001 FB10 4.3 km Stackpole 165612 Stackpole 2001 FP86 1.7 km Plait 165347 Philplait 2000 WG11 1.3 km Randi 3163 Randi 1981 QM
12 km
The satisfaction to be had ?
That my very personal asteroid – at 12 km , note !
– is 9 times the size of Phil’s , and almost 3 times that of Rebecca ’s …
So , I ’ve decided that size does matter , after all !
( The origin of this obsession with asteroid size can be found in this article – just do a search for “ delightful . ” )
British citizens can be extradited to other European Union countries with minimal safeguards against injustice something amply illustrated by the case of Andrew Symeou a nineteen - year - old London man .
In July 2007 Mr Symeou took a holiday on the Greek Island of Zante .
He returned home on 22nd July and told his parents what an enjoyable time he'd had .
On 20th July in the Rescue nightclub another young man , Jonathon Hiles , was allegedly punched or pushed from a raised dance podium and sustained head injuries from which he died on 22 July .
On 24 July two young friends of Mr Symeou who remained on Zante were taken into police custody for questioning .
According to them they were held for over eight hours , deprived of food and water , beaten , punched , slapped and threatened until they signed statements written in Greek implicating Mr Symeou in the death of Mr Hiles .
As soon as they were freed from custody they contacted British consular officials , reported their alleged mistreatment and retracted their statements .
The only evidence against Mr Symeou consists of physical descriptions of the assailant that do n't match him , and the statements extracted from his friends under duress .
The incident took place at about 1 am and Mr Syemou claims that he visited the nightclub at about 4 am and stayed for only about 20 minutes .
Mr Symeou claims that he did not even know about the incident until his friends returned home and told him , and that he never knew , met or saw Mr Hiles .
Mr Symeou was never invited to give his version of events to Greek police or summoned before a Greek court , but almost one year later on 18th June 2008 a European Arrest Warrant was issued in the UK for his extradition to Greece .
On 12th August Mr Symeou found himself in the Horseferry Magistrates Court .
The European Arrest Warrant was introduced into force on 1st January 2004 under the usual justification of protecting us against organised crime and terrorism .
All that is required for the deportation of a suspect under an EAW is basic information about their identity and the alleged offence .
There are thirty - two categories of crime for which extradition may be sought , some of them not specific offences under English law .
There is no provision for a British court to be allowed to assure itself that there is a proper case for the accused to answer by means of examining prima facie evidence , and there is no provision for the magistrate hearing the extradition case , or indeed the home secretary , to have any discretion to refuse extradition if they believe or know that an injustice is being done .
The safeguards against misuse are absolutely minimal : provided that the correct information has been provided ( which is minimal ) then a British citizen can be extradited to another EU member state with as much ceremony as posting a parcel .
Andrew Symeou 's lawyer was only able to oppose extradition because he had managed to obtain copies of the Greek authority 's paperwork and contended that they had not followed their own legal procedures correctly .
The European Arrest Warrant is another manifestation of the European Union 's headlong flight into harmonisation of all things , in this case Europe 's legal systems .
This has profound implications for all of us : any one of us , our children , wives , husbands , relatives or friends could face extradition to any EU country without a British court being able to hear even basic evidence and being satisfied there is a case to answer .
Mr Symeou found himself back in the Horesferry Magistrates Court on 30th October to hear their ruling .
The Court found against Mr Symeou , and although he has seven days to appeal , it is likely he will face extradition to Greece to face months or years in prison waiting for his case to be heard .
British courts now have no power to consider the evidence against a British citizen who is the subject extradition under a European Arrest Warrant .
They have no power to prevent injustices being done even if it is manifestly obvious that that is about to happen .
In all of this we must not forget the victim , Jonathan Hiles and his family .
They are entitled to justice as much as defendant is entitled to protection .
But in these circumstances surely the family and friends of the victim , just as much as those of the defendant , would want to know that the correct person is facing extradition and trial by means of the safeguard that a British court can hear the prima facie evidence against them and rule that there is a proper case to answer ?
Neither party now enjoys that safeguard .

Japan's Automated Eco Cycle Parks Bikes Underground
December 17th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
One major deterrent for city bicyclists is lack of parking .
Some Japanese cities have taken it upon themselves to remedy the problem with the Eco Cycle , a profoundly weird machine that takes your bike and parks it underground for safe - keeping .
The Eco Cycle costs 2,600 yen for a monthly ticket .
What do you think — would you trust your bike here ?

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
ZURICH ( Reuters ) - Geneva - based banks and investment funds have lost more than 5 billion Swiss francs ( $ 4.22 billion ) in the alleged $ 50 billion fraud by former Nasdaq chairman Bernard Madoff , Swiss newspaper Le Temps reported on Saturday .
Union Bancaire Privee ( UBP ) , a leading bank for investment in funds of hedge funds , has lost about 1 billion Swiss francs , said Le Temps , which spoke to various unnamed banking sources for its article .
A spokesman for UBP said the bank had no comment with regards to the article .
UBP had 127 billion Swiss francs of assets under management at the end of June .
Geneva - based private bank Benedict Hentsch said on Friday its exposure to Madoff products was 56 million francs , or 5 percent of its asset under management .
The bank merged three months ago with alternative investment specialist Fairfield Greenwich Group , which has invested $ 7.5 billion or half of its assets in one of the funds set up by Madoff .
Le Temps quoted one of Benedict Hentsch ’s partners as saying he and another partner were rushing to New York to break the agreement with Fairfield .
The EIM Group , active in hedge funds , has said it is affected by $ 230 million or about 2 percent of its $ 11.5 billion assets under management , the paper reported .
No one was available to answer phone calls at the bank and there was no reply to a request for comment via email .
Le Temps also said that Notz , Stucki & Cie , a group that offers portfolio management for wealthy individuals , has also been hit by the Madoff scandal .
No one was available to answer phone calls at the bank and a phone message was not returned .
The vast majority of Geneva - based family offices have also been touched by the Madoff scandal , the newspaper said .
Benbassat & Cie had invested 1.1 billion francs in the Madoff funds , Le Temps said .
Telephone calls to the bank were not answered an email message was not returned .
Private bank Syz & Co told Le Temps that its 3A fund was not exposed to Madoff .
But it did not give details about a possible direct exposure of its private banking clients , the paper said .
Bank Pictet & Cie said it had “ never chosen any of the funds linked to Bernard Madoff in our hedge funds investment strategy . ”
Thierry Lombard , of private bank Lombard Odier Darier Hentsch , was quoted as saying : “ the Madoff universe has never been on our list of in - house funds nor in any of the open architecture funds . ”
Private bank Mirabaud said : “ We have an exposure of a few millions , not of tens of millions . ”
The Man Group , GAM -- controlled by Julius Baer , Gottex and Rotschild said they are out of trouble .
Julius Baer told Reuters on Friday it had no direct exposure .
UBS said its exposure was limited and insignificant .

Carl Sagan was one of the first to bring to the mass public a toolkit for deciphering science from pseudoscience when he published Demon - Haunted World in 1996 .
His " baloney detection kit " was a set of guidelines to help laypeople spot logical fallacies and other common flaws in popular pseudoscientific claims .
Many other great minds have continued in this tradition , and today we 're flush with similar lists .
In an effort to increase the confusion , I 've taken it upon myself to compile some of the best , mix them all up , pick and choose the best points , and distill them down into a single list .
In compiling this list , I owe the biggest debts to Dr. Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch.org , Dr. Tom Perls of AntiAgingQuackery.com , Dr. Michael Shermer of the Skeptics Society , and of course Dr. Carl Sagan .
All four of these guys have put in many years of hard work protecting the innocent public from harmful and untruthful pseudoscientific claims .
It 's no accident that common themes run through all of their work .
I 've created a 15 - point checklist that I call " How to Spot Pseudoscience . "
When you hear any claim about a new product , a new discovery , or some paranormal ability , run it through these fifteen questions and you 'll get a pretty clear idea of whether or not it has any merit .
1 . Does the claim meet the qualifications of a theory ?
Very few claims that are n't true actually qualify as theories .
Let 's review the four main requirements that a theory must fulfill .
1 ) A theory must originate from , and be well supported by , experimental evidence .
Anecdotal or unsubstantiated reports do n't qualify .
It must be supported by many strands of evidence , and not just a single foundation .
You 'll find that most pseudoscience is supported by only a single foundation .
2 ) A theory must be specific enough to be falsifiable by testing .
If it can not be tested or refuted , it can't qualify as a theory .
And if something is truly testable , others must be able to repeat the tests and get the same results .
You 'll find that this feature is truly rare among pseudosciences ; they 'll generally claim some excuse or make up a reason why it can't be tested or repeated by others .
3 ) A theory must make specific , testable predictions about things not yet observed .
4 ) A theory must allow for changes based on the discovery of new evidence .
It must be dynamic , tentative , and correctable .
You 'll find that most pseudoscience does not allow for changes based on new discoveries .
2 . Is the claim said to be based on ancient knowledge ?
This is a sure sign that the claim is not based on scientific evidence , and it 's intended to fool you into thinking that because the ancient Chinese believed it , it must have merit .
In fact many true theories are not very old at all , because they 've replaced older theories as knowledge has increased .
Generally , the more recent the evidence , the better scientific foundation it has .
3 . Was the claim first announced through mass media , or through scientific channels ?
Real discoveries go through an unbiased peer review process , which results in publication through scientific journals .
When a belief is first announced through the mass media , like Pons and Fleischman 's cold fusion experiments or like the Steorn Orbo perpetual motion machine , there 's generally a reason its proponents chose not to subject it to the scrutiny of peer review .
4 . Is the claim based on the existence of an unknown form of " energy " or other paranormal phenomenon ?
Loose , meaningless usage of a scientific - sounding word like " energy " is one of the most common red flags you 'll see on popular pseudoscience .
Terms like energy fields , negative energy , chi , orgone , aura , psi , and trans - dimensional energy are utterly meaningless in any scientific context .
Approach with extreme caution .
5 . Do the claimants state that their claim is being suppressed by authorities ?
This is usually a really frail excuse for why mainstream scientists do n't take their claim seriously , why the product is not approved by the FDA , or why scientific journals wo n't publish their articles .
You 'll often hear this in the form of a conspiracy of the medical establishment to suppress a quack cure because it's in the interest of the medical industry to keep you sick .
In fact , any doctor or pharmaceutical company that could develop a new cure would make a huge fortune ; they 'd never suppress it .
The same goes for auto manufacturers worldwide who are said to be " suppressing " new efficient engine technologies .
6 . Does the claim sound far fetched , or too good to be true ?
When something sounds too good to be true , it usually is .
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence .
Does the claim truly fit in with what we know of the way the world works ?
How often do claims that turn the world upside down really turn out to be true ?
Approach such claims with extreme skepticism , and demand evidence that 's as extraordinary as the claim .
7 . Is the claim supported by hokey marketing ?
Be wary of marketing gimmicks , and keep in mind that marketing gimmicks are , by themselves , completely worthless .
Examples of hokey marketing that should always raise a red flag are pictures of people wearing white lab coats , celebrity endorsements , anecdotes and testimonials from any source , and mentions of certifications , colleges , academies , and institutes .
8 . Does the claim pass the Occam 's Razor test ?
Is there a simpler , natural explanation for the claim that does not require any supernatural component ?
Are results consistent with the placebo effect or the body 's natural healing capacity ?
Can a stage magician duplicate the psychic 's feats ?
The Law of Large Numbers states that a one - in - a - million event usually happens to everyone about once a month , and since Occam 's Razor says that the simpler of two possible explanations is usually the right one , do n't leap for a supernatural explanation just because you happened to dream about your grandmother on the night she died .
9 . Does the claim come from a source dedicated to supporting it ?
Science works by starting with a null hypothesis and searching for evidence .
Pseudoscience starts with a positive hypothesis and supports it with questionable research and anecdotal reasoning .
It 's unlikely that an institution dedicated to the promotion of any given claim will present any type of evidence other than that which supports their claim , and its bias should be given serious consideration .
10 .
Are the claimants up front about their testing ?
Any good research will outline the testing that was done , and will present all evidence that did not support the conclusion .
Be skeptical of any claims that do not detail testing methodology that was thorough and responsible , including external verification and duplication , or that do not provide evidence unsupportive of the conclusion .
11 . How good is the quality of data supporting the claim ?
Watch out when testing data might be susceptible to observational selection , which is the counting of hits and not the misses , like we see with television psychics .
Watch out when sample sizes are too small to have statistical significance , as with most clinical trials of homeopathy .
And especially watch out for hastily drawn causal relationships : the assumption that because the relief occurred after the remedy , the remedy must have caused the relief .
12 . Do the claimants have legitimate credentials ?
Be aware that there is a huge number of unaccredited institutions ( which are often just bedroom offices ) giving out degrees in just about anything .
Be aware that some institutions claiming to be accredited received their accreditation from unrecognized accreditation bodies .
Finally , be aware that genuine accredited universities often have programs in unscientific fields such as chiropractic , naturopathy , and acupuncture .
You must be vigilant .
To see just how vigilant , go to ThunderwoodCollege.com and get your own Ph.D. in the field of your choice in seconds , for free .
13 .
Do the claimants state that there 's something wrong with the norm ?
When real research is presented , it consists of the evidence that was discovered and the conclusion .
It does not go off on alarmist rants about how the food we eat is dangerous , how we 're destroying the planet , how the government covers up its evils , or how you 're going to hell if you accept evolution .
When a claim is presented as an alternative to the wrongs of the status quo , it 's a sign that the claim is probably based on ideology or philosophy rather than science .
14 .
Is the claim said to be " all natural " ?
As we 've see time and time again , by no definition can " all natural " mean that a product is safe or healthy .
Consider the examples of hemlock , mercury , lead , toadstools , box jellyfish neurotoxin , asbestos — not to mention a nearly infinite number of toxic bacteria and viruses ( E. coli , salmonella , bubonic plague , smallpox ) .
In many cases , synthetic versions of natural compounds have been engineered to make them safer , more effective , and able to be produced in large quantities .
15 .
Does the claim have support that is political , ideological , or cultural ?
Some claimants suggest that it 's moral , ethical , or politically correct to accept their claims , to redirect your attention from the fact that they may not be scientifically sound .
In some cases , such as Young Earth Creationism , proponents use the court system to force schools to teach their claims as fact .
Generally , when a theory is scientifically sound , even if it 's brand new it will eventually find its way into the educational curriculum .
Good science is done in the lab and in the field — not in the courts , not in protest marches , not in blogs , and not in church .
A political or cultural campaign to legalize or promote some product or claim is a major indicator that it 's bogus .
There you have it .
With this checklist , anyone is well equipped to filter out the chaff from the wheat .
Questions like these are what should be taught in schools , encouraging young people to begin looking at all the crazy misinformation in our world with critical analysis .
The ability to tell fact from fiction is essential to our progress as a species as we search for the next great discoveries in medicine , space exploration , computing , power generation , and every other scientific field .

Word History : Fuck is an old word , although throughout its history it has probably been uttered in speech much more than it has been written in manuscripts or printed in books .
Some of the first first written evidence we have of the word fuck is found in a poem composed in a mixture of Latin and English sometime before 1500 .
In the manuscript of the poem , some of the lines are even written in code — to hide the lewd nature of the text or perhaps to offer the reader the fun of deciphering the verses and discovering the bawdy words within .
The poem , which satirizes the Carmelite friars of Cambridge , England , takes its title , " Flen flyys , " from the first words of its opening line , " Flen , flyys , and freris , " that is , " fleas , flies , and friars . "
The line that contains fuck reads " Non sunt in coeli , quia gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk . "
The Latin words " Non sunt in coeli , quia , " mean " they [ the friars ] are not in heaven , since . "
The code " gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk " is easily broken by simply substituting the preceding letter in the alphabet , keeping in mind differences in the alphabet and in spelling between then and now : i was then used for both i and j ; v was used for both u and v ; and vv was used for w .
This yields " fvccant [ a fake Latin form ] vvivys of heli . "
The whole thus reads in translation : " They are not in heaven because they fuck wives of Ely [ a town near Cambridge ] . "

Blankets and duvets are needed to keep the baby orphaned seals warm
A seal centre is appealing for blankets , towels , duvets , and donations for the orphaned animals .
The RSPCA wildlife centre at East Winch in Norfolk , has taken in large numbers of orphaned grey seals since November .
The rescued seals , which come to the centre from Essex , Suffolk and Norfolk , are either sick or injured , or too young to survive on their own .
Staff are appealing for extra blankets and duvets to help keep the small seals warm , as supplies are running out .
Centre manager Alison Charles said : " We are extremely grateful for the support of the public in caring for the seals and hope to boost our numbers of old and new blankets , towels and duvets . "
Extraction and refining heavy oil from Canadian tar sands will have increasingly devastating impacts on migratory bird populations , according to a new study .
According to a new report , the cumulative impact of developing Canadian tar sands over the next 30 – 50 years could be as high as 166 million birds lost , including future generations .
Written by scientists from the Natural Resources Defense Council , Boreal Songbird Initiative , and Pembina Institute , the peer - reviewed paper suggests that avian mortality from continued development of Canada ’s tar sands would provide a serious blow to migratory bird populations in North America .
[ social_buttons ]
“ This report is yet another wake up call to the government in Alberta , as it confirms that the cumulative impact of oil sands development is on an unsustainable trajectory , ” said Pembina Institute ’s Simon Dyer , a contributing author to the report .
It is estimated that half of America ’s migratory birds nest in the Boreal forest , and each year 22 – 170 million birds breed in the area that could eventually be developed for tar sands oil if the rate of development continues at it is currently planned .
“ At a time when bird populations are rapidly declining , this report puts into perspective the far reaching effects of tar sands oil development on North America ’s birds , ” said the report ’s lead author Jeff Wells , Ph.D. of the Boreal Songbird Initiative .
“ The public needs to understand the real and long - term ecological costs of this development and determine if this is acceptable , ” added Wells .
In Alberta , tar sands mining and drilling causes significant habitat loss and fragmentation .
Expansive toxic tailings ponds are protected by propane cannons that are used to keep ducks from landing in them .

Police in Mumbai today released the identities and home addresses in Pakistan of the nine dead gunmen who allegedly attacked India 's financial centre last month - in a move apparently intended to increase the pressure on the Pakistani government .
The news comes as Pakistani ministers offered Indian officials the chance to interview those detained in Sunday 's raids on militant camps as part of a " joint investigation " .
In custody are two Islamist leaders - Lashkar - e - Taiba commander , Zakiur Rehman Lakhwi , blamed for the attack on Mumbai last month , and the head of Jaish - e- Mohammad , Masood Azhar , who is accused of masterminding a strike on the Indian parliament in 2001 .
Pakistan 's defence minister , Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar , took to the airwaves in India saying that officials from Delhi may be allowed to interrogate both suspects .
" Lakhwi was picked up ...
Azhar has also been picked up .
We will help India in joint investigations ...
India may be allowed to interrogate these people also , " he said .
Delhi has spurned previous offers from Pakistan for a " joint investigation " , saying it wants Islamabad to hand over fugitives from Indian law who are accused of being behind terror strikes in India .
In a move designed to keep the pressure on Islamabad , police in India say they have pieced together more details of the nine dead militants , saying they were young Pakistani men between the age of 20 and 28 .
Two of the men were from Okara district , three from Multan , two from Faisalabad and one was from Sialkot .
Only one gunmen survived , Mohammad Ajmal Amir Iman , who remains in custody .
The leader of the group is said to have been Ismail Khan , whose home is in Dera Ismail Khan - a town in the lawless area near the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Rakesh Maria , joint commissioner of Mumbai police , told journalists that his expertise with GPS marked him out .
" This was not his first operation for the Lashkar , " he said , referring to the armed Islamist group blamed by India for the Mumbai terror attack .
India says that for years it was Pakistani policy to use guerrilla groups such as Lashkar as proxies in the conflict over the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir .
Indian police later said they would question a man who has been held in custody since February , in connection with the Mumbai attack .
The man , identified only as Sabauddin , would be brought to Mumbai from a jail in northern India , a police officer Rakesh Maria said .
Sabauddin , whose nationality was not disclosed , was arrested along with an Indian national , Faheem Ansari , in northern India carrying hand - drawn sketches of hotels , the train terminal and other sites in Mumbai that were later attacked , Maria added .
Indian ministers were quick to point out that President Asif Ali Zardari 's crackdown on militant groups operating in its half of Kashmir - a first by Pakistan - was " something that need to be done in Pakistan 's own interests " .
Official sources say that Pakistan 's detention of two " terrorists " was " just a first step " .
The sources pointed out that Azhar has been detained by Pakistan at least twice in the past , but released after " a few months " .
In an article for the New York Times , Zardari used strong language to commit himself to an anti-terror strategy .
He wrote that as " demonstrated in Sunday 's raids , which resulted in the arrest of militants , Pakistan will take action against the non-state actors found within our territory , treating them as criminals , terrorists and murderers " .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures fell Friday for a sixth straight session to their lowest level in four years , ending the week with the biggest loss since the Persian Gulf War in 1991 , as worse - than - expected U.S. jobs data darkened the outlook for energy demand .
Crude oil for January delivery ended down $ 2.85 , or 6.5 % , at $ 40.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest closing level since December 2004 .
Oil lost 25 % during the week , the largest drop since the week ended Jan. 18 , 1991 .
In after - hour electronic trading , oil climbed back 2 % .
Crude 's weekly loss , the second biggest since oil futures started trading in 1983 , surpassed the 24 % decline recorded in the week ended March 21 , 2003 , when the U.S. government confirmed that coalition troops had seized control of Iraqi oil fields .
Friday 's drop came as the U.S. Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls plunged by 533,000 in November , the worst job loss in 34 years and much bigger than the projected loss of 350,000 .
See Economic Report .
" The fall in employment was brutal , " said James Williams , an energy economist at research firm WTRG Economics .
" Folks without jobs drive less , and those in fear of losing their jobs are minimizing expenditures . "
The Labor Department also reported that the unemployment rate rose to 6.7 % in November , the highest jobless rate since October 1993 .
Total U.S. petroleum products supplied in the past four weeks dropped 6.6 % from the same period a year ago , the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday .
Motor gasoline demand in the world 's biggest oil consuming country dropped 2.8 % .
Global oil demand will show an " outright contraction " of 0.5 % next year , according to Merrill Lynch analysts , led by Francisco Blanch .
They expected crude prices to average at $ 50 next year .
" Given the rate at which we are selling off , we shudder to think where crude oil prices will be when the boys from OPEC get together in 12 days ' time , " said MF Global analyst Edward Meir .
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , which controls about 40 % of the world 's oil production , chose not to reduce production at its meeting in Cairo last weekend .
However , the oil cartel will meet next on Dec. 17 in Oran , Algeria , where production cuts may be announced .
Also weighing on crude prices Friday was strength in the U.S. dollar , which surged against its major rivals on safe - haven demand .
The dollar index DXY , +0.26 % , which tracks the performance of the dollar against a trade - weighted basket of six major currencies , rose 0.9 % to 87.35 .
See Currencies .
A rising greenback tends to put downward pressures on dollar - denominated oil prices .
Also on the Nymex , January reformulated gasoline fell 7 % to 90.12 cents a gallon , and January heating oil fell 5.5 % to $ 1.4265 a gallon .
January natural - gas futures tumbled 4.6 % to $ 5.742 per million British thermal units .
The Reuters / Jefferies CRB Index CRB , - 1.01 % , a benchmark gauging the prices of major commodities , fell 4.3 % to 208.6 points .
Gold and other metals futures also posted steep losses .

A National Labor Relations
Board judge ruled on Tuesday that Starbucks had illegally fired three baristas and otherwise violated federal labor laws in seeking to beat back unionization efforts at several of its Manhattan cafes .
The administrative law judge , Mindy E. Landow , found that Starbucks had also broken the law by issuing negative job evaluations to union supporters and prohibiting employees from discussing the union even though the employees were allowed to discuss other subjects not related to work .
“ The judge ’s ruling shows that this company has trampled on workers ’ rights to organize a labor union , ” said one of the fired baristas , Daniel Gross , who is a longtime leader of the effort by the Industrial Workers of the World to unionize Starbucks workers in New York , Minnesota , Michigan and other states .
Judge Landow ordered that Mr. Gross and the two other baristas be reinstated to their jobs and receive back wages .
She also ordered Starbucks to pledge to end what she said was discriminatory treatment toward workers who supported the union at four of its Manhattan shops : 200 Madison Avenue at 36th Street , 145 Second Avenue at 9th Street , 15 Union Square East and 116 East 57th Street .

Carbon dioxide found on extrasolar planet could lead to proof of extraterrestrial life
NASA 's Hubble space telescope has discovered carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a distant planet outside our solar system , a breakthrough which could be an important step toward finding evidence of extraterrestrial life .
The space agency said the Hubble found the CO2 in the atmosphere of ' hot Jupiter ' planet HD 189733 b , which orbits a nearby star 63 light - years from Earth .
Previous observations of HD 189733 b's atmosphere by Hubble and the Spitzer Space Telescope found water vapour and methane .
Breakthrough : NASA 's
Hubble space telescope has discovered carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a distant planet outside our solar system
Mark Swain of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California used Hubble 's near - infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer to study infrared light from the planet .
He was able to identify carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide , which absorb certain wavelengths of near - infrared radiation .
The extrasolar planet is itself too hot to support life - its surface is about 1,800 °F ( 1,000 °C ) - but astronomers said they hope their observations could lead to the first evidence of life beyond our planet .
' The carbon dioxide is the main reason for the excitement because , under the right circumstances , it could have a connection to biological activity as it does on Earth , ' Swain said .
Excitement :

' The very fact we are able to detect it ( CO2 ) and estimate its abundance is significant for the long - term effort of characterizing planets to find out what they are made of and if they could be a possible host for life . '
Eric Smith , Hubble Space Telescope program scientist at NASA , added : ' These atmospheric studies will begin to determine the compositions and chemical processes operating on distant worlds orbiting other stars .
' Hubble was conceived primarily for observations of the distant universe , yet it is opening a new era of astrophysics and comparative planetary science .
' The future for this newly opened frontier of science is extremely promising as we expect to discover many more molecules in exoplanet atmospheres . '
A great step forward
9 December 2008
This perspective is available as a PDF leaflet in English and Español .
The occupation of Republic Windows and Doors by 250 workers in Chicago , Illinois is an important step forward and one that deserves the full support of the working class throughout the country and internationally .
For the first time since the onset of the economic crisis , a section of the working class is taking an independent stand and resisting the corporate assault on jobs and living standards , which is claiming thousands of new victims each day .
These workers are displaying enormous courage .
They refused to be thrown out of the factory when management moved to shut down the plant last Friday , after giving the workers just three days notice .
They have insisted they will not leave the plant until management pays the severance and vacation pay owed to each worker .
This action has a powerful objective meaning .
The same conditions that have driven these workers into struggle are affecting millions throughout the US and around the world .
Such struggles are going to erupt more and more frequently as the economic crisis compels workers to act collectively to assert their own class interests .
In that sense , this struggle recalls the experience of the Great Depression of the 1930s , when the sit - down strikes by rubber and auto workers sparked a wave of mass industrial struggles throughout the US .
Like working people everywhere , the workers in Chicago are confronting a battle not just against one employer , but against the entire capitalist economic and political system .
Republic was forced to close its doors when Bank of America , one of the largest financial institutions in the world , cut off the company 's line of credit .
Bank of America was a recipient of more than $ 25 billion in the government 's multi-trillion - dollar bailout of Wall Street .
For workers losing their jobs , homes and life savings there has been no bailout .
But for the banking executives and speculators whose recklessness and greed have brought the entire economy to the brink of collapse , the government has found unlimited resources .
This only underscores the class interests defended by both big business parties — the Democrats as well as the Republicans .
Though the workers have shown enormous determination , the struggle has also revealed political limitations .
The United Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers of America ( UE ) has sought to contain the fight to appeals to the Democratic Party and the banks .
The union has brought in political figures to smother the struggle , including Jesse Jackson , who has a long history of defusing working class struggles .
Moreover , the demands being raised fall far short of the needs of the workers themselves .
What is needed is not just severance pay or longer notice before workers are thrown out of their jobs , but a struggle to stop plant closings and defend the jobs of all working people .
Such a struggle requires a direct appeal to the working class throughout Chicago , the US and internationally , and the forging of a new political movement of the working class to fight for an alternative to the capitalist profit system .
The eruption of this struggle has surprised and frightened the government .
Cognizant of the growing social anger over the naked class bias of the Wall Street bailout , the media and politicians have , up to now , professed sympathy for the workers .
President - elect Barack Obama and Illinois Governor Blagojevich have issued statements of support to pressure Bank of America and Republic to resolve the crisis before it becomes an example for other embattled workers .
Democratic Party officials helped organize a meeting Monday between Bank of America , Republic , and the UE in an attempt to hash out a quick settlement .
But the proverbial genie has been let out of the bottle and it can not be put back in .
No matter how this struggle is concluded , the example of Chicago is going to give other people ideas .
The plant occupation is a demonstration of the social power of the working class .
These 250 workers have shown more resolve than the United Auto Workers union , with its millions of dollars in dues money and billion - dollar strike fund .
The UAW has completely capitulated to the job - cutting and concessions demands of the auto companies and Congress , without even the pretense of a fight .
The contrast underscores that the lack of mass resistance to the policies of the corporations and banks is not due to a lack of opposition in the working class , of which there is plenty .
Rather , the responsibility lies with the union bureaucracy , which has spent the last thirty years doing everything it can to strangle the initiative and resistance of workers .
All of the skeptics and opportunists who have said it is impossible to fight for socialist consciousness in the working class have been proven wrong again .
Workers are once again asserting their own interests in a way that implicitly challenges the system of capitalist private property .
As the economic crisis deepens and more and more struggles erupt , the question that will arise in the minds of millions of working people will be :
What class should control the factories and financial resources of society and who should make the economic decisions ?
Whatever illusions workers may have in the incoming Obama administration , that will not stop them from fighting .
As workers enter into struggle , more and more will come to see the necessity of dispensing with such illusions and seeking a political alternative to the two capitalist parties .
What is now posed is the need for a national and international struggle based on a socialist perspective .
