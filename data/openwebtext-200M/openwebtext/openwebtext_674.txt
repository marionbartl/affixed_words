SCHOOL BOARD CHOOSES NOT TO REAPPOINT HAMAS SUPPORTER TO THE SCHOOL BOARD�S DIVERSITY COMMITTEE JAWHAR BADRAN , A REPRESENTATIVE OF CAIR , HAD STATED THAT HAMAS IS NOT A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION ( Fort Lauderdale , FL ) On Tuesday , November 18th , the day his term ended , members of the Broward County School Board made a conscious decision not to reappoint or reassign
Badran , on March 1st , was videotaped making statements in favor of Hamas .
The statements included him saying that Hamas was �not a terrorist organization .�
As well , in July of 2006 , Badran described himself to the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel as a suicide bomber .
He stated , � Hamas and Hezbollah are committing acts of defense against the acts of the Israelis .
The only weapons that we have are to strap bombs on our bodies and do whatever damage and destruction we can . �
Badran was also an admitted member of the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , a group affiliated with Hamas and a group currently named as a co-conspirator by the U.S. Justice Department for a federal trial dealing with the financing of millions of dollars to Hamas .
Americans Against Hate ( AAH ) pushed for Badran�s removal from the Diversity Committee , a position which he had held the past four years .
AAH received word of the School Board�s decision from the offices of Dr. Robert Parks , the School Board member who originally appointed Badran to the Diversity Committee , and Robin Bartleman , the outgoing School Board Chair .
AAH Chairman Joe Kaufman stated , � While we had wished for Jawhar Badran�s removal prior to his term ending , we are pleased that he will no longer have a role in the government body .

Some thoroughly depressing news to start Monday morning : the founder of UK media research agency Enders expects the number of media jobs in the UK industry to halve between now and 2013 .
The last couple of months has seen urgent and accelerated downsizing from a glut of publishers , TV and other groups .
Claire Enders ( via Reuters ) : “ We calculated the total jobs in the media in the UK at about 400,000 … at the end of 2007 .
Between the beginning of 2008 and 2013 we ’re expecting half of those jobs to go .
The big employers are the regional press , magazines , local advertising sales .
Real numbers are in print . ”
That kind of decimation might seem an unlikely apocalypse , but other analysts ( via Reuters ) are pessimistic , too … Numis ’ Paul Richards :
“ In terms of the really tough trading we ’ve only had two months , maybe three ” … Screen Digest ’s Vincent Letang : “ I see a long slowdown before a potential recovery in 2012 .
I do n’t expect , following that period of crisis , we ’ll have a strong rebound as we had after the dot - com crash . ”

The New York Times Company 's 10Q ( NYT ) contains more details on the company 's cash crunch .
Specifically , the company must deliver $ 400 million to lenders in May of 2009 , six months from now .
The company has only $ 46 million of cash on hand , and its operations will likely begin consuming this meager balance this quarter or next .
The company has been shut out of the commercial paper market , but has a $ 366 million short - term credit line remaining that it entered into several years ago , when the industry was strong .
It has not yet drawn this cash down , and given the current environment and the trends at the company , we would not take for granted that it will be able to do so .
The New York Times is in discussions with its lenders about the May payment , and management thinks it will be able to work something out ( " We expect that we will be able to manage our debt and credit obligations as they mature . "
Note the use of the word " manage " as opposed to " meet . " )
The company does not provide details as to what this managed solution might look like , so here are some possibilities .
1. Sell assets .
This is a must .
It is also likely to be difficult and painful in the current environment .
As we noted in " New York Times Running On Fumes " , the New York Times has gotten itself in a situation where it will be forced to choose among multiple bad options just to pay its bills .
A fire sale of the building , the Boston Globe , the Red Sox , and / or other assets is one of them .
2. Draw down the $ 366 million remaining on the second credit line immediately .
This option , too , unfortunately , is problematic ( if it were n't , the NYT would almost certainly have already drawn this money down ) .
What is a " credit line " ?
It is a promise , on paper , that a bank will lend NYTCO money when it wants it .
This promise was made several years ago , when the New York Times and the rest of the newspaper industry were undefeated heavyweight fighters in perfect physical shape .
Now , it 's the 11th round , and they 're battered and bloody and slumped on the ropes .
Does n't the bank that signed that credit line have to give NYTCO the money ?
Not necessarily .
The bank is contractually obligated to give NYTCO the money , but some contracts , obviously , are barely worth the paper they 're printed on .
Given the current circumstances , if we were that bank , and we were as strapped and scared as most banks are these days , we would certainly be reading the fine print to see what sort of " material adverse change " clauses the contract might include .
Even if NYTCO could persuade us that early 2009 is not going to be as bad as it seems like it will be , the money will be due in two years , in 2011 , and 2011 just is n't that far away .
3 . Make major cash - saving cost cuts , including eliminating ( or severely cutting ) the dividend .
This wo n't conjure up $ 400 million by May , but it might convince a lender that NYTCO understands what it is up against and is committed to taking the tough steps necessary to deal with it .
It would also allow the company to keep generating cash through 2009 , which would obviously help .
Ca n't NYTCO just borrow more money from someone else or issue some commercial paper or something ?
This will be tough .
The reason the company has drawn down its first short - term credit line is that it got shut out of the commercial paper market .
On getting another loan from someone else ... would you lend NYTCO more money right now ?
( There are certainly terms under which we would , but they are not terms that NYTCO would like very much . )
Conclusion
Will this cash crunch force the New York Times into bankruptcy ?
No .
( Or at least not yet . )
The company still has assets , and it is not yet burning so much cash that it can't take steps to save itself .
Those steps are likely to be unpleasant , though .
And they will be taken at gunpoint .

How The New York Times Can Save Itself
Dividend Cut Could Make New York Times Sale More Likely
On its own , that cost could be absorbed by the agency .
But , as the economy declined , the M.T.A. had lost hundreds of millions because tax receipts — which finance part of its budget — were falling .
And its ability to renew its variable - rate bonds at low interest rates was hurt by the trouble at Depfa and other banks .
The transportation authority now faces a $ 900 million shortfall , according to officials .
It is “ fairly breathtaking , ” Mr. Dellaverson told the M.T.A. ’s finance committee .
“ This is not a tolerable long - term position for us to be in . ”
In a recent interview , Mr. Dellaverson defended New York ’s use of variable bonds .
“ Variable - rate debt has helped M.T.A. save millions of dollars , and we ’ve been conservative in issuing it , ” he said .
“ But there are risks , which we work hard to mitigate .
Usually it works .
But what ’s happening today is a total lack of marketplace rationality . ”
In a statement , the transportation authority said that it was exploring options to reduce the cost of the Depfa - backed bonds , that its variable - rate bonds had delivered savings even during the current turmoil and that the agency had remained within its budget on debt payments this year .
However , the transportation authority has already announced it will raise subway and train fares next year because of various fiscal problems , and may be forced to shrink the work force and reduce some bus routes .
Some analysts say fares will probably rise again in 2010 .
The Depfa fallout does n’t end there .
Rating agencies have downgraded the bonds of more than 75 municipal agencies backed by Depfa , including in California , Connecticut , Illinois and South Dakota .
Officials in Florida , Massachusetts and Montana have cut budgets because of C.D.O. ’s or similar risky bets .
And Hypo , the German company that bought Depfa , last week asked the German government for financial help for the third time .
Depfa has frozen much of its business , according to Wall Street bankers , and though it continues to honor its commitments , some wonder for how long .
The Wisconsin school districts have filed suit against the Royal Bank of Canada and Stifel Nicolaus alleging misrepresentations .
Board members hope they will prevail and schools and retirement plans will emerge unscathed .
The companies dispute the lawsuit ’s claims .
Mr. Noack is not named as a defendant and is cooperating with the school boards .

The standards of competence of the Bush administration are now up for a third term :
“ They did n’t speak to anyone in the Legislature , they did n’t speak to anyone in the business community , ” said Lyda Green , the State Senate president , who lives in Wasilla , where Ms. Palin served as mayor .
Representative Gail Phillips , a Republican and former speaker of the State House , said the widespread surprise in Alaska when Ms. Palin was named to the ticket made her wonder how intensively the McCain campaign had vetted her .
“ I started calling around and asking , and I have not been able to find one person that was called , ” Ms. Phillips said .
“ I called 30 to 40 people , political leaders , business leaders , community leaders .
Not one of them had heard .
Alaska is a very small community , we know people all over , but I have n’t found anybody who was asked anything . ”
Lyda Green - who 's the State Senate President and a Republican - and Sarah Palin are mortal enemies - just so you know where she 's coming from .
When two far right shock - jock radio talk show hosts , interviewing Palin on the air , described Green on the air as a " bitch , " Palin could only giggle and say she would be " honored " to host the two men at an event .
Here 's Green 's take on the Palin pick :
" She 's not prepared to be governor .
How can she be prepared to be vice president or president ? " said Green , a Republican from Palin 's hometown of Wasilla .
" Look at what she 's done to this state .
What would she do to the nation ? "
And here 's what Lyda Green said after the staggering news last March - greeted with stunned disbelief by Palin 's staff and the entire Alaskan establishment - that Palin was seven months ' pregnant :
" It 's wonderful .
She 's very well - disguised , " said Senate President Lyda Green , a mother of three who has sometimes sparred with Palin politically .
" When I was five months pregnant , there was absolutely no question that I was with child . "

Hollywood would get a little unexpected boost from the proposed $ 700 - billion bailout of the nation ’s financial system .
The bill wending its way through Congress would provide tax breaks worth more than $ 470 million over the next decade for movie and TV producers that shoot in the U.S .
That ’s not a lot of money , given that the average studio movie costs $ 106.6 million to make and market , but it could keep some low - budget productions -- and jobs -- from going offshore .
Hollywood has long sought measures to curb so - called runaway production , which it blames for causing thousands of job losses in Southern California as filmmakers have fled to Canada and other foreign countries that offer cost savings through tax breaks and other incentives .

One provision would provide film and TV producers with the same tax deductions that American manufacturers such as General Motors Corp. , Boeing Co. and Xerox Corp. receive for making their products in the U.S .
Specifically , the legislation would allow filmmakers who shoot in the U.S. to qualify for a tax deduction granted in 2004 to domestic manufacturers that capped the top tax rate at 32 % instead of 35 % .
Additionally , the tax package lifts the budget cap on the existing tax deduction , which was limited to movies that cost less than $ 15 million to make -- in effect excluding most studio films , which cost a lot more .
Now producers would be able to immediately deduct all production costs up to $ 15 million , regardless of the movie ’s total budget .
The change also extends the existing credit , which was due to expire this year , to December 2009 .
Representatives of the Motion Picture Assn. of America , the Directors Guild of America and the Independent Film and Television Alliance , which backed the measures , said it was premature to comment because they had not been approved .

The provisions were part of a broad tax extension bill approved earlier by the Senate and then folded into the revised bailout legislation that it passed Wednesday .

You'd think it was an impossible task : how can you make a great beast like a sperm whale provide a breath sample ?
But scientists have come up with an ingenious method that involves flying a toy helicopter over the animal just as it releases air through its blowhole .
Petri dishes slung beneath the chopper capture the exhaled gases and mucus .
Researchers from the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) say the trick is helping them study the disease - causing micro-organisms carried by live whales .
It is an important advance given that much of what we know about the cetaceans comes from dead animals , not free - ranging ones .
ZSL's Dr Karina Acevedo- Whitehouse told the BBC : " We do n't know much about them because they are so big and they are in the water all the time , and that makes it really difficult to obtain biological samples that are relevant to determining health in these populations ; unless they 've already stranded or unless they are in captivity , which are hardly representative of a normal population . "
Karina Acevedo- Whitehouse scans the water for whales
The chopper breathalyser is featured in the BBC 's new Oceans series , which records a series of underwater scientific expeditions aimed at building up a global picture of the state of our seas .
The ZSL work is being undertaken in the Sea of Cortez ( also known as the Gulf of California ) , where sperm whales ( Physeter macrocephalus ) gather in large numbers .
The mammals have been boosted by the presence of abundant prey - humboldt squid ( Dosidicus gigas ) , which themselves seem to be thriving in what are generally over - fished waters .
The whale numbers give plenty of opportunities for the researchers to get close to the animals - but often not close enough to get a good breath sample .
In the Oceans programme , presenter Lucy Blue is seen hanging out over the end of a small boat with Petri dishes attached to a long pole .
But every time she gets near a whale , the creature dives .

The one - metre- long remote - controlled chopper allows Dr Acevedo - Whitehouse 's team to take a sample without the whales being disturbed .
The " pilot " controls the aircraft at a safe distance , directing the machine to hover over the water where whales are surfacing .
When a whale blows , the dishes catch the spray thrown up by the animal .
The dishes are then flown back to the control boat where they are sealed and taken to be analysed in a laboratory to identify particular pathogens - bacteria , viruses , fungi .
" We 're on a moving boat and we do n't have too much space to manoeuvre , to let the helicopter land , so it can be quite dangerous , " Dr Acevedo - Whitehouse told the BBC World Service 's Science In Action programme .
" Also , it 's quite challenging to be able to calculate at a distance where the whale is and where the blow is .
We 've even attached a tiny video camera to the helicopter to see when the whale is actually blowing and where we could pass the helicopter through it to collect the sample . "
The helicopter has to be handled with care on a small boat Using both the chopper and the pole method , the team has managed to sample some 60 whales in the Sea of Cortez ( and a further 40 , of different species , around Gibraltar ) .
The ZSL research is a collaborative study with Dr Diane Gendron from CICIMAR , a research institution belonging to the National Polytechnic University of Mexico .
" [ Dr Gendron ] has been working with the whales for more than 20 years , " said Dr Acevedo - Whitehouse .
" She can photo - ID the animals ; we know what animal it is .
We will be able to tell if a whale is having the same pathogens year after year .
It will let us monitor the health of the populations . "
The BBC Oceans series starts its run on BBC Two at 2000 GMT , Wednesday 12 November .

I found a great video interview with Edsger Wybe Dijkstra .
You have probably heard of Dijkstra 's algorithm .
He invented it .
In the interview professor Edsger talks about his thoughts on software development .
He compares two very different styles of programming - Mozart style of programming vs. Beethoven style of programming .
When Mozart started to write , the composition was finished .
He wrote manuscript in elegant handwriting in one go .
Beethoven was a doubter and a struggler .
He started writing before he finished the composition and then glued corrections onto the page .
In one place he did it nine times .
When they peeled them , the last version proved to be identical to the first one .
From the video one can understand that Edsger preferred Mozart 's style of programming .
Not just programming , but Mozart style of doing things .
He says that the most important thing has been the daily discipline of neatly writing down his thoughts .
His daily discipline lead to hundreds of crystal clear scientific papers , which have now been archived in EWD Archive .
You are welcome to watch interview with Edsger Dijkstra :
At the beginning of video Dijkstra criticizes current software release methodology .
He says that version 1.0 of should be the finished product .
I do n't think he 's right .
It 's like Tannenbaum saying Torvalds that Linux is obsolete .
Also see " Release Early , Release Often . "
Edsger Dijkstra 's quotes from video :
Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes .
The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull .
He therefore approaches his task in full humility and avoids clever tricks like the plague .
We should not introduce errors through sloppiness but systematically keep them out .
Program testing can convincingly show the presence of bugs but it is hopelessly inadequate to show their absence .
Elegance is not a dispensable luxury but a factor that decides between success and failure .
I found a funny poster of Dijkstra :
Whatever you just said , it 's wrong .
sun gives " energy "
plants " take up " " sunlight "
they " breathe " CO2 and " release " O2
It 's good to talk to plants
A tree starts out as a seed .
Where does it get the mass ?
The common answer is : from the soil , which is wrong .
The mass of the tree comes from the wood ( cellulose ) , and cellulose ( by weight ) is carbon .
Carbon comes from the air ( CO2 ) .
I. The first question you want to ask , right now , is why this now obvious answer was n't obvious to begin with .
More specifically , why you know the " photosynthesis " but not how to apply it , at all .
Why were we taught photosynthesis ?
First , most of us do n't remember anything about it anyway .
If we do , we have recollections of certain unconnected concepts :
The quotes serve to suggest we do n't even really know the meaning of the terms we learned .
None of those statements are informative , nor can the be applied to reality ( e.g. answering the above question . )
It 's not that you forgot ; it 's unlikely you could have answered that question even back when you were learning photosynthesis .
Yet -- and this is the point -- the word " photosynthesis " is in your head .
You learned a made up word , an artificial carve out of what is really a fluid physical process .
You did n't learn any of the reality .
So , on the one hand , we actually did n't learn anything .
And , on the other hand -- the worse hand -- we actually think we know something .
Not just ignorant ; but ignorant and deluded .
II .
But " tree mass comes from the air " is n't actually right , either .
Some trees are more than 50 % water by mass , so the mass of a tree would indeed come from the ground .
( No partial credit : if you said " from the ground " but were thinking " minerals " you were still wrong . )
Indeed , this question reveals that even with a general background in science , and two acceptable answers , most people still get it wrong .
So what , exactly , was the point of the general background in science , let alone photosynthesis ?
In other words , you do n't really appreciate that a ) a tree has water mass ; b ) air has mass .
I state it here , and you " know " it , but that 's not the same as it being a fundamental part of your worldview , the way " the sun is hot " or " the earth revolves around the sun " does , fundamentals that allow you to make guesses about reality .
That 's what science should have given you ; instead , it gave you a hodgepodge of disconnected linguistic propositions that neither describe reality nor predict reality .
" Where do plants get their energy ? " " Photosynthesis . "
Nothing happened there , except words .
Here 's an example : if , prior to this post , I had asked why a helium balloon , despite weighing something , floats , you 'd have to reason out an answer .
But just my saying , " air has mass " makes the question easier to answer .
You already know air has mass , you do n't need me to tell you ; but you do n't feel it -- that 's why my telling you here makes a difference .
I hardly need point out how a discussion about global warming is vastly altered if it is intuitively understood that trees get their carbon from the air .
III .
But , actually , both of those answers are wrong :
It is too vague , allows for multiple different interpretations and answers , is simultaneously misleading and oversimplified .
The bigger problem -- and this applies not only to science but to any field furthered by a dialectic -- is that weprecision in answers , and allow ---- imprecision in the questions .
" Where does the dry mass of a tree come from ? " would be a little better .
Etc.
But no one worries about this ; indeed , many shrug their shoulders , " yeah , the question is vague , but we all know what it means . "
Well , evidently not .
It barely requires exposition that psychiatry suffers greatly from this problem , the haziest and laziest of terms and definitions magically generating concrete and specific responses .
Internist asks me , " I have a patient who is bipolar , what should I do ? "
If I say anything other than " Depakote " or equivalent , he thinks I 'm being an ass .
But my answer is 100 x less relevant than understanding what he means by either " bipolar , " " patient , " or " do .
" Politics , I need not point out , is worse .
The most asinine questions are expected to generate meaningful responses .
" Should we bail out General Motors ? "
Which one of those words actually means what you say it means ?
Who is " we ? "
What 's a " bail out ? " " General Motors " the whole company , the pension division , the new plant they opened in Russia , what ?
But if you ask for any clarification , you 're being difficult .
IV.A final analogy may be here helpful .
You may also ( not ) remember from school " significant digits . "
For example , 3 + 4.2 = 7 . Since " 3 " only has one significant digit ( 3.0 is a more precise number with 2 significant digits ) the answer itself can have no more than one significant figure .
Importantly , it 's not that " 7 " is an okay answer , but really 7.2 is more precise .
7.2 is wrong , because that 3 could have been 3.4 , 2.6 , etc .
Or , more generally , an answer can not be more precise than its data .
Or its question .
The first business of science education should not be to help us answer questions , but to help us ask questions .

Two - thirds of teenagers do not believe science qualifications would help them to have rewarding careers .
A poll of 1,000 16 - to 18 - year - olds found that just over a quarter ( 28 % ) saw the sciences as relevant .
The study said that students were unaware of the range of career options – including in sectors such as fashion and sport – that studying sciences could open up for them .
Many young people have preconceived ideas about science subjects leading solely to laboratory jobs and wearing a white coat , it said .
The survey by the Science Council , which represents learned societies and professional institutions , warned that British pupils ' negative view of science subjects was preventing huge numbers of them from having fulfilling and potentially lucrative careers .
Diana Garnham , the council 's chief executive , said : " This research highlights the huge misperception about what studying the sciences can lead to .
" Scientists work everywhere in the economy making use of their science skills in industries such as finance , fashion , art and design , and sport .
" It 's important we explain these options to students so they can make an informed choice about their career . "
The science minister , Lord Paul Drayson , said : " I want to shake this image problem that science has .
" I 'm sure teenagers would agree that Lewis Hamilton 's formula one race engineers have an exciting life .
" We need to make them realise it 's because of what they studied at school . "
The findings come after the English funding council announced a revival in the number of students taking up science , maths and language subjects at A - level and university last month .
The research coincides with the launch of Future Morph - a new online resource for students , teachers and parents aimed at changing perceptions of the careers open to students with science , technology , engineering and maths ( Stem ) qualifications .
The most likely reason students gave for avoiding a Stem subject was that they are " too difficult " ( 30 % ) , they are " not interesting or enjoyable enough " ( 27 % ) and that they will " limit my career options " ( 23 % ) .
Increasing the number of students studying Stem subjects and going into related careers is important for the UK economy , the council argued .
( CNN ) -- Up and down the East Coast , residents and naturalists alike have been scratching their heads this autumn over a simple question :
Where are all the acorns ?
Some scientists fear a mysterious shortage of acorns this fall in the eastern U.S. will affect squirrels .
Oak trees have shed their leaves , but the usual carpet of acorns is not crunching underfoot .
In far - flung pockets of northern Virginia , Maryland , Pennsylvania , West Virginia and other states , scientists have found no acorns whatsoever .
" I can't think of any other year like this , " said Alonso Abugattas , director of the Long Branch Nature Center in Arlington , Virginia .
Louise Garris , who lives in the Oakcrest neighborhood of Arlington , Virginia , first noticed the mysterious phenomenon early this fall when doing yardwork beneath a canopy of large oak trees .
" I have lived in the area my entire life and have never not seen any acorns ! " she said .
Garris checked with some local plant nurseries and they confirmed her observation .
The mystery has found its way to the Internet , where a " No acorns this year " discussion on Topix.com yielded more than 180 comments from people reporting acorn disappearances as far away as Connecticut and North Carolina .

" WHAT IS GOING ON ? " posted a resident of Maplewood , New Jersey .
" Now we are finding dead squirrels !
SHOULD WE ALL BE CONCERNED ? "
Not necessarily , naturalists say .
Last year Garris reported a bumper crop of acorns , which scientists say may be one clue to this year 's scarcity .
Virginia extension agent Adam Downing said acorn production runs in cycles , so a lean year is normal after a year with a big crop .
" It fits with the physiology of seed reproduction .
The trees are exhausted , energy wise , from last year , " Downing said .
But even he is surprised at the complete absence of nuts in parts of Virginia .
" There are plenty of acorns in most of the state , but zero acorns in some pockets , " he said .
Downing said recovery from last year 's big crop , combined with a much wetter - than - usual spring , probably accounts for the acorn absence .
Meteorologists say the Washington - Baltimore area saw about twice as much precipitation last May as normal .
Kate McNamee , who runs a Washington - area , volunteer tree - planting project called " Growing Native , " lends specific numbers to the acorn shortage .
Her group collects hardwood seeds and plants trees to protect rivers and streams in the Potomac River watershed .
" Last year we collected 25,000 pounds of seeds , most from a bumper crop of acorns , " said McNamee .
" This year we only collected 10,000 pounds , and 90 percent of that was walnuts . "
Even though this acorn shortage has not risen to the level of a crisis , scientists say it is important to watch closely .
If the shortage continues for several years , other forces might be at work .

Garris said her observations got her thinking about other recent environmental issues .
" I had read about the collapse of the bee colonies , and it made me wonder , is something else going on here ?
Could this be affecting other systems ? "
At the Long Branch Nature Center , calls and e-mails have been pouring in from people who want to donate acorns they 've gathered in areas where they are plentiful .
It 's also hard to think of acorns without thinking about squirrels .
What happens to them when their favorite food disappears ?
Some Eastern Seaboard residents have reported seeing skinny , aggressive squirrels devouring bird feed .
" Especially in the depths of winter , there 's not much else for the squirrels to eat .
Some may switch their diet , many others probably wo n't make it , " said Abugattas .
" Squirrel and deer numbers will almost certainly go down . "
But Doug Inkley , senior scientist at the National Wildlife Federation , said that wild animals can be resilient when their usual food sources go away .
Inkley cited a blight that destroyed 3.5 billion American chestnuts from 1900 - 1940 , wiping out a common food source for squirrels , deer , mice and wild turkeys .
But those animals adapted and survived , he said .
Barbara Prescott , a wildlife rehabilitation expert , agreed that squirrels are not fussy about their diet .
She suggested that residents leave whole ( not crushed ) corn , peanuts and sunflowers in the seed as backyard treats .
John Rohm , wildlife biologist for Prince William , Loudoun , Fairfax , and Arlington counties in northern Virginia , has faith in the furry population .
" Animals are resourceful , " he said .
" If they 're hungry , they 're gonna find something to eat . "

Tractor Bucket Wedding : Taking the Plunge in Mid Air
In honoring an ancient tradition that the bride ’s feet should n’t touch the ground during the journey from home to the ceremony , a Chinese couple got married in mid-air in two tractor digger buckets .
Wedding organizer , Fan Yalin , said the usual way of following the tradition was for the groom to carry the bride in his arms from the car .
However , this couple wanted to do something different and being that the groom ’s job is selling heavy machinery , his colleagues came up with the idea of having them stand in two tractor buckets .
And so it went , with the bride and two bridesmaids in one and the husband and two best men in the other .
The couple , who took the words , ‘ until death do us part ’ a bit more to heart than most , told the media that they loved the ceremony , describing it as “ dangerous but sweet . ”
“ It was really cool to have a tractor bucket marriage .
Very interesting . ” said one of the guests .
Whatever floats your boats or keeps your tractor bucket in the air !
Kudos to the happy couple !
May they fly together for a long time to come !

Cunliffe ’s approach will jar readers accustomed to being informed of the epoch - making quality of every inauguration speech .
Not for him “ the events and personalities flitting on the surface ” of conventional history .
Rather , he focuses resolutely on the underlying forces — primarily geography and climate — that influenced societies , and specifically on the ways those forces shaped and constrained the “ intricate social networks by means of which commodities were exchanged and ideas and beliefs were disseminated . ”
Cunliffe is intellectually indebted to Fernand Braudel and the Annales school of French economic and social historians , which emphasized largely static environmental influences and long - term historical continuity and regarded political events as little more than trivia .
The Annales approach works better for the millennia Cunliffe examines , in which very , very few individuals can even be identified , than for the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance , the periods Braudel assessed .
Geography forms the essential basis of Cunliffe ’s history .
The waters encircling Europe , the transpeninsular rivers that penetrated it , and its topography , currents , tides , and seasonal wind patterns all determined millennia - old sailing routes , and thus the goods and beliefs transported along them .
From Cunliffe ’s perspective , even the Roman Empire was just an interlude , and perhaps its main achievement was to institutionalize through its ports , roads , and market centers Europe - wide networks of exchange that had been operating since the Middle Stone Age .
By stressing historical continuity and adroitly employing a wide - ranging archaeological record to highlight mobility and interconnectedness , Cunliffe draws a startling picture .
Europe , he demonstrates , was geographically and culturally merely “ the western excrescence of the continent of Asia . ”
His archaeological and topographic analysis shows how for thousands of years the steppe lands linked central Asia to the Great Hungarian Plain , thus providing “ easy access ” from China to the Atlantic Ocean .
Here was a corridor for trade and migration , starting with nomadic groups deep in prehistory and continuing through the preclassical , classical , medieval , and early modern eras with great hordes of Cimmerians , Scythians , Sarmatians , Alans , Huns , Magyars , Bulgars , Moguls , and Tatars .
Knowledge of , for example , the chariot seems to have moved from the Russian forest steppe ( the earliest known examples date to 2800 B.C. ) to the Carpathian basin in Hungary and , by the 16th century B.C. , to Mycenaean Greece and Sweden .
Sarmatian horsemen , originally from central Asia , served in northern England as mercenaries in the Roman army .
By water and over land , through far - flung webs of trade and tribute , the most disparate cultures reached and changed each other .
The beliefs and technologies behind megalithic tombs found along Europe ’s Atlantic coast as far north as the Orkneys spread to Minoan Crete by 3000B.C. Identical amber jewelry is found only in southern Britain and Mycenaean Greek sites , strongly suggesting direct contact between the societies of Homeric Greece and prehistoric Britain .
Images of the same type of warrior are found in Sardinia , Egypt , and Scandinavia by about 1300 B.C. Archaic Greek building techniques were used in southern Germany in the sixth century B.C.
At a Dark Ages trading center in central Sweden , active from the sixth through ninth centuries A.D. , archaeologists have excavated coins from the eastern and western Roman empires , a ladle from Egypt , a bishop ’s crosier from Ireland , and a bronze statue of Buddha from India .
In the Byzantium of the 900s , the Varangian guard was made up wholly of Scandinavian mercenaries .
“ It may have been a member of the guard , ” Cunliffe notes , “ who scratched his name , Halfdan , in runes … in the church of Hagia Sophia , leaving a poignant reminder of the confrontation of two very different cultures . ”
My circumstances are different from most people but today I believe everyone should seek security first .
Some of you may be asking the question , do I have anything in equities ?
My shareholding in Hargreaves Lansdown is probably all the exposure to equities I need .
I do admit to having others which have gone down in line with the market .
In Pollster 's poll of polls :
Even in Republican - skewed RCP , he 's at 49.2 - his highest ever on RCP - and ahead in five of six battleground polls .
Obama 's amazing money machine is making a difference :
The disparities in resources is stark , with Obama closing in on a 3 - 1 margin in spending .
The cash - flush RNC is obviously spending its money on other things like field , and saving up up for one last barrage of sleazy attack ads .

In the latest of a series for the BBC News website , celebrities and news - makers get grilled in exactly five minutes by Matthew Stadlen .
This week , Matthew 's in New York to meet Jerry Springer , who talks about his outrageous TV show , America 's future and his love of Britain .
NOVEMBER 18 --Claiming that he has been unfairly branded a " douchebag " in the book " Hot Chicks with Douchebags , " a Las Vegas man has filed a libel lawsuit against the volume 's author and publisher .
Michael Minelli , a 27 - year - old club promoter , alleges that the inclusion of his photograph in the book has subjected him to " hatred , contempt , and humiliation " and has resulted in " friends , acquaintances , coworkers , employees , and strangers alike " calling him a " douchebag . "
As seen here , Minelli 's photo appears on page 202 of author Jay Louis 's book , which was published in July by Simon & Schuster .
In the book , Louis noted that Minelli's " popped - collar , spikey - haired presence was so far beyond regular douche , so far beyond uberdouche , he could spontaneously create a new element on the periodic tables -- Douche Nine . "
At the time he was photographed by Louis , Minelli was working the door at the popular " Rehab " party at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino .
As first reported by Courthouse News Service , Minelli's Clark County District Court lawsuit seeks unspecified financial damages and legal fees .
Last month , three New Jersey women sued Louis and his publisher over their appearance in " Hot Chicks with Douchebags , " which they claimed was " vulgar " and presented them as " females who date dubious men . " ( 5 pages )
“ Hi Sue , I ’m doing your book , we have to read it and just wanna say it ’s the most boring crap book I ever read , so thanks a lot for ruining my life .
Cheers . ”
“ Hi Susan , we ’re doing your book , I ’ve gotta do coursework only I do n’t understand about context , what is it , and I do n’t no any other gothic writers and we ’ve got to compare you , what ’s gothic anyway .
Pleeeeze reply asap . ”
“ Hi . I ’ve got this essay to do for tomoz , it ’s about I ’m the king of the castle and does the setting play an important part in the story .
Can you reply tonight and do it in bullet points so I can copy and paste it straight in .
thanks you ’re a star in advance , cheers … ”
“ Hi , we have to do this essay on context with your book , and cultural context so what are those please , please explain carefully , I do n’t get it . ”
Those are genuine , and very representative , emails from school pupils , sent via my author website .
The books they refer to are I ’m the King of the Castle , set for GCSE English , and The Woman in Black ( Theatre Studies ) .
I also receive ( far fewer ) questions about Strange Meeting , set for the A - level module on the First World War .
Two years ago , inundated by questions on the books , I set up a special section of my blog in which I answered some of the Frequently Asked Questions on all three novels and occasionally took up a particular topic related to one of them and wrote about it at length .
I hoped this would ease the flow of emails I had to answer .
It did n’t .
I do n’t think any of them got beyond “ Contact Susan ” before firing off their query – looking into the FAQs seemed too much trouble .
But then , so , quite frequently , was reading one of the books themselves , or reading all of it rather than bite - sized chunks – let alone actually answering questions , writing an essay , doing coursework .
Why bother , when the author was there to do it for you ?
Worse , I have had questions not just from pupils but from teachers explaining that they are studying the books via videos of old TV versions and reading only short sections of the text itself .
“ They find it hard to read a whole novel , ” one teacher apologised .
In that case , they should not be doing GCSE literature at all .
I am happy to reply to the cries for help .
It has become distressingly clear to me that too many school pupils are taught badly , lazily , unintelligently and cursorily .
They are not taught how to read and understand novels or to write essays and coursework and answer questions about them .
Judging by the evidence of their emails , many should not be studying English literature at all , but with guidance , understanding and above all enthusiastic teaching they could certainly be helped to get more out of books – any books – than they are .
It is unhelpful to complain that “ things are not what they were in my day ” , though I sometimes envy George Eliot and Hardy , Shakespeare , Donne and Keats , not so much for being great writers as for being dead and unable to be consulted .
We studied dead authors at school and even when I read English at King ’s College , London in the ’60s the course only went up to 1880 .
Modern Literature was a special option and one could get a degree without reading any living author .
I have no doubt that we should not turn back that clock .
In the ’50s , far fewer students studied for O - and even fewer for A - Level English Literature than now .
Those who did were much better equipped to study the classic authors , simply because they were the academically bright and well motivated , having passed the 11 - Plus to grammar school .
The rest ( disregarding the independent sector ) went to Secondary Modern schools where more of them studied just English language .
Of course , there were drawbacks – no educational system is perfect .
But not all pupils should study literature to GCSE and A - level standard .
They are not equipped to learn how to analyse complex verse and prose or to develop critical awareness .
Not all of them need to , or will ever , find practical application for those particular skills .
But all children can learn how to read for pleasure , and for the enrichment of their lives , understanding and imagination .
If those who struggle with analysis and textual comparison were introduced to a wide variety of books which they simply might enjoy reading , far fewer would be put off all literature for the rest of their lives .
It saddens me greatly to think that my own novels may be taught so badly , so dully and so mechanically that they will contribute to this loathing of books .
I have seen enough school essays and coursework to know that standards are lower than they were .
But which standards ?
Of teaching , of exam marking ?
Yet the Examination Boards ’ requirements are exacting enough .
This course aims to promote in students a knowledge of and affection for English Lit. , and to lead them to an understanding of the literary uses of language and the human and spiritual dimensions of literary works .
Students should develop the ability to read , understand and respond to a wide range of literary texts , appreciate the ways in which authors achieve their effects and develop the skills necessary for literary study ; develop awareness of social , historical and cultural contexts and influences in the study of literature ; develop the ability to construct and convey meaning in speech and writing , matching style to audience and purpose .
But there is many a slip twixt cup and lip , and written work I have seen often falls far short of those requirements .
It may be that the competent students , with ability to study literature to A - level and
beyond , are confident and well taught enough not to need my help .
Perhaps the only ones I encounter are those struggling at the bottom of the heap .
I simply wonder if they should be in this particular heap at all .
Bright pupils will be able to understand and fulfil the GCSE examination board requirements above .
Yet they are the ones I am concerned about when it comes to A - level , because there should be a big leap in the standards required , and judging by the new AS - and A - level syllabus , that is not so .
Not enough is being demanded of the cleverest pupils , who should be studying literature at this level .
It is not a question of “ when I was your age , things were a lot harder ” .
They were certainly different and the books we studied more demanding – and more numerous – than those on the current syllabus .
I did a lot of rote - learning to pass the exams – I had the blessed ability then to get by heart whole pages of novels and long poems , most of which I still remember .
It was handy , in the days before it was permissible to take the text into the exam room , and it stands me in good stead now for crosswords , but otherwise I question the value of it .
I could impress by regurgitating long paragraphs verbatim , but were my critical and analytical abilities in any way improved or tested by this ?
I had certainly no notion of what was meant by the “ cultural and social context ” of novels – if , indeed , anybody had ever asked such a question .
A more careful , considered and critical response is required of students now , at least in examinations .
But I query the purpose of the new “ creative and transformational ” writing modules of the A - level syllabus .
Empathy questions are most popular in the study of history , and at primary school age they are of value .
At eight or nine years , my own children spent days pretending to be Romans , and dressed up as Victorian children to spend a school day as they would have done in 1880 .
It brought history to life in a way my dull lessons from textbooks never did .
But far more should be expected of those aged 16 plus , and I get anguished requests for help from pupils who find “ transformational and creative writing ” almost impossible .
They are asked to take on the persona of one of my characters and write a new chapter for the novel in that guise , or else they must write a new ending , changing the story or bringing it up to date .
That was my job when I was writing the book as it is my job now .
But mine is not a skill to be acquired in five terms , let alone imparted by the average school teacher .
The study of English literature is something quite different from creative writing and students with great academic ability often find the “ transformational writing ” tasks vague and frustrating .
But why should they be expected to write as I write ?
If the pupils who find analysing a novel and writing a critical essay about it difficult are being challenged beyond their limits , then the academically able are not being challenged enough .
Iris Murdoch once told me school students should not be studying her novels , they should only read the classics , the great Victorians , the major poets – in other words , the dead .
I am sure that the brightest should indeed be studying the canon , as well as some modern writers – the key words being “ as well ” .
A serious concern now is the way the exam syllabus is structured , in terms of teacher - choice .
Once , it was “ either Hamlet or King Lear , ” “ The Mill on the Floss or Jane Eyre , ” but now it can be between , “ Far from the Madding Crowd or A Kestrel for a Knave ” , “ poems by Wordsworth or Carol Ann Duffy ” , and too many teachers will take the easier option – and it is easier to teach Duffy than Wordsworth , I ’m the King of the Castle than Wuthering Heights .
At GCSE the emphasis is almost wholly on modern writers , at A - level slightly less so , but the pendulum has still swung very far in the modern direction over the last few decades .
Teachers are afraid of their pupils being bored – or rather , of saying they are bored .
But it is the nature of the teenager to affect boredom .
The challenge to the teacher is to bypass that affectation and to interest , enthuse and excite .
The word “ relevant ” rears its head a great deal , too .
Modern writers are regarded as “ relevant ” to the interests and concerns of young people , while dead writers are not .
Yet it is a teacher ’s job to reveal how dead authors , classic writers , can be just as relevant to their pupils , in terms of the experience of being human , of emotions felt or perceptions shared .
I fear that too many teachers are themselves afraid .
They are afraid of being bored and not finding books “ relevant ” , and afraid of challenge , of complexity , of difficult language , of anything that is not immediately accessible and easily digestible .
One of the reasons is that they often do not read themselves , for interest and enrichment , regularly and widely .
I have despaired , going into the homes of teachers – and yes , teachers of English – and seeing no books , of talking to teachers of English and discovering that they only read the set texts of the day and have never studied anything beyond the syllabus .
How can they hope to broaden the literary horizons of all their pupils if they do not broaden their own ?
But to return to those emails .
Several things are clear even from the few I quoted – and I do know that these are teenagers who never write formal letters with a pen on paper , but whose natural mode of communication is text and email .
I have no objection to informal phrasing and a direct approach , I understand that they write and send in an instant , do not reread or spell - check .
I hope I am not stuffy , but I do object to “ Hi Sue ” .
Nobody ever calls me “ Sue ” and it is impolite to shorten someone ’s first name automatically .
If they sign “ Joshua ” , I do not reply “ Dear Josh ” .
I do n’t require deference , just friendly politeness .
But it is not their fault .
They have not been taught .
Nobody has said , “ If you write to the author of a book you are studying , you should address them politely as ‘ Dear Miss Hill ’ . ”
Manners are not automatic , like breathing .
Nor is grammar .
I suppose I could correct the spelling and grammar errors , but if I did so , replying to their desperate emails would take me twice as long .
But what about attitude ?
That depends .
I do not mind informality but rudeness and even abuse get short shrift .
I do not ignore them , I reply in no uncertain terms and it is often pleasantly surprising to receive a charming apology , such as this one : “ Dear Mrs Hill , I was dead out of order , I am really , really sorry .
I hope you forgive me .
I did n’t mean to be rude and reading what I wrote I see now I was , only I was a bit stressed out , so please forgive me and I take back about saying your book was crap .
I ’m reeeellly sorry .
Love from … ”
I often tackle straightforward questions by suggesting where they might find out the answers for themselves and I often wonder how far they have simply not had some things explained to them clearly enough and how far they have been listening to their iPods at the time .
I always correct any misinformation and , above all , I try to help them to see that the text stands alone and that their opinion of it has value , provided they have read it carefully and can explain why they find that something carries a particular meaning .
I go on to explain that I may not have put that meaning there consciously , because so much of what a writer does is unconscious , but that nevertheless it is valid .
This usually comes as a revelation and that is one of the tremendous advantages of studying a living author .
I , that author , can give students permission to interpret my novel as they wish , encourage them to articulate their findings and validate the meanings they uncover for themselves in my text , even if those meanings are new to me .
Those interpretations are often fresh and insightful and rarely as far - fetched and obscure as those of many an academic critic .
If only I could have had such validation for my interpretations from Hardy and George Eliot and Donne .
It can be difficult to make students see that studying literature is not like studying maths , that there are rarely simple right / wrong
answers , that I cannot tell them something definitive which , on exact repetition , will ensure they pass their exam with high marks .
This is a difficult concept to grasp at the age of 15 or so .
Panic sets in .
“ But you ’ve got to know the answer , you wrote the f—ing book did n’t you ? ”
But encouraging , helping , explaining , clarifying – teaching , even – are one thing .
Writing their essays , doing their coursework , providing nuggets of information in bullet - point form to be cut and pasted in are another matter .
Last week , I told a girl that no , I would not actually write her essay for her .
“ Why not ? ” she replied .
Did she genuinely not know ?
Do I mind being “ a set book author ” ?
No , so long as I can somehow make everyone who has to study a book of mine understand that what I wrote was a novel , a story , to be read and enjoyed , not a set text on which exam questions could be set .
One of the novels I studied for O - level was George Eliot ’s Silas Marner .
It was dully taught , we analysed it out of existence , and I have never been able to face it since .
I often implore students not to let this happen to my books .
I wonder if they listen .
One of the biggest debates among people who like scifi — aside from the Star Wars vs. Star Trek thing — is where to draw the line between science and magic .
Some adhere to the idea that magic is simply science that we do n't yet understand , others feel that magic represents an essential mystery that can't be understood rationally .
Of course the other big dividing line between magic and science has to do with genre : magic appears mostly in fantasy stories , and science ( of course ) in science fiction .
And yet there is currently a trend in the scifi world toward creating stories that blur the line between science and magic :
A lot of steampunk novels blend technology and sorcery ( one of my favorite examples is in Elizabeth Bear 's New Amsterdam , where one of the characters is a " forensic sorceress " ) .
And shows like Lost and X - Files have frequently mingled the mystical and the rational .
We talked to five authors whose fiction blurs the line between magic and science to find out what they thought of the difference between the two .
Here 's what they said .
Advertisement
Jeff VanderMeer , author of City of Saints and Madmen ( and , with Ann VanderMeer , a columnist for io9 ) :
The main difference is that science exists and magic does n't .
Even though everything in a novel is made up in a sense , this still matters - it creates different responsibilities .
If , for example , the physical laws of a fantastical or SF world are different than our world , there has to be some explanation , no matter how off - the - cuff .
And if that world contains magic , I think the writer has to be even more rigorous in thinking out how magical systems work , no matter how much of that appears in the text .
This is because we are used to constraint .
We are worlds of blood - and - water existing within a larger but finite network of people and settings , and all of that is constrained by the egg - yolk that is the Earth .
If even something as arbitrary and recent as a sonnet suffers from constraint , then magic can be no different .
Of course , if you 're a surrealist or absurdist , you often do n't care about the difference between science and magic because the boundary between the two is going to be trampled and gleefully pissed on anyway .
As well it should .
Nothing is more annoying than allowing a little reality ruin your fun .
If you have the imagination to get away with it .
Or , if you 're Jack Vance , you just set your stories far enough in the future that the science seems like magic and you sit back in your golden throne , fold your arms , and cackle like either a mad scientist or a crazy sorcerer - take your pick .
One reason I have no magic in most of my fiction is that I cannot believe in it and thus cannot write about it in any convincing way .
This is the same reason you do not find unicorns in my fiction .
Or Smurfs .
Or Republicans .
I can and do , however , believe in huge intelligent squid ponderously pulling themselves through the alleys of a weird city , protecting themselves with helmets full of water .
I can also believe in nefarious mushroom - based intelligent life forms living in bizarre underground caverns .
However , since this is merely an audacious application of current theory on biology and biological systems it amounts to perfectly good science .

Elizabeth Bear , author of New Amsterdam and Dust :
That 's a really interesting question , especially since for both SF and fantasy , I tend to lift my " rules " — whether that means the laws of physics or the laws of magic — from outside sources .
Basically , in terms of writing — science fiction or fantasy — science and magic both serve ( for me ) to form a framework upon which I can hang the rest of the story .
They 're a structural element .
So I try to find the coolest bits of either than I can .

Stephen Hunt , author of Court of the Air :
A fantasy author creates a monster by having a character in robes of any colour mumbling a spell , whereas the rules clearly state a science fiction writer has to put the character in white robes only , and have them mumbling something about genetic engineering and how at termination of protein synthesis , type I release factors promote hydrolysis of the peptidyl - transfer RNA connection in reaction to recognition of a stop codon .
For the average reader , though , these both seem equally magic .

Ted Chiang , author of Stories of Your Life and Others :
Roughly speaking , if you can mass - produce it , it 's science , and if you can't , it 's magic .
As an example , suppose someone says she can transform lead into gold .
If we can use her technique to build factories that turn lead into gold by the ton , then she 's made an incredible scientific discovery .
If on the other hand it 's something that only she can do , and only under special conditions , then she 's a magician .
And I do n't mean that she 's a charlatan ; she might actually be able to transform lead into gold .
But scientific phenomena are reproducible by other investigators ; they are n't dependent on a specific person .
Electricity might have seemed magical at one time in history , but it works for everyone ; you do n't need to have an innate talent or be descended from someone special for a light bulb to turn on which you flip a switch .
It took the work of very smart people to get us to the point that we can all use electricity , but none of them were magicians , precisely because they were able to make their discovery work for everyone .
To go on at slightly greater length , the reason magic can't be mass - produced is that it usually relies on some subjective quality of the practitioner : her intense concentration , her spiritual purity , something that can't be substituted with another person or with a machine .
Magic is , in a sense , evidence that the universe knows you 're a person .
When people say that the scientific worldview implies a cold , impersonal universe , this is what they 're talking about .
Magic is when the universe responds to you in a personal way .

China Miéville , author of Perdido Street Station and Un Lun Dun :
What is the difference between science and magic ?
In real life , loads .
In SF , I think the question 's misleading , because I think that whatever SF may think and claim , and however much individual books may justly pride themselves on scientific accuracy , fundamentally the genre is not predicated on ' real ' science at all .
It 's about apparently authoritative use of supposed scientific language , or , to put it another way , bullshitting .
And that is not ( necessarily ) a dis .

There you have it , dear readers .
What do you think ?
LittleBigPlanet is a great game ; unfortunately , it has n't turned out to be quite the system seller that Sony was hoping for .
The game debuted at number 4 on the UK sales chart ; meanwhile , it was the eighth best selling game in North America last month .
And while these are respectable numbers , Sony 's David Wilson has said that they would be even higher if it were n't for the glut of high - profile holiday releases .
" We are also pleased with its commercial performance , " Wilson told GamesIndustry .
Biz .
" In other times of the year , it would be a clear number one — so you have to put the chart in context .
This is an incredibly volatile time of year and the chart reflects that —
November 7 saw 47 titles released on that one day alone , including many big hitters with Christmas number one aspirations .
Look at the chart this week — the top four are all brand new entries . "
Wilson also believes that LBP had a tougher time because it was going up against games in established franchises , while it was a new intellectual property .
The game was launched alongside Fallout 3 and MotorStorm : Pacific Rift ; meanwhile , the likes of Fable II , Gears of War 2 , Resistance 2 and more were all released within a week of LBP .
" LittleBigPlanet has also sold well given that this is a brand new IP , " Wilson explained .
" Our industry is littered with examples of brand new innovative titles that have been lauded by the critics but have sold dismally .
But Sony is delighted and honored to be working with hugely talented developers who can create brilliantly creative original games . "
But while the initial sales of the game may not have been as high as expected , the nature of LBP suggests that it could very well be a game with legs .
" It is also a game that will benefit enormously from word of mouth and from people trying it out with friends or in store — it drips fun and charm in equal measure , " Wilson said .
" Also the bulk of our marketing , including our six - figure TV advertising campaign , does n't roll out until December , so we genuinely believe that Sackboy has n't even hit his stride yet . "
Sony 's spin on the numbers once again begs the question , why do publishers insist on releasing so many games in the fourth quarter ?
If LBP would have sold better at a different time of the year , why not release it earlier or hold on to it a little longer ?
Instead , a wonderful game gets much less attention then it deserves because it is going up against such stiff competition .
Hopefully , time will show that the game does indeed have legs , as it would be a shame for PS3 owners to miss out on this experience .

First Dog Barney Bites a White House Reporter ( Video )
Perhapsis upset with the outcome of the presidential election or was just having a bad morning .
In a case of bad doggy manners , the Scottish terrier took a nip out of a member of the White House press corps today .
Reuters political reporter Jon Decker had just wrapped up a piece for MSNBC at 10:30 a.m. and was heading back to the press room when he saw First Dog Barney on the lawn with his custodian .
The reporter asked permission to pet the pooch and was promptly rewarded with a snap and snarl .
Decker checked his smarting finger and discovered that Barney had broken skin .
He muttered , " that 's not good . "
Heading back to the building to fetch a band aid , he was directed by colleagues to check with the nurse .
She , in turn , sent him packing to White House physician Dr. Richard Tubb , who gave him a tetanus shot and a prescription for an antibiotic .
Let this be a cautionary tale to all future reporters .
Word on the street is that President - elect Barack Obama has promised his daughters Malia and Sasha a dog !
Laura Bush told reporters that Barney is in the dog house over the incident .
Check out the video below .
Lawyers for leading Zimbabwean human rights activists and political detainees abducted by the state , held incommunicado for weeks and then imprisoned in defiance of a court order have accused the police of torturing them in an attempt to extract false confessions of a plot against President Robert Mugabe .
The lawyers are demanding the release of Jestina Mukoko , one of the country 's most prominent activists and head of the Zimbabwe Peace Project , and eight others who were jailed on Christmas Eve despite a judge ruling that they should be moved to hospital and examined by doctors for signs of torture .
" The state is in contempt of court , " said Alec Muchadehama , one of the lawyers for the detainees .
" The reason they brought some of them to court is for public relations purposes to save their image but the truth is that they have no intention of releasing them .
The police have not moved an inch and our clients are still detained at Chikurubi maximum security prison , including [ a ] two - year - old child . "
Mukoko was taken from her home by armed men on 3 December .
Five days later , Police Chief Superintendent T Nzombe wrote to the national NGO coalition saying Mukoko was not in police custody and that the state regarded her disappearance as a " kidnapping " .
But Mukoko and eight others were suddenly brought to court on Christmas Eve , when it was revealed that they had been in police custody all along .
They were accused of being part of a plot to train an armed group in Botswana to attack Zimbabwe and remove Mugabe from power .
The government and state - run media has made much of the supposed plot in recent weeks but produced no firm evidence .
Last week , South Africa 's president , Kgalema Motlanthe , said the Zimbabwean government had raised the accusations at regional meetings but " we never believed " it .
" Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country ?
The answer is no .
That 's not America .
Is there something wrong with a seven - year - old Muslim - American kid believing he or she could be president ?
Yet I have heard senior members of my own party drop the suggestion that he is a Muslim and might have an association with terrorists .

Yesterday was Veteran 's Day ( or Armistice or Remembrance Day , depending on where you live ) , a day set aside to honor those who have served in the military .
Today , on the day after , it seems appropriate to share some photographs of U.S. soldiers currently in the thick of war in Afghanistan .
Getty Images photographer John Moore spent some time recently in Afghanistan 's Korengal Valley , near the Pakistani border , with Viper Company of the 1 - 26 Infantry , and brought back these images , documenting what he saw .
The final two photographs do not involve Korengal , but are striking examples of these difficult and complex times , and the sacrifice of one American family .

Microsoft announced it was moving away from its commercials featuring Bill Gates and Jerry Seinfeld just two weeks after unveiling the baffling teaser ads .
Although the Seinfeld spots were so short - lived that they might be dubbed a failure — particularly since Seinfeld 's deal with Microsoft is rumored to be worth $ 10 million — Microsoft and ad agency Crispin Porter claimed that the teasers did what they set out to do .
The tale of Gates and Seinfeld traipsing around with the common man was n't the first ad campaign to struggle to find its audience .
If Microsoft execs need a boost , they can console themselves that it could have been worse .
They could have run one of these campaigns :
1. Virgin Blue Encourages Travelers to " Chuck a Sickie " 
Earlier this year , budget Australian airline Virgin Blue ran a campaign telling potential passengers to " chuck a sickie "  to take advantage of the carrier 's ultra - thrifty fares .
If you 're unfamiliar with Australian slang like I was , you might think this campaign was some sort of horrifying effort to encourage the tossing of ill people .
Instead , " chuck a sickie "  is a more benign term for taking a sick day from work .
Virgin Blue head Brett Godfrey did n't see the campaign as harmless fun , though ; he did n't appreciate how they supported workplace absenteeism .
Godfrey reportedly ordered the ads pulled just 29 minutes after seeing them for the first time .
2. Chevy Lets Users Generate Attack Ads
In 2006 Chevrolet ran a promotion tied to an episode of The Apprentice .
The idea was that fans of the Chevy Tahoe could go on Chevy 's website and " build their own " 
Tahoe ads from stock footage of the SUV rumbling through the wilderness .
Chevy 's website would host the ads , and the best ones would win concert and sporting event tickets for their directors .
However , the site drew more than a few directors seeking a soapbox from which to lambaste SUVs , often with hilarious results .
The natural settings in the stock footage coupled with the directors ' own trenchant barbs about environmental degradation fostered some truly biting attack ads that ran on Chevrolet 's own servers .
Here 's an example :
3. Benetton Goes to Death Row
Italian clothing maker Benetton has never backed down from a controversial ad campaign ; at various points the company has run pictures of terminal AIDS patients and a priest kissing a nun .
However , many critics thought the designer finally crossed the line in 2000 with the campaign " We , On Death Row , "  which featured death - row inmates wearing their prison uniforms .
The company 's catalog contained pictures of 25 death - row prisoners , and their faces also appeared in print ads and on billboards around the world .
The campaign 's creator , Benetton creative director Oliviero Toscani claimed that the images were simply used to draw attention to the brutality of the death penalty .
Families of the prisoners ' victims and victims '- rights groups contended the photos and accompanying narrative glorified the convicts and portrayed the killers as the actual victims .
( The ads did n't mention the often - grisly crimes for which the subjects were imprisoned . )
Public outrage grew so quickly that Sears terminated its contract to peddle Benetton 's clothes , and the campaign could still be considered to be one of advertising 's bigger blunders in poor taste .
4. Nike Dunks Its Sneaker Shots
Nike 's Hyperdunk basketball shoes got a huge shot in the arm earlier this year when the viral video of Kobe Bryant wearing the sneakers and jumping over an Aston Martin became a web sensation .
The print ads Wieden +
Kennedy designed to go along with the shoes did n't fare quite so well .
The ads presented large photographs of a basketball player being dunked on ; the center of each shot was the hapless defender 's face , which was obscured by the flying dunker 's thighs and waist .
Slogans like " That ai n't right "  appeared on top of the image .
To basketball players , it seems apparent that the " that "  in question is being on the receiving end of a ferocious dunk .
Others , though , thought that the key to the image was one man 's groin in another 's face , and " That ai n't right "  was actually a homophobic slam .
Following a heated debate on Wieden +
Kennedy 's blog and a loud public outcry , Nike scrapped the ads .
5. Just For Feet Trips at the Super Bowl
The Super Bowl is the biggest stage for advertising , and as such , it can be the scene for some of the industry 's biggest failures .
Few ads in history have failed quite so spectacularly as the one footwear chain Just for Feet ran during the 1999 Super Bowl .
The spot portrayed a Humvee of white mercenaries chasing an African runner before giving him a cup of drugged water and then forcing a pair of Nikes on his feet while he 's passed out .
The ad weathered criticism for being colonialist , racist , and pro-drugging ; the whole thing was offensive enough that no one seemed to even notice it did n't even really make sense .
Want more proof that the ad was transcendentally bad ?
Just For Feet sued its ad agency , Saatchi & Saatchi , for $ 10 million for convincing the company to run the ad despite its misgivings .
Although Just for Feet eventually dropped the lawsuit , the company filed for bankruptcy protection later that year amid a serious accounting fraud .

One man called 999 to complain about a pizza order A priest dialled 999 when staff at Manchester Airport 's WHSmith would not allow him to use the toilet , police have revealed .
It was one of many " frivolous " calls made to Greater Manchester Police ( GMP ) , which dealt with 5,000 emergency reports over Christmas .
The force has urged the public not to dial 999 for " ridiculous " reasons .
One woman complained she was unable to get through to Strictly Come Dancing to vote for Tom Chambers in the final .
While a hoax caller reported Santa was breaking into a house with Rudolf .
People calling 999 for non-emergencies and silly pranks can have a major impact on members of the public who need the police
Supt Karen Lee , Greater Manchester Police Police also received a 999 call from a man who complained staff at a takeaway had wrongly put mushrooms on his pizza .
Another caller dialled the number to ask for chemist opening times .
Supt Karen
Lee said : " I do n't want a person to call 999 and be delayed because someone else is calling to report something that is not an emergency or , worse still , that is completely ridiculous and a deliberate joke .
" People dialling 999 for non-emergency calls can put lives at risk because it could delay someone who really needs urgent help getting through . "
During the festive period officers have so far dealt with 72 hoax calls .
With New Year 's
Eve the force 's " busiest night " , police have warned they do not want to have their time wasted .
Supt Lee added : " People calling 999 for non-emergencies and silly pranks can have a major impact on members of the public who need the police . "
Last new year GMP dealt with more than 3,000 emergency calls in six hours after midnight , and thousands more were taken on the force 's non-emergency numbers .

FOR ANYONE WHO has ever worried about the power of a vicious rumor , Barack Obama 's strategy over the summer must have seemed almost bizarre .
Buffeted by rumors about his religion , his upbringing , and controversial statements made by his wife , Obama launched Fight the Smears , a website that lists every well - traveled false rumor about the candidate , alongside rebuttals and explanations for how the rumors arose .
Fighting rumors by publicizing them in vivid , high - profile locations is , to say the least , a surprising tactic .
It 's hard to imagine someone victimized by workplace rumors summarizing them and posting them on the lunchroom wall .
The conventional wisdom about rumors is to take the high road and not respond .
When John McCain , during the 2000 Republican primaries , was plagued with rumors that he had fathered an illegitimate child , for the most part he opted not to engage with them at all .
Why would anyone want to broadcast negative claims about themselves ?
And yet new research into the science of rumors suggests Obama 's approach may be a sounder strategy - and the reasons why it makes sense suggest that we misunderstand both how rumors work and why they exist .
By using the tools of evolutionary theory and new approaches to mathematical modeling , researchers are drawing a clearer picture of how and why rumors spread .
As they do , they are finding that far from being merely idle or malicious gossip , rumor is deeply entwined with our history as a species .
It serves some basic social purposes and provides a valuable window on not just what people talk to each other about , but why .
Rumors , it turns out , are driven by real curiosity and the desire to know more information .
Even negative rumors are n't just scurrilous or prurient - they often serve as glue for people 's social networks .
And although it seems counterintuitive , these facts about rumor suggest that , often , the best way to help stem a rumor is to spread it .
The idea of " not dignifying a rumor with a response " reflects a deep misunderstanding of what rumors are , how they are fueled , and what purposes they serve in society .
McCain 's approach in this election seems more in tune with this theory .
With rumors circulating in the blogosphere that Sarah Palin 's youngest baby might actually have been her daughter 's child , the campaign did n't turn the other cheek :
It released a statement from the Palin family that Bristol really was pregnant .
The strategy worked .
The other rumor was squelched .
Rumor has been around as long as human civilization , and for much of that time has been frowned upon .
The Bible has some stern words for those who spread rumors : " A man who lacks judgment derides his neighbor , " the Book of Proverbs reads , " but a man of understanding holds his tongue . "
Rumors have long been seen as at best trivial , and at worst vicious and immoral .
Experts began to look at rumors more analytically in the 1940s and 1950s , in a wave of research fueled by concern about how rumors could be managed during wartime .
Though interest waned during the following decades , rumor studies have seen a resurgence in the last decade or so - partly because researchers are now more able to tackle complex , dynamic phenomena , and partly because they 're newly armed with the biggest ongoing social psychology experiment in human history , the Internet , which provides them with terabytes of recorded rumors and a way to track them .
In 2004 , the Rochester Institute of Technology psychologist Nicholas DiFonzo and another rumor researcher , Prashant Bordia , analyzed more than 280 Internet discussion group postings that contained rumors .
They found that a good chunk of the discourse consisted of the participants sharing and evaluating information about the rumors and discussing whether they seemed likely .
They realized , in other words , that people on the sites were n't swapping rumors just to gossip ; they were using rumors as a vehicle to get to the truth , the same way people read news .
" Lots of times people will share a rumor not for their benefit or for the other person 's benefit , but simply because they 're trying to figure out the facts , " says DiFonzo , one of the leading figures in the resurgence of rumor research .
He published a book on the topic this fall : " The Watercooler Effect : A Psychologist Explores the Extraordinary Power of Rumors . "
Some types of facts seem to be more urgent triggers than others .
Rumors that involve negative outcomes tend to start and spread more easily than ones that involve positive outcomes .
Researchers sort rumors into " dread rumors , " driven by fear ( " I heard the company is downsizing " ) , and " wish rumors , " driven by hope ( " I heard our Christmas bonus will be bigger this year " ) .
Dread rumors , it turns out , are far more contagious .
In a study involving a large public hospital in Australia that was in the midst of a restructuring , Bordia and his colleagues collected 510 rumors that could be classified as dread rumors or wish rumors .
Four hundred and seventy - nine of them were dread rumors .
Perhaps even more than negative stories dominate the news , negative rumors dominate the grapevine .
In the absence of other sources of information , people turn to rumors to answer their most urgent concerns - suggesting that rumors play a vital role , not a peripheral or idle one , in times of worry , and can have a profound impact on how a town , city , or society reacts to a negative event .
This is a much more neutral view of rumors than the Bible , or traditional etiquette , might take .
And indeed , rumor researchers tend to see them nonjudgmentally , as inherent to human nature - naturally occurring , inevitable human social phenomena , rather than pesky distractions from more civilized discourse .
Aside from their use as a news grapevine , rumors serve a second purpose as well , researchers have found :
People spread them to shore up their social networks , and boost their own importance within them .
To the extent people do have an agenda in spreading rumors , it 's directed more at the people they 're spreading them to , rather than at the subject of the rumor .
People are rather specific about which rumors they share , and with whom , researchers have found :
They tend to spread rumors to warn friends of potential trouble , or otherwise help them , while remaining mum if it would be harmful to spread a given rumor in a certain context or to a certain person .
It 's not just altruism : Rumors can build status for the person who spreads them .
The psychologists John L. Shelton and Raymond S. Sanders , in documenting the impact of a murder of an undergraduate on the Ohio State University campus in 1972 on the student body , found that those with access to " inside information " about the crime and the administration 's response were instantly granted higher social status .
So simply possessing - or being seen as possessing - potentially useful information can serve in and of itself as a motivation to spread rumors .
When it comes to rumors about people rather than events , psychologists have found that we pay especially close attention to rumors about powerful people and their moral failings .
Frank McAndrew , a professor of psychology at Knox College who studies the evolutionary roots of gossip , has found that we 're particularly likely to spread negative rumors about " high - status " individuals , whether they 're our bosses , professors , or celebrities .
Our behavior , McAndrew suggests , evolved in an environment in which information about others was crucially important .
Back when humans lived in small groups , he theorizes , information about those higher than us on the totem pole - especially information about their weaknesses - would have been hugely valuable , and the only source we had for such information was other people .
( McAndrew 's work , much of which focuses on our obsession with celebrity culture , suggests our brains are n't terribly adept at distinguishing people who are " actually " important from people who simply receive a lot of attention . )
If the fundamental dynamics of rumor have roots that run deep into history , the means of transmission have been changing a great deal recently .
Unlike previous forms of media , the Internet has created a two - way street - a way to quickly connect with like - minded people - that greatly multiplies the power of rumors .
" In the course of a single day , people across the country might hear the same rumor spoken in almost exactly the same words , " says Eric Foster , a psychologist at Temple University who studies gossip and social networks .
Hopelessly Corrupt Rep Goes On to Compare the Community Organization to the KKK !...
Brad Friedman Byon
10/12/2008 , 1:07 pm PT
Well , is n't this rich ?
Tom Feeney --- yes , that Tom Feeney , the one who is alleged to have commissioned vote - rigging software for touch - screen voting machines in 2000 , as testified to by former Republican software programmer Clint Curtis in a sworn affidavit , sworn testimony to congress , and a successful polygraph test --- went on Fox " News " this week to decry unsubstantiated charges of " voter fraud " by the low - income voter registration community organization ACORN .
( And if you 're done laughing ... )
Feeney --- the man who , as Speaker of the FL House in 2000 , also promised to award all of the state 's electoral votes to George W. Bush no matter what the ballots and Supreme Court had to say about it --- then went on to compare ACORN to the KKK ...
ed note : they have n't ] , or an illegal alien [ed note : have n't done that either ] , or someone to vote 20 or 30 times [ ed note : nope ] , they are cancelling out the votes of honest American citizens .
This is destructive of our democracy .
I believe every time ACORN gets a dead person to vote [ ] , or an illegal alien [ ] , or someone to vote 20 or 30 times [ ] , they are cancelling out the votes of honest American citizens .
This is destructive of our democracy .
I believe Acorn has violated more Americans ' civil rights to have their votes counted than any group since the KKK .
It 's an outrage .
The hopelessly corrupt Feeney is in a desperate campaign to save his U.S. Congressional seat in FL's 24th district , against a challenge from Democrat Suzanne Kosmas ( who recently defeated Curtis in the primary , after he had changed parties , in part , in order to try and unseat his former - colleague , Feeney . )
Feeney has also been seen on TV , of late , in his district , ' apologizing ' in an embarrassing campaign ad , for having gone on a trip to play golf in Scotland with ( and paid for by ) disgraced Republican uber - lobbyist , Jack Abramoff .
RAW STORY has more , including the video of the laughable Feeney appearance on Fox " News " this week .
BTW ...
The terrifying new documentary film , Murder , Spies & Voting Lies , detailing the Feeney / Curtis vote - rigging scandal , and The BRAD BLOG 's four year odyssey in reporting it , has now been released .
It 's also screening on LinkTV , and can be purchased --- signed by myself and filmmaker , Patty Sharaf --- as a premium in support of The BRAD BLOG right here .
UPDATE 10/12/08 : Whoops , forgot to mention that if Feeney were actually concerned about voter fraud in his home state , he 'd call for immediate prosecution in this actual , documented , but still unprosecuted case of voter fraud in Florida !
Peter Dodds is lost .
Well , not exactly .
He knows he 's going to meet me at 2:30 in the Davis Center .
But just where ?
He does n't remember .
And yet , without hesitation , he walks into the atrium , past crowds of people , up the sweeping staircase and directly into Henderson 's coffee shop .
There I sit , gulping a latte .
How did he figure out where to go ?
" t's an interesting kind of search problem , " he says .
" It just seemed like the right place to go .
I figured you would n't be hanging out with the students , and that coffee might have something to do with this .
I was right . "
That kind of intuitive problem solving , he thinks , is not simple to explain and even harder to replicate with a computer .
It 's way beyond the best artificial intelligence programs , and it would be charitable to say that neuroscience has a firm grasp of how the brain manages such a task .
But it 's not magical either .
" It 's complex , " he says .
And complexity lies at the heart of Dodd 's research and teaching as an assistant professor of mathematics and statistics .
He 's part of a group of researchers who make up UVM's Complex Systems Center launched in 2006 by the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences .
advertisement
" In its most simple form , a complex system is many distributed parts interacting in some distributed way , " Dodds says , " giving rise to some interesting , often unexpected , macrophenomena . "
Take a neuron .
Alone , it 's a cell that conducts a chemical signal .
But billions together , each woven with thousands of links that adapt and change over time , emerge as a brain capable of following a hunch and the smell of coffee .
Big Band , no conductor
While the human brain may be the ultimate complex system , other examples appear everywhere .
Take army ants .
Despite their name , they have no general , and their queen sends out no instructions .
No ant is aiming to get across that gully , and there is no blueprint or traffic light .
Yet millions of ants , following the same instinctive rules of individual behavior , can build bridges with their bodies and forage for food along vast efficient highways .
" That 's emergence , " says computer scientist Maggie Eppstein , director of the UVM Complex Systems Center .
" You ca n't just look at the rules each little thing is following and then describe what is going to happen in the whole system .
You 've got to run the model or observe the whole to understand what happens at the next scale . "
Ferociously chaotic air currents resolve into a tornado that moves across the landscape maintaining its form .
" In complex systems , through local interactions and self - organization , stable or semi-stable patterns emerge at a next level or a higher scale , " she says , " but they are difficult to predict because they are so sensitive to small changes in the system or initial conditions . "
Applying insights like these , Eppstein and her colleagues across the university are helping to lead the rapidly developing field of complex systems science .
They aim to bring new approaches to some of the world 's most vexing problems like improving hurricane forecasts , understanding the effects of phosphorus pollution in a watershed , slowing the spread of invasive species , making robots that can start to discern the intentions behind an action , and untangling the genetic and environmental threads that lead to heart disease .

The lights are on
Recall what happened on the afternoon of Aug. 14 , 2003 .
In a cascade , the lights went out in Cleveland , New York City , Baltimore , Albany and Detroit .
Eventually , more than 50 million people were without power across the Northeast and Canada as 265 power plants shut down .
This famous blackout was a complex systems failure .
No one pulled the plug ; numerous local problems and mistakes created a series of dynamic feedback loops .
The result : an unpredictable regional disaster .
" Nobody 's in charge of the electric grid , " says Paul Hines , a power engineer who is part of the UVM complex systems group , " there are hundreds of companies and entities who all have a role .
What 's amazing is that in the midst of this system , with millions of human and non-human actors — a lot that we can't predict — we still get order .
Most of the time , when you flip the switch , you get light . "
Or , as Dodds says , complex systems are " typically highly balanced , flexible , and robust , but are also susceptible to systemic collapse . "
Decades of work to improve overall control of this patchwork of operators , powerplants , substations , and transmission wires — a product of history more than rational design — have n't gotten very far .
" The reliability of the grid has basically been constant for the last 25 years , " Hines says .
He recently presented data that shows the frequency of blackouts has remained the same since 1984 , and also that very large blackouts are more frequent than would be expected from traditional exponential statistics and risk assessments .
" Traditional methods have tried to estimate the reliability of the system by taking each component individually , " Hines says .
Any one substation is pretty straightforward and may not appear to be hard to manage .
" But this misses what happens when combinations of components fail , " he says .
In a complex system , one plus one might add up to a lot more than you 'd guess .
These kinds of nonlinear interactions do n't show up in a static model that simply describes the electric grid .
Which is why Hines is developing dynamic graph - based models instead that draw on new methods from network theory .
" Our goal is not to create a complex model , our goal is to create a useful model , " he says , " a simple model that helps us understand a complex system . "
He 's feeding data from actual power systems into his model , seeking sets of components that cluster together when he runs the model since these may be particularly important to maintaining the robustness of electricity delivery systems .
Parts is not parts
" Complex systems science is just the evolution of science , " Dodds says .
Since the revolution that Newton and Descartes helped launch , the main thrust of so - called normal science has been to look for smaller pieces and more fundamental laws .
Molecules yield atoms yield quarks .
" There are many problems that we figured out by breaking things into little pieces , " Dodds says .
" Scientists figured out DNA with its double helix .
And then they figured out the human genome by measuring like crazy .
There was a sense conveyed that once we understood all the bits of the genome , we 'd understand everything human , " he says , " but that 's totally insane . "
" It 's like saying once we understand atoms we understand matter , " he says , " But we do n't . "
Of course , many of the underlying ideas behind complex systems are far older than the name .
It was Aristotle who stated that the " whole is more than the sum of the parts . "
But complex systems science takes this realization further .
As physicist PW Anderson wrote in a seminal 1972 paper in Science , in a complex system â€ œthe whole becomes not only more than , but very different from the sum of its parts . "
" The ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability start from those laws and reconstruct the universe , " Anderson wrote .
Peter Dodds stands at the bottom of the Davis Center stairs and watches students playing pool .
One after the other , they rub their cue sticks with chalk and lean over the table .
" If you want to understand how humans behave collectively you have to understand what their psychology is : and you will never get that from studying quarks or DNA or cells , " he says , as a stream of students pass around him like he 's a rock in a river .
" Never . "
WASHINGTON  Infant deaths in the United States declined 2 percent in 2006 , government researchers reported Wednesday , but the rate still remains well above that of most other industrialized countries and is one of many indicators suggesting that Americans pay more but get less from their health care system .
Infant mortality has long been considered one of the most important indicators of the health of a nation and the quality of its medical system .
In 1960 , the United States ranked 12th lowest in the world , but by 2004 , the latest year for which comparisons were issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , that ranking had dropped to 29th lowest .
This international gap has widened even though the United States devotes a far greater share of its national wealth to health care than other countries .
In 2006 , Americans spent $ 6,714 per capita on health  more than twice the average of other industrialized countries .
Some blame cultural issues like obesity and drug use .
Others say that the nation ’s decentralized health care system is failing , and some researchers point to troubling trends in preterm births and Caesarean deliveries .
BAGHDAD , Nov 17 ( Reuters ) - Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari and U.S. ambassador Ryan Crocker signed a long - awaited accord on Monday requiring Washington to withdraw its forces within three years .
The signing ceremony put a formal end to months of negotiations over the pact on the future of the U.S. presence , which the Iraqi government approved on Sunday .
The pact must still be passed in the Iraqi parliament , but the government is confident it will achieve this by the end of the month .
" Definitely , today is an historic day for Iraqi - American relations , signing the security pact after months of difficult talks and negotiations , " Zebari told reporters after exchanging signed copies with Crocker .
Both men smiled and enthusiastically shook hands as officials applauded .
Apart from the troops pact , the two men signed a long - term strategic framework , which Crocker said would define relations between the countries for years in " economy , culture , science , technology , health and trade , just to name a few . "
" It reminds us all that , at a time when U.S. forces will continue to withdraw from Iraq in recognition of the superlative security gains over the last few years , our relationship will develop in many other important ways . "
But the main focus for Iraqis is the pact at last committing the United States to withdraw a force that now numbers about 150,000 by Dec. 31 , 2011 , a firm date that reflects the growing confidence of Iraq 's government as violence has eased .
Iraqi leaders consider the date to be a major negotiating victory after the administration of outgoing President George W. Bush long vowed not to accept a firm timetable .
" This was a complicated and tough negotiation , and I think all Iraqis can be very proud of the substantial achievement that their negotiating team has witnessed , " Crocker said .
FIRST READING
Iraqi lawmakers were due to begin a first reading of the troops accord later on Monday , the start of an approval process that should run into next week .
" The final word will be for the parliament , but the political atmosphere is positive , " Zebari said .
The pact gives Iraq 's government authority over the U.S. troops presence for the first time , replacing a U.N. Security Council mandate that has governed the U.S. presence since shortly after the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein .
Under the deal , U.S. troops will leave the streets of Iraqi towns and villages by the middle of next year and leave Iraq altogether by the end of 2011 .
The deal also provides for Iraqi courts try U.S. soldiers for serious crimes committed while off duty , but only under very tight conditions .
The agreement 's passage through parliament is likely but not assured .
Followers of Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr oppose the pact altogether , and the largest Sunni Arab bloc , the Accordance Front , says it should be put to the public in a referendum .
However , if other groups follow through on their leaders ' promises to back it , the accord should pass .
The Bush administration says the accord does not need U.S. congressional approval .
Some Iraqi politicians have said it is easier to back the pact since the election of Barack Obama this month to replace Bush .
Obama pledged to withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq by mid-2010 , while his opponent John McCain opposed setting a date .
Iraq 's government has become increasingly confident of its ability to maintain order as violence has declined over the past year .
Last month saw the lowest death toll from violence since the invasion , according to government statistics .
Iran , which has influence among Iraqi Shi'ites , has opposed the pact .
But Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi did not explicitly reject the agreement on Monday , saying only that the United States must take seriously the views of Iraqi officials .

BBC News , Baghdad
It took some time to make sense of the scene in front of us .
A jailer at Baghdad 's Rusafa prison had just swung open the heavy metal - barred door .
Inside a small dimly lit room , the first sight was the iron - framed double bunks , packed together and hung with plastic bags , clothes and towels .
Then , staring back at us from the bunks , faces and faces , bearded , unshaven , balding , greying .
I feel like I 'm dead in here
Iraqi prisoner
And then into a larger room and in almost every conceivable space there was a human being .
Four or five men perched on a bunk , some even tucked on the floor underneath .
It was astonishing to see so many people packed into one space .
It 's the first time the foreign media have had such access to an Iraqi jail since the US invasion in 2003 .
They were nervous at first , at seeing their jailers at the door behind us and no doubt at seeing foreign journalists suddenly appear in their midst .
Everything is fine here , was the first thing they said .
But then a man in a long white robe or dish - dash jumped down from a bunk .
" Do n't listen to that , " he said .
" The conditions are terrible here .
There are people sleeping next to the toilets .
Some stand so that others can sleep . "
Prisoners say some have to stand to make room for others to sleep
Enlarge Image
Another man , sitting on a top bunk said : " I feel like I 'm dead in here . "
He said a court had ordered his release , then he had been re-arrested .
Because there is no proper exercise area , the inmates are rarely allowed out .
A few feet from one of the bunks , a fraying curtain covered the three toilets and one shower , which serve more than 100 people .
There were also blankets on the floor outside the toilets , where people sleep .
" We have to take it in turns to wash , once every three days , " one prisoner explained .
Allegations of abuse
It was a cool November day when we visited , but the air was warm and thick inside .
It 's hard to imagine what it must be like during Baghdad 's 50 degree Celsius summer heat .
We 'd been brought here by Iraqi Interior Ministry officials , after we had asked to check on allegations of abuse and beatings in Iraqi prisons .
To our surprise , the ministry 's second in command said we could see for ourselves .
And once we were inside , we were able to talk to the inmates freely without our conversations being monitored .
The increasing number of prisoners is putting a lot of pressure on the system
General Abdul Kareem al - Khalaf
Operations commander for the Interior Ministry Some prisoners said they had been beaten and abused , although most at the time of arrest .
What stood out , and what concerned them most was the conditions in which they are now being kept .
Some of these men are suspected insurgents detained by Iraqi police and army units , others accused of crimes like robbery .
But they often have to wait months just to be charged - let alone tried - because Iraq 's creaking judicial system cannot cope with the caseload .
With thousands arrested in security operations over the past few years , the system has become progressively more overloaded .
After an explosion or violent incident , Iraqi police and soldiers often round up anyone who happens to be nearby , so many innocent bystanders get trapped in this legal limbo , incarcerated in places like Rusafa .
' Changing culture '
The situation here is not unique .
Mobile phone footage filmed by Iraqi MPs who have visited other jails , seen by the BBC , shows similar conditions .
Prisoners can wait months in legal limbo due to a creaking judicial system " We do have a problem with overcrowding , " admits General Abdul Kareem al - Khalaf , the operations commander for the Interior Ministry .
" And the increasing number of prisoners is putting a lot of pressure on the system . "
He says there are still " some isolated cases " of violations such as torture or beatings in prisons , but insists the culture is changing .
It 's the " exceptional situation " in the country that is to blame for the way the inmates are forced to live in the prison , said Rusafa 's deputy governor , who did n't want to be named when we interviewed him .
But he said the conditions were not " inhumane " .
If you had seen the jails in Saddam Hussein 's time , " then you would have seen really inhumane conditions " .
There is less torture and other abuse now , from reports we have gathered .
But Iraqis we have spoken to who have been imprisoned in Saddam 's time and since say conditions have n't changed much .
And they could get even worse .
As the United States and Britain gradually make their exit from Iraq , they are due to transfer thousands of prisoners into the custody of the Iraqi prison system .

President Bush 's dog bites Reuters reporter David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Thursday November 6 , 2008
Print This Email This President Bush has often had a contentious relationship with the press .
But through his two terms there was never any reports of anyone needing medical attention after White House meetings .
Until today , that is .
MSNBC's Tamron
Hall reported that President Bush 's dog , Barney , bit a Reuters reporter following a gathering of White House employees .
The reporter , John Decker , was given medical treatment .
It was not known what part of his body received the bite .
" This is not a joke , " Hall said .
" He had to go to the hospital .
We are told that he is fine . "
Then the MSNBC reporter did joke .
" Apparently Barney does not want to leave the White House , and he is a little tense after Tuesday , " she mocked .
Hall added , " And I guess Senator Obama and his family should keep that in mind when they are shopping for the dog or the puppy they promised the kids .
Be nice to reporters . "
" Come on , that 's not a story , " a blogger named Gottalaff posted at The Political Carnival .
" Reporter bites dog ... now that 's a story ! "
Alexandra Blair , in a Times Online column , written before today 's bite incident , detailed other presidential dog stories .
" Theodore Roosevelt , who worked hard on his macho image , kept a pitbull , Pete , that nearly provoked a diplomatic incident when it attacked the French Ambassador , tearing the seat out of his trousers , " Blair wrote .
" Pete was banished to Roosevelt 's home on Long Island . "
Blair adds , " Gerald Ford , had a more practical use for Liberty , his golden retriever , whistling for her to come and break up boring meetings . "

In my article , " The Role of Identity Within Magic , " one of the readers expressed her own experiences with magicians as being people who talk about magical orders and oaths and call each other frater and rave about finding parking spaces .
She also noted that in terms of improving the quality of life in this world , it did not seem that magicians were doing much .
Another reader believed that the practice of magic was mainly done by people who were power hungry or trying to fill a void within their lives .
Yet another reader spoke scathingly of the words magic , magician , shaman , arguing that there was a guru complex associated with these terms and that magic is an archaic and out of date word that should n't be used to describe the connections one cultivates with others or him or herself .
None of these critiques are invalid .
In fact , they are indicative of two problems that the occult subculture faces , but which it rarely addresses , namely the cultural stigma associated with the term magic ( or magick if you must ) and the inability to cohesively explain and demonstrate the benefits of including a practice of magic in a person 's life .
Let 's explore each problem in further depth , before I point the way to a possible solution .
Stereotypes about magic
On any cultural level , other than the occult subculture , the term magic has a lot of cultural stigma associated with it .
This cultural stigma takes three forms , and none of the forms are entirely accurate , but nonetheless they are prevalent because of a simple fact that many magicians would prefer to ignore .
The term magic ( or magick ) has never been rehabilitated .
And why is that so important ?
Because a certain magician once wrote that he would set out to rehabilitate magic ( or as he coined it : Magick ) .
That magician 's name is Aleister Crowley and he is probably the only occult magician that has any real claim to fame , though most of his fame is really notoriety .
Crowley failed to rehabilitate magic in any substantial way .
The most he did was what previous magicians did , which was write about it and spread the relevant literature to interested parties .
To this day , there are people , myself included , who write about magic and yet it is still not rehabilitated .
It may never be rehabilitated , at least within contemporary culture , and if it is rehabilitated , it may involve using new terminology to convey the concepts that are structured into various paradigms of magical practice .
First Stigma : Magic is practiced by people who feel powerless
The first form of cultural stigma that surrounds magic comes from academia .
Until relatively recently ( the last two decades ) , the majority of academic works on magic and the occult have usually depicted magic as something performed by ignorant primitives who are n't " civilized " enough to know better or something done by eccentric " civilized " people who feel powerless and resort to using supernatural forces to gain control of their environment .
Recent scholarship has gotten better , partially because there are pagans and occultists in academia who are raising their own voices , and partially because those researchers who do n't identify as pagans or occultists are willing to acknowledge their biases and consider the possibility that magic could actually work and be utilized for a variety of reasons beyond an attempt to control one 's environment or situations .
One reason , as an example , is the choice to use magical techniques to achieve an altered state of consciousness that allows the magician to connect with the universe in a fundamentally different way than everyday consciousness allows ( more on this later ) .
What must be realized about the academic coverage of magic is that such coverage is usually situated in a Western - centric perception of the universe .
For instance , the argument that magic is only performed by ignorant savages is certainly rooted in Western Imperialism and the belief that the so - called primitives have an unsophisticated and irrational understanding of the world and so resort to magic as a way of controlling their environment .
Did these vaunted academics consider the possibility that magic might have other uses , that it might for instance provide a common bonding experience for the community , as well as a means of focusing the intent of the community ?
From the writings I 've perused , it seems the academics never considered this a possibility until very recently .
( For a much more comprehensive examination of this issue , please refer to the two chapters on definitions of magic that I wrote in Multi- Media Magic . )
The claim that magicians only practice magic to achieve a sense of power that is lacking from their lives is a claim that can easily be applied to any religious zealot as well :
If I pray hard enough and long enough , God will grant me what I desire .
This desire to claim power is based in a concept called magical thinking , which argues that by appealing to external powers the magician or religious person can somehow obtain control over his or her immediate reality , without having to lift a hand in the process .
While it is true that magicians may work with spiritual entities and deities , creating a mutual relationship of respect where all parties benefit , it 's also true that any sense of power the magician has ultimately comes from mastering his / her internal reality .
The magician achieves true power when s/he no longer reacts , and instead consciously evaluates a situation and makes a conscious choice based on that evaluation .
That is real magic ( and not something every magician , let alone every person has mastered ) .
Second Stigma : Magic is evil
The second stereotype of cultural stigma surround magic is the belief that magic is satanic or evil or that magicians are out to become gurus .
This stereotype also points to the idea that people get involved in magic because they feel powerless .
As someone who was once a born again Christian , and left Christianity because of the pervasive ignorance and intolerance that exists in the more extreme versions of it , I got involved in magic because I wanted to answer the questions about life and reality .
I had n't gotten answers from the Christian god , and when I found about magic , I realized that here was a system of methodologies that could be used by anyone to actively work toward answering the questions a person might have about reality and life .
Magic did n't promise all the answers on a golden platter .
Nor did it promise gobs and gobs of power .
If anything , my own journey as a magician has involved lots of hard work , the facing of many internal demons and issues ( and resolution of said demons and issues ) , and the humbling realizations of just how little control I may have over my immediate environment , as well as the very empowering realizations of how much control I have over my internal beliefs and how I choose to act in a situation .
The practice of magic taught me to discipline and apply myself to what I really wanted to achieve in life , as well as providing me a variety of techniques I could use to alter my consciousness , heal myself , change negative behaviors into positive ones , and in some cases increase the possibility of an opportunity working out .
Nonetheless , magic is n't a cure all .
It does n't solve every problem and can sometimes complicate issues .
And the real test of magic is not seeing how much power you can acquire .
The real test involves learning to be responsible with the power you do have , which is the power of your actions and responses .
And remember , magic is only one avenue of expression for those actions and responses .
As for magicians trying to become gurus … just about every magician I 've met has had anything but that particular interest in mind .
Do you know how much work it takes to become a guru ?
Not only that but you have to keep the Guru vibe going and make sure you never make a mistake .
No thanks .
Being a guru is a thankless task .
Whatever perks one might get for doing it , s/he is trapped by the very image s/he creates in order to obtain followers .
The true magician does n't need to be a guru and is much more satisfied developing his / her own spiritual journeys .
Third Stigma : Magic is useless
The third and final stigma is the argument that magic is useless .
This stigma is connected to the second problem that magicians face , namely :
What is the benefit of doing magic ?
As one reader put it , all she seemed to hear about was the various oaths and magical orders different magicians belonged to and how impressed they were about finding parking spaces .
If all a magician can is find a parking space , you have to wonder if magic is all that effective , because anyone can find a parking space .
Frankly , I do n't feel that finding a parking space is an indicative of a magical achievement and if that 's all a magician is boasting about , s/he really needs to get a life and needs to spend a lot more time practicing magic and a lot less time talking about it .
Likewise , talking about what magical order you belong to does n't say much about the benefit of magic .
I do n't think that magic is an archaic word or concept .
The fact that even in the most " sophisticated " cultures there are people still practicing magic speaks to its relevance .
But the question does arise as to what the benefit of practicing magic is .
And unfortunately a lot of the focus in magical practice is primarily on obtaining short term goals and material needs , as opposed to focusing on more long term goals .
When the magician is focused on getting his / her next parking space , or even the next job , then it 's rather hard to determine exactly how magic plays a role in obtaining these things or what the overall benefit of doing magic is , other than creating some kind of placebo effect .
While the magician can claim that magic has been employed to get that parking space or job , it can just as easily be said that the magician got these things through coincidence or having the right set of skills .
On the other hand , when the magician obtains a result which clearly involves the creation of a reality out of improbable circumstances , that situation can be pointed to as an example of magic working to the benefit of the magician .
Even so , usually such situations seem to focus on addressing the short term material needs of the magician , as opposed to doing anything more substantial or contributory to anyone besides the magician .
Little wonder that magic is considered useless , while magicians are sneered at .
The lust for results is the undoing of the magician .
While sometimes practicing magic to address a problem that has occurred recently is a very necessary activity , it should not be the only activity or reason for doing magic .
Nor , for that matter , should the activity only focus on the material gain of the magician .
Instead of summoning a Goetic demon to get a girl or a job , one might wonder what would happen if the magician chose to work with the Goetic demon to achieve a better awareness of his or her weaknesses , or to learn new skills that s/he can use to navigate life better .
The Benefit of Magic and a future direction
We can only provide a solution to the three stigmas I mentioned above when we answer :
What is the benefit of doing magic ?
The benefit of doing magic is n't merely the acquisition of material goods or advantageous opportunities ( though these can be useful in their own right ) .
The benefit of magic is that it provides the practitioner a methodology for interacting with reality , possibility , and his / her own conscious awareness of the space s/he travels through during these interactions .
When a person can utilize magical processes to recognize the ways s/he is sabotaging herself and can then make changes and become a healthier person as well as model those changes to others then the real benefit of magic is realized .
Magic is the harnessing of willful intention and conscious attention to change the self 's identity and role within the universe and recognize the potential to be part of something larger than just him / herself .
And what is larger than the magician ?
It is not society or culture which is reflections and illusions ; something a magician is a part of and affects the sense of self everyday , but nonetheless is just a matrix holding us to certain patterns and behaviors that entrap us far more than they free us .
What is larger is the universe itself … and when the magician can recognize how s/he is just a small part of the universe itself , a cell in the body of the universe , but one that nonetheless either transmits healthy information or unhealthy information , then the magician might realize that the benefit of magic is the evolution of the person and the role that person plays in the evolution of the universe .
Society and culture are illusions because they are transitory .
What they reveal is the overall health and integration that people have with each other and the universe .
This sense of health and integration is played out in how we treat each other and how we treat this planet .
Magic is just one methodology among many for helping us achieve a better awareness of our place in the universe as well as how we can change that place , for better or worse .
And it must be understood that our place in the universe is small …we are not so significant that if we were gone the universe would collapse .
But we are significant enough in the sense that our actions and choices play a role in not merely how we live our lives , but also how we pass on that living to our descendents and to the universe we live in .
Every action , every choice is an imprint .
They are tiny actions , tiny choices , seemingly insignificant in and of themselves , but the repetition of pattern provides strength in numbers and the consequences can be very hard to undo .
I realized some few years ago that magic was n't doing me much good if my life was headed on a collision course of bad decisions and worse consequences .
I realized that true magic was n't about reactively doing magic to solve a problem or get a quick fix .
True magic was proactively choosing to change , to recognize the root of my problems and change those problems , while also examining various areas of my life and choosing to do something about them instead of just stumbling along , waiting for whatever might happen next .
Magic was spending a year dedicated to working with the element of Earth and consequently learning a lot about how to handle finances effectively as well as how to show others that it could be done .
Magic was spending a year focused on love and seeing all the unhealthy patterns of love in my life and then making changes , becoming healthier in how I related to love , while also learning a lot about what this culture does n't really show with any kind of relationship :
The intimacy of connection with each other , and with our environment .
Magic has been doing the internal work , the meditation , the mindful awareness , and the changing of old patterns into new healthier ones , so I do n't need to do so many overt acts of magic to solve the latest crisis in my life .
And magic , for me , has always involved learning as much as possible about a wide variety of fields of study such as semiotics , linguistics , multimodality , psychology , neuroscience , etc , and then taking that information and applying it to my spiritual practices so that I could refine how I did magic , while also showing myself and others what it could be used for .
For magic to be relevant and significant and of any real benefit to us , it must be balanced with an awareness of other disciplines .
The magician needs to be a renaissance person , one who has knowledge on a variety of disciplines and the practices those disciplines contain .
S/he must also be able to connect all of those practices together and create an effective synthesis of principles for promoting effective changes , i.e. changes that have the potential to benefit all as opposed to or only a few .
Henry Agrippa wrote in The Three Books of Occult Philosophy that the magician who only practiced magic was a dull person who did not really understand magic .
To understand magic involved learning about other disciplines and applying those practices to his or her life and the lives of others .
Magicians in general need to return to this approach to magic , instead of focusing on hyper - individuation as a display of will .
The hyper - individualized person cannot connect with anyone else , because s/he fails to understand or acknowledge anyone else .
By learning about a variety of disciplines and also experiencing a variety of people and the struggles they deal with , the magician can begin to consider how magic can be applied to the benefit of all and focus on doing so .
Until such a time as that occurs magic will never be rehabilitated .
It will instead be the masturbatory wanking of trying to get results , or showing your true will off , or the boasting of finding a parking space .
There 's not much change in any of that and it does n't do much beyond providing people yet another way to re-act instead of consciously act .
For magic to be rehabilitated and beneficial , we must change our way of thinking about it and implementing it , moving away from a model of self gratification , and moving toward a model of conscious awareness and connection with each other and with this universe we live in .
When we can do that and share what we develop with others , so that all can benefit , then we will see real change , real magic , and realize its benefit in our lives .

WASHINGTON —
The emergency bailout of General Motors and Chrysler announced by President Bush on Friday gives the companies a few months to get their businesses in order , but hands off to President - electBarack Obama the difficult political task of ruling on their future .
The plan pumps $ 13.4 billion by mid-January into the companies from the fund that Congress authorized to rescue the financial industry .
But the two companies have until March 31 to produce a plan for long - term profitability , including concessions from unions , creditors , suppliers and dealers .
In February , another $ 4 billion will be available for G.M. if the rest of the $ 700 billion bailout package has been released .
Even before the March 31 deadline , it might fall to the Obama administration to persuade Congress to release the second $ 350 billion of the Treasury Department ’s huge financial system stabilization program — a request that the Bush administration is reluctant to make .
( Reuters ) - The U.S. credit - card industry may pull back well over $ 2 trillion of lines over the next 18 months due to risk aversion and regulatory changes , leading to sharp declines in consumer spending , prominent banking analyst Meredith Whitney said .

The credit card is the second key source of consumer liquidity , the first being jobs , the Oppenheimer & Co analyst noted .
“ In other words , we expect available consumer liquidity in the form of credit - card lines to decline by 45 percent . ”
Bank of America Corp BAC.N , Citigroup Inc C.N and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N represent over half of the estimated U.S. card outstandings as of September 30 , and each company has discussed reducing card exposure or slowing growth , Whitney said .
Closing millions of accounts , cutting credit lines and raising interest rates are just some of the moves credit card issuers are using to try to inoculate themselves from a tsunami of expected consumer defaults .
A consolidated U.S. lending market that is pulling back on credit is also posing a risk to the overall consumer liquidity , Whitney said .
Mortgages and credit cards are now dominated by five players who are all pulling back liquidity , making reductions in consumer liquidity seem unavoidable , she said .
“ We are now beginning to see evidence of broad - based declines in overall consumer liquidity . ”
“ Already , we have witnessed the entire mortgage market hit a wall , and we believe it will , for the first time ever , show actual shrinkage over the next few months , ” she wrote .
The credit card market will be 18 months behind the mortgage market and will begin to shrink by mid-2010 , Whitney said .
Whitney also expects home prices to continue falling another 20 percent hurt by lower liquidity .
They are down 23 percent from their peak , she said .
“ In a country that offers hundreds of cereal and soda pop choices , the banking industry has become one that offers very few choices , ” Whitney wrote in a note dated November 30 .
She also said credit lines to consumers through home equity and credit cards had been cut back from the second - quarter levels .
“ Pulling credit when job losses are increasing by over 50 percent year - over - year in most key states is a dangerous and unprecedented combination , in our view , ” the analyst said .
Most of the solutions to the situation involve government intervention , and all of them require more dilutive capital to existing lenders , she said .
“ Accordingly , we continue to be cautious on our outlook on US banks . ”
SUGGESTIONS
In a column in the Financial Times , Whitney suggested four adoptable changes to make a difference .
The first would be to re-regionalize lending , which has gone from “ knowing your customer ” or local lending , to relying on what have proven to be unreliable FICO credit scores and centralized underwriting , due to the nationwide consolidation since the early 1990s , she wrote in the column .
Expanding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ’s guarantee for bank debt will also help as the banks need to know they can access reasonably priced credit for an extended period to continue to extend new credit lines , she wrote in the column .
Whitney also advised delaying the introduction of new accounting rules , which would bring off - balance - sheet assets back on balance sheet , until 2011 or 2012 , as the primary assets that will come back are credit card loans .
Whitney suggested amending the proposal on Unfair and Deceptive Lending Practices that is set to be adopted in 2010 , saying restricting lenders ’ ability to reprice an unsecured loan will cause them to stop lending or to lend less .

The government is facing a growing backlash over its rescue package for the economy after the pound slumped to below parity with the euro on British high streets and at airports for the first time since the single European currency was launched a decade ago .
Sterling 's decline to a value of less than a euro , after commission charges , is seen by economists and opposition politicians as a pivotal ' psychological moment ' - and evidence of declining faith in the British economy on global currency markets .
Last night , as skiing operators and other holiday companies across the UK reported customers shunning expensive trips in favour of cut - price deals , Currency Exchange on London 's Oxford Street was selling euros for as little as € 1.0532 to the pound .
After commission and a handling fee , however , € 18 cost The Observer £ 19.61 , an exchange rate of € 0.918 to the pound .
Tourists at Birmingham , Liverpool and Luton airports were also getting less than € 1 to the pound after sterling tumbled in value every day last week .
Customers changing £ 200 at Birmingham and Liverpool were last night receiving just € 197.13 from Travelex counters , while those at the ICE bureau de change at Luton took away € 199.63 - an exchange rate of € 0.986 to the pound at Birmingham and Liverpool and € 0.998 at Luton .
Tories and Liberal Democrats laid the blame for the pound 's collapse firmly at the door of Gordon Brown .
Philip Hammond , shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury , said the Prime Minister 's decision in the pre-Budget report to let borrowing soar to fund £ 20bn of tax cuts had severely damaged - rather than boosted - economic confidence and people 's willingness to spend .
' Hundreds of thousands of Britons find themselves grounded as the pound falls below one euro in value , ' he said .
' This is the currency market 's verdict on Gordon Brown 's economic plans and his decision to go on a borrowing binge . '
Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman and deputy leader , said that while the immediate cause of sterling 's fall had been the rapid drop in interest rates from 4.5 per cent to 2 per cent since last month - and the expectation that they would drop further - the reason the cuts had been necessary was the result of the government 's failure .
' Behind it all is a sense that we are a weak economy with a much bigger housing bubble than other countries , and Brown failed to do anything to address that .'
Cable argued that sterling 's vulnerability strengthened the case in the medium to long term for the UK to be ' locked into a bigger currency block ' - meaning entry into the euro .
The case for euro entry was also put by leading economist and commentator Will Hutton .
' The pound buying less than a euro is an important psychological moment .
Britain first doubted the euro would be launched , then whether it would survive , then whether it would ever become a serious currency , ' said Hutton .
' Even today people are rushing to pronounce its death warrant .
Now it is plainly the world 's second currency after the dollar .
As the pound becomes more volatile and less valuable , the euro will be seen increasingly as a safe haven - a zone in which both British industry and the City of London would flourish .
The question is not if Britain will join , but when - and how many working lives and businesses will be wrecked by ideological opposition before it does . '
New opinion polls today suggest Brown is not sustaining his ' bounce ' of recent weeks .
A ComRes poll for the Independent on Sunday showed Labour on 36 per cent , still behind the Tories on 37 per cent - the same figures as in a survey for the daily Independent 10 days ago .
The poll also showed 52 per cent agreeing that the recent fall in the value of the pound was evidence that ' Gordon Brown 's economic plans probably wo n't work ' , against 39 per cent who disagreed .
A YouGov survey for the Sunday Times showed the standing of the parties virtually unchanged from a similar poll last month .
The Tories increased their lead from 5 per cent to 6 per cent , putting the Tories on 41 per cent ( unchanged ) , Labour on 35 per cent ( down 1 per cent ) and the Liberal Democrats on 15 per cent ( up 1 per cent ) .
Both Tories and Liberal Democrats are determined to maintain the pressure on Brown , following his slip of the tongue at Prime Minister 's Questions in the Commons last Wednesday in which he claimed to have ' saved the world ' from economic collapse .
The Conservatives dug up a quote from Brown 's time as shadow Chancellor when he said ' a weak currency is a sign of a weak economy , which is the sign of a weak government ' .
Labour ministers have fired back , claiming the Tories have no answers to the economic crisis and are a ' do - nothing party ' .
The Treasury last night refused to comment on sterling 's fall and said there was no prospect of entering the euro in the near future .
Official rates showed the pound was worth € 1.11 yesterday .
At its high point against the euro in May 2000 , a pound was worth € 1.746 .
The pound has fallen 17 per cent against the euro this year as the Bank of England has cut rates from a peak of 5.75 per cent to a more - than - 50 - year low of 2 per cent .
Interest rates in the eurozone remain higher at 2.5 per cent , despite a 0.75 per cent cut by the European Central Bank last week .
Queen Elizabeth has been given an academic briefing on the origins of the credit crunch and wound up the " lesson " by asking why nobody had seen the crisis coming .
The 82 - year - old monarch had the complexities of the current global financial crisis explained to her during the inauguration of a new building at the renowned London School of Economics ( LSE ) .
The origins and effects of the crisis were explained to her by Professor Luis Garicano , director of research at the LSE 's management department , the Press Association reported .

KANSAS CITY , Missouri ( Reuters ) -
Two weeks before an election that could install the first black U.S. president , scattered ugly incidents have reflected a deep residue of racism among some segments of white America .
A cardboard likeness of Barack Obama was found strung from fishing wire at a university , the Democratic presidential nominee ’s face was depicted on mock food stamps , the body of a black bear was left at another university with Obama posters attached to it .
Though the incidents are sporadic and apparently isolated , they stirred up memories of the violent racial past of a country where segregation and lynchings only ended within the last 50 years .
And some feared that Obama could be a target for people who reject him on racial grounds alone .
The Illinois senator leads Republican rival John McCain in polls ahead of the November 4 election and has a big following in many sections of Americans , from liberals to conservatives , black and white , poor and wealthy .
“ Many whites feel they are losing their country right before their eyes , ” said Mark Potok , who directs the Southern Poverty Law Center that monitors hate groups .
“ What we are seeing at this moment is the beginning of a real backlash . ”
Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod said the incidents were disappointing but he said there were fewer than some had predicted .
“ We ’ve always acknowledged that race is not something that ’s been eradicated from our politics , ” said Axelrod .
“ But we ’ve never felt that it would be an insuperable barrier and I do n’t think that it will be . ”
The latest incident occurred on Monday when the body of bear cub was found on the campus of Western Carolina University in North Carolina .
Obama campaign signs were placed around the dead animal ’s head .
School officials said it was a prank .
Earlier a cardboard likeness of Obama was strung up with fishing wire from a tree at a university in Oregon and an Ohio man hung a figure bearing an Obama sign from a tree in his yard .
The man told local media he did n’t want to see an African - American running the country .
ANGRY INDIVIDUALS
Potok said the displays of racism did not appear orchestrated as part of a campaign of racial intimidation , but were rather the acts of angry individuals .
Their voices are often heard in radio call - back shows or letters to editors .
Many Americans “ see the rise of minority rights , gay rights , women ’s rights as a threat to the world they grew up in and that their parents grew up in .
They see huge demographic changes , ” he said .
“ They see jobs disappearing to other countries , and now they see a man who is African American and who will very likely become president of the United States .
For some of those people that symbolizes the end of the world as they know it . ”
He estimated there were as many as 800 white supremacy or nationalist groups in the United States , with at least 100,000 as “ an inner core ” of membership and many more on the fringes .
One such group , the League of American Patriots , last month distributed literature about why a “ black ruler ” would destroy the country .
Michigan State University professor Ronald Hall , writing in his new book “ Racism in the 21st Century , ” said racism remains one of the most pressing U.S. social problems , though it now takes forms that are more subtle than the lynchings and mob violence seen decades ago in some parts of the country .
Some groups tagged with racist acts deny the charge .
In California , a Republican group said it intended no racial overtone when its October newsletter depicted a fake food stamp bearing a likeness of Obama ’s head on a donkey ’s body surrounded by fried chicken , watermelon and other images evoking insulting stereotypes about African - Americans .
Some acts have targeted not Obama ’s black heritage -- his father was Kenyan and his white mother was from Kansas -- but the false notion that he is a Muslim .
A derogatory billboard in West Plains , Mo. , went up last month showing a caricature of Obama wearing a turban .
“ There are a lot of Republicans and McCain supporters who find it hard to believe that a black guy whose middle name is Hussein is going to be the next president of the United States , ” said David Bositis , senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies .
David Wolff , a 52 - year - old white Pennsylvania voter who plans to cast his ballot for Obama , said he commonly hears racist comments and thinks such sentiments are deeply rooted across America .
“ One thing that could speed up the eradication of racism would be to have a charismatic , inspirational , transformational , generational black president , ” he said .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The international financial crisis has given world leaders a unique opportunity to create a truly global society , Britain ’s Prime Minister Gordon Brown will say in a keynote foreign policy speech on Monday .
In his annual speech at the Lord Mayor ’s Banquet , Brown -- who has spearheaded calls for the reform of international financial institutions -- will say Britain , the United States and Europe are key to forging a new world order .
“ The alliance between Britain and the U.S. -- and more broadly between Europe and the U.S. -- can and must provide leadership , not in order to make the rules ourselves , but to lead the global effort to build a stronger and more just international order , ” an excerpt from the speech says .
Brown and other leaders meet in Washington next weekend to discuss longer term solutions for dealing with economic issues following a series of coordinated moves on interest rates and to recapitalize banks in the wake of the financial crisis .
“ Uniquely in this global age , it is now in our power to come together so that 2008 is remembered not just for the failure of a financial crash that engulfed the world but for the resilience and optimism with which we faced the storm , endured it and prevailed , ” Brown will say in his speech on Monday evening .
“ ... And if we learn from our experience of turning unity of purpose into unity of action , we can together seize this moment of change in our world to create a truly global society . ”
According to a summary of the speech released by his office , Brown will set out five great challenges the world faces .
These are : terrorism and extremism and the need to reassert faith in democracy ; the global economy ; climate change ; conflict and mechanisms for rebuilding states after conflict ; and meeting goals on tackling poverty and disease .
Brown will also identify five stages for tackling the economy , starting with recapitalizing banks so they can resume lending to families and businesses , and better international co-ordination of fiscal and monetary policy .
He also wants immediate action to stop the spread of the financial crisis to middle - income countries , with a new facility for the International Monetary Fund , and agreement on a global trade deal , as well as reform of the global financial system .
“ My message is that we must be : internationalist not protectionist ; interventionist not neutral ; progressive not reactive ; and forward looking not frozen by events .
We can seize the moment and in doing so build a truly global society . ”
The not - for - profit child care sector is urging the Federal Government to buy ABC Learning , which has been put into voluntary administration and has revealed it is $ 1 billion in debt .
The head of SDN Children 's Services , Ginny Udi , has suggested the Government could then put the management of the centres out for tender .
She says it would be an opportunity for the Government to set quality standards on the industry .
" We believe it 's time for the Government to take back the reins , " she said .
" The not - for - profit sector is very concerned that something as important as children 's growth and development and early learning was allowed to be subject to the market . "
Earlier , Education Minister Julia Gillard announced the Government is to provide up to $ 22 million in funding to keep ABC Learning centres open until December 31 .
Ms Gillard said the funding was to bridge the gap between the cost of operating unprofitable centres and the amount that is raised through their operation .
" The $ 22 million represents the possible costs of supporting the continued operation of these centres for two months and will allow parents to have certainty that childcare will be provided as usual , " she said .
She also flagged reforms to controls over the private child care sector in the wake of the collapse .
" We believe this is an area which needs to be managed , " she said .
" The former government just took its hands off the wheel and shut its eyes as the market was allowed to rip .
" What happened with ABC - ultimately I think accountants will answer that question for us and our corporate regulators will have something to say on the matter . "

In a series of posts at Ballot Access News today , Richard Winger writes :
In 2004 , Ralph Nader was on the ballot in jurisdictions containing 50.8 % of the national presidential vote cast that year .
In those jurisdictions , he polled .67 % of the total presidential vote cast in those places .
In 2008 , Nader was on the ballot in jurisdictions containing 84.4 % of the national presidential vote cast that year .
In those jurisdictions , he received .66 % of the total presidential vote cast in those places .
His popular vote in 2008 of 738,622 is considerably better than his 2004 vote of 465,650 .
But , one can say that the improvement was entirely due to his more successful ballot access efforts in 2008 , compared to 2004 .
When one controls for that , his support was virtually unchanged .
Naderâ€™s best state in 2004 was Alaska .
In 2008 his best state was Maine .
In 2004 , Libertarian presidential nominee Michael Badnarik was on the ballot in states containing 98.2 % of the presidential vote .
In the states in which he was on the ballot , he received .330 % of the total vote cast for president .
In 2008 , Libertarian presidential nominee Bob Barr was on the ballot in states containing 94.8 % of the presidential vote .
In those states , he received .421 % of the total vote cast for president .
Ron Paul was on the November 2008 ballot for president in Louisiana and Montana .
Those two states only accounted for 1.9 % of the national presidential vote this year .
However , Paul received votes in those two states equal to .82 % ( of the total presidential vote in those two states ) .
Consequently , he received the highest percentage of the vote ( in the areas in which he was on the ballot ) of any presidential candidate last month , other than Barack Obama and John McCain .
Whether Ron Paul was a â€œcandidateâ€ for president in November 2008 depends on the definition of â€œcandidateâ€ .
He did not ask to be put on the ballot .
Alan Keyes was on the ballot last month for president in 3 states , which comprise 18.6 % of the national presidential vote .
In those 3 states , he received .19 % of the total vote cast in those 3 states .
George Phillies , who appeared on the New Hampshire ballot with the label â€ œLibertarianâ€ , polled .07 % of the vote cast in New Hampshire .
New Hampshire only cast .5 % of the national presidential vote .
Charles Jay , presidential candidate of the Boston Tea Party , polled .02 % of the vote cast in the three states in which he was on the ballot .
Those three states accounted for 10.2 % of the national presidential vote .
Thomas Stevens , presidential candidate of the Objectivist Party , polled .01 % of the vote cast in the two states in which he was on the ballot .
Those two states cast 8.2 % of the national presidential vote .
Other than in 2008 , the only other Libertarian who ever ran for president in the general election , even though he was not the Libertarian presidential nominee , was L. Neil Smith in 2000 .
He appeared on the Arizona ballot with the label â€ œLibertarianâ€ , and polled .38 % in that state .
In 2004 , Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb was on the ballot in states containing 54.3 % of the national presidential vote cast that year .
In the places where he was on the ballot , he received .177 % of the total vote cast in those places .
In 2008 , Green Party presidential nominee Cynthia McKinney was on the ballot in states containing 69.7 % of the national presidential vote cast that year .
In the places where she was on the ballot , she received .173 % of the total vote cast in those places .
Thus , the experience in these two presidential elections for the Green Party almost perfectly matches the Nader experience .
In both cases , the candidate did a far better job of getting on ballots in 2008 than in 2004 .
But , in the areas with ballot status , the percentage of the vote received was virtually the same in both years .
In 2004 , Constitution Party presidential nominee Michael Peroutka was on the ballot in states containing 66.4 % of the national presidential vote .
Where he was on the ballot , he polled .173 % of the total presidential vote in those places .
In 2008 , Constitution Party vice - presidential nominee Chuck Baldwin was on the ballot in states containing 59.0 % of the national presidential vote this year .
Where he was on the ballot , he polled .238 % of the total presidential vote in those places .
Thus , the Libertarian Party and the Constitution Party experienced a similar pattern in these two presidential election years .
Each party did a worse job of getting its presidential candidate on the ballot in 2008 than it had in 2004 .
But , in the places where each partyâ€™s presidential candidate was on the ballot , each party polled a markedly higher share of the vote in 2008 than it had in 2004 .
In 2004 , the Socialist Workers Party presidential candidate , Roger Calero , or his stand - in , James Warren , appeared on the ballot in jurisdictions containing 27.2 % of the presidential vote cast that year .
The party received .03 % of the vote in the places in which it appeared on the ballot .
In 2008 , the Socialist Workers Party had the same presidential candidate , as well as the same stand - in ( the party needs a stand - in when Calero runs , since he is not eligible to be president and therefore some states wonâ€™t print his name on the ballot ) .
The 2008 SWP ticket appeared in places that cast 24.7 % of the national presidential vote .
The 2008 ticket polled .02 % of the vote cast in the places where it was on the ballot .
The vote total , 7,561 , is the second lowest presidential total in the partyâ€™s history ; only 2000 was lower .
In 2004 , the Socialist Party presidential nominee , Walt Brown , appeared on the ballot in states containing 20.5 % of the presidential vote that year .
He polled .04 % in the states in which he was on the ballot .
In 2008 , the Socialist Party presidential nominee , Brian Moore , appeared on the ballot in states containing 21.2 % of the presidential vote .
He polled .02 % in the states in which he was on the ballot .
The Party for Socialism and Liberation ran a presidential candidate for the first time in 2008 , Gloria La Riva .
She appeared on the ballot in states containing 26.4 % of the presidential vote .
In those states , she polled .02 % of the total presidential vote .

Given their history there , the British would certainly know what it looks like to lose in Afghanistan , and in a diplomatic cable leaked to a French newspaper the British ambassador there says that ’s precisely what ’s happening :
The coded cable reproduced Wednesday in Le Canard EnchaÃ®n
Ã© seems to be from France ’s deputy ambassador to Afghanistan , FranÃ§ois Fitou , describing a conversation he had with the British ambassador to Kabul , Sherard Cowper - Coles .
It says Cowper - Coles believes the West ’s war against Taliban forces in Afghanistan is being lost and the coalition that includes Canada ’s Armed Forces should leave an “ acceptable dictator ” in charge of the country within five to 10 years .
“ We have no alternative to supporting the United States in Afghanistan , but we should tell them that we want to be part of a winning strategy , not a losing one , ” the cable paraphrases the ambassador as saying .
[ Below is the original script .
But a few changes may have been made during the recording of this audio podcast . ]
You ’d think that college students would be experts at sleeping .
But odd hours , parties , cramming for tests , personal problems , self - medication with drugs or alcohol and general stress can wreck a student ’s sleep habits .
Which can be bad for the body and the mind .
Texas Tech University is even offering a class called " Improving Your Sleep Habits " .
People suffering from sleep - deprivation are at an increased risk for obesity , diabetes , psychological problems and car crashes .
Students who do n’t get enough sleep have poorer attendance and lower grades .
On top of all that , a new study published in the journal Learning & Memory finds that you ’re probably better off sleeping than cramming for a test .
Two hundred college kids were taught to play a couple of video games that they were unfamiliar with .
Subjects who learned the games in the morning lost some skills when they played again 12 hours later .
But they did much better the next morning after getting a good night ’s sleep .
So remember : if you really want to get those A’s , do n’t forget to get some zzzz’s .

Generic drug companies complain it is difficult to get drugs on the market Drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines into the EU , pushing up medicine bills , the European Commission has said .
Their actions cost EU healthcare providers 3 bn euros ( $ 3.9bn ; £ 2.5 bn ) in savings between 2000 and 2007 , it said .
It added that drug firms used legal action and multiple patents to stop rivals getting to market .
Drug firms said the " perfectly lawful " measures were justified to protect investment in research and development .
Market access Generic drug companies - which sell cheaper versions of drugs once the patent has expired - have long complained that it is difficult to get their drugs to market in Europe .
Big Pharma invests heavily in the development of new drugs
The Commission said that innovators filed multiple applications to stop generic drugs getting to market - in one case , there were 1,300 patents for a single drug .
The report found that owners of original drugs often intervened in national approval procedures for generic medicines .
There were nearly 700 cases of reported patent litigation and more than 200 settlements between brand name drug companies and generic companies .
More than 10 % of these settlements limited the entry of the generic drug to the market .
Fine threat " Market entry of generic companies and the development of new and more affordable medicines is sometimes blocked or delayed , at significant cost to healthcare systems , consumers and taxpayers , " said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes .
" It is still early days but the Commission will not hesitate to open antitrust cases against companies where there are indications that the antitrust rules may have been breached , " she added .
The Commission could impose large fines on drug companies if they have engaged in unfair practices .
In 2005 , AstraZeneca was fined 60 m euros for blocking cheaper rivals to Losec , its heartburn and ulcer pill .
Pressure mounts
Drug firms use " perfectly lawful practices - such as patent portfolios , patent litigation and the release of improved medicines , " the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations ( EFPIA ) said .
" These [ practices ] are essential for innovators to protect their huge investment in R&D [ research and development ] , " it said , adding that the 17 % of turnover industry spent on R&D exceeds any other sector in Europe .
The EFPIA - which said the Commission 's report missed the opportunity to tackle the real issues facing the industry - called for a more competitive market for generic drugs , pointing out that Europeans pay more for generic drugs than US citizens .
In response to claims that the delayed or blocked sale of generic drugs was pushing up healthcare costs , the EFPIA said : " A single member state , the Netherlands , achieved greater savings - up to 400 m euros - in one year , on only 33 medicines , simply by promoting greater price competition between generics . "
The Commission report increases the pressure on the global pharmaceuticals industry .
Barack Obama , the US President - elect , is also expected to try to cut costs as part of the reform of healthcare coverage in the US .

300 Dead ? 300 Dead what ???!
Last night as I watched the various international news outlets , I was dismayed to see them relating to the rising death toll in Gaza as if Israel had indiscriminately mowed down a huge swath of unsuspecting innocents .
As the death toll went from 225 to nearly 275 , Zahava and I watched with our mouths agape as a BBC interviewer ( or maybe it was Sky News ... I forget ) asked an Israeli Government spokesperson " How do you respond to this enormous number of casualties ... many of whom might be women and children ? "
Did you get that ?
" Enormous " ... " Might be " .
They might be women and children .
They might also be , oh I do n't know , terrorists ... or angels or flying pigs !
You do n't have a friggin clue , do you ?
But that does n't stop you from speculating , does it ???!!!
GAH !!!
Even Hamas itself , did n't say that " many " of the dead were women and children .
In fact , Hamas had been reporting that most of the dead were , in fact , Hamas officials and security forces !
But let 's leave the bias aside for a moment and talk about the ' enormous ' numbers that really count :
Two waves of 60 aircraft each flew bombing sorties from approximately noon on Saturday through to the early hours of Sunday ... and then resumed bombing runs throughout Sunday .
Considering that Hamas and Islamic Jihad have deliberately placed their entire command and control structure , as well as their munitions factories and training facilities , in the midst of densely populated civilian areas , it is nothing short of miraculous that after a day and a half of nearly non -stop bombing the result is only 300 deaths !
Think for a moment about how many people live in a typical apartment building .
Now double that since our Gaza neighbors are n't particularly careful about zoning and fire regulations ... and it is n't hard to imagine that even one poorly aimed bomb could result in a higher death toll than 300 !
Unlike Hamas , which has been perpetrating ongoing war crimes against Israel by deliberately targeting civilian population centers with kassams , ketyushas and mortars ( even as recently as ten minutes ago ! ) , Israel has made an Herculean effort to make sure that only military targets are hit .
Heck , we 're even taking their wounded over the border and treating them in Israeli hospitals !
Try that in the other direction and see if anyone comes back alive !
And another talking point that the international press never seems to miss is that the Kassams and Ketyushas are ' primitive weapons that rarely injure or kill anyone ' .
WTF ?!
That 's like having a mean drunk for a neighbor who comes home from the pub every night and takes a few wild shots at your house with his old service revolver before passing out amongst the shrubs .
What 's the big deal ?
He almost never hits anyone , right ?
Why all the fuss ??!
It 's enough to make me want to grab them by their Balliol College ties and throttle them until their arrogant public school accents begin to sound suspiciously like East End cockney !
Will there be ' collateral damage ' in the form of civilians injured and killed ( including women and children ) as a result of Israel 's current military campaign ?
Without a doubt .
But what I can't help but ask these affected idiots on my TV screen is ' where was your concern for civilian casualties when it was Jewish civilians being targeted ?!'
[ Update : On a similar note here on the home - front , Labor MK , Science , Culture , and Sport Minister Raleb Majadele ( who is an Israeli Arab ) boycotted Sunday 's Cabinet meeting over Israel 's military attacks on Gaza .
Several MKs have asked aloud why he never bothered to use his cabinet post to raise so much as a public objection during all the time that Gazans have been bombarding Israel .
I think the term we 're looking for here is ' Fifth Column ' . ]

I 've often wondered why the folks running Israel always seem to take these TV twits so seriously .
They will never approve of any action Israel will ever take to defend herself .
That makes them , in my book , irrelevant .
When I was a young child having a tantrum , my mom would tell me to knock it off , or she'd " give me something to cry about . "
I think it 's about time we used that approach on the Christiane Amanpours of the world .
Posted by : psachya | Dec 28 , 2008 4:09:16 PM
I had the same reaction when I saw our Sunday Boston Globe headline " Israeli Airstrikes Kill Hundreds in Gaza " .
Hundreds of what ?
To their credit ( as much as I hate to give it ) , the Globe also ran a photo of rocket damage in Netivot .
Aussie Dave reports the appointment of Dan Gillerman to head a PR campaign about the operation .
Good ; I hope we 'll see the effect over here soon .
It never ceases to amaze me that , despite the fact that Jews control everything ( right ? ) , the worldwide media bias is so strong that Israel cannot manage to get decent PR .
And btw , can you explain the name of this latest operation , " cast lead " ?
Posted by : Debbie | Dec 28 , 2008 4:14:41 PM
Ilana - Davita ... Merci . :-)
psachya ...
Because we do n't have the luxury of independent action .
All of our large weapons , ordnance and planes come from abroad , as does all of our fuel and spare parts .
So long as international policy is shaped , even in part , by the media , Israel ( and Israelis ) must take it very seriously .
Debbie ...
The explanation I 've seen published in several places is : " Launched during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah , the operation was codenamed after a Hanukkah poem by Haim Nachman Bialik referring to a “ dreidel cast from solid lead ” . "

I hope Israel takes it all the way .
Has Hamas ever been concerned about collateral damage ?
No .
If you do n't play by their rules , you can't win ... if there is such a thing as winning .
There is no honor in lobbing rockets into civilian populated areas ... if there is any honor left .
If Israel fired rockets using the same tactics as Hamas , the toll would be 100 times greater .
Hiding amongst women and children is cowardly and despicable .
This situation has not changed ... it is a mess .
I believe Israel must take whatever action is necessary regardless of the media .
Just my two cents .

It 's our concept too .
The " kill everyone " policy is only if you 're dealing with Amalek or the Seven Nations , and identification of our current enemies with either Amalek or the seven nations has issues .
For anyone else , Rambam Hilchot Melachim 6.4 says :
ואם לא השלימו או שהשלימו ולא קבלו שבע מצו ת
עושין עמהן מלחמה והורגין כל הזכרים הגדולי ם

I especially love comments from the media like " wildly inaccurate rockets " as if that makes it better .
Let someone shoot those inaccurate rockets at their homes for a while and see what happens .

I just hope it is as well - planned as is being reported and that we do n't stop until the goal has been reached .

Why does n't Israel put the Fifth Column folks on trial for treason , for that is all it is when these supporters of Hamas et al go palaver with the Enemy and / or do treasonous actions like NOT support the State during a time of crisis .
Maybe those who want to move the Arabs out of Israel were correct ; they never will be friendly to Israel , and maybe it 's time to admit the sad and terrible truth .
And yes , some might be either loyal or at least not willing to fight against Israel , and want to stay , but too damn bad .
I have seen no evidence that Israel 's Arabs want to help Israel , so maybe they should get that one - way ticket out and do n't let the door hit 'em in the ass on the way out .
Certainly , this treasonous MK Majadele should be permanently exited from Israel .
What other country in the entire world would countenance treason in its midst ?
Posted by : Maurice S | Dec 28 , 2008 11:00:32 PM
Interesting concept ; treason that is .
I wonder how many Israeli leaders we would lose if we were to apply the test to each and every one .
Hmmm ...
Olmert , Barak , Livni ...
Not such a loss IMHO .
Maybe we could start a new government , like the one the Torah commands us to have set up !
What a concept !
Thanks to David for ' reporting ' on the news so I could just send my family to this blog instead of having to send a lengthy e-mail assuring them I 'm safe and sound in the West Bank !
Posted by : Tehillah | Dec 28 , 2008 11:42:56 PM
As you have noted , the PR problem for some people seems to be that not enough Jews are being killed by Palestinians .
Too Bad ...
One thing going for Hamas -- and the Arab world in general , they really know how to sucker punch the western media .
Too bad for the Palestinian people that these so - called " liberals " are frequently victims of their own authority issues , blindly root for the suffering underdogs , and do not demand better leadership from the Palestinian Authority in bringing a peaceful solution to this conflict .

" Kassams and Ketyushas are ' primitive weapons that rarely injure or kill anyone ' . "
Yeah , let 's wait ' till they get some nukes from Mr. AhMADinejad ...
What would these same journalists say if these ' primitive weapons ' were aimed at their houses , their kids ' schools , their offices ?
Would they be so supportive of Hamas and the like ?
Go for it Israel !
G-d bless you , J'lem !
I pray for your victory !!

The so - called " left - wing " idiots always blame Israel , always fabricate the truth to make their f**king propoganda -- the main idea is anti-US .
Some of them are apparently hypocritite , they blame everything in the free world to show off their anti-US courage , and tolerant any shits like jihad , especially anti-Israel &US 's shits .
I am tired of these f**king idiots , if you guys still do not take it seriously and let their f**king propoganda shits more and more " innocent " young man , your freedom and democracy will be destroyed by those jihad shits finally .
I am from China .
I admire Israel 's courage and spirit .
I support any military operation aimed to destroy shits like HAMAS .
If they do not follow the rule of war , you guys do not have to follow those rules -- this is the only way to make those shits back to table , trust me .
Posted by : Kirby | Dec 29 , 2008 5:48:18 AM
there had not been a single Israeli death from rocket fire since June of this year ( the last truce that was declared ) .
Now , after one death , you have this response which , we know from Haaretz reporting , was planned as the negotiations for that truce were going on .
not to mention that gaza has been in a virtual siege for 18 months now since hamas came to power after our encouraging parliamentary ELECTIONS .
the worst kind of nationalist is the one that can't criticize themselves .
not every action that israel takes needs to be supported so fervently .

are you serious ?
... I have a deal for you .
What if I decided to sit in my car across the street from your house and get good and drunk every day .
When your kids get off the school bus I get to shoot in their general direction .
My state of inebriation and lack of aiming will almost guarantee that I 'll miss your kids every time .
I may mess up the paint job on your house , but who cares ... you have to repaint at some point anyway , right .
What 's that ?
You do n't want to take that chance with your kids ?
So why is it you are OK with Israeli kids living under fire every day ?
What you REALLY need is to be dragged from your comfortable Brooklyn apartment and flown to Sderot where you will be chained to a sign post in the center of town for just one day .
When the sirens start going off ( as they do every 20 - 30 minutes ) you can take comfort in the fact that " there had not been a single Israeli death from rocket fire since June " .
The odds are with you , right ?
RIGHT ?!
Idiot .

It is interesting to see how easy it is to manipulate the news .
Take the ARD Tagesschau website , Germany 's public TV news network , which most Germans trust to be " objective " :
Today 's headline is : Israel bombs islamic university .
The sub - line then reads :
At least 300 dead ...
It does n't take a rocket scientist to see that the average reader is supposed to connect the two headlines : Israel bombs a university = school and kills at least 300 students .
Oh yeah , much farther down the article they will actually say that nobody was inside the university when it was bombed and that the number of 300 casualties is an estimated total .
This is pretty smart , because now nobody can accuse them of writing something that is not true , but they know very well that most people nowadays just skim the headlines and do n't bother to read the small print .
And voila , you have those crazy Israeli monsters displayed in a mainstream European newscast .

All of y'all have really bought in to this idea of the legitimacy of state violence , huh .
Any individual murdered by the state is unacceptable .
The authority on both sides are despicable and all of these poor people in Israel - Palestine are locked into the unfortunate result of imperialism .
I think that we should be examining why we find top - down , state violence acceptable , but bottom - up , anti-state violence , impoverished violence as evil and sickening .

Mitch ,
1 . You 're making the assumption that this is a Milhelmeth Reshuth .
There are many who rule that since the Yishma 'elim lay claim to the Land , they have the din of the 7 Amim .
Certainly , you can beg to differ .
2. The Ramba " m tells us that in a MR , we are not to go out and actively kill the women and children { The Ramba " m cites Deut .
20:14 , 2:34} .
" Colateral damage " happens .
Go back and look at my original post ... no stirah here .
3 . On another topic , interesting that no one cares to mention the necessity of requiring taxes and labor from those we 're fighting in a so called MR , let alone the plundering of their possessions { The IDF allows the taking of food ... Bully for them .} Nope .
That would be politically incorrect .
And we Jews are " civilized " { Translation : " Western " } - {eyes rolling}
4 . We 're only fighting now due to an election ploy and / or because rich , white Jews may start getting killed .
That loses votes , does n't it ?
5 . How do I subscribe to comments ?
Please , no California airhead jokes .
6 . Thank you for reminding me about the preview feature .

What is wrong with you guys ?
These people are trying to defend themselves with whatever weapons they have .
Un " smart " rockets may be indiscriminate , but what the hell is Israel doing destroying Universities and hospitals and fish markets and fishing boats with their " pin-point " accurate smart - bombs ???
This is deliberate destruction of infrastructure - not terrorist hideouts .
And you people are actually cheerleading this crap .
Shame on you .
Posted by : Unbelievable | Dec 29 , 2008 5:04:36 PM
Unbelievable ...
Even if you were n't banned for your use of insulting profanity in your fake email address ( which you are , BTW ) , I would n't take you that seriously .
You are clearly light on facts and heavy on Jew hatred .
No hospitals have been hit .
In fact Israel has been taking wounded from Gaza into Israeli hospitals as a humanitarian gesture !
The area of the university that was destroyed was a chemical lab that was being used to make explosives .
Nobody was there at the time .
I have seen no indication that any fishing boats or markets have been deliberately targeted ... but if Hamas puts their military infrastructure in civilian areas ( a war crime , BTW ) you put your civilians in danger .
all in all , I think 300 dead ( with less than 50 confirmed by human rights organizations as non-combatants ) is pretty damned good .
Show me one modern nation that has done as well in a shooting war .
Certainly the US killed far more in their ' shock and awe ' at the outset of the Iraqi war .
I have no problem with you carrying water for the Jihadists .
After all , you are entitled to your loyalties .
Just do n't [ email protected ] with the facts ( i.e.lie ) to support your case .
Buh bye !
Posted by : David Bogner | Dec 29 , 2008 5:33:29 PM
Does the MSM not understand that in order for Hamas to be effective , their rockets do n't actually have to kill anyone ?
The goal of terrorism is not necessarily to kill ( that is a benefit if it can be achieved ) but to merely scare or terrorize a population .
Even if there was not a single kill from a rocket every , the fact that they are launched at Israel and cause psychological and mental trauma is their main aim , to which they are extremely effective .
Posted by : Jason | Dec 30 , 2008 6:18:04 PM
Mitch , Today Rav Yigal Kaminetzky {previous Chief Rabbi of Azza / Newe Deqalim} was supporting the opinion that we are indeed fighting a Milhelemeth Misswah , ... allowing soldiers to eat pork and treifoth even , if need be , to drag away a hathan from the huppah , and to engage children if necessary , and all else that goes with it .
Unfortunately , I did not hear the first part which I gather included his reasoning as to why .
You and others may or may not agree with this one rabbi's opinion .
But it is certainly a valid one which he expressed .

Aaarrgghhhh .
I was listening to Jeremy Bowen the other night .
( I dunno .
A masochistic moment , I guess .
Dear Jeremy -- may I call you " Mister Bowen " ? )
He was helping us to visualize the Israeli soldiers at the Erez Checkpoint as jackbooted Nazis in some horrible antiseptically steel - barred prison .
" I can tell which side of the barrier I 'm on , " he said , in public school - affected English , dripping with sarcasm , " by the garbage .
The soda cans have Arabic writing instead of Hebrew , because the Israelis wo n't allow food and drink past the checkpoint . "
Geez , I wanna apply my kubata to that boy 's nethers .
( Shorin Ryu talk .
Do n't be alarmed . )
Could it perhaps be that the Arabs prefer the taste of Cola bottled in Egyptian plants ???
Who knows ?
Jeremy does n't ever bother to ask .
Oh , yeah ... and he seems to be always busy when reports on the horrors of living in Sderot are being covered ... where no Arabic writing can be found on the soda cans .
Hmmmmmmmm ....

Air hostess helped land passenger jet after co-pilot had ' breakdown ' over the Atlantic
An air hostess helped land a jet carrying 146 passengers after the co-pilot had an apparent mental breakdown over the Atlantic Ocean , investigators revealed today .
The UK - bound plane made an emergency diversion to Shannon Airport , in Ireland , last January after the Air Canada flight officer began a ‘ rambling and disjointed ’ conversation , said an official report .
Another attendant suffered wrist injuries as the crew forcibly removed the co-pilot from the cockpit controls and restrained him in a seat in the cabin .
Mid-air drama :
The air hostess helped out after the plane 's captain asked if anyone could fly
The captain of the Boeing 767 from Toronto to Heathrow asked staff to seek out any trained pilots onboard .
One of the female cabin crew came forward saying she had a commercial pilot ’s licence and was asked to take over in the co-pilot ’s seat .
The captain praised the attendant to investigators for helping him safely land the plane at Shannon , where the ill flight officer was removed and admitted to the acute psychiatric unit of Ennis Regional Hospital for 11 days .
He was later flown home to Canada by an air ambulance for further care , according to the investigation .
The official report into the incident by the Irish Air Accident Investigation Unit ( AAIU ) did not explicitly refer to the co-pilot ’s medical condition .
But it recorded the views of two doctors onboard that he was in a ‘ confused and disorientated state ’ .
The captain also reported that his colleague became uncharacteristically ‘ belligerent and unco-operative ’ and was ‘ effectively incapacitated ’ .
One passenger at the time reported seeing the distraught co-pilot yelling for God as he was being restrained .
The AAIU praised the actions of both the captain and crew in diverting to the nearest airport and removing the co-pilot from the controls .
‘ For his own well - being and the safety of the aircraft , the most appropriate course of action was to stand him down from duty and seek medical attention which was available on board , ’ said the report .
‘ The commander ( captain ) realising he was faced with a difficult and serious situation used tact and understanding and kept control of the situation at all times .
‘ The situation was dealt with in a professional manner ...
As such , the commander and flight attendants should be commended for their professionalism in the handling of this event . ’
There were no safety recommendations from the investigation .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Round three of the presidential debates went to Barack Obama , according to a one - night USA Today / Gallup poll of debate watchers conducted Oct. 16 , completing a sweep of the three debates for Obama .
Debate watchers were more likely to say McCain did a better job than Obama in the third debate than in the second debate ( 30 % to 23 % ) , but McCain 's best showing in the eyes of the viewing public was the first debate , when 34 % said he did the better job .
Still , Obama won each debate by a convincing margin .
Obama 's debate wins generally keep tradition with what Gallup has found historically .
Gallup polls seeking reaction to past presidential debates as early as 1960 -- conducted either immediately after each debate concluded or in the succeeding days -- have most often shown that the Democratic candidate has been viewed as the winner over the Republican candidate .
Gallup has found that , despite all the attention paid to the debates , they generally do little to transform the presidential race .
For example , John Kerry was viewed as the winner of all three presidential debates in 2004 but still lost the election to George W. Bush .
Opinions of Candidates
In each of the three debate - reaction polls USA Today and Gallup conducted this year , roughly half of the viewers said their opinions of each candidate were not affected by the debate .
But the debates apparently did more to enhance Obama 's image than McCain's .
After each of the three debates , more debate watchers said their opinion of Obama was more favorable than said it was less favorable .
In contrast , those whose opinion of McCain was influenced by the debates tended to come away with a less positive view of the Republican nominee .
The Debate Audience
Roughly two - thirds of Americans reported tuning in to each of the three presidential debates , including 63 % for the Sept. 26 debate largely focused on foreign policy , 66 % for the Oct. 7 town - hall - style debate , and 65 % for the most recent debate , which concentrated on domestic policy .
Seventy - three percent of self - identified Democrats , 68 % of Republicans , and 55 % of independents reported watching Wednesday night 's debate .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,015 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Oct. 16 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 729 national adults who watched the Oct. 15 debate , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Polls conducted entirely in one day , such as this one , are subject to additional error or bias not found in polls conducted over several days .

Tombs Prison ( and the “ Bridge of Sighs " )
The Tombs prison was built in 1838 and resembled Egyptian architecture .
The " Bridge of Sighs " was the bridge that connected it with the Criminal Courts Building .
( The name is taken from a similar bridge in Florence , Italy . )
The original Tombs Prison was built at Centre Street in 1838 .
It was constructed with 148 double cells which , in accordance with the practice of that period , gave it a capacity for 296 prisoners .
This existed until 1897 .
The second Tombs Prison was opened in 1902 and was the largest and busiest detention institution ; it consisted of a main building and two annexes .
This prison was connected by a " Bridge of Sighs " with the Criminal Courts Building on the Franklin Street side .
This prison had a normal capacity of 591 cells ; it was a massive stone structure with steel cells .
The building was abandoned in 1941 when a new prison , known as the City Prison Manhattan , was occupied on Sunday , November 8 , 1941 .
Standing on Centre Street at Leonard Street , the prison was built in 1840 with granite from the old Bridewell Prison in City Hall Park .
Map of the Five Points in the 1800s * The Five Points intersection .

It was torn down in 1852 , and replaced by the Five Points Mission in 1853 .
The triangle across the street is Paradise Square .
2 St. Philips African Episcopal Church , destroyed in the riots of 1834.3 African Society for Mutual Relief .4 65 Mott St , location of the first NYC tenement in 1827.5 Chatham Square .
Used as a huge open air market up until 1820.6
The Tombs prison , erected 1838.7 Five Points House of Industry , built 1856.8 The Bowery Theatre.9 Cow Bay.10 Mulberry Bend .
It was considered one of the worst slums in NYC .
The entire block was demolished in 1896 and turned into a park .
11 Bottle Alley , and ( 12 ) Bandit 's Roost were two of the many alleyways inside the Mulberry Bend .

The Tea Water Pump was a natural spring fed well that supplied much of Manhattan with water up until the end of the 18th century .
NYC would be without a reliable water supply until 1842 with the opening of the Croton Aqueduct .

Kevin Jarnot sez : " Little Tikes Commercial has created a playground structure called the " Infinity Climber " , which is a climbable Moebius double twist strip for kids .
It also recently won a 2004 Industrial Design Excellence Award ( IDEA ) " Link
Cassidy Curtis sez : " I hate to break it to your readers , but that piece of playground equipment is not really a Moebius strip .
It has two twists , not one , which means it's an orientable surface ( having two unique sides ) , topologically equivalent to an ordinary circular strip .
A kid on one side of the strip could crawl around forever and not meet any kids on the other side .
Real Moebius strips have an odd number of twists , and thus have only one side . "
Kevin McCarty sez :
That 's not quite right either .
A two - twist strip is not topologically
equivalent to a no - twist strip , nor to a one - twist strip ( the Moebius
strip ) .
They 're all topologically inequivalent .
The two circular
edges of the 2 - twist strip are linked , while with the 0 - twist strip
they 're not .
For all integers n , the n- twist strips are inequivalent
to each other .
The ones with even number of twists are orientable
with two circular edges with varying linking number , and the
odd - numbered twists are non-orientable with a single circular edge
that links ( knots ) itself a varying number of times .
Welcome to the
wonderful world of homotopy equivalence classes .
Tim sez :
I should add that Kevin McCarty 's comment is only true for
strips nested in euclidean space .
Without such an embedding , there 's
no way to distinguish strips differing in an even number of twists .
See : on homotopy , where the space Y is in fact euclidean 3 - space .
Without
such a reference space we can only say whether our strips are
homeomorphic or not , which they indeed are whenever they differ
in an even number of twists .
I believe that any confusion here originates from the use of
homotopy in knot theory where an ignorance of the space in which
the knot is embedded would result in every knot being equivalent to
the trivial knot .
7 Tree Data Structure Plugins for Rails
A surprising number of applications seem to involve storing a tree of similar items out to some arbitrary depth : managers and employees , assemblies and parts , categories for organizing things .
Rails does n't have any native ability to handle a tree structure - but , as with many other things , plugins fill the gap .
And even though this requirement has been around for ages , there 's still active development in the plugin world as people try to invent a better tree .
The oldest alternative I know of in this are is acts_as_tree , which was actually pulled out of the Rails core code .
This plugin established the standards for the genre : it extends ActiveRecord and supplies an API including parent , siblings , ancestors , root , and so on .
Succeeding choices have extended this API but remain generally backwards - compatible .
After acts_as_tree came acts_as_nested_set , which provides tree functionality through a different data structure .
This plugin optimizes some queries - such as selecting a subtree of descendants - compared to acts_as_tree , and has become a popular alternative .
It 's also spawned a number of descendants including better_nested_set and awesome_nested_set ( which seems to be the most active of the nested set projects ) .
It 's worth noting that awesome_nested_set includes STI support .
But that 's not the end of the story .
Another project , acts_as_materialized_tree , has just put out a release .
A materialized tree tags every node with its path .
This makes subtree searches more efficient than they are in acts_as_tree , and insertion and removal of children faster than in the nested set plugins .
Of course , there are tradeoffs ; moving subtrees and counting descendants are not quick with materialized trees .
There are still more choices beyond these three for specialized situations .
Two that are worth knowing about are acts_as_category , which combines trees and lists together ( and is probably the most heavyweight of the choices here ) and acts_as_ordered_tree , which adds a persistent ( and arbitrary ) sorting to nodes .
It 's impossible to recommend a single tree plugin as the best for all circumstances ; it depends on the mix of operations in your application .
fortunately , the broad API similarity here makes it relatively easy to test the choices and see which one works best for you .

Steve Emerson is Executive Director of the Investigative Project on Terrorism and author of 5 books and countless articles on terrorism .
His most recent book is Jihad Incorporated : A Guide to Militant Islam in the U.S .
The Mumbai massacre was a heavily planned plot carried out by Islamic terrorists .
Period .
Memo to Obama :
Until the onus of responsibility is put on Islamic " civil rights " groups that want to ban free speech and claim that anyone who uses the term Islamic terrorist is a racist , there is no hope of winning the battle .
It all comes together .
After more than 7 years since 9/11 , we can now issue a verdict : Islamic terrorists have won our hearts and minds .
Let 's thank those who made it happen : the U.S. government , European governments and the mainstream media .
It 's time to stop placating or being intimidated by Islamic front groups who masquerade as civil rights groups .
In 2007 , the perversity of was demonstrated when the FBI released its annual 2007 hate crime reports .
Of the total 1,628 victims of anti-religious hate crimes , 69.2 % were Jewish and 8.7 % were Muslim .
Yet by my still unfinished account , there were at least 40 times more stories last year about Islamophobia than about anti-Semitism .
Even after the conviction of the defendants of all 108 counts in the Holy Land Foundation ( Hamas ) trial this past week , The New York Times poignantly focused its reporting not on the convictions for abetting terrorism and contributing to countless deaths of civilians , but on the tear jerking sobs of the wives and daughters of the convicted defendants who ( surprise ) claim their fathers were innocent .
Now can you imagine the New York Times focusing its coverage sympathetically on the families of the convicted members of the KKK or neo -Nazis ?
Now further imagine reporters from the top newspapers getting their exclusive information for stories from un-indicted co-conspirators in the Hamas case .
Indeed , enough is enough .
It is time to start listening to folks like Mr Syed or the courageous Zuhdi Jasser , rather than cave in to the PC crowd .
Reporters seem incapable of reporting Islamic radicalism at home unless there is a conviction .
And even then , as The New York Times has so dishonestly but consistently demonstrated , there are only good sheiks and good Islamic groups , not bad ones that preach jihad .
" Only they can get their faith freed from the clutches of extremism .
This is no time to hide .
It 's time to stand up and speak out .
For the terrorists will continue to speak on our behalf , until we do not speak up .
This is no time for silence .
Enough is enough ! "
" The great religion that preaches and celebrates universal brotherhood , equality of men and peace and justice for all has been hijacked by a demented , miniscule minority .
And , as my friend says , only Muslims can solve this problem .
Only Muslims can confront these anarchists in their midst ... "
" It 's all very well for us to say Islam has nothing to do with extremism and terrorism .
We can go on deluding ourselves these psychopaths do not represent us ... "
But thankfully , there remains a glimmer of hope , and not from the condescending columnists of the New York Times or the State Department know - it - alls , but from courageous Muslim moderates in this country like Zuhdi Jasser or brutally honest Muslim columnists in the Middle East .
While the West refuses to utter the term Islamic extremists and as a corollary holds no one responsible , at least one Muslim columnist has the guts to tell the truth of where the responsibility lies .
It is time to stop caving in to the PC crowd .
If we refuse to use the term Islamic terrorist , we conveniently take away any onus of responsibility for Islamic groups to halt the murderous ideology they propagate .
In fact , in nearly EVERY claim of responsibility , which I studied , for hundreds of violent Islamic attacks which took place since 9/11 , the common justification by the Muslim terrorist perpetrator was that there was a " war against Muslims " by the West and the Jews that had to be avenged .
The real truth is that there is war against the West and the Jews by Islamic jihadists .
And no amount of territorial withdrawal or peace negotiations will assuage them .
Last year , the Departments of State and Homeland Security issued an internal memorandum that henceforth no one could use the term " Islamic terrorists " and could only use the generic term " militant " or " extremist . "
Even President Bush , who once invoked the term " Islamofacism , " now refuses to use the term Islamic terrorist .
In Canada , the author Mark Steyn was the subject of three human rights complaints and subsequent trials for calling radical Muslims terrorists and other such " slurs . "
He won all three tribunals .
Our politically craven governments , followed in part by the media , have now started to ban the use of the term " Islamic terrorists " or " Islamic militants , " insisting that they simply be called " extremists " or militants .
The government 's rationale was a page picked right out of the playbook of western radical Islamic strategy : Portray the use of the term " Islamic terrorist " as " racist " and as allegedly stigmatizing all Muslims .
In the United States , after 9/11 , a group of American men ( mostly converts ) pleaded guilty or were found to be guilty of training with LeT and of trying to " wage war " against the United States .
Evidence produced in the trial showed that LeT 's website — before being taken down — focused disproportionately on two enemies : Americans and Jews .
In 2004 , Ismail Royer , an official with the Council on Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) who had trained with the Taliban , pled guilty to weapons and explosives charges .
He was sentenced to 20 years in prison .
In later grand jury testimony , Royer admitted that the cell 's primary goal was to fight with the Taliban against United States forces in Afghanistan .
The most that government officials , in cahoots with mainstream media , could utter were names like Al Qaeda ( AQ ) or Laskar - e - Taiba ( LeT ) as potential suspects .
Yet even here , the discussions were mindless .
One talking head said it could not be AQ since AQ behavior is to have massive simultaneous explosions ( as if Al Qaeda follows a pre-programmed script ) .
Another expert said LeT did not have the resources to carry it out , forgetting ever so slightly that all Islamic terrorist groups share resources , recruit from other terrorist groups , train each other , provide each other with equipment and , most importantly of all , want to destroy their " enemies . "
On Wednesday , even though everyone knew by then that the perpetrators were jihadists , CNN constantly referred to the terrorists as " extremists " — with no modifier .
Hell , they could have been the Basque ETA or the ultra right wing U.S. militia .
Then a CNN anchor asked his guest with totally innocence , " Now why would an extremist group target a Jewish house of worship ? "
Because , my dear politically correct anchor , it was an Islamist terrorist group .
Watching and reading the last 5 days of reports of the Mumbai attacks was an Alice in Wonderland experience .
Even after an Islamic terrorist group took credit , TV anchors and reporters assiduously avoided the term Islamic terrorist .
They must have consulted with the Thesaurus for the Politically Correct to determine that the word " gunmen " would not offend any jihadist .
Without realizing it , the Grey Lady had hit upon a great travel series .
In the best spirit of jihad for dummies , why not a year 's worth of op - eds focusing on " Why They Hate____ " filled in , mad - libs style , with the U.S. , Britain , Italy , Spain , Germany , the Netherlands , Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , Israel , Jordan , Iraq , Egypt , Kenya , and the other 74 countries where radical Islam has reared its violent head ?
With only the moral blindness that the New York Times could capture , each op - ed would portray the attacks in a contrived even - handed way , without blaming , or even naming , the perpetrators of the attacks —
Muslim jihadists .
This past Saturday , the New York Times ran an op - ed piece entitled " What They Hate about Mumbai , " focusing specifically on the free market sins of that great city .
With contrived evenhandedness , the op - ed managed to blame both Hindus and Muslim extremists — without blaming either party in particular for the murderous attacks .
Terrorism expert Steve Emerson says there 's no hope of victory in the war on terrorism until we call it what it really is .
The Jihad that shall not be named !
Submitted by Jason Orlich , Dec 4 , 2008 00:46
Western media often omit the motive and intent of the Islamic terrorists out of fear of " offending " Muslims around the world .
As a member of the U.S. military , we have captured / killed jihadists from more than 70 countries around the world who are all walking , talking and preaching the same vile hatred of the West and the non-Islamic world .
They have stated their goals and objectives while defining themselves and their cause in Islamic terms .
Despite all that , we continue to call primary state sponsors of terror ( Saudi Arabia and Pakistan ) our " allies " or " partners " in War on Terror .
We continue to target proxies ( al - Qaeda , Taliban , Laskar - e - Tayyba , etc ) while ignoring their sponsors !
It 's time we called a spade a spade !
Keep up the great work Steve !
You 're a great American and the U.S. military appreciates your undying efforts to expose and identify the nature of the enemy we face today at home and abroad !

Clueless , the fallout from Mumbai
Submitted by Robert J. Fuller , Dec 3 , 2008 17:01
" Every villain is followed by a sophist with a sponge . "
Lord Acton
The coverage of the atrocity in Mumbai was disheartening but thoroughly predictable .
Rather than discuss what attacked the city , the entire focus was on who , which group or other could it be and whatever could they want ?
Not the fact they called themselves " mujahideen " and what that could tell us about the what .
Not any discussion about the meaning of Jihad , even though that is what " Allah 's soldiers " -- mujahideen -- fight .
That would have meant using words like " Islam " and " Muslim " which in turn might have invited criminal legal action from the United Nations for inciting Islamophobia !
It might have meant spelling out what a mujahideen fighting in the cause of Allah ( jihad fi sabil Allah ) actually believes in and how he justifies violence in the name of religion .
But that would imply there was more going on than the usual politics among nations or that Islamic terrorism was something more than a reaction to American policies ( our fault , even if in India ! ) .
As in Deepak Chopra on CNN :
" What happened in Mumbai , he told the interviewer , was a product of the U.S. war on terrorism , that ' our policies , our foreign policies ' had alienated the Muslim population , that we had ' gone after the wrong people ' and inflamed moderates .
And ' that inflammation then gets organized and appears as this disaster in Bombay . ' "
Indeed , it is terrible the way we force Muslims to have to kill us !
But is n't it amazing how easily so many peaceful moderates become " inflamed " into murderous fanatics ?
Is it possible Deepak Chopra does not know what he is talking about ?
Is it possible that in rendering ourselves unable to discuss these matters forthrightly , unable to name our enemy or discuss his motivations , we politically correct ourselves into the graveyard ?
Someone , in all this coverage , could have provided historical perspective , perhaps mentioned the history of the Islamic Jihad against India dating back to the 8th Century .
The very same religious war to spread Islam and subjugate Infidels which historian Will Durant wrote about : " The Islamic conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history .
It is a discouraging tale , for its evident moral is that civilization is a precious good , whose delicate complex of order and freedom , culture and peace , can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying from within . "
It is a tale which involves cities burnt to ashes , whole populations massacred , temples destroyed , and according to Professor K.S. Lal , a loss of life of perhaps 80 million between 1000 - 1525 CE .
This is how Amir Khusrau wrote about it : " the whole country by means of the sword from our holy warriors , has become like a forest denuded of thorns by fire ... Islam is triumphant , idolatry is subdued .
Had not the law granted exemption from death by payment of poll tax , the very name of Hind , root and branch would have been extinguished . "
Western commentators take note , Islamists do n't simply hate the West !
Hindus have been the greatest victims of Islam .
Those promoting the notion Jihad started the day before yesterday and just concerns the West or Israel must explain what beheaded teachers and farmers in Thailand , killed in the name of Islam by self - proclaimed jihadists , have to do with the West ?
Or Christian schoolgirls beheaded in Indonesia .
Or the 150,000 Algerians killed by jihadists .
Or the millions of Christian and animist Africans killed in the Sudan in an attempt to impose Shari 'a law .
They are only about Islam .
Unthinkable as it may seem , Islamists may just have their own agenda , their own reasons for doing things , quite independent of us and regardless of our policies .
It might have been worthy of discussion that these religious murderers targeted a miniscule group of Jews in Mumbai and reserved for them the most sadistic torture before killing them , men and women .
What did these Jews have to do with the politics of Pakistan or Kashmir or India ?
Nothing .
We 're told now the terrorists were " avenging " Palestine , which tells us two things .
That jihadists everywhere consider themselves fighting in the same cause and the degree to which Jew - hatred is inculcated within Islam , preached by clerics across the globe and sanctified by verses of the Qur'an and Sunnah .
For your consideration ,
Sheikh Abd al - Rahman al - Sudayyis , Imam of the primary mosque in Mecca : " Jews are the scum of the earth , the rats of the world , the violators of pacts and agreements , the murderers of prophets , and the offspring of apes and pigs . "
( This was in a sermon ! )
Sheikh Muhammad Tantawi , Grand Imam of Al Azhar in his learned book on the Jews :
" The Koran describes the Jews with their own particular degenerate characteristics , i.e. killing the prophets of Allah [ Koran 2:61 / 3:112 ] , corrupting His words by putting them in the wrong places , consuming the people 's wealth frivolously , refusal to distance themselves from the evil they do , and other ugly characteristics caused by their deep - rooted lasciviousness … only a minority of the Jews keep their word { Koranic citations here ] ….
All Jews are not the same .
The good ones become Muslims { Koran 3:113 ] , the bad ones do not . "
This incitement to hate and even murder , for Jews , as well as for kaffirs ( unbelievers ) of all stripes , goes on unabated .
Of course , this is not a useful line of inquiry for our media types being way too troublesome and likely to make the wrong people angry .
So would viewing this attack in the global context of more than 12,000 acts of Islamic terrorism since 9/11 .
So let 's look at one of the who .
Lashkar - e - Taiba ( Army of the Pure ) is currently being named the most likely culprit .
Now , going by the name of Jamaat - u - Da'wa , they are the terror wing of Pakistan 's Islamic Religious Party ( MDI ) and have been backed with Saudi money and the assistance of the Pakistani ISI , Intelligence Service .
They are officially allied with Al Qaeda ( signatory to the same International Islamic Front ) .
They have been very involved in killings in Kashmir and implicated in suicide homicide terror in India .
What do they want ?
In a pamphlet entitled " Why Are We Waging Jihad ? " they go way beyond the conflict over Kashmir and declare America , Israel and India to be existential enemies of Islam .
In case you miss the point , they promise to plant " the flag of Islam " over Washington D.C. , Tel Aviv and New Delhi .
Listing " reasons for jihad " they ensure no lack of reasons will ever be found --
" -- to eliminate evil and facilitate conversion to the practice of Islam ; to ensure the ascendancy of Islam ; to force non Muslims to pay the jizya poll tax ( make them subjugated peoples ) ; to liberate Muslim territories from a non-Muslim occupation ... " and so on and so forth .
It also poses these questions to Muslims :
" Have all the obstacles to observing the faith ( Islam ) in the world been removed ? "
" Is the current world order that of kaffirs ( unbelievers ) or of Muslims ? "
Since the answer is no to both questions , the jihad must continue .
The document also links their jihad movement with the others Muslims are waging ( or contemplate )
" Christians now rule Spain , ( once Muslim Andalusia ) and we must wrest it back from them .
All of India …. were part of the Muslim empire that was lost because Muslims gave up jihad .
Palestine is occupied by the Jews .
Countries such as Bulgaria , Hungary , Cyprus , Sicily , Ethiopia , Russian & Chinese Turkistan ... were Muslim lands and it is our duty to get these back from unbelievers .
Even parts of France ... were home to Muslim mujahideen but are now under the occupation of unbelievers . "
Shari 'a law mandates any territory once belonging to Islam , forever belongs to Islam and if lost must be reclaimed .
And for Lashkar as well as for Jamaat - e - Islami , that includes India itself .
The idea that these jihadis do not see their struggles as separate from the greater Ummah is amplified in comments such as these :
" Yes we all need to fight the jihad locally yes there is Shia Hezbollah and Sunni Hamas .
My goal for now is to liberate Palestine .
In Iraq the mujahideen must rid the region of American occupation .
There is the fight against traitor governments like Egypt and Saudi Arabia , but it 's the same fight .
The defeat of the anti Muslim world .
We are in World War Three .
The Americans are doing everything to prevent Islam to emerge as the world superpower ... there is one basic fact and that is all groups have the same goal and we know that Allah will bring victory to the believers and I am telling you that you are fighting Allah , not Islam .
And Allah is invincible . "
-- Abu Mosaab of Islamic Jihad , as told to Aaron Klein
" There is one fight for all Islamic resistance and that is the fight for Islamic rule . "
-- Ramada Adassi , Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades to Aaron Klein
" We dream of an entire Islamic world and we will achieve it . "
-- Khadaffy Janjalani , Abu Sayyaf beheader .
" Tomorrow our nation ( the Muslim Nation ) will sit on the throne of the world .
This is not a figment of the imagination , but a fact .
Tomorrow we will lead the world , Allah willing .
Apologize today before remorse will do you no good . "
-- Hamas leader Khaled Mash'al
" Hizballah is not waging the battle of Hizballah or of Lebanon .
We are waging the battle of the nation ( the Muslim Ummah ) . "
-- Hassan Nasrallah , Hizballah
The reason America remains public enemy number one has less to do with its foreign policies than the fact America is the lead Infidel power and is seen as the chief obstacle in the way of Islam dominating the 21st Century .
That is made explicit in an Al Qaeda Manifesto of 2002 : " No project for the liberation of the Islamic nation could succeed as long as the US was there , defeating the US means the defeat of the West , which would lead to the shift of the international center of gravity back to the Islamic world . "
Does this not go beyond the ‘ jihad is a reaction to American policies ' theory ( and thus will go away if we change policies , abandon Israel etc ) ?
Maybe India thinks giving up Kashmir will make these problems go away ?
Clearly , that would be wishful thinking .
Here is a revealing interview with Maulana Khan , confidant of Jamaat - e - Islami Amir , Qazi Hussain Ahmed ( Jamhooria Islamia magazine May 2007 ) :
" Our motto is ' Constant Jihad . '
Qazi's vision is that Pakistan will be the center of the new Islamic Empire that stretches from Burma to Afghanistan , from Sri Lanka to Tajikistan .
Jamaat will use all tactics from terrorism in the kafir controlled areas to negotiations in the Muslim … for India , Kashmir is like a keystone that sits on top of the arch -- if you can remove the keystone then the whole arch falls down .
Kashmir is the keystone for India .
Once Kashmir is taken out , these militancy movements will break India … Qazi 's vision is to make the entire India a 100 % Muslim nation ... each time a riot breaks out in India we had used that pretext to strike terror among the Hindus , Christians and Ahmaddiahs .
The similar terror will be at the heart of every non-Muslim , both Hindu and Christians , in the coming years in the entire of India .
Prophet succeeded with terror , so can we ... Qazi is an analytical genius who knows every strategy that was used by Prophet Muhammad ( PBUH ) . "
That 's what India can expect .
And after giving a vision of the new Empire , complete with slavery and executions for apostasy and the banning of photos , cinema and songs he says this , " " Whatever man needs to know is in the Quran & Hadiths ... we will prove everything we say is from Quran & Hadiths .
Let them prove what we say as wrong from the Quranic angle , they cannot . "
And that remains the challenge to moderate Muslims from the fundamentalists .
There have been condemnations of this horror from the Muslim world , some sincere some perhaps not .
Aijaz Zaka Syed , a Muslim columnist wrote a column for Sunday 's Khaleej Times Online : " It 's all very well for us to say Islam has nothing to do with extremism and terrorism .
We can go on deluding ourselves these psychopaths do not represent us ... The great religion that preaches and celebrates universal brotherhood , equality of men and peace and justice for all has been hijacked by a demented , miniscule minority .
And , as my friend says , only Muslims can solve this problem .
Only Muslims can confront these anarchists in their midst ...
Only they can get their faith freed from the clutches of extremism .
This is no time to hide .
It 's time to stand up and speak out .
For the terrorists will continue to speak on our behalf , until we do not speak up .
This is no time for silence .
Enough is enough ! "
These are fine words , finer still and courageous if acted upon .
Yet the exoneration of Islam and of teachings central to Islam in the same sentence gives me pause .
How can there be any confrontation with fundamentalists by moderates without confronting those verses of the Qur'an and Sunnah and those elements in Islamic law ( Shari'a ) which jihadists use to justify violence and Islamic supremacism ?
Are they " anarchists " when all they want is full Shari'a ?
Are they a " miniscule minority " and if so why are they , the fundamentalists , in the driver 's seat , with most of Islam 's leading clerics seemingly behind them ?
Why can't they be marginalized and silenced if their argument is not convincing to very many Muslims ?
Finally , where in the Qur'an are brotherhood and equality ever applied towards non-Muslims ?
I can't find it .
I celebrate those things , most civilized Muslims do as well , but how much of the Qur'an and Sunnah do you have to discard to only keep the peaceful , tolerant verses ?
What is the difference between what the Jihadists want and what the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) , the 57 member Islamic bloc , is pushing at the United Nations ?
Shari'a .
Islamic supremacism .
The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam of 1990 which the Muslim nations embraced , repudiates the very foundations of the UN , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and redefines human rights according to Islamic Shari 'a law .
Which is to say no human rights as we understand them .
The new agenda of the OIC , besides demonizing and delegitimizing Israel , now includes imposing Islamic blasphemy laws upon the non-Muslim world , which the good dhimmis seem quite willing to accept judging from the voting of the General Assembly .
There will be no " defaming religion " , meaning giving offense to Islam or Muslims .
Even though curbing freedom of expression violates Article 19 of the Universal Declaration , hurting the feelings of Muslims and defaming the religion of truth takes precedence .
After all , Muslims have proven they will kill over such things .
Likewise , we must put a stop to counter terrorism and national security measures because they target Muslims , oppress them , discriminate against them , and are Islamophobic .
These are the priorities of majority Muslims , represented by the Islamic bloc of nations at the UN .
Not fighting radical Islam and its teachings and its violence and how that might defame Islam !
Fighting non-Muslims trying to protect themselves , or trying to critically examine the teachings and tenets of Islam in order to understand the threat against them .
The OIC would criminalize free speech regarding Islam .
The UN could not even agree on an international definition of terrorism -- it was blocked by an OIC insisting the definition had to exclude " armed struggle for liberation & self - determination " " the legitimate right of peoples to resist foreign occupation " -- meaning that the blowing up certain civilians , say Israeli , or even American , would be out of the reach of the definition " terrorism " The Counter - Terrorism Committee ( CTC ) created by the Security Council after 9/11 , since Sept 28 , 2001 , has never named a single terrorist , terrorist organization or state sponsor of terrorism .
And this , of course , was the OIC intention .
The question is , what is moderate about this ?
Discussing Shari'a is now off - limits at the UN , since it might constitute " defaming " religion , even though it is to be the measure of human rights and is embedded in the constitutions of most Muslim States , the laws of these countries must also be off - limits !
But we can discuss it here .
‘ Umdat al - Salik , the classic manual of Islamic law certified by Al Azhar says this about Jihad :
" Jihad means going to war against non-Muslims & is etymologically derived from the word ' mujahada ' signifying warfare to establish the religion ... the duty of Jihad exists as long as the universal domination of Islam has not be attained ... ' until the end of the world ' … the Caliph makes war upon Jews , Christians and Zoroastrians until they become Muslim or else pay the non-Muslim poll tax … moreover , the Caliph fights all other peoples until they become Muslim ... if there is no Caliph , Jihad must still be carried out . "
That is the controlling definition of Jihad according to Islamic law and the consensus of scholars .
What else is the OIC upholding by upholding Shari'a ?
08.0 Leaving Islam is the ugliest form of unbelief ( kufr ) and the worst .
08.1
When a person who has reached puberty and is sane voluntarily apostasizes from Islam , he deserves to be killed .
08.2
In such a case , it is obligatory for the Caliph to ask him to repent & return to Islam .
If he does it is accepted from him , but if he refuses , he is immediately killed .
08.4
There is no indemnity for killing an apostate ( O : or any expiation , since it is killing someone who deserves to die )
08.7 Acts that entail leaving Islam ( and would invite the death penalty ) -- just a few of them - - - 1 ) to prostrate to an idol , whether sarcastically , out of some contrariness , or in actual conviction .
2 ) to intend to commit unbelief , even if in the future , and like this intention is hesitating whether to do so or not 3 ) to speak words that imply unbelief such as " Allah is the third of three " or " I am Allah " ( unless one is intoxicated spiritually or insane ) 4 ) to revile Allah or his Messenger 6 ) to be sarcastic about Allah 's name , His command , His interdiction , His promise or His threat 7 ) to deny any verse of the Qur'an of anything which by scholarly consensus belongs to it or to add a verse that does n't belong to it .
Did you catch that ?
To intend to commit unbelief , even if in the future .
The basis for this penalty is Muhammad saying " whoever changed his Islamic religion , kill him . "
( Bukhari v9b88n6922 )
This view of Apostasy was the basis for the Ridda ( Apostate ) War after the death of Muhammad , when so many Muslims left the faith and refused to pay zakat , charity tax .
80,000 were killed for trying to leave Islam .
As the medieval scholar Ibn Taymiyah wrote : " Whoever deviates from the Book is to be brought back with iron , i.e. by force .
Hence the soundness of the religion is based on the Qur'an and the Sword . "
Let 's go on ,
" Retaliation is obligatory against anyone who kills a human being purely intentionally and without right .
the following are not subject to retaliation 0.1.0 pg 582 -- a Muslim for killing a non-Muslim -- the killing of an apostate from Islam -- a father or mother ( or their father or mothers ) for killing their offspring or their offspring 's offspring .
Absorb that .
Do human rights as understood by Islam include the barbaric punishments in Shari'a for theft ( cutting off of limbs ) for adultery ( death ) for homosexuality ( death ) ?
Like we 've seen recently in Iran or Somalia ?
But wait , Islamic law does more than punish behavior .
Islamic law considers doing wrong : thought crimes , crimes of speech , crimes of belief .
In fact , it calls them the worst crimes , worse than killing .
Which explains what is going on now at the UN .
Qur 'an 9:12 - 13 " if they attack your religion with disapproval and criticism ... "
Ibn Kathir ( Islam 's most venerated scholar ) " disapproval and criticism , it is because of this that one who curses the Messenger , peace be upon him , or attacks the religion of Islam by way of criticism and disapproval , they are to be fought . "
- Tasfir Ibn Kathir
The Qur'an says disbelievers are the worst of creatures .
98:6 - 7 . That those who deny Muhammad 's revelations are evil ( 7:177 )
That disbelief itself is the worst crime ( 10:17 ; 61:7 ) and worse than killing ( 2:191 ) .
" Since Jihad involves killing and shedding the blood of man , Allah indicated that these men are committing disbelief in Allah , associating with Him ( in worship ) and hindering His path , and that is a much Greater Evil and more disastrous than killing .
Abu Malik commented about what Allah said ( and al - fitnah is worse than killing ( ) meaning what you ( disbelievers ) are committing is much worse than killing . "
Tasfir Ibn Kathir .
What is there that is moderate about Shari'a ?
Jihad against infidels until the world is subjugated to Allah ( and His Messenger ) .
Dhimmitude -- legal , social and moral apartheid against non-Muslims .
Violence and intolerance toward non-Muslims .
Oppression of women .
Death for apostasy , leaving Islam - - this alone makes Islam a religion of fear , not of peace .
Not to mention the amputations , the stonings to death .
How do any modern nations endorse this Shari'a as defining " human rights " and the ordering of societies ?
How does this make them moderate ?
Shari 'a encapsulates the ideology derived from the Qur'an and Sunnah by scholarly opinion and there is no area of life it leaves untouched , that includes political life .
Islamic scholars say again and again the whole world must be governed by Shari 'a because it is the will of Allah for all mankind and everything else is disobedience , unbelief and corruption ( and those things are worse than killing , according to the Qur'an , 2:191 ) .
What does Osama bin Laden call for ?
" Muslims and especially the learned among them , should spread Sharia law to the world , that and nothing else ... ( Muhammad said ) " I have been commanded to battle mankind until they declare there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah ..he also said , per Berida " Call them to Islam , if they respond ( convert ) accept this .. if they refuse to accept Islam , demand of them the jizya .. if they refuse , seek the aid of Allah and fight them .
Does Islam , or does it not , force people by the power of the sword to submit to its authority , corporeally if not spiritually ?
Yes . "
" In fact , Muslims are obligated to raid the lands of the infidels , occupy them , and exchange their systems of governance for an Islamic system , barring any practice that contradicts the Shari'a from being publicly voiced among the people as was the case at the dawn of Islam .... divine foundations ( are ) built upon hating the infidels , repudiating them with tongue and teeth till they embrace Islam or pay the jizya with willing submission and humility .
The Prophet was sent in the final hours with the sword so that none is worshipped but Allah , alone , partnerless . "
-- Osama Bin Laden " Moderate Islam is a Prostration to the West " ; Raymond Ibrahim , The Al Qaeda Reader
This foundation for jihad is a far cry from the explanations put forth by the likes of the New York Times .
Where is the Muslim world speaking forthrightly against Shari'a , against religious warfare , against any killing in the name of God , ever ?
Condemning Muslim terrorists by name and pronouncing them outside Islam ( would n't " hijacking " the religion call for that much ? ) .
Condemning the teaching of Jihad ideology and Islamic supremacism in mosques and schoolbooks , refuting them Islamically , calling on Muslims to live peacefully as equals with non Muslims on a permanent basis -- not as a tactical respite before resuming the war when circumstances favor Muslims again .
Where is the forthright confronting of Qur'anic verses such as found in Surah Nine and other Medinan revelations concerning war against and the subjugation of Jews , Christians and other non-Muslims ?
And where is the free world uniting to reject these doctrines and their encroachments and the threat they represent to life and liberty ?
Mumbai demonstrates we are still , clueless .
I think this is what liberals like to call " speaking truth to power "

THE
NECESSITY
OF
ATHEISM .
A CLOSE examination of the validity of the proofs adduced to support any proposition , has ever been allowed to be the only sure way of attaining truth , upon the advantages of which it is unnecessary to descant ; our knowledge of the existence of a Deity is a subject of such importance , that it cannot be too minutely investigated ; in consequence of this conviction , we proceed briefly and impartially to examine the proofs which have been adduced .
It is necessary first to consider the nature of Belief .
When a proposition is offered to the mind , it perceives the agreement or disagreement of the ideas of which it is composed .
A perception of their agreement is termed belief , many obstacles frequently prevent this perception from being immediate , these the mind attempts to remove in order that the perception may be distinct .
The mind is active in the investigation , in order to perfect the state of perception which is passive ; the investigation being confused with the perception has induced many falsely to imagine that the mind is active in belief , that belief is an act of volition , in consequence of which it may be regulated by the mind ; pursuing , continuing this mistake they have attached a degree of criminality to disbelief of which in its nature it is incapable ; it is equally so of merit .
The strength of belief like that of every other passion is in proportion to the degrees of excitement .
The degrees of excitement are three .
The senses are the sources of all knowledge to the mind , consequently their evidence claims the strongest assent .
The decision of the mind founded upon our own experience derived from these sources , claims the next degree .
The experience of others which addresses itself to the former one , occupies the lowest degree , --
Consequently no testimony can be admitted which is contrary to reason , reason is founded on the evidence of our senses .
Every proof may be referred to one of these three divisions ; we are naturally led to consider what arguments we receive from each of them to convince us of the existence of a Deity .
1st .
The evidence of the senses .
-- If the Deity should appear to us , if he should convince our senses of his existence ; this revelation would necessarily command belief ;-- Those to whom the Deity has thus appeared , have the strongest possible conviction of his existence .
Reason claims the 2nd. place , it is urged that man knows that whatever is , must either have had a beginning or existed from all eternity , he also knows that whatever is not eternal must have had a cause .
-- Where this is applied to the existence of the universe , it is necessary to prove that it was created , until that is clearly demonstrated , we may reasonably suppose that it has endured from all eternity .
-- In a case where two propositions are diametrically opposite , the mind believes that which is less incomprehensible , it is easier to suppose that the Universe has existed from all eternity , than to conceive a being capable of creating it ; if the mind sinks beneath the weight of one , is it an alleviation to increase the intolerability of the burden ?
-- The other argument which is founded upon a man 's knowledge of his own existence stands thus .
--- A man knows not only he now is , but that there was a time when he did not exist , consequently there must have been a cause .-- But what does this prove ?
we can only infer from effects causes exactly adequate to those effects ;--- But there certainly is a generative power which is effected by particular instruments ; we cannot prove that it is inherent in these instruments , nor is the contrary hypothesis capable of demonstration ; we admit that the generative power is incomprehensible , but to suppose that the same effect is produced by an eternal , omniscient Almighty Being , leaves the cause in the same obscurity , but renders it more incomprehensible .
The 3rd . and last degree of assent is claimed by Testimony --- it is required that it should not be contrary to reason .--- The testimony that the Deity convinces the senses of men of his existence can only be admitted by us , if our mind considers it less probable that these men should have been deceived , then that the Deity should have appeared to them --- our reason can never admit the testimony of men , who not only declare that they were eye- witnesses of miracles but that the Deity was irrational , for he commanded that he should be believed , he proposed the highest rewards for faith , eternal punishments for disbelief --- we can only command voluntary actions , belief is not an act of volition , the mind is even passive , from this it is evident that we have not sufficient testimony , or rather that testimony is insufficient to prove the being of a God , we have before shewn that it cannot be deduced from reason , --- they who have been convinced by the evidence of the senses , they only can believe it .
From this it is evident that having no proofs from any of the three sources of conviction : the mind cannot believe the existence of a God , it is also evident that as belief is a passion of the mind , no degree of criminality can be attached to disbelief , they only are reprehensible who willingly neglect to remove the false medium thro ' which their mind views the subject .
It is almost unnecessary to observe , that the general knowledge of the deficiency of such proof , cannot be prejudicial to society :
Truth has always been found to promote the best interests of mankind .--- Every reflecting mind must allow that there is no proof of the existence of a Deity .
Q.E.D.
The Aston Martin - Foster design has solar panels Sports car manufacturer Aston Martin is joint winner of a competition to design a new Routemaster bus for London .
The Warwickshire - based firm 's winning entry was a team effort with leading architects Foster and Partners .
They share the £ 25,000 first prize with bus , coach and truck design firm Capoco Design , based in Wiltshire .
A Transport for London spokesman said the first of the greener and more accessible , hop - on hop - off , double - deckers could be in service by 2011 .
The original Routemasters were phased out from regular service by the end of 2005 as they were inaccessible to wheelchairs or pushchairs .
Tendering process
The competition , in which children were also invited to take part , attracted about 700 entries .
The winning designs will now be passed on to bus manufacturers , following a competitive tendering process , to develop into a final proposed design .
The Aston Martin - Foster bus design envisages a highly - manoeuvrable , zero-emissions vehicle , with solar panels built into a glass roof , full accessibility , warm lighting and wooden floors .
The Capoco design combines what the company describes as " the best of the old with the best of the new " .
The Capoco Design retains the Routemaster - style front engine
It has a low flat floor to allow easy access and will be low emission , but will also retain the Routemaster - style front engine and open rear platform .
The youngest winners were nine - year - olds Thomas Staricoff , from Brighton , and Olivia Carrier , from north - west London , who received £ 200 worth of bicycle vouchers for their drawings of what a new bus should look like .
London Mayor Boris Johnson said : " We have had a phenomenal response , with ideas submitted from around the globe , and we now have , in our joint winners , two stunning designs that allow us to go forward and produce a truly iconic bus fit for 21st Century London . "
But Labour 's transport spokesperson on the London Assembly , Val Shawcross , said : " The design competition may have been fun and the winning designs are extremely impressive , but this is not a serious way to make policy and not a worthwhile use of public money .
" I have yet to hear one convincing argument for why London needs a new double - decker bus and until Boris comes up with some , Londoners will see this as little more than a vanity project . "

Despite claims from the McCain and Palin campaign and Republican politicos that fraudulent registration applications can lead to massive voter fraud , a member of the McCain - Palin Honest and Open Election Committee said in an interview published by Politico.com that he knew of no case in which a fraudulent voter registration application had led to someone casting a fraudulent vote .
Ronald Michaelson , who was also the executive director of the Illinois Board of Elections for nearly three decades , said that trying to cast fraudulent votes by first submitting phony voter registration applications did n't make for a very sensible or plausible election - rigging scheme .
Michaelson said the rancorous debate over the issue in recent weeks has undermined voters ' confidence in the election process
“ The fact that so many of these illegal registrations are being made public raises a perception in the minds of people , ’’ he said .
“ That ’s more of a general concern .
You do n’t want to perpetuate the idea that our election process is lacking integrity . ”
When asked if the Republican party did n't hold responsibility for driving that perception through remarks made by McCain and others , Michaelson said , “ Well , it does n’t help .
It has captured the attention of a lot of people . ”
Why perpetuate it then , Michaelson was asked .
He replied , “ Maybe it ’s because there ’s nothing else to talk about . "
Fraudulent voter registrations have been at the center of controversy after it came to light that some temporary workers registering voters on behalf of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) had submitted fake registration applications to increase their numbers and perhaps please supervisors .
Some reports had claimed the workers submitted false applications to earn higher pay , but ACORN told the New York Times it paid workers an hourly wage , rather than per application .
One of the fraudulent applications was submitted in the name of Mickey Mouse , others were submitted under the name of Dallas Cowboys ' quarterback Tony Romo , under the name of a deceased voter , the name of a restaurant and the names of people randomly selected from a phonebook .
FBI agents and state officials are investigating ACORN operations in several states to determine if the organization or any of its workers were involved in a coordinated scheme to submit fraudulent applications .
But ACORN has maintained that it was the first entity to bring the fraudulent applications to light and that its internal audits of applications , augmented by checks conducted by election officials , prevent such applications from making it to voter rolls .
The organization said that it 's required in some states to submit every application it receives to election officials , even questionable ones , but that it flags such applications to draw officials ' attention to them .
It even temporarily closed an office in August in Gary , Indiana , and replaced its management staff after discovering a high number of fraudulent applications were being submitted by workers there .
But as a result of these efforts , it says it 's become a target of partisan politics .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain declared during one of his debates with Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama that ACORN was " on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy . ”
He also accused Obama of ties to the organization .
Both claims have been analyzed by FactCheck.org .
ACORN organizers have since received death threats , and ACORN offices have been vandalized and burgled .
Republicans have been the target of their own voter registration fraud scandals recently .
A firm called Young Political Majors , which was hired by the California Republican Party to register voters , is being investigated for improperly registering voters as Republicans by leading them to believe they were signing petitions calling for harsher treatment of child molesters .
The firm received $ 7 to $ 12 for every person it registered as a Republican .
The owner of the firm , Mark Jacoby , was also arrested this month on felony charges of voter registration fraud and perjury after officials say they discovered that he had fraudulently registered himself at a California address where he did n't live in order to qualify to register other California voters .
The California Republican Party reportedly also paid $ 175,000 for voter registration efforts to a Republican operative who had been investigated for voter registration fraud in several states .
Democrats have accused McCain and the GOP of attacking ACORN to draw attention away from voter suppression efforts occurring in several states , such as deceptive robocalls designed to trick voters into not going to the polls and efforts by Republican election officials and party officials topurge eligible voters from registration lists in some states and challenge the eligibility of voters in other states .
Democratic officials say the likelihood that a fraudulent registration application would lead to a fraudulent vote is small .
When Republican officials were asked for examples of such fraudulent votes being cast , Politico reported that a spokesman for the McCain campaign pointed to 13 news stories and a 2003 Missouri state auditor ’s report .
But eleven of the examples he cited did n't involve registration fraud , and two of them concerned convicted felons who were accused of casting illegal votes in their own names .
There was only one example of a forged registration being connected to a fraudulent vote .
It involved a 2006 story about a community organizer who registered a non U.S. citizen , after which someone voted in the noncitizen ’s name .
A reader has pointed out a second Politico story , however , that lists a number of other cases in several states in which false voter registrations led to fraudulent votes .
The piece also quotes former ACORN workers who say the organization had no quality control and even alleged that some ACORN affiliates purposely flooded election officials with false applications to create confusion that would lead to some applicants getting on the voter roll .
Here are a couple of salient paragraphs from the piece .
Anita MonCrief , an ACORN whistle - blower who worked for both it and its Project Vote registration affiliate from 2005 until early this year , agrees .
" It 's ludicrous to say that fake registrations can't become fraudulent votes , " she told me .
" I assure you that if you can get them on the rolls you can get them to vote , especially using absentee ballots . "
MonCrief , a 29 - year old University of Alabama graduate who wanted to become part of the civil rights movement , worked as a strategic consultant for ACORN as well as a development associate with Project Vote and sat in on meetings with the national staffs of both groups .
She has given me documents that back up many of her statements , including one that indicates that the goal of ACORN 's New Mexico affiliate was that only 40 percent of its submitted registrations had to be valid .
MonCrief also told me that some ACORN affiliates had a conscious strategy of flooding voter registration offices with suspect last - minute forms in part to create confusion and chaos that would make it more likely suspect voters would be allowed to cast ballots by overworked officials .
Nate Toller , who worked on ACORN registration drives and headed an ACORN campaign against Wal - Mart in California until 2006 , agrees .
" There 's no quality control on purpose , no checks and balances , " he told me .
ACORN conducted extensive voter registration drives in 18 states and has claimed that it registered 1.3 million new voters during this election cycle , most of them minority or poor , working - class voters and young voters – categories of voters who tend to register and vote Democrat .
The New York Times recently reported , however , that this number was wildly inflated and that the real number was closer to 450,000 .
Some 400,000 applications submitted by ACORN to election offices were rejected because they were incomplete , were duplicate registrations or were found to be fraudulent applications .
About 9,000 , or about 2 percent of the rejected applications , were found to be fraudulent .
A lawyer for ACORN , however , estimated that 5,000 to 6,000 additional applications could prove to be fraudulent as investigations continue .
The remaining applications were re-registrations from people who had moved and were simply registering their change of address .

NASA is experiencing problems with a $ 250 million machine for recycling urine and other wastewater into drinking water for astronauts , the space agency said on Friday .
Glitches triggered two shutdowns during initial attempts on Thursday and Friday to begin the distillation process on pre-collected samples of urine .
NASA delivered the water regeneration system to the $ 100 billion International Space Station this week to prepare for its crew to grow from three members to six in May .
Residents of the station must recycle water because the space shuttles , which produce water as a byproduct of their electrical systems , will no longer fly to the outpost after 2010 and it is too expensive to haul as much water as the crew will need on unmanned cargo ships from Earth .

The recycler problems , which pointed to a sensor , were not unexpected , said mission commentator Rob Navias .
NASA still expects the machine to work well enough for astronauts to bring back batches of purified water for analysis when shuttle Endeavour returns to Earth next week .
The shuttle has been at the station since Sunday to deliver more than 7 tonnes of cargo to support an expanded crew .
Contaminated joint
In addition to the water recycling gear , the shuttle astronauts delivered two new sleeping compartments , a second toilet , a galley and more exercise equipment .
Improvements to the station ’s exterior are also under way .
Astronauts on Friday prepared for the third of four spacewalks to fix a problem with a joint in the station ’s truss .
The 3 - metre - wide rotary joint is needed to position solar panels so they can collect light from the Sun as the station orbits about 340 km above Earth .
Last year , NASA discovered one of the two joints had been contaminated with metal filings and designed a complicated series of spacewalks to fix the problem and prevent it from happening to the other joint .
Spacewalking schedule
Space station managers estimate up to 10 spacewalks may be needed to resolve the problems .
Shuttle Endeavour ’s astronauts have completed two of four planned spacewalks already , despite the loss of a $ 100,000 tool kit on Tuesday and a buildup of carbon dioxide in one astronaut ’s spacesuit near the end of the second spacewalk on Thursday .
The third outing is scheduled for Saturday .
Endeavour is due to leave the station next Thursday after an 11 - day stay and return to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida next Saturday .
NASA plans eight more missions to the station and a final servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope before the shuttle fleet is retired in 2010 .

POZNAN , Poland ( Reuters ) - Former Vice President Al Gore urged weary climate delegates to agree a new climate treaty next year and drew loud cheers on the last day of difficult two - week U.N. climate talks on Friday .
Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore gestures as he gives a speech during the U.N. climate change conference in Poznan December 12 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Kacper Pempel
The talks were on course to meet a minimum goal , to sign off on a fund to help poor nations prepare for global warming , but they were likely to delay any decision on climate targets .
Gore urged 145 environment ministers gathered in the western Polish city of Poznan to put aside climate blame squabbles which have marred the talks for years and agree a climate treaty in Copenhagen next December .
“ The struggle is palpable here in Poznan , ” he said .
“ It can be done , it must be done , ” said the 2000 presidential candidate , climate crusader and 2007 Nobel Peace Prize winner .
“ We now face a crisis that makes it abundantly clear that increased CO2 emissions anywhere are a threat to the integrity of this planet ’s climate balance everywhere . ”
“ As a result the old divide between the North and South , between developed and developing countries is a divide that must become obsolete . ”
He said the world ’s two biggest carbon emitters China and the United States were both ready to lead the fight against climate change .
The U.N. talks are meant to push a treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol , which limits neither country .
Gore said the inspiration of U.S. President elect Barack Obama could push the talks over the finish - line in Copenhagen .
“ I would like to relay to you a message that I ’ve heard from the people of the United States of America this year , that I think is very relevant to the task the world is facing over this next year -- ‘ Yes we can ’ , ” he said .
Obama swept to victory last month on a promise of bringing about change in the United States , pushing an upbeat slogan of ‘ Yes , we can ’ .
U.N. talks have stumbled on splits between the rich and poor , oil producers and small island states vulnerable to rising seas .
Red tape and complex jargon has also got in the way .
Gore said recession was no reason for inaction and urged a “ Green New Deal , ” a program of massive investments , which U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon endorsed on Thursday .
Famous for his “ Inconvenient Truth ” film charting evidence for climate change , Gore won the loudest cheers for supporting a tougher limit on levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than a widespread aim of 450 parts per million or more .
“ We will soon need to toughen that goal to 350 , ” he said .
According to Jacob Weisberg in Slate :
A source of mild entertainment amid the financial carnage has been watching libertarians scurrying to explain how the global financial crisis is the result of too much government intervention rather than too little .
One line of argument casts as villain the Community Reinvestment Act , which prevents banks from “ redlining ” minority neighborhoods as not creditworthy .
Another theory blames Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for causing the trouble by subsidizing and securitizing mortgages with an implicit government guarantee .
An alternative thesis is that past bailouts encouraged investors to behave recklessly in anticipation of a taxpayer rescue .
There are rebuttals to these claims and rejoinders to the rebuttals .
But to summarize , the libertarian apologetics fall wildly short of providing any convincing explanation for what went wrong .
The argument as a whole is reminiscent of wearying dorm - room debates that took place circa 1989 about whether the fall of the Soviet bloc demonstrated the failure of communism .
Academic Marxists were never going to be convinced that anything that happened in the real world could invalidate their belief system .
Utopians of the right , libertarians are just as convinced that their ideas have yet to be tried , and that they would work beautifully if we could only just have a do - over of human history .
Like all true ideologues , they find a way to interpret mounting evidence of error as proof that they were right all along .
Well , I would suggest that he goes off the tracks as soon as he says that we “ fall wildly short of providing any convincing explanation for what went wrong . ”
I hear a hell of a lot more cogent analysis of what went wrong and how than either Republicans or Democrats have offered .
In fact , the whole article is a strawman .
Weisberg essentially says that the whole mess was caused by deregulation , and that deregulation equals libertarianism .
Further , since the crisis was “ caused ” by deregulation , that invalidates the argument for deregulation and thus makes libertarianism intellectually bankrupt .
He does have one thing right , though .
Libertarians will be painted with the same broad brush as the socialists , who– when faced with the collapse of socialist nations such as the USSR , Cuba , etc– claim that socialism would work if only it was really tried .
The problem is that his conclusion is based on the premise that anyone believes libertarian has been attempted — a premise that he ’s actually trying to generate rather than to reflect .
Libertarians have never claimed that the society that we advocate has been remotely enacted in America , and the whole time we ’ve been criticizing the hodgepodge of regulation and non-regulation by government as evidence that government is captured by special interests .
This , more than any other reason , was why I ’ve removed my support from the FairTax .
I love the FairTax proposal , but my cynicism of government has proven correct too many times to believe that Washington would allow a proposal to go through without modifying it into a monster .
If I believed they ’d enact the FairTax as proposed , I may support it .
But since I do not , I do n’t want my name behind the horrible tax scheme that would eventually be enacted under the moniker “ Fair ” Tax .
Sadly , though , some would claim that Weisberg– if not right about the issues– accurately captures public sentiment towards libertarianism .
This mess will undoubtedly give deregulation or non-regulation a bad name , completely glossing over the fact that we libertarians have been complaining about the perverse incentives cause by this supposed deregulation all along .
They ’ll follow this up as electorates always do , by running away from liberty into the waiting arms of their nanny - state saviors .

Composite image by POLITICO Obama ad slams McCain on abortion rights
ST .
PAUL , Minn . — Barack Obama has launched a broadside against John McCain ’s opposition to abortion rights and moved one of the most divisive issues in modern American politics to the airwaves on a large scale for the first time in this presidential campaign .
Obama ’s new radio ad , airing widely in at least seven swing states , tells voters McCain “ will make abortion illegal . ”
It ’s airing as McCain courts female voters with the addition of the staunchly anti-abortion governor of Alaska , Sarah Palin , to his ticket .
Advertisement
Democrats had , until now , sought to appeal to women primarily on economic issues such as health care and workplace discrimination ; abortion rights were hardly mentioned at the Democratic National Convention in Denver last week .
But women ’s rights groups have been urging Obama to attack McCain on the issue , pointing to polling showing that some women who support McCain think he supports abortion rights .
In fact , the Arizona senator has long supported a ban on abortions , with exceptions for victims of rape and incest , and for pregnancies that threaten the life of the mother .
Palin has an even firmer anti-abortion stance :
She would require rape and incest victims to carry their pregnancies to term .
“ Let me tell you : If Roe vs .
Wade is overturned , the lives and health of women will be put at risk .
That 's why this election is so important , ” says the nurse - practitioner who narrates Obama ’s ad .
“ John McCain 's out of touch with women today .
McCain wants to take away our right to choose .
That 's what women need to understand .
That 's how high the stakes are . ”
An announcer then claims that “ as president , John McCain will make abortion illegal , ” before playing an exchange on " Meet the Press " in which McCain told moderator Tim Russert that he favors “ a constitutional amendment to ban all abortions . ”
“ We ca n't let John McCain take away our right to choose .
We can't let him take us back , ” says the ad .
Obama supports abortion rights , though he was criticized by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primary for avoiding votes on controversial abortion issues .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said the ad about McCain was sent to stations last Thursday , before the choice of Palin was made public .
“ This is a straightforward ad about the very well - documented fact that he wants to overturn Roe v. Wade and supports a constitutional ban on abortions , ” said Burton .
The campaign did n’t release further details of the ad buy , but Politico readers reported that it ’s airing in Florida , Virginia , Iowa , Ohio , Indiana , Wisconsin and Colorado .
One Colorado reader said he ’d heard it about a dozen times Tuesday — signs of a large buy .
McCain aides did n’t respond to a question about the ad , but Republican Party communications director Danny Diaz responded by attacking Obama 's opposition to an Illinois bill that advocates said would protect babies who survived abortions , and critics said was an attempt to limit all abortions .
“ Barack Obama voted against a bill that would have protected infants born alive having survived an abortion attempt , " said Diaz .
" He has offered misleading statements on the issue and is now trying to confuse voters by attacking Senator McCain . "
Kate Michelman , an informal Obama adviser who is the former president of the abortion - rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America , said she expected the campaign to expand its appeal to women on issues of abortion rights .
“ This is a door opened to a longer campaign and strategic effort to ensure that women know the truth about John McCain and Gov. Palin , ” she said , suggesting it would come “ on the radio , in the mail , on the phones , and in the organizing on the ground . ”
Though the campaign says the ad was released before Palin was chosen , Michelman said her selection , and her strong anti-abortion stance , would drive the issue closer to the center of the race .
“ By his nomination of Gov. Palin , McCain has made his opposition to a woman ’s right to decide a major campaign issue , ” she said .
SHANGHAI , China -- Novak Djokovic 's victory celebration turned out to be more dangerous than his opponent .
Jubilant after overwhelming Russia 's Nikolay Davydenko 6 - 1 , 7 - 5 in the Masters Cup final Sunday , Djokovic tossed just about everything in reach -- two rackets , wristbands and his sweat - soaked shirt -- into the cheering crowd at Qi Zhong stadium .
By anyone 's standards , Novak Djokovic had a terrific 2008 season .
Among his four victories : the Australian Open and his first Masters Cup title .
Matthew Stockman / Getty Images
Then he headed to the players box , where his coach , family and a former Miss Universe were standing and cheering .
A joyous group hug ensued , and they all bounced up and down together , reveling in the Serb 's first title in six months .
But when Djokovic walked away , he realized he had cut his left hand somewhere in the joyous melee .
It would n't have been good form to drip blood on his new trophy , so he had to ask the trainer to apply a bandage before the awards ceremony .
" You do n't feel the pain in the moments of happiness , " he said .
The victory provided Djokovic with perfect bookends to his year .
He won the Australian Open in January for his first Grand Slam .
And that cut ?
Not serious , and he has plenty of time to heal before starting 2009 -- and to think about how close he is to breaking the stranglehold that Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer have had on the top two spots in the rankings since mid-2005 .
" Certainly I believe that I have the quality to reach the top spot in the upcoming year or next couple of years , [ maybe ] 10 years , " Djokovic said .
" That is my lifetime goal that I 've been always trying to achieve .
But I have learned a lesson .
If I pay too much attention to rankings , it does n't go the right way . "
Federer , who says it does n't sound right to hear himself introduced as No. 2 in the world after spending a record 237 consecutive weeks at the top , is intent on taking the No. 1 spot back from Nadal .
He better watch his back .
Djokovic 's victory -- his first since the Rome Masters in May -- pulled him within 10 points of Federer 's total of 5,205 , and the Swiss star 's aching back , which caused him to pull out during the Paris Masters two weeks ago and tightened up on him here , is worrisome .
In the aftermath of the deadly Mumbai terror attacks , Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has come out with guns blazing – with a plan to get all 1,000 rookie cops ready to use heavy artillery in time for New Year ’s Eve , The Post has learned .
Alleged Mastermind of Mumbai Attacks Arrested
PHOTOS : NYPD Practices Fighting Terrorism In Brooklyn
The NYPD wants all 1,000 Police Academy recruits trained to use M4 automatic machine guns – which are now carried only by the 400 cops in its elite Emergency Service Unit – in time for the holiday celebration in Times Square .
The recruits currently at the academy will get three days of training to familiarize them with the weapon , police said .
The department also plans to train its 2,000 officers in the Organized Crime Control Bureau .
They include narcotics , vice , gang - and auto - crime cops .
That means five times as many cops will be able to use these powerful weapons as now .
“ In the event of multiple terrorist attacks , these other units will be deployed to supplement Emergency Services , ” said NYPD spokesman Paul Browne .
Kelly had proposed training other cops in the use of the weapon , a compact version of the M16 combat assault rifle used by the military , during previous “ tabletop exercises ” that dealt with responding to multiple terrorist attacks , Browne said .
The final decision to undertake the training was made after the three - day Mumbai , India , assault , which began Nov. 26 .
In the carnage in the city formerly known as Bombay , 10 terrorists carrying automatic rifles and grenades attacked a railway station , a market , a restaurant popular with foreigners , two luxury hotels and a Jewish center .
At least 195 people were killed and 295 wounded .
The dead included 18 foreigners , among them six Americans .
Police sources said NYPD brass decided to train the members of the current academy class because they are all in one place and it is easier than bringing them back for instruction once they are in the field .
The recruits ’ three - day training is being called “ familiarization ” because it is shorter than the two weeks Emergency Service officers receive on such weapons .
However , those cops also get training in other heavy weapons during that time .
The recruits ’ instruction will be carried out at the police range at Rodman ’s Neck in The Bronx .
There is no intelligence Times Square will be a target on New Year ’s Eve .
The area will be on high alert , but has been so for every year since the millennium .

( CNN ) -- Estimates for the amount of thick sludge that gushed from a Tennessee coal plant last week have tripled to more than a billion gallons , as cleanup crews try to remove the goop from homes and railroads and halt its oozing into an adjacent river .
TVA officials originally said the cleanup would take four to six weeks .
Now they say they are n't sure .
The sludge , a byproduct of the ash from coal combustion , was contained at a retention site at the Tennessee Valley Authority 's power plant in Kingston , about 40 miles west of Knoxville .
The retention wall breached early Monday , sending the sludge downhill and damaging 15 homes .
All the residents were evacuated , and three homes were deemed uninhabitable , according to the TVA .
TVA 's initial estimate for the spill was 1.8 million cubic yards or more than 360 million gallons of sludge .
By Friday , the estimate reached 5.4 million cubic yards or more than 1 billion gallons -- enough to fill 1,660 Olympic - size swimming pools .
Environmental advocates say the ash contains concentrated levels of mercury and arsenic .
The plant sits on a tributary of the Tennessee River called the Clinch River .
At least 300 acres of land has been coated by the sludge , a bigger area than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill .
A spokesman for TVA , a federal corporation and the nation 's largest public power company , said the agency has never experienced a spill of this magnitude .
" There 's a lot of ash there , " spokesman John Moulton said Friday .
" We are taking this very seriously .
It is a big cleanup project , and we 're focused on it 24 hours a day . "
Initial TVA estimates put the cleanup timeline at four to six weeks , but Moulton said the agency will no longer say how long it expects the effort to take .
Environmentalists say it could take months or even years to clean up the mess .
Video footage showed sludge as high as 6 feet , burying porches and garage doors .
The slide also downed nearby power lines , though the TVA said power had been restored to the area .
An estimated 78,000 cubic yards , or 15.7 million gallons , of sludge covered local railroad tracks and Swan Pond Road .
Chris Copeland 's backyard is covered with the sludge , though it did n't damage his house .
" We have a terrible mess in our backyard , " he told CNN's " Newsroom . "
" I can't begin to imagine how much of an effort it is going to take to clean this mess up .
It is incredible how much ash , dirt , earth , trees and debris is behind our house and then covering this neighborhood . "
Bulldozers and heavy machinery have been on the scene of the spill since Monday , scooping up the thick gray goop that downed power lines , trees and broke a water main , forcing a temporary boil order on residents .
Footage from the Clinch River , a popular fishing site , reveals piles of dead fish on its banks .
TVA said that has nothing to do with the toxicity of the sludge .
" What happened -- when you have a surge of ash , that created a wave to push the fish up and onto land , " Moulton said .
" When the water receded , there were dead fish .
They were n't killed by any toxic chemicals , they were stranded by the wave . "
He noted that water quality tests from the nearby water treatment facility have shown that the water from the river intake meets federal and state guidelines for potable water .
But critics of the coal operation remain concerned about the long - term effects of the spill .
" The early results are showing that it is not in the drinking water yet , but it is a fluid situation and the stuff is still not properly contained and concentrations can change over time , " said Stephen Smith of CleanEnergy.org .
He said people can still be exposed as the sludge dries and goes airborne in dust .
He said the spill underscores the need for the federal Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the containment of coal ash and accused TVA of underplaying the Tennessee spill .
" You have acute problems we are dealing with today , but we 'll have chronic problems for a long time , " Smith said .
" This whole area has been devastated environmentally . "
Appalachian environmentalists compare the mess to another spill eight years ago in eastern Kentucky , where the bottom of a coal sludge impoundment owned by Massey Energy broke into an abandoned underground mine , oozing more than 300 million gallons of coal waste into tributaries .
The water supply for more than 25,000 residents was contaminated , and aquatic life in the area perished .
It took months to clean up the spill .
" If the estimates are correct , this spill is 1 ½ times bigger , " said Dave Cooper , an environmental advocate with the Mountaintop Removal Road Show , a traveling program that explains the impact of an extreme form of mining .
CNN 's Samira J. Simone contributed to this report .

I received a call this morning from a commodities broker who told me that the Comex is alerting various futures firms about the potential of a squeeze on the December contract and is advising the $ 840 December shorts to exit their positions .
That is the remaining open position .
There have been 12,636 notices of delivery .
The shorts have until December 31 to make delivery .
Normally they deliver early to take in cash and earn the interest .
They must be delaying .
As I understand the situation , that represents about 40 percent of the gold available at the Comex , and of course someone could enter the scene late , buy February gold , and then spread into December , which would stun the shorts .
My broker friend said his back office said this sort of alert is highly unusual and that the concern is real , not only for gold , but for other commodities too , like copper and palladium , as there is a good deal of talk of taking deliveries there too .
But gold is the one for which the advice to cover went out .
This is an extremely productive development and could spur the price of gold up quickly as word spreads .
As we all know , buying Comex gold and silver ( the cheapest way to buy precious metals ) makes all the sense in the world in this financial environment .

Thanksgiving is a week away .
But it 's never too early to start stockpiling stories to share over turkey and stuffing next Thursday .
Which president pardoned the first turkey ?
Is Big Bird 's costume made of turkey feathers ?
Kara Kovalchik has all the details .
1. Butterball turkeys have been a holiday tradition for the past 50 years .
While the name " Butterball "  implies that the bird is injected with butter ( which it is not ) , it actually refers to a specific breed of turkey .
Butterball turkeys have all - white feathers ( birds with colored feathers often have dark spots on their meat , which is not aesthetically pleasing ) and have extra - broad breasts .
Butterball turkeys are also the best - selling brand in the U.K. at Christmas , since the British obviously do n't celebrate Thanksgiving .
2. Caruncle , wattle and snood might sound like a law firm , but they are actually words that describe the various bits of red fleshy stuff that grows on a turkey 's head .
The snood is the flap that hangs over its beak , the caruncles are colored growths on the throat , and the wattle is the skin hanging under the turkey 's beak .
When all three turn bright red the turkey is either in a mating mood or is very angry .
In either case , you 'll want to stay out of its way .
3 . Unlike chicken and duck feathers , turkey feathers are too stiff for use as pillow and duvet stuffing .
Some of the larger , more colorful feathers are sold for decorative purposes or craft projects , but the majority of turkey feathers are ground up and composted .
4 . The classic " Turkeys Away "  episode of WKRP in Cincinnati was based on a very unsettling real event .
WKRP creator Hugh Wilson had a friend who worked for an Atlanta radio station that decided to toss live turkeys out of a helicopter for a Thanksgiving promotion .
Just like the TV episode revealed , none of the folks involved with the stunt knew that domestic turkeys could n't fly , and a local shopping center was bombarded with turkeys hitting the ground " like bags of wet cement . " 
( " As God is my witness , I thought turkeys could fly ! "  )
5. Big Bird of Sesame Street fame is clad in a costume made of turkey feathers .
Feathers plucked from the hind end of the bird , to be more specific .
A company called American Plume and Fancy Feather selects the feathers for the Children 's Television Workshop to inspect ( nine out of 10 feathers are rejected ) , and then the white feathers are dyed yellow and incorporated into the Bird 's costume .
6 . The classic folk melody called " Turkey in the Straw "  first gained popularity via minstrel shows in the mid-1800s .
There is no copyright information available regarding the song , so the author of the tune remains a mystery .
However , the song has earned at least one unusual place in pop history : in the United States , it is the most common melody used by ice cream trucks to attract customers .
7 . It is now a Thanksgiving tradition for a live turkey to be presented by the National Turkey Federation to the U.S. President , and for him to official grant it a pardon .
The bird that had been earmarked for Thanksgiving dinner was then relegated to a farm or petting zoo to live out its life .
Many reports state that Harry S Truman was the first President to grant the bird a pardon , but it was actually John F. Kennedy who first declared that the gift gobbler would not appear on the White House dinner table .
8 . Even though domestic turkeys can't fly , their by - products are well - traveled .
When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin tore into their first meal on the Moon , those foil packets contained freeze - dried roast turkey with all the trimmings .

She had been fighting leukemia for some years , evidently , and unfortunately died of complications from the disease early this morning in California .
Barrett - Roddenberry will be fondly remembered by Star Trek fans forever for her work , which will — fittingly , one might say — end with the upcoming reboot of the franchise , in which she one last time performed the voice of the Enterprise computer .
She had reportedly just completed her voiceover work on the movie when she passed away .
Reports say that a public memorial for Barrett - Roddenberry is planned for shortly after Christmas or in early next year , and that her family has asked that donations be made to the CARE Organization or Precious Paws in lieu of flowers .
Condolences can be sent via e-mail to share@roddenberry.com .
We at GeekDad extend our sincerest condolences to her son Rod and the rest of her family .
BANGKOK , Thailand ( CNN ) --
Fourteen sailors are still missing from a
Thai trawler that was sunk last week by the Indian navy as a suspected pirate ship , the vessel 's owner said Tuesday .
The Indian navy frigate INS Tabar was reported to have battled a " pirate vessel " last week .
One crewman was found alive after six days adrift in the Gulf of Aden , and one is confirmed dead , said Wicharn Sirichaiekawat , owner of the Ekawat Nava 5 .
Last week , India 's navy reported that the frigate INS Tabar had battled a pirate " mother vessel " in the gulf November 18 , leaving the ship ablaze and likely sunk .
Wicharn said that vessel was his ship , which was in the process of being seized by pirates when it came under fire .
Indian authorities insisted that their ship had acted against a pirate vessel that had threatened to attack the Tabar .
" We fired in self - defense and in response to firing upon our vessel .
It was a pirate vessel in the international waters , and its stance was aggressive , " said Commodore Nirad Sinha , a navy spokesman .
He said the ship the Tabar fired upon was laden with ammunition .

Wicharn said the Ekawat Nava 5 was headed from Oman to Yemen to deliver fishing equipment when it was set upon by pirates off the Horn of Africa .
The pirates were seizing control of the ship when the Tabar moved in , he said .
Wicharn said he learned the fate of his vessel from a Cambodian crew member who survived the gunfire and drifted in the ocean for six days before he was plucked to safety by a passing ship .
The sailor was recovering in a hospital in Yemen , he said .
Wicharn said his ship made a distress call November 18 as it was chased by pirates in two speedboats , but the connection was lost midway .
The owners , Sirichai Fisheries , had not heard from the crew since then .
Later that evening , the Indian navy said it encountered a suspected pirate " mother vessel , " with two speedboats in tow about 285 nautical miles ( 525 km ) southwest of the Omani port of Salalah .
" Mother vessels " are often used as mobile bases to ferry pirates and smaller attack boats into deep water .
When the Tabar 's crew hailed the ship and demanded that it stop for inspection , the pirates threatened to destroy the Indian ship , the ministry reported .
" Pirates were seen roaming on the upper deck of this vessel with guns and rocket - propelled grenade launchers .
The vessel continued its threatening calls and subsequently fired upon INS Tabar , " the ministry said .
The Indian frigate returned fire , setting the pirate ship ablaze and setting off explosions on board , the statement said .
An international fleet has been patrolling the waters off the Horn of Africa in an effort to crack down on pirates based in largely lawless Somalia .
Map of piracy incidents in 2008 »
Pirates have attacked more than 90 vessels off East Africa this year , according to the International Maritime Bureau 's Piracy Reporting Center , which monitors piracy around the world , including a Saudi supertanker captured this month .
The latest ship seized was a Yemeni freighter Adina taken last week with a crew of seven on board , including two Yemenis , two Panamanians and three Somalis , security sources in Yemen told CNN .
The government is in direct contact with officials in Somalia to work on rescuing the ship , for which the hijackers are seeking a $ 2 million ransom .
Although the pirate takeover of the Saudi supertanker highlights the dangers facing cargo ships navigating the Horn of Africa , marine security experts are warning that racing boats , private charters and luxury yachts can be far easier pirate targets :
Rich people usually carry cash and jewels .

The word Goliard is applied almost exclusively to members of the supposed , an itinerant disillusioned unemployed edumacated sort who wandered Western Europe famously in pursuit of wine , women and song .
Since pretty much all institutions of higher learning in that part of the world were at that time appendages of the Church , the Goliards ( or Goliard poets , as they 're often referred to ) were almost to a man the formerly religious type who'd suffered some sort of spasm of faith and decided to pursue a more Epicurean lifestyle outside the stifling and stodgy suppression of organized religion .
Once their hometowns grew tired of their earthly antics , they could just move on and pack up to the next monastery over the hill down yonder - " You speak Latin ?
You must be the prelate who was being sent to tutor our young nuns regarding the Temptation of Sins of the Flesh !
Come on in , here 're your quarters , dinner 's at five ! "
Rumour had it that these travelling rascals were followers of an order founded in the 13th century by the famous , albeit legendary , secular Bishop Golias - a cute conceit and a common mythos for the subculture to share , but hogswallop nonetheless considering that they 'd been recognized as an irritation by Church authorities as early as the 11th century .
One problem in particular which really got their goat was when these bogus onetime priests taught illiterate peasants satiric verses to common Church hymns - the simple country folk , not knowing any Latin , did n't know any different , but the priests noticed when their flocks began singing slightly deviated lyrics ; instead of being about the sufferings of Jesus on the cross and the perfection of God , the new words were rather regarding what the Pope did to who every night and how many times !
The Goliard phenomenon flourished where the Church was the supreme power - because where spiritual and legal powers were concentrated and combined with the 10 % tithe across the board , you ended up with a lot of disgruntled farmhands just about ready to vent and blow off some steam towards their cloistered masters .
Goliards were big favourites in the taverns , whipping up drinking songs ridiculing the Powers That Was - and what 's more , doing it through adapting universally - known religious hymns , turning the very tools of the authorities against themselves .
Many great poets of the age began their careers as Goliards , eventually maturing and growing out of the rebellious , Bohemian lifestyle - these notably including Pierre de Blois , Gautier de Châtillon , Phillipe the Chancellor and Primus ( aka Hugo , canon of Orléans ) , a towering wit second in the Goliard canon only to the aptly - named Archipoeta ( Archpoet ) of Cologne , some of whose words have here below been translated and arranged for your education and edification :
Down the broad way do I go ,
Young and unregretting ,
Wrap me in my vices up ,
Virtue all forgetting ,
Greedier for all delight
Than heaven to enter in :
Since the soul in me is dead ,
Better save the skin .
Pardon , pray you , good my lord ,
Master of discretion ,
But this death I die is sweet ,
Most delicious poison .
Wounded to the quick am I
By a young girl 's beauty :
She 's beyond my touching ?
Well ,
Ca n't the mind do duty ?
Hard beyond all hardness , this
Mastering of Nature :
Who shall say his heart is clean ,
Near so fair a creature ?
Young are we , so hard a law ,
How should we obey it ?
And our bodies , they are young ,
Shall they have no say in't ?
Potent stuff , is n't it ?
That 's what made the words of these men so dangerous !
Forget the Moors or the Witches - these cads were the greatest threat to Christianity at the time because they knew the Church inside and out , knew all the abhorrent internal politics and logical gaps ( aka " leaps of faith " ) in Church dogma and could eventually perhaps have taken it down from the inside out ... if they could have only laid the bottle aside for a minute and gotten their act together .
Alas , this heady age of ribald debauchery was not to last .
Enough of these overeducated gads and layabouts were causing enough problems that edicts came down restricting their activities before they could amount to anything - the Council of Trier issuing an order in 1227 forbidding Goliards from taking part in chanting Church services .
By 1289 this had escalated to the point where their mere existence was declared forbidden .
They pop up again from time to time over the course of the next century , but eventually they disappear from the record altogether , passing on a legacy to the travelling secular performers - minstrels , troubadors and jongleurs - who would be arriving on the scene after them , treading more softly .
Why do we know about them ?
Why am I telling you all this ?
Well , I 'm one perverse motherfucker .
But besides that , you 've probably already heard the words of Goliard poets , even though you might not have understood them in German and Latin : in 1803 a 13th - century collection of their satirical and deeply humanistic songs was unearthed from an abbey at Benediktbeuem , causing a mild flap and eventually manifesting splendidly as the source material for Carl Orff 's Carmina Burana .
So next time you 're grooving in your computer chair as an MP3 of O Fortuna comes blaring out , do n't just appreciate the kickin ' tune - realise that the lyrics are a 13th - century cross between " Weird Al " Yankovic and Rage Against the Machine and consider which oppressive , monolithic power structure you could be undermining right now .
...
spiregrain says : the poem you 've quoted here is covered in movement 11 of Carmina Burana .
The music is noded under

Paul Krugman gets it right .
Instead , the Republican rump , the party that ’s left after the election , will be the party that attends Sarah Palin ’s rallies , where crowds chant “ Vote McCain , not Hussein ! ”
It will be the party of Saxby Chambliss , the senator from Georgia , who , observing large - scale early voting by African - Americans , warns his supporters that “ the other folks are voting . ”
It will be the party that harbors menacing fantasies about Barack Obama ’s Marxist — or was that Islamic ? — roots .
Why will the G.O.P. become more , not less , extreme ?
For one thing , projections suggest that this election will drive many of the remaining Republican moderates out of Congress , while leaving the hard right in place .
{snip}
But the G.O.P.’s long transformation into the party of the unreasonable right , a haven for racists and reactionaries , seems likely to accelerate as a result of the impending defeat .
This will pose a dilemma for moderate conservatives .
Many of them spent the Bush years in denial , closing their eyes to the administration ’s dishonesty and contempt for the rule of law .
Some of them have tried to maintain that denial through this year ’s election season , even as the McCain - Palin campaign ’s tactics have grown ever uglier .
But one of these days they ’re going to have to realize that the G.O.P. has become the party of intolerance .
He 's got it perfect .
If Obama wins today , the Republican party with the help of FOX and talk radio will be the party of Screaming Zombies that will make the Clinton years look like a walk in the beach .
And as Digby tells us :
Agile project management has taken the software development community by storm , with terms like sprint and Scrum becoming part of everyday team conversations .
But as Agile techniques are incorporated into company practices , there exists the very real danger that Agile will be adopted in name , but not in spirit .
With this in mind , we turned to the original authors of the 2001 Agile Manifesto for advice on how Agile can be subverted .
Paint - by - Numbers Innovation
A typical developer pain point is when Agile techniques are applied dogmatically , without thinking through whether a specific practice makes sense for a given task .
They confuse checklists with real Agile adoption .

7 Agile Leadership Lessons for the Suits
Cargo Cult Methodology : How Agile Can Go Terribly , Terribly Wrong
Why Your Project Management Practices Are Failing
ABC : An Introduction to Agile Programming
According to Alistair Cockburn , one of the original 17 signatories to the manifesto , some of this weakness can be traced back to how people acquire new skills .
People tend to have three stages of skill acquisition , he says .
" In the first stage , people need to follow a recipe .
In the second stage , you say ' That 's all very nice , but I need more , ' so you go off and collect recipes and ideas and techniques .
And in the final stage — if you ever get there — is a level of fluency and intuitiveness where you can't say what you 're doing , but you kind of borrow and blend . "
As a result , says Cockburn , level - one thinking leads to the mentality of " I have my checklist , I have my certificate . "
He says , " In general , we tend to deplore it , because Agile is really about level two and level three . "
The experienced developers and team leads should be paying attention to how things are going .
However , adds Cockburn , " Anyone who comes into the business will naturally , perhaps necessarily , ask for a checklist .
So now you get the Scrum - master certification and the Agile checklist and the Scrum checklist and the XP [ extreme programming ] checklist ; everybody wants a checklist .
We need to get people out of that box and into an arena where they 're thinking about principles and feelings , and not [ about ] a checklist . "
Kent Beck , another Agile manifesto signatory , says it can be a challenge for organizations to take on the new challenges of Agile development .
" Lately we 've been talking about Agile in terms of words like ' self - awareness ' and ' self - discipline . '
And somehow it was an unnamed presupposition or an unnamed characteristic of a group of people who were successful using lightweight processes that they were pretty self - aware people , and that they would have a lot of self - discipline . "
But now , the Agile community is asking organizations to take on those characteristics .
" They think they can just go by rote and issue some edicts , " he says , and people will magically take on those attributes .
When companies apply Agile practices without self - examination , Beck says , peril lies ahead .
When companies try to " do " Agile mechanically , he says , " We ask , ' Well , are n't you talking about it ?
About what 's working and not working in the quality of your communications and your community ? ' "
Because the initial community was self - motivated , those issues did n't need to be addressed early on .
" These are the things we did n't think to say back in 2001 , and now we 're seeing people applying it very mechanically , we 're seeing what 's missing , " Beck says .
If You Don't Know Where You 're Going , Agile Wo n't Get You There
Cockburn also sees teams use Agile as an excuse not to engage their customers at a detailed level .
Developers do n't have a plan , do n't get requirements — and may not even be very good designers to start with .
Cockburn says , " They start going around in circles , and the customers or users try to tell them what they want , and the developers say ' No , no , no !
That 's too much information .
Just give me the first sentence out of what you said and I 'll go build it . '
And then the users say ' But no , it 's more complicated than that , let me tell you more . '
The developers say ' That 's all I need , we 're doing increments , let me just build that . ' "
The result , of course , is that " They go around in circles , and they get lost , and they 're over - budget , " he says .
It 's really a pretty predictable mess , says Cockburn .
The people driving the process keep being told , we do n't need this much thinking .
" I actually saw someone write on a [ discussion ] list , ' If you have to plan , you 're not Agile enough . '
And unfortunately , that really does bad things to projects , " he adds .
Alternately , the team may have a good rapport with their customers , but be unable to control the project scope .
Another problem , says Cockburn , is when people do n't get the size and shape of the system they 're supposed to build ; they only work from user stories .
" The user stories multiply like rabbits .
If you were to do a burn - up chart , where the line goes toward the ceiling , instead of down toward zero , you 'd find that the ceiling is going up faster than the progress being made . "
That 's depressing for everybody involved , Cockburn says .
" I 'm not sure where this has come out of the manifesto , " he wonders .
" But what happens is that [ developers ] say ' We do n't need to know how big the problem is , because we 'll give you great stuff as we go along . '
So they never figure out the shape of what it is they 're building , which means they do n't have a clue how much it 's going to cost . "
The ' Agile ' team might say , " This looks like 170 story points , " but they do n't have any basis for that estimate .
It turns out to be 700 story points , " But they only discover that as they go along , much to the depression of everyone involved , " Cockburn adds .
When All You Have Is A Hammer , You Want to Bang on Too Many Nails
It 's also possible for developers to insist on using every tool in the Agile / Scrum tool - bag , even when it does n't make sense .
" I struggle at times to determine how to apply the principles to a particular task that I 'm doing , " Beck confesses .
" It often comes down to a practice that makes sense in general , but that does n't make sense in a particular situation . "
Even though he 's being " doing Agile " for years , he can sometimes have a hard time figuring out how to apply it .
" I do n't think that 's a problem with Agile development per se , " he says .
" If I was a dyed in the wool waterfallist , I think the same thing would apply .
You need to be able to get to a context where you can see that it does n't apply to this situation . "
But even when the techniques do n't apply , the underlying principles of Agile — such as transparency and accountability — still do , according to Beck .
" That makes sense whether I 'm doing a technology spike or production programming or a research paper , or doing some kind of highly risky blue sky research .
But how they apply is different , in different contexts . "
This can be especially true in early project stages .
It 's good for teams to call their shots , but Beck says it 's important to make commitments .
That is n't easy when you do n't know a lot about the user 's needs , and it can be hard to know what to say with any certainty .
Still , Beck says , you can explain to management and users , " At the end of the week , we 're going to know something we did n't know before , " even if you can't say that at the end of the week you 'll have a specific feature .
" Because you might not know it that feature is even possible , but you can still call your shots as far as what it is you expect to be able to learn , " he says .
" The principle of transparency holds even at an early stage .
You might not expect to see a bunch of tests or some production - ready code .
But it takes a kind of flexibility to apply that without clinging rigidly to the practice . "
That 's why the manifesto has a line about individuals and interactions over processes and tools , Beck says .
It 's not that processes and tools are not valuable .
But in fluid situations , Beck 's experience has shown , you 're better off relying on people who can recognize the situation and respond to it creatively .
That 's far better than saying " Here 's the point in the process where I 'm supposed to write a test , so I 'll write a test . "
It 's also possible for an individual to lose sight of the Agile principles and become focused solely on process .
Beck met one team at a conference dinner , several years ago , which had been working under a very dogmatic coach who insisted that everything had to be done in exactly " this " way .
" The management had said that they had to do [ Agile ] or they would be fired , and they were furious — understandably so , " says Beck .
It 's not that Agile was inappropriate , he points out .
They could write tests , they could deliver something at the end of every week .
All that stuff was physically possible .
But , Beck says , " If you 're going to ask someone to do something difficult or challenging , you need to build a relationship to begin with .
You need to spend time maintaining that relationship through the difficult situation , and the coach had n't done that . "
It can also be very difficult to take when a well - functioning team suddenly finds themselves stuck with what they see as an unneeded burden .
" It 's certainly frustrating , " says Beck , " if you have a process that 's working well for you , and somebody comes along and says ' You have to change it , because everyone else is changing . '
At that point , it 's getting in the way of your progress . "
Broken Engagements
Agile development also depends upon the engagement of the sponsors or customers in the process .
That 's a difficult transition for some , according to Cockburn .
" It looked like for a while that we were pushing all the power down to the programmers , but in fact we were evening out the power and responsibilities .
Everyone gets to feel awkward about that . "
In some organizations , he says , programmers ignored their bosses and built whatever they wanted .
At the other extreme , programmers expected the bosses or managers or sponsors to tell them accurately what the priorities were — not something the managers were used to .
" So you get a breakdown on both sides , " says Cockburn .
" The sponsors are n't used to being asked to show up and care about the project , even [ about ] the requirements .
...
They say ' No , that 's what we hired you to do . ' "
The programmers respond , ' We do n't know ; we need you to help us figure it out , ' " he adds .
And the sponsors say , ' We do n't have time .
Work it out yourselves . ' "
Agile 's Not Always Appropriate
Then there are places where Agile just is n't the right fit at all , says Cockburn , such as organizations with high turnover ( i.e. franchises like McDonald's ) .
The processes are really critical , and staff does n't have the time to learn by apprenticeship because people are coming in and being trained all the time .
Other venues where Agile is n't workable , he says , include situations where you need comprehensive documentation , life - critical systems or certain types of legal situations — when that 's more important than the working software . "
Finally , remember that Agile is intended for processes that will go through multiple iterations , reminds Cockburn .
" Agile is built on incremental development , " he points out .
Not for projects that are one - shots , like a Bar Mitzvah or wedding .
( " You know you do n't get more than one iteration on a wedding , " he says . )
To apply Agile principles in those scenarios , you have to plan very , very carefully .
" You might still borrow a burn - down chart , you might borrow some techniques ; but you 're not going to get the advantage of multiple iterations [ or ] reflective improvement in that . "
Agile as Religion : When Even Founders are Heathen
Finally : once individuals become familiar with Agile , either through training or practice , they can become inflexible and intolerant of people new to the process .
Cockburn has seen this in action .
" I 'm one of the authors of the manifesto , so if I say something ' weird , ' they can't tell me I do n't understand Agile .
But if someone else — and it does n't matter how many years of experience they have — says something funny , they get told they do n't understand Agile . "
That makes Cockburn gnash his teeth .
" They can't yank my club card , but they can pretend you do n't have one , " he says .
Sometimes Agile principles are grossly misinterpreted , according to Cockburn .
" I get called in by a CIO , CTO , any CXO , and they 're suffering because their programmers are telling them ' You do n't know anything about Agile .
Agile means we do n't have to give you a plan , Agile means we do n't need an architecture ' — a whole bunch of rubbish that is n't in the Agile manifesto . "
So Cockburn , or people like him , have to come in and tell the CIO that it 's okay to ask for a plan and an architecture .
" But it takes me to come and do it , " Cockburn says .
" If anyone else says it , they get told that they 're just an old fuddy - duddy , [ and that ] they do n't know anything about Agile . "
The politics of compassion have overcome the politics of fear .
Tonight , Michigan became the thirteenth state to legalize the physician supervised possession and use of cannabis .
According to early returns , more than 60 percent of Michigan voters decided in favor of Proposal 1 , which establishes a state - regulated system regarding the use and cultivation of medical marijuana by qualified patients .
Voters endorsed the measure despite a high profile , deceptive , and despicable ad campaign by Prop. 1 opponents — who falsely claimed that the initiative would allow for the open sale of marijuana “ in every neighborhood , just blocks from schools . ”
( In fact , Proposal 1 does not even allow for the creation of licensed cannabis dispensaries . )
Michigan ’s new law goes into effect on December 4th , at which time nearly one - quarter of the US population will live in a state that authorizes the legal use of medical cannabis .
Meanwhile , in Massachusetts , some 65 percent of voters ( and virtually every town ) decided “ yes ” on Question 2 , which reduces minor marijuana possession to a fine - only offense .
Like in Michigan , voters rejected a high - profile , deceptive ad campaign by the measure ’s opponents , who argued that it would increase adolescent drug abuse , permit large - scale marijuana trafficking , endanger workplace safety , and sharply increase traffic fatalities .
Question 2 is expected to become law in 30 days — making Massachusetts the thirteenth state to decriminalize the personal possession and use of cannabis .
( Note : Under state law , politicians have the option of amending the new law . )
NORML celebrates both victories and recognizes that neither would have been possible without the grassroots efforts of Michigan and Massachusetts state activists — who laid the groundwork for both campaigns by successfully passing a series of similar , municipal initiatives over the past several years .
Wednesday Morning Update :
Victories in four pro-marijuana law reform measures in local elections were announced overnight :
Citizens in Fayetteville , Arkansas voted in favor of initiative question # 16 , which instructs city police to make the enforcement of minor marijuana offenses a low priority .
The initiative passed with nearly 66 percent support .
Not too surprisingly the citizens of Berkeley , California voted again to affirm an initiative that ‘ eliminate limits on the amount of medical marijuana patient or dispensary can possess ’ .
Measure JJ passed with 61 percent support .
Hawaii County also passed a lowest police priority marijuana initiative .
Also , the Massachusetts PPQ results regarding medical marijuana , which readily passed as expected , are online here .
Unfortunately for reformers the Drug Policy Alliance - sponsored Prop. 5 , which sought progressive criminal justice law reforms for non-violent offenders ( and would have changed the legal status of a minor marijuana citation from a criminal to civil offense ) did not prevail at the polls , losing with 40 percent support .
Once again , voters have rejected the Bush doctrine on drugs .
They ’ve rejected the lies put forward by drug warriors and law enforcement , and demonstrated — overwhelmingly — that truth , compassion , and first - hand experience are more persuasive than the deception and scare tactics of those who would take away our freedoms and confine us in cages .
In short , it is the cannabis community , not the Drug Czar , that is shaping America ’s marijuana policy , and tonight we go to bed knowing that millions of Americans will wake up tomorrow with a better , brighter , and more tolerant future than they had today .

Mystery of the screaming mummy
By Kathryn Knight for MailOnline
It was a blood - curdling discovery .
The mummy of a young man with his hands and feed bound , his face contorted in an eternal scream of pain .
But who was he and how did he die ?
On a scorching hot day at the end of June 1886 , Gaston Maspero , head of the Egyptian Antiquities Service , was unwrapping the mummies of the 40 kings and queens found a few years earlier in an astonishing hidden cache near the Valley of the Kings .
The 1881 discovery of the tombs , in the Deir El Bahri valley , 300 miles south of Cairo , had been astonishing and plentiful .
Hidden from the world for centuries were some of the great Egyptian pharaohs - Rameses the Great , Seti I and Tuthmosis III .
Yet this body , buried alongside them , was different , entombed inside a plain , undecorated coffin that offered no clues to the deceased 's identity .
It was an unexpected puzzle and , once the coffin was opened , Maspero found himself even more shocked .
Unexpected : Alongside the remains of great Egyptian pharoahs lay the body of a young man , his face locked in an eternal blood - curdling scream , in a plain , undecorated coffin
There , wrapped in a sheep or goatskin - a ritually unclean object for ancient Egyptians - lay the body of a young man , his face locked in an eternal blood - curdling scream .
It was a spine - tingling sight , and one that posed even more troubling questions : here was a mummy , carefully preserved , yet caught in the moment of death in apparently excrutiating pain .
He had been buried in exalted company , yet been left without an inscription , ensuring he would be consigned to eternal damnation , as the ancient Egyptians believed identity was the key to entering the afterlife .
Moreover , his hands and feet had been so tightly bound that marks still remained on the bones .
Who could he be , this screaming man , assigned the anonymous label ' Man E ' in the absence of a proper name ?
An autopsy , performed by physicians in 1886 in the presence of Maspero , did little to shed any light on the subject .
One of the physicians , Daniel Fouquet , believed the contracted shape of his stomach cavity showed he had been poisoned , writing in his report that ' the last convulsions of horrid agony can , after thousands of years , still be seen ' - yet his science was unable to help him ascertain why .
Even marrying these findings with historical documents only allowed experts to speculate .
Some believed ' Man E ' was the traitor son of Rameses III , who'd been involved in a coup to remove him from the throne , others that he was an Egyptian governor who had died abroad and been returned to his homeland for burial .
Some believed the unconventional manner of his mummification showed that he was not Egyptian at all , but a member of a rival Hittite dynasty , who had died on Egyptian soil .
All explanations were possible , yet Man E's true identity seemed destined to remain a mystery .
Hidden from the world for centuries , buried beneath the vast desert sands , the magnificent Deir El Bahri templre ( pictured ) where Man E , the ' screaming mummy ' , was discovered
As Dr Zahi Hawass , Secretary General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities , puts it , ' We 'd never seen a mummy like this , suffering .
It 's not normal , and it tells us something happened , but we did not know exactly what .'
Until now .
Today , nearly 130 years after his body was first uncovered , a team of scientists has brought the wonders of modern forensic techniques to bear on the enigma .
Using sophisticated - technology , including CT scanning , Xrays and facial reconstruction , to examine the mummy , they uncovered tantalising new clues that could reveal his identity , all under the watchful eye of Five 's TV crew , who are making a series of documentaries hoping to unravel some of Egypt 's great secrets .
Their findings suggest that Man E is indeed Prince Pentewere , elder son of Rameses III , who , with his mother , Tiy , had evolved a plan to assassinate the pharaoh and ascend to the throne .
Certainly , the theory has a number of supporters .
Among them is Dr Susan Redford , an Egyptologist from Pennsylvania State University , who points out that an ancient papyrus scroll details a plot by Tiy to dethrone Rameses III in favour of their son , even though he was not the nominated heir .
The plot was apparently supported by a number of high level courtiers , suggesting that they felt Pentewere had a legitimate claim , even though the accession was usually thought to be divinely ordained .
A wall painting of pharoah Rameses III .
The pharoah faced plots by his elder son Prince Pentewere and wife Tiy to dethrone him .
Some believe that Man E is Prince Pentewere
' The scroll tells us that the coup was very quickly discovered and the plotters brought to trial , ' she explained .
' They were sentenced to death , but the papyrus also tells us that Pentewere was spared this fate .
Perhaps because of his royal status he was allowed to commit suicide . '
He would almost certainly have done so , she says , by drinking poison .
Yet other findings from the 1886 postmortem seemed to dispute the body might be that of Pentewere .
It suggested that Man E had been buried with his internal organs intact , which was extraordinarily unusual , even for a traitor , and a boost to theories that the body had been mummified elsewhere at the time - or had not even been Egyptian at all .
Some academics believed that the body may have been that of a rival Hittite prince , basing their theory on a letter written by Tutankhamun 's widow Ankhesenamun .
The pharaoh died without leaving an heir and , in her letter , his wife had appealed to the then King of the Hittites that he allow her to marry one of his sons , who would become king and ensure her own continuing power .
Man E , some academics believed , was just such a prince , one who had travelled to Egypt to meet with his new bride and befallen a cruel and murderous fate .
Yet today 's forensic findings seemed to dispute this theory : a modern 3D scan showed the mummy had been completely eviscerated , as was customary for important Egyptians .
Studies :
The mummy 's remains undergo a 3D scan , which showed that the body was completely eviscerated , as his customary for important Egyptians
Moreover , new analysis of the condition of his joints and teeth also appeared to overturn earlier theories as to the mummy 's age at the time of death : Fouquet had believed him to be in his early 20s , too young for Pentewere .
Now , it seemed , he could have been anywhere up to the age of 40 , consistent again with Rameses ' son .
Equally revealing was a full facial reconstruction .
Using modern forensic techniques , a 3D image of Man E's skull was created , revealing what would have been a strong and handsome face , with a prominent nose and long jaw - features which do not correlate with a Hittite background .
Egyptians had a long lower face and an extended cranium from the forehead to the back of the head , as did Man E , suggesting he 's a ancient Egyptian .
There are , of course , still anomalies - the sheepskin covering , the unorthodox way the body was preserved without a name .
The passing of the centuries has ensured that some of the Screaming Man 's secrets are destined to remain unsolved , and as Dylan Bickerstaffe , an eminent Egyptologist , puts it , ' With some questions we found the answers to be more ordinary than we thought , ' he says .
' But we 've also answered others and found the answers to be much stranger . '
It is certainly enough to convince Dr Hawass , who now believes that this most enduring of Egyptian mysteries has been solved .
This article is part of a series describing a port of the samples from Practical Common Lisp ( PCL ) to Clojure .
You will probably want to read the intro first .
This article covers Chapter 5 , Functions .
Passing arguments to functions
One of the cool things about Common Lisp is the variety of ways to pass arguments to functions .
You can pass arguments
by position or by name
as a fixed or variable list
with preset defaults for some arguments
Clojure provides many of the same things , but the syntax is different .
Here is a function that takes two required arguments , and two optional arguments .
( defn foo [ a b & [ c d ] ] ( list a b c d ) )
Here are some examples of calling foo :
user= > ( foo 1 2 ) ( 1 2 nil nil ) user= > ( foo 1 2 3 4 ) ( 1 2 3 4 )
You can also pass values by name , using a map literal .
The function bar expects named arguments a and b .
The : or clause specifies a default for b :
( defn bar [{ : keys [ a b ] : or { b 10 }} ] ( list a b ) )
Examples of calling bar :
user= > ( bar { :a 1 } ) ( 1 10 ) user= > ( bar { :a 1 :b 2 } ) ( 1 2 )
Another nicety is defining an optional parameter 's default value in terms of another parameter .
Here is a Clojure approach that defaults height to width when creating a rectangle :
( defn make - rectangle ( [ width ] ( make - rectangle width width ) ) ( [ width height ] { : width width : height height } ) )
Usage :
user= > ( make - rectangle 20 ) { : width 20 , : height 20 } user= > ( make - rectangle 10 20 ) { : width 10 , : height 20 }
Corner cases
Common Lisp also supports discovering whether a user specified a parameter .
This comes in handy if you want to detect that the user re-specified the default for some parameter .
I did n't find a built - in way to do this in Clojure .
Here is one approach :
( defn which - args - supplied [{ : keys [ a b c ] : as all : or { c 4 }} ] ( let [ c-supplied ( contains ?
all :c ) ] ( list a b c c-supplied ) ) )
The :as : all collects the entire arguments list into all .
Then , I use contains ?
to detect whether the user specified a value for c .
Usage :
user= > ( which - args - supplied { :a 1 } ) ( 1 nil 4 false ) user= > ( which - args - supplied { :a 1 :c 4 } ) ( 1 nil 4 true )
If you wanted to make this feel more like Common Lisp , you could write a macro .
Common Lisp also supports a return - from macro to " return " from the middle of a function .
This encourages an imperative style of programming , which Clojure discourages .
However , you can solve the same problems in a different way .
Here is the return - from example , rewritten in a functional style so that no return - from is needed :
( defn pair - with - product - greater - than [ n ] ( take 1 ( for [ i ( range 10 ) j ( range 10 ) : when ( > ( * i j ) n ) ] [ i j ] ) ) )
Usage :
user= > ( pair - with - product - greater - than 30 ) ( [ 4 8 ] ) user= > ( pair - with - product - greater - than 50 ) ( [ 6 9 ] )
Dynamic invocation
To demonstrate funcall and apply , PCL uses a function to plot a histogram .
Clojure provides an equivalent apply .
The PCL version of plot also uses CL's loop .
Instead , I will use doseq and dotimes for looping :
( defn plot [ f min max step ] ( doseq i ( range min max step ) ( dotimes _ ( apply f [ i ] ) ( print " * " ) ) ( println ) ) )
The _ is idiomatic for " I do n't plan to use this value " .
In this case I want to do something n times , but the individual iterations do not need to know their ordinal .
With plot in place , we can plot any function of one argument , over any range .
( The usefulness of this is sharply limited by the horizontal resolution of your output device ) .
Some examples :
user= > ( plot #( Math / pow % 2 ) 1 5 1 ) * **** *********
**************** user= > ( plot identity 2 10 2 ) ** **** ****** ********
Wrapping up
No big surprises here .
Function invocation is flexible and powerful in Clojure .

With each passing day , Norm Coleman 's lead , currently 206 , slips further into obscurity as the final canvassing concludes .
No amount of crying , here , here and here , by Norm Coleman will change the fact that the final canvassing total often differs from the election night tally ; as evidenced in a document released by the Franken campaign .
If you want further evidence , a quick glance to our previous post , illustrates a perceived inequality with relation to the expected trend and the actual result .
Drawing from the table , Coleman may continue to bleed votes as these four northern counties continue to finalize their vote tally in preparation for the automatic recount .
But even if Franken cannot close the 206 vote advantage Norm Coleman currently holds , Franken may be able to make up ground in the undervotes .
Undervotes occur when the ballot reading optical scanner fails to record a vote in a given race , in this case the Senate race .
Using data provided by the Minnesota Secretary of State for the presidential and senate elections , I tabulated a massive grid with data from each of Minnesota 's 87 counties .
I took this data and calculated the discrepancy between Presidential votes and Senate votes , it turned out to be 24,830 ; in other words , 24,830 people cast a vote for President , but did not cast a machine defined vote in the Senatorial election .
This number represents a maximum number of undervotes that could possibly exist ( technically it could be more , but its statistically improbable ) ; in reality it is likely fewer .
There are three scenario's that could result in a vote being marked as an undervote by the optical scanner ; perhaps the person legitimately did not vote for a Senate candidate , there may have been a random malfunction or perhaps the voter failed to adequately mark their Minnesota ballot as depicted below :
The three above instances clearly demonstrate the intent to vote , but would still none the less be classified as undervotes .
It is these instances which could very well allow Franken to surpass Coleman upon the conclusion of these undervotes in the impending recount .
Using the previously collated data table , I concluded that there is a maximum of 18,328 undervotes present in counties won by Obama , but this is n't news , the Associated Press beat me to it , but I still have more to offer .
This tilt towards Obama translates into a rather large lead for Franken in counties that have a high number of undervotes .
If a uniform distribution of undervotes exists in each of Minnesota 's 87 counties and the current trend holds in each county , Franken could pull ahead if just slightly less than 40 % of the potential undervotes are infact undervotes .
Franken will likely win the recount if the trends hold and there are 9,848 undervotes evenly distributed across the state .
The other approach views a book collection less as a testimony to the past than as a repository for the future ; it ’s where you put the books you intend to read .
“ I like to keep something on my shelf for every mood that might strike , ” said Marisa Bowe , a nonprofit consultant and an editor of “ Gig : Americans Talk About Their Jobs . ”
At its most pragmatic , and with the aid of technology , this attitude can be breathtakingly ruthless .
Lisa Palac , a freelance writer , and Andrew Rice , a public relations executive , ultimately chose their beloved but snug house in Venice , Calif . , over their library .
“ We ’d been lugging these books around for years , and why ? ”
Palac wrote in an e-mail message .
Her husband said , “ Do we really need to keep that copy of ‘ The Scarlet Letter ’ from college on hand ?
I can order up another copy online and have it tomorrow if I need it . ”
They kept only one carton of books apiece , donating the rest to a fund - raising bazaar for their son ’s school .
Older people , curiously enough , seem to favor the less nostalgic approach .
When you ’re young and still constructing an identity , the physical emblems of your inner life appear more essential , and if you ’re single , your bookshelves provide a way of advertising your discernment to potential mates .
I ’ve met readers who have jettisoned whole categories of titles — theology , say , or poststructuralist theory — that they once considered desperately important .
Most of them express no regrets , although Nicholson Baker , who wrote an entire book protesting the “ weeding ” of books and periodicals from American libraries , still mourns the collection of science fiction paperbacks he discarded in his youth .
“ I ’m not good at it , ” Baker wrote in an e-mail message when asked about his own culling .
“ When I ’m doing research , I buy lots of used , out - of - print books , preferably with under­lining and torn covers .
I like watching them pile up on the stairs . ”
For the most part , I ’ve been pragmatic in my purging , and for years reference books were the most likely survivors .
I needed them for work , for those occasions when I suddenly had to know at what age Faulkner published “ Absalom , Absalom ” ( 39 ) or the name of the Greek muse of lyric poetry ( Euterpe ) .
Now the Internet can tell me all that .
Apart from the rare reference that ’s worth reading in its own right , like David Thomson ’s Biographical Dictionary of Film , these titles have been drifting away as the trust I ’m willing to put in Wikipedia gradually equalizes with the faith I ’ve invested in , say , Benet ’s Reader ’s Encyclopedia .
( It does n’t help that reference books tend to be shelf hogs . )
Nevertheless , most of the nonfiction I ’ve kept consists of books I ’ve already read and know I ’m likely to refer to in my own writing .
Richard Holmes ’s biography of Coleridge has come in handy for more than one project , as has Carol J. Clover ’s study of slasher films , “ Men , Women , and Chainsaws . ”
In fiction , on the other hand , apart from a few choice favorites , the list is weighted toward classics I optimistically plan to get around to someday .
Like John Irving , I hold one substantial unread Dickens novel ( “ Barnaby Rudge ” ) in reserve , for emergencies .
This method has its pitfalls .
The novelist Jonathan Franzen used to limit the unread books on his shelves to no more than 50 percent of the total .
“ The weight of those books seemed to represent a standing reproach to me of how little I was reading , ” he said in a phone interview .
“ I want to be surrounded by books I love , although now sometimes I worry that it ’s too familiar , what I see when I look around me , that it ’s become a sort of narcissistic mirror . ”
When it comes to novels , I ’m probably too sanguine about what my future can accommodate .
“ Eventually the truth hits home , ” Brian Drolet , a television producer in New York , told me .
“ As the actuarial tables advance , the number of books you ’ve got time to read diminishes . ”
Dr. Johnson once said of second marriages that they represent the triumph of hope over experience .
So , too , do my bookshelves .
I have turned out to be less rational about this than I thought , and have made my library into a charm against mortality .
As long as I have a few unread books beckoning to me from across the room , I tell myself I can always find a little more time .
( CNN ) --
In a blistering speech before the United Nations General Assembly , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed " a few bullying powers " for creating the world 's problems and said the " American empire in the world is reaching the end of its road . "
And while he insisted Iran 's nuclear activities are peaceful , Ahmadinejad blamed the same powers for seeking to hinder it " by exerting political and economic pressures on Iran , and threatening and pressuring " the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Those powers , meanwhile , are building or maintaining nuclear stockpiles themselves , unchecked by anyone , he said .
As Ahmadinejad spoke , the only person at the United States table was a note - taker ; no U.S. diplomat was present .
When President Bush spoke earlier Tuesday , however , Ahmadinejad was in the room .
CNN 's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour said Ahmadinejad 's comments were some of the most conciliatory he had made to the United States .
" As long as the aggressors , because of their financial , political and propaganda powers , not only escape punishment , but even claim righteousness , and as long as wars are started and nations are enslaved in order to win votes in elections , not only will the problems of the global community remain unsolved , but they will be increasingly exacerbated , " the Iranian leader said .
He accused the United States of oppressing Iraqis with six years of occupation , saying Americans were " still seeking to solidify their position in the political geography of the region and to dominate oil resources . "
Watch Ahmadinejad say the " American empire " is nearing " the end of its road " »
Meanwhile , he said , Palestinians have undergone " 60 years of carnage and invasion ... at the hands of some criminal and occupying Zionists . "
Watch Ahmadinejad blast U.S. , Israel , " bullying powers " »
He said Zionists in Israel " have forged a regime through collecting people from various parts of the world and bringing them to other people 's land , by displacing , detaining and killing the true owners of that land . "
The Security Council , he said , " cannot do anything , and sometimes under pressure from a few bullying powers , even paves the way for supporting these Zionist murders . "
He stopped short of calling for Israel to be politically wiped off the map as he has in the past .
He called for " a free referendum in Palestine for determining and establishing the type of state in the entire Palestinian lands . "
Ahmadinejad pointed to what he said are signs of hope , saying an increasing number of nations are turning their backs on " the bullying powers " and seeking to establish new relations .
" Today the Zionist regime is on a definite slope to collapse , " he said .
The Anti-Defamation League released a statement saying the Iranian leader showed he " is deeply infected with anti-Semitism " and displayed " the true threat the Iranian regime poses to Israel , the United States and the West . "
Hours before Ahmadinejad 's speech , Bush told the General Assembly that Iran was among the nations that " continue to sponsor terror . "
" Yet their numbers are growing fewer , and they 're growing more isolated from the world , " Bush said .
Bush also said U.N. members needed to enforce sanctions against Iran for failing to suspend its nuclear program , which the United States and other Western nations believe is intended to develop nuclear weapons .
Before Ahmadinejad spoke to the U.N. , he told CNN's Larry King that he is willing to meet with presidential candidates Sens.
John McCain and Barack Obama -- even in front of the media -- to discuss world issues and debate .
But he has no preference between the two , he said in the interview that aired Tuesday night on " Larry King Live . "
Watch Ahmadinejad discuss the role of the next U.S. president »
" We believe that these are issues relating to the domestic affairs of the United States , " Ahmadinejad told Larry King of the presidential race , according to a transcript of the interview .
" And decisions pertaining to that must be made by the American people .
And it's not important to us either , " Ahmadinejad said .
" What matters essentially is that the president that is chosen by the American people should adopt a path and a policy approach and for us to observe the policy approach .
" This is the campaign period , anyone can say anything .
So we disregard that .
What matters is that once someone is in office , we have to watch and see if that person will bring about some changes in policy or continue the same old path . "
Ahmadinejad was in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly meeting , which began Tuesday .
" I have said that , in fact , on this very trip , currently in New York , that I am ready to speak with the presidential candidates before the press , " he told Larry King .
" I believe that we 've really done whatever we could do in this respect . "
Watch Ahmadinejad say he 'd debate U.S. presidential candidates »
Asked whether he fears a U.S. attack , Ahmadinejad told King that attacking Iran would be the " worst thing the U.S. government can do ...
I think that in the United States , there are enough reasonable people , smart people , who would not allow the U.S. government to make such a big mistake . "
Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq , meanwhile , would be " the best scenario , " Ahmadinejad said .
" But I think that it needs a timetable ... the presence of the United States there has not reduced tension and it has not limited terrorism either .
In fact , it has increased terrorism . "
On hostility between the United States and Iran , Ahmadinejad told King : " The hostility has not been from our end .
Up to this day , we have always been interested in having friendly relations . "
Iran , he said later , " throughout history ... has demonstrated that it is a nation that is for peace and friendly with others . "
And he insisted Iran 's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes , despite Western nations ' concern to the contrary .
" Their concerns about us are not new , " he told King of the West .
" They 've always been concerned .
They were the ones who inspired Saddam [ Hussein ] to attack Iran and get us involved in an eight - year war .
The terrorist groups that killed our president , our prime minister , our officials , are now freely asked to live in the Western countries . "
The nuclear issue , he said , has been politicized and is not a legal struggle at all , noting the International Atomic Energy Agency , the U.N. 's nuclear watchdog group , has " not detected any noncompliance or deviation " on the part of Tehran .
Watch Ahmadinejad talk about nuclear weapons »
Ahmadinejad spoke extensively of Iran 's support for Palestinians .
The Iranian leader previously has made statements suggesting that Israel be politically " wiped off the map , " though he insists that can be accomplished without violence .
He has questioned the existence of the Holocaust , the genocidal Nazi campaign against European Jews , and warned Europeans that they may pay a heavy price for its support of Israel .
He insisted , however , that he and his country wish no harm to Jews .
" We have no problems with Jewish people , " he said .
" There are many Jews who live in Iran today ... but please pay attention to the fact that the Zionists are not Jews .
They have no religion ... they just have -- wear masks of religiosity .
How can you possibly be religious and occupy the land of other people ? "
Watch Ahmadinejad say he has no problems with Jews
On the Holocaust , he said an impartial group should research whether it happened as has been claimed .
" There is a claim that the extent of the calamity was what it was , " Ahmadinejad said .
" There are people who agree with it .
There are people who disagree . "
Ahmadinejad has also caused controversy by previously suggesting there were no homosexuals in Iran .
Regarding that statement , he told King : " I said it is not the way it is here .
In Iran this is considered a very -- obviously , most people dislike it .
And we have , actually , a law regarding it and the law is enforced . "
However , he said , " we do pay attention that in Iran nobody interferes in the private lives of individuals .
We have nothing to do with the private realm of people .
This is at the -- non-private , public morality .
In their own house , nobody ever interferes . "

[ Via Hack a Day
Going into town with my dad as a youngster there were three rows of ramshackle wooden buildings just on the edge of town .
When I was first old enough to notice them , they were vacant , sagging and weathered .
When I asked my dad what they were he told me they had been barracks for WPA workers .
He said they lived there while working on construction projects in the area , mainly roads , bridges and parks .
He also told me it was a program that helped turn the country around during the great depression .
It gave men jobs , three meals a day , a place to sleep and money to send home to their families .
It gave them hope and a sense of purpose .
But most of all , it restored their pride , something that had been sorely missing when unemployment was so high and people were forced to stand in soup lines .
The WPA , Works Progress Administration , was part of President Franklin Roosevelt ’s New Deal program to help the country out of the depression .
The goal of the WPA was to employ most of the unemployed people on relief until the economy recovered .
When Harry Hopkins , head of the WPA , testified before Congress on January 1935 , he estimated that 3.5 million people were on relief .
He asked for and received $ 4 billion for the project , which came to $ 1200 per worker per year .
Only one member per household was allowed in the program and then for only 30 hours per week .
This allowed more people to benefit from the program .
Between 1935 and 1943 the WPA provided almost 8 million jobs .
The program built many public buildings , projects and roads and operated large arts , drama , media and literacy projects .
It fed children and redistributed food , clothing and housing .
Almost every community in America has a park , bridge or school constructed by the agency .
Expenditures from 1936 to 1939 totaled nearly $ 7 billion .
( Jim Crouch , “ The Works Progress Administration )
Over the years I watched the buildings south of town slowly deteriorate .
They were never torn down , but eventually fell down .
I think people wanted them there as a reminder of how bad times had been , and how they had all survived .
After high school I went on to Iowa State University , a land - grant college and practically a museum for WPA art projects .
ISU benefited greatly from the branch of the WPA called The Federal Arts Project , which gave unemployed artists the opportunity to decorate hundreds of public buildings with murals , canvases and sculptures .
Iowa State ’s campus includes over 600 public works of art , including the largest public collection of sculptures by Christian Petersen , who was artist - in - residence there from 1934 to 1955 .
It also has the largest Grant Wood murals in the nation ; two WPA projects located in the library titled “ Breaking the Sod ” and “ When Tillage Begins , Other Arts Follow . ”
In part because of these wonderful sculptures and murals , ISU is rated as one of America ’s 25 most beautiful campuses .
I can still remember the enormous Grant Wood mural covering one entire wall in the library and the beautiful Petersen sculptures scattered all around the campus , including a stunning fountain in front of the Memorial Union Building .
Of course I did n’t appreciate then as much as I should have , but then , what college student does ?
There was also a beautiful park outside of Ames , Iowa that was built entirely by WPA crews .
There were stone walkways , hiking paths , streams , waterfalls and picnic areas .
All the trees and landscaping had been done by WPA also .
It was one of my favorite retreats when I was in college .
Another novel special program of the WPA was The Federal Writers Project , which prepared state and regional guidebooks , organized archives , indexed newspapers , and conducted sociological and historical investigations .
The Federal Theatre Project sent scores of stock companies touring the country with old and new plays , bringing drama to communities where it had only been known through the radio .
Also through the Arts Project , musicians organized symphony orchestras and community singing .
( Encyclopedia of American History )
By March 1936 , the WPA rolls had reached a total of more than 3,400,000 persons ; after initial cuts in June 1939 , it averaged 2,300,000 monthly ; and by June 30 , 1943 , when it was officially terminated , the WPA had employed more than 8,500,000 different persons on 1,410,000 individual projects , and had spent about $ 11 billion .
During its 8 - year history , the WPA built 651,087 miles of highways , roads , and streets ; and constructed , repaired , or improved 124,031 bridges , 125,110 public buildings , 8,192 parks , and 853 airport landing fields .
( Encyclopedia of American History )
Maybe it ’s time to resurrect the idea of the WPA .
Dust off these old ideas and refurbish them as well as the projects they serviced .
Our neglected infrastructure has begun to crumble .
We need to develop new energy sources that could create entirely new jobs .
There are still rural areas in this country that desperately need better roads , housing and schools .
And it certainly would n’t hurt to bring additional literacy and arts to these same repressed areas .
Granted , our economy is different than it was 70 years ago , but think about it ; in seven years with $ 11 billion the WPA restored the lives of 8,500,000 people as well as their families .
The WPA literally changed the landscape of America .
The entire country benefited in one - way or another from the WPA projects .
Why do we continue to pump billions of dollars into financial institutions that are showing no accountability for what they are given and continue to ask for more ?
A.I.G. just asked for another $ 150 billion in government assistance on top of the $ 85 billion they already received .
And by the way , A.I.G. executives had another “ retreat ” at a luxury resort in AZ this past week .
I guess causing your company to fail and then getting money from the government is exhausting .
They take our tax dollars and go on a luxury retreat while we taxpayers just have to retreat .

On Sunday morning , February 17 , 2008 , the skies above Shiveluch Volcano in Russia ’s Far East were clear and calm .
When the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ( ASTER ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite passed overhead , it caught this view of a column of ash from a recent eruption seemingly frozen in the air over the mountain .
The southern slopes of the snow - covered volcano were brown with ash .
The top image in this pair shows a close - up view of the ash column , which rises over the volcano to the east ( right ) of the active caldera .
The bottom image shows the entire volcano .
In this view , the shadow of the ash column looms over the northern flank of the volcano .
Shiveluch ( sometimes spelled Sheveluch ) is among the largest and most active of the dozens of volcanoes that sit on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia ’s Far East .
The mountain has a rugged and complicated structure .
The northern part of the volcano is called “ Old Shiveluch , ” a stratovolcano that was active in the late Pleistocene Epoch ( the Ice Age ) .
In the Holocene Epoch ( the modern geological time period ) , activity shifted toward a more southern summit , called “ Young Shiveluch . ”
The bowl - shaped , shadow - filled feature to the left of the ash column is the crater , or caldera , of Young Shiveluch , where most eruptive activity takes place today .
Shiveluch is the northernmost of the active volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula .
The peninsula is along the convergent boundary of two slabs of the Earth ’s crust : the Okhotsk Plate to the west and the Pacific Plate to the east .
Just offshore of the Kamchatka Peninsula is an impossibly deep trench in the ocean floor where the Pacific Plate is diving ( subducting ) beneath the Okhotsk Plate .
This trench , known as the Kuril - Kamchatka Trench reaches depths of more than 10,500 meters ( more than 6.5 miles ) .
The Pacific Plate is sliding below the Okhotsk Plate at about 9 - 10 centimeters per year .
This subduction produces frequent earthquakes and explosive volcanic eruptions on the Kamchatka Peninsula .

Russian warships approached Venezuela Monday for upcoming joint maneuvers -- Moscow 's first military presence in the region since the Cold War -- as Washington closely monitored the situation .
Venezuelan defense officials said the ships , including the nuclear - powered cruiser Peter the Great and destroyer Admiral Chabankenko , would arrive on Tuesday .
The joint exercises were to coincide with a two - day visit by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to Venezuela , the strongest US critic in the region .
Medvedev was due to arrive Wednesday and meet fiercely anti-liberal President Hugo Chavez on Thursday , before heading to communist Cuba .
Analysts see Medvedev as bringing a defiant message to Washington 's doorstep , in the wake of Russian outrage at US plans to install a strategic missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic , and support for the brief Georgia war in August .

Eating enough omega - 3 fatty acids is twice as important for boosting the brainpower of girls as it is for boys .
Several studies have upheld the link between intelligence and higher consumption of omega - 3 fats , especially those found in fatty fishes such as salmon .
William Lassek at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and Steve Gaulin at the University of California , Santa Barbara , wondered whether this effect might be even stronger in girls because women not only use omega - 3 fats to build their brains , they also store them on their hips and thighs in preparation for …

Even better , the McCain campaign blames Jenna ’s pastor ’s comments on Obama ( because Obama is now somehow responsible for McCain cheating on his first wife ?
– that ’s a new one ) , and McCain calls these “ disgraceful person attacks . ”
Really ?
First off , it was Evangelical leader Rick Warren who seemingly alluded to McCain ’s adultery in the past 24 hours , while speaking to ABC ’s Jake Tapper .
And it was God himself , I believe , who included the admonition against adultery in Leviticus , so unless Rick Warren and God are working on the Obama campaign and nobody told us …
In any case , accusations about disgraceful personal attacks from the people who have repeatedly suggested that Obama is un-American , hates the troops , and wants America to lose a war , an accusation with vaguely racist undertones , and have injected race into their TV commercials , a point noticed by at least one mainstream national network correspondent – now that ’s rich .
So tell us again how pure as snow McCain is .
But to top even that , an unnamed Republican consultant says that we ’d better not talk about McCain ’s adulterous affair he had with Cindy while married to his wife ( McCain ’s first wife was in a terrible accident , physically deformed as a result , and McCain was “ repulsed ” by her and ended up cheating on her , then leaving her for his mistress who was rich and 17 years his junior ) because then the Republicans might start talking about Rev. Wright and Tony Rezko .
Are you freaking kidding me ?
Oh so you mean the Republicans wo n’t bring up Wright and Rezko , they ’ll play nice , so long as we are n’t mean to McCain .
How stupid do you think we are ?
First off , McCain already brought up Rev. Wright , so spare us the implication that he has n’t yet .
Secondly , you ’ve been accusing Obama of hating his country for weeks ( Joe Klein at TIME said it was so sleazy of you that it showed that McCain has a “ character defect ” ) , Dick Cheney ’s former aide just had a book published with anti-Semitic undertones and racist attacks on Obama again calling him a Muslim , and now you expect us to believe that McCain and the Republicans wo n’t go into the gutter unless we provoke you ?!
And today the Republican party is bringing back the “ bitter ” comments .
LOL
These people are incredible .
The gutter would be a step up for the McCain campaign at this point , and everyone in the media has noticed it and berated them for it for weeks .
McCain lied about Obama ’s trip to Afghanistan , he lied about Obama ’s comments about fuel efficiency ( and the lie is still on McCain ’s home page ) , and the list goes on and on .
McCain , the guy who hired Karl Rove ’s deputy to inject some sleaze into his own lifeless campaign , is now worried about us going negative .
That ’s just precious .
I really think the McCain campaign has completely fallen off their rocker .
It ’s as if McCain is no longer running the campaign , or even aware of what his deputies are saying , it ’s all just so bizarre .
But the notion that the Republicans will play nice if we do – seriously , you got a bridge to sell too ?
Scientists from Maastricht University have developed a method to look into the brain of a person and read out who has spoken to him or her and what was said .
With the help of neuroimaging and data mining techniques the researchers mapped the brain activity associated with the recognition of speech sounds and voices .
In their Science article " ' Who ' is Saying ' What ' ?
Brain - Based Decoding of Human Voice and Speech , " the four authors demonstrate that speech sounds and voices can be identified by means of a unique ' neural fingerprint ' in the listener 's brain .
In the future this new knowledge could be used to improve computer systems for automatic speech and speaker recognition .
Seven study subjects listened to three different speech sounds ( the vowels /a/ , /i/ and /u / ) , spoken by three different people , while their brain activity was mapped using neuroimaging techniques ( fMRI ) .
With the help of data mining methods the researchers developed an algorithm to translate this brain activity into unique patterns that determine the identity of a speech sound or a voice .
The various acoustic characteristics of vocal cord vibrations ( neural patterns ) were found to determine the brain activity .
Just like real fingerprints , these neural patterns are both unique and specific : the neural fingerprint of a speech sound does not change if uttered by somebody else and a speaker 's fingerprint remains the same , even if this person says something different .
Moreover , this study revealed that part of the complex sound - decoding process takes place in areas of the brain previously just associated with the early stages of sound processing .
Existing neurocognitive models assume that processing sounds actively involves different regions of the brain according to a certain hierarchy : after a simple processing in the auditory cortex the more complex analysis ( speech sounds into words ) takes place in specialised regions of the brain .
However , the findings from this study imply a less hierarchal processing of speech that is spread out more across the brain .
The research was partly funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research ( NWO ) :
Two of the four authors , Elia Formisano and Milene Bonte carried out their research with an NWO grant ( Vidi and Veni ) .
The data mining methods were developed during the PhD research of Federico De Martino ( doctoral thesis defended at Maastricht University on 24 October 2008 ) .
Glenn Greenwald and friends crashed AT&T 's lavish do at the DNC in Denver to see who got invited to the secretive party thrown to thank Democratic operators for getting AT&T off the hook on the charges it faced of abetting the Bush administration with its illegal warrantless bulk - surveillance program .
None of the attendees would speak to them , but they 're on video , so maybe we can identify them and figure out who AT&T owns in the Democratic party .
Armed with full - scale Convention press credentials issued by the DNC , I went — along with Firedoglake 's Jane Hamsher , John Amato , Stoller and others — in order to cover the event , interview the attendees , and videotape the festivities .
There was a wall of private security deployed around the building , and after asking where the press entrance was , we were told by the security officials , after they consulted with event organizers , that the press was barred from the event , and that only those with invitations could enter — notwithstanding the fact that what was taking place in side was a meeting between one of the nation 's largest corporations and the numerous members of the most influential elected faction in Congress .
As a result , we stood in front of the entrance and began videotaping and trying to interview the parade of Blue Dog Representatives , AT&T executives , assorted lobbyists and delegates who pulled up in rented limousines , chauffeured cars , and SUVs in order to find out who was attending and why AT&T would be throwing such a lavish party for the Blue Dog members of Congress .
Amazingly , not a single one of the 25 - 30 people we tried to interview would speak to us about who they were , how they got invited , what the party 's purpose was , why they were attending , etc .
One attendee said he was with an " energy company , " and the other confessed she was affiliated with a " trade association , " but that was the full extent of their willingness to describe themselves or this event .
It was as though they knew they 're part of a filthy and deeply corrupt process and were ashamed of — or at least eager to conceal — their involvement in it .
After just a few minutes , the private security teams demanded that we leave , and when we refused and continued to stand in front trying to interview the reticent attendees , the Denver Police forced us to move further and further away until finally we were unable to approach any more of the arriving guests .
Update : Facebook responds , offers advice on dealing with Spam .
Myspace really started going downhill when it was overtaken by spammers pushing Macy ’s giftcards .
The problem even got so bad that they ended up collecting over $ 200 million in statutory damages from two of the responsible spammers .
Personally , I stopped using Myspace almost entirely when I started getting more spam messages than real one ’s , sometime in late 2006 .
I ca n’t help but wonder how many million other social networkers switched to Facebook for the same reason .
Here is the typical Macy ’s spam that caused so many problems for Myspace :
So far Facebook has done a great job avoiding a similar fate .
While many applications on FB are annoying and could be used for nefarious purposes , it has n’t been much of a problem so far .
I ’ve feared for a while that spammers would find a way to invade Facebook in much the same way .
When I signed on this morning , here is what I saw :
Hopefully Facebook is not overwhelmed by Macy ’s ( and other ) spam in the same way Myspace was .
Today ’s development is not encouraging .
Ratings are down .
Criticism is up .
Two years after its ratings peak , '' Heroes ' ' has become a series under siege .
Here 's our five - point plan to give the supernatural drama its powers back
Heroes ( TV series ) type TV Show genre Superhero
The scene : a cozy New York apartment on the L.A. set of Heroes in August , where an ordinary man trying very hard not to become an extraordinary monster pops the cork on a champagne bottle .
” The ziti smells terrific ! ” says Gabriel Gray ( Zachary Quinto ) , calling out to the woman who ’s minutes away from damning him to his predestined future as a brain - mutilating serial killer .
Her name is Elle ( Kristen Bell ) , and not only does she emerge from the kitchen sporting a Betty Crocker smile and holding the aforementioned Italian casserole , she also promises him a tasty side dish — in the form of a scruffy dinner guest who possesses a secret power .
” He ’s special too , ” she coos .
It ’s all part of a pivotal Heroes flashback episode airing Nov. 10 , which tells the origin stories of the series ’ key supervillains , including Gabriel / Sylar .
Watching the cast and crew , it is clear they ’re laboring hard to make the fantasy feel real and unique .
” I want to do something different , ” Quinto tells director Allan Arkush as they refine a fight sequence .
” I think I want to rip my glasses off . ”
The work seems to pay off :
By afternoon ’s end , Quinto & Co. have concocted a clever , creepy scene , worthy of Heroes at its very best .
But how many of you will still be around to watch it ?
That ’s the urgent question facing Heroes and several other returning shows that have found themselves struggling to regain their audiences after being out of sight , out of mind for as long as nine months — a consequence of not coming back last spring following the writers ’ strike .
The show is now averaging only 9.4 million viewers , down from last year ’s 11.6 million average .
And the Oct. 6 episode notched its lowest number ever at 8.2 million viewers — a far cry from its peak performance of 16 million in season 1 .
But not all the news is bad : Season 3 ’s first two episodes averaged 3.1 million DVR viewers over seven days , a jump of 5 percent from last fall .
And while the drama has taken a tumble in overall viewers , it ranks eighth — same as last season — in the advertiser - coveted 18 - 49 demo .
Heroes may no longer be a pop culture phenomenon , but it is still a good , though not great , performer for NBC .
Problem is , good might not be good enough .
To hear series creator Tim Kring tell it , Heroes needs to be — or , at least , needs to be seen as — zeitgeist - tapping , blockbuster event television in order to remain viable .
As Kring told EW in September : ” Looking at the state of serialized TV , the shows that succeed are rare .
You wait months for [ shows like Lost and The Sopranos ] to come back , and when they do , there ’s a smaller amount [ of episodes ] , which makes them feel special .
It ’s hard to stay special if you ’re on all the time . ”
To keep Heroes buzzy , Kring last season adopted a strategy of dividing each season into shorter ” volumes , ” which he hoped would ” build toward exciting finales and create excitement in between story lines . ”
Yet has the third - volume Heroes met Kring ’s own criteria for vitality ?
Many critics and fans do n’t think so .
” Villains , ” now at its midpoint , has embroiled its core characters — including time - traveling Hiro Nakamura ( Masi Oka ) , power sponge Peter Petrelli ( Milo Ventimiglia ) , and quick - healing Claire Bennet ( Hayden Panettiere ) — in a comic - bookish yarn about a prison break of mutant baddies and a mystery menace aspiring to unleash superpowered anarchy upon the world .
The episodes have certainly addressed many complaints about Heroes ‘ poorly received second season :
The pace is quicker , the premise has been clearly established , and most of the characters have been plugged into the central arc .
Unfortunately , though , last year ’s bugs have been replaced by new ones .
And they must be stopped .
NBC ’s No. 2 drama wo n’t ever reclaim its status as a ratings powerhouse , but it can regain its creative glory — provided producers start fixing things now .
In order to speed things along , we present our five - point plan to save Heroes … from itself .

Vetting blunders label 12,000 innocent people as paedophiles , violent thugs and thieves
Mistaken identity : The CRB has labelled more than 12,200 innocent people as paedophiles and thieves ( picture posed by model )
More than 12,200 innocent people have been branded criminals by bungling police and Government officials , it has been revealed .
The incorrect records showing them to be paedophiles , violent thugs or other convicts were disclosed to schools , hospitals , nurseries and voluntary groups by the Criminal Records Bureau .
The extent of the misreporting is four times worse than officials had suggested .
Those wrongly accused by the CRB face having their careers blighted .
They also have to go through an appeals process to clear their names .
By the time that has finished , they may have been stigmatised and their chance of obtaining a job or training post dashed - disclosures are sent to the potential employee and the applicant on the same day .
The CRB 's annual report indicates that only 680 inaccurate disclosures were made last year - fewer than two each day .
But figures seen by the Daily Mail reveal there were 2,785 last year .
That is almost eight trainee teachers , nurses or childminders waking up each day to find a letter on their doormat wrongly branding them an offender .
Since 2003 - 2004 , more than 12,200 have been wrongly stigmatised as criminals .
They contested their cases , and were proved to be right .
Figures obtained by Tory MP Mike Penning show that , in some years , virtually every contested disclosure was found to be inaccurate .
In 2005 - 2006 , 2,669 disputes were upheld , out of 2,675 that were contested .
The CRB , an arm of the Home Office , was set up in 2002 to vet those working with children or vulnerable people .
It carries out checks on criminal convictions , cautions and reprimands .
An enhanced check also examines any other ' relevant and proportionate ' information held by police forces .
The CRB had been effectively covering up the scale of the problem by only making public those mistakes for which its staff were personally responsible .
It had not been releasing details of disclosures containing inaccuracies supplied to the CRB by other public bodies - most notably the police - then subsequently disclosed in the agency 's name .
Mistakes have included people having convictions wrongly attributed to their name because of a mistake by staff entering information into the Police National Computer .
' Soft intelligence ' - such as the never - proved suspicion that a person has been linked to a crime - has also been inaccurately or wrongly disclosed .
Shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve said : ' The increase in the number of incorrect disclosures is disturbing .
These are mistakes that risk ruining people 's lives . '
Phil Booth , of the NO2ID privacy campaign , said : ' One mistake in the system and your whole life can go down the pan .
You are officially tagged a criminal when you have done nothing wrong . '
The number of vetting checks is being expanded .
From next autumn , more than 11 million adults - one in four of the adult population in England - will have to be vetted and registered on the Independent Safeguarding Authority 's database .
They will be forced to pay £ 64 each for background checking .
A CRB spokesman said : ' In the last four years , CRB checks have prevented 80,000 unsuitable people from working with vulnerable groups .
' Of around 3.3 million checks conducted by the CRB last year , over 99.91 per cent were issued correctly .
' While any disputes are clearly regrettable , the percentage of disputes upheld as a total of the number of disclosures issued has fallen for the last three years . '
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Wall Street slumped Thursday , with the S&P 500 plunging to an 11 - 1 / 2 year low as fears of a prolonged recession sparked a massive selloff .
Treasury prices rallied as investors sought the comparative safety of government debt .
The dollar was mixed versus other major currencies .
Oil prices plunged
The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index lost 6.7 % and closed at its lowest point sine April 14 , 1997 .
The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled ( INDU ) 5.6 % and the Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) slumped 5.1 % .
Both the Dow and Nasdaq closed at their lowest points since March 12 , 2003 , which was just above the low of the last bear market .
The Dow has lost 872 points , or 10.4 % , over the last two sessions .
It saw a bigger two - day point drop in the two sessions after the presidential election , but it had n't seen either two - day percentage drops since October 1987 , according to Dow Jones .
Stocks slipped through the early afternoon following miserable readings on the labor market and manufacturing sector .
The major gauges briefly bounced after hitting fresh 5 - 1/ 2 year lows .
But the recovery attempt dissolved as Congress haggled over the fate of the automakers and Citigroup led the bank stocks sharply lower .
" It was pretty brutal , " said Phil Orlando , chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors .
He said the market is at a critical point , with the S&P having " tested " or closed below the lows of the previous bear market .
Investors will be looking closely at the next few sessions to see if stocks can hold those key levels .
Since peaking at an all - time closing high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9 , 2007 , the S&P 500 has lost 52 % .
The Dow has lost nearly 47 % since closing at an all - time high of 14,164.53 on the same day .
Since hitting a bull market high of 2,859.12 on Oct. 31 , 2007 , the Nasdaq has lost 54 % .
" The wealth destruction is phenomenal , " said Tom Schrader , managing director at Stifel Nicolaus .
Orlando said that the economic news Thursday morning and over the last few months has been pretty uniformly dreadful .
Investors are looking at probably three consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth , from the third quarter of this year through the first quarter of next .
The current quarter , the fourth , is expected to be the worst .
" We 're going to hit an inflection point where the economy improves , but no one believes it yet , " Orlando said .
He said that typically in a recession , the stock market bottoms when it perceives the slowdown is about halfway or three - quarters of the way through .
Investors decided they 've had enough and start pushing stocks higher before the news improves .
But this time around , investors will need to see the evidence first .
In the week ended Wed. Nov. 19 , investors pulled roughly $ 19.5 billion out of equity mutual funds , according to tracking friim Trim Tabs .
In the previous week , invesotrs pulled $ 31.8 billion out of funds .
Investors have now cashed out of funds in 16 of the last 17 weeks .
After the close Thursday , Dell ( DELL , Fortune 500 ) reported better - than - expected earnings and worse - than - expected revenue .

GM shares bounced Thursday afternoon after hitting the lowest level since the Great Depression .
Ford Motor shares also bounced after hitting lows .
On Thursday , General Motors ' finance arm GMAC said it has filed to become a bank holding company , in a bid to tap into the $ 700 billion bank bailout .
GM was the only Dow component to advance in Thursday 's session .

Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) shares plunged 26.4 % .
The move follows the U.S. government 's decision to inject $ 25 billion into the bank .
Earlier this week , Citi said it was cutting over 50,000 of its staff as a means of cutting costs heading into what is expected to be a rough 2009 .

As readers of the blog know , my undergraduate teacher and mentor was Dr. Hans Sennholz .
The days we are living through right now are the days he taught his students about in his lectures and in his books , such as Age of Inflation ( 1979 , rev ed 2006 ) and Money and Freedom ( 1985 ) .
Sennholz was a critic of the world fiat currency system .
And in other books , such as Debts and Deficits ( 1987 ) Sennholz analyzed how fiscal imbalances and monetary irresponsibility went hand in hand .
Sennholz was a passionate defender of the teachings of the classical economists and the Austrian school of economics .
As a second semester junior and throughout my senior year , I was fortunate to be invited to his " graduate seminar " where the students ( mostly from Argentina ) that were earning their advanced degree from the International College under Sennholz would meet to discuss economics ( Wednesday nights ) .
We read Adam Smith , David Ricardo , J. B. Say , John Stuart Mill , Carl Menger , Eugen Bohm - Bawerk , and Ludwg von Mises through the course of the year .
We discussed methodology , economic method , and public policy .
It was a great opportunity for me -- not yet a serious student , but still afforded the opportunity to be part of serious scholarly endeavors and witness it without the same expectations that the graduate students faced .
I witneessed dissertation defenses and master thesis presentations in addition to our seminar discussions .
I just had to " wear a proper pair of trousers " ( I was normally either in doctor pants , sweat pants , or shorts none of which were acceptable to Dr. Senhholz ) and " keep up with reading " or as Sennholz characteristically explained " they will kick me out . "
I had a wonderful undergraduate experience at Grove City College ---
I was President of my fraternity ( and all that implies ) , I was a co-captain of the tennis team ( and we were very successful ) , I was dating my future wife and life partner , and I found my " calling " with economic argument and a career as a professional academic economist .
In short , professionally " I wanted to be like Hans " .
Why did this man have such a powerful influence over me ?
I think he was a great teacher of economics and he made the discipline come alive in a way that few teachers can do .
He spoke with a sense of urgency about the truth content of economics .
Listening to him made me want to read , and what I read made me want to listen even more carefully .
If a young student had any interest in economics , it would be hard for me to imagine a better " reading course " than I was exposed to at GCC designed by Dr. Sennholz --- first read Henry Hazlitt and Frederic Bastiat , then read Mises and Sennholz , then an indepth reading of the classics I listed above , and then a return to reading Mises , Hayek , Kirzner , Lachmman and Rothbard .
I might not have been as prepared as others entering graduate school for conventional economics ---
I had read Mansfield 's Microeconomics for intermediate , but my exposure to macroeconomics was reading Keynes ( not a textbook ) and Galbraith and Friedman .
Nor did I have formal course work in econometrics or mathematical economics as an undergraduate .
No , Sennholz had designed the major at GCC to include a year long history of thought sequence , and requirements in symbolic logic , as well as the economics courses which included principles , intermediate micro , contemporary ( which in essence was intermediate macro ) , comparative , labor , and economic history .
Sennholz 's courses ( I took everyone he offered , including futures trading ) were mainly discussions of the main policy debates that followed from economic theory --- thus as I wrote in an essay honoring him many years ago now " relevance was a virtue " in his approach to economics .
Before I graduated I had read in economics not just the pro market side , but also critics of the mainline of economic teachings such as Malthus , Marx , Veblen , Keynes , and Galbraith , and not just Austrians but also Friedman , Stigler , and Buchanan on the market oriented side of the contemporary debates .
And we read original sources , not textbooks .
I did have courses in probability and statistics and calculus , but they were not tied to my economics major ; just as I took several courses in philosophy and religion as part of my course of study .
Whatever I lacked in background for studying economic modeling and measuring , I more than made up for in my understanding of economic philosophy , public policy , and the writing up of economic argumentation .
This helped me because I understood the intuition of economics and what the modeling exercises were trying to capture and why it mattered for the underlying debates in economic theory and public policy .
And as Dave or Steve can attest to , we became obsessed with economics in graduate school --- including technical economics --- but from this perspective of getting at the underlying intuition ( Dave remember the joy we had with Mike Alexeev and general equilibrium theory ?
I am serious .
Do you remember my presentation of Abraham Wald and the debates in the 1920s and 1930s on existence and stability ?
Or my paper on Stigler and Becker and utility theory ) .
As strange as it may seem given his extreme opposition to formalism , it was Dr. Sennholz who turned me on to the study of economic theory , and the urgency of getting the theory right in order to get the world of practical affairs right .
Well , today I stumbled upon a talk of his from right after I graduated from GCC in 1983 .
Thanks to the Mises Institute Media Project , you can see Dr. Sennholz discuss the monetary writings of Carl Menger .
I remember hearing a version of this lecture at GCC .
I think you can see in this lecture both his engaging style , but also this point about the urgency of the truth content I was stressing above , and also the connection between theory and practical policy which Sennholz always taught .
Bad theory results in bad policy ; good theory guides good policy .

If you want to make changes to a single image , such as resizing or converting from one file format to another , then you 'll probably load up the image in an editor and manually make the required changes .
This approach is great for a single image , but it does n't really scale past more than a few images , at which point it becomes time consuming , not to mention boring !
This is where Python and the Python Imaging Library ( or PIL ) come in , allowing you to write scripts that process images in batch .
The PNG2GIF converter I wrote back in August is just one example of batch image processing using Python and PIL .
In this post I 'm going to explore some other uses , and provide lots of example code .
Batch Processing
No matter what processing we want to do on our images the script outline will be the same : loop over all provided arguments , and perform the processing .
The code to do this is shown below :
#!/usr/bin/env python import sys import Image #
Loop through all provided arguments for i in range ( 1 , len ( sys . argv ) ) : try : #
Attempt to open an image file filepath = sys .
argv [ i ] image = Image .
open ( filepath ) except IOError , e : # Report error , and then skip to the next argument print " Problem opening " , filepath , " : " , e continue # Perform operations on the image here
This will allow our script to be called in all of the following ways :
batch_process.py image.gif batch_process.py image1.png image2.gif image3.jpg batch_process.py *.png batch_process.py image1.gif , *.png
Processing
With the help of PIL the image processing is really simple .
Below is a collection of just some of the operations we could perform .
For more details see the PIL documentation .
# Resize an image image = image .
resize ( ( width , height ) , Image .
ANTIALIAS ) # Convert to greyscale image = image .
convert ( ' L ' ) #
Blur image = image .
filter ( ImageFilter .
BLUR ) # Sharpen image = image .
filter ( ImageFilter .
SHARPEN )
Saving
Once we 've processed the image we need to save the changes .
In some instances we might just want to save over the original filename .
If that 's the case we can just call the save method of image with its original filename .
If we want to save the file under a different name , or as a different filetype we need to do a little more work :
# Split our original filename into name and extension ( name , extension ) = os .
path .
splitext ( filepath ) #
Save with " _changed " added to the filename image .
save ( name + ' _changed ' + extension ) #
Save the image as a JPG image .
save ( name + '. jpg ' )
Notice in the last example how PIL takes care of the conversion to JPG for us .
All we do is provide the file extension and PIL does the rest for us .
A Complete Example

The multi-million dollar 1000 Genomes project is set to be finished in a year .
The same but different .
The 1000 Genomes project aims to catalogue human genetic variation .
Punchstock
An almost complete catalogue of human genetic variation could be available by the end of 2009 , thanks to a massive genome sequencing project that includes academic and industrial partners around the world .
Announcing completion of the pilot phase of the 1000 Genomes project , the project 's co-chair David Altshuler said last week that it has already successfully catalogued 3.8 trillion bases of sequence — approximately a thousand times the number found in a single human genome .
Speaking at the annual meeting for the American Society of Human Genetics in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , Altshuler predicated that the data should be deposited in GenBank , the US National Institutes of Health database for genetic sequences , within the next two months .
But that 's only around a tenth of the total amount of data the project aims to rack up by the time it has finished .
" One thing we 're good at is having ambitious goals , " said Alan Guttmacher , interim director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute ( NHGRI ) , one of the organizations funding the project — the final cost of which could reach US $ 50 million .
Variations on a theme
The sequencing initiative is a direct descendant of efforts to sequence the human genome that started in the 1990s .
Soon after the announcement of the genome 's first draft in 2000 , a drive to map all common genetic variations between people began .
This effort , known as the International HapMap Project , produced a reference guide of hundreds of millions of single - letter differences among people , which could be used to quickly compare genomes without directly sequencing them .
Versions of this map have been used in genome - wide association studies during recent years to find genetic variants that are associated with common diseases , and could point to ways of predicting or even treating those diseases .
But the HapMap details only the most common genetic variants — those that occur in more than 1 in 20 people — and contains little information on rare single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) or on so - called structural variants , such as large block deletions or duplications of gene sequence , which seem to be important in some diseases .
This is where 1000 Genomes comes in , says Altshuler , who is also a professor of genetics and medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston , Massachusetts .
" Next - generation sequencing makes it possible to examine a different part of the allele spectrum , " he said .
By fully sequencing some 1,200 people from various ethnic groups around the world and looking at parent–child trios alongside data from other sequencing projects , 1000 Genomes hopes to capture rarer genetic variations — namely , those that occur in fewer than 5 % and more than 1 % of people and some that occur at even smaller frequencies .
The work comparing parents and their children could help scientists to get better estimates of the individual mutation rate from generation to generation .
" We 'll get an unparalleled view of human genetic variation , " says Richard Durbin of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge , UK , and the other co-chair of 1000 Genomes .
Getting personal
The 1000 Genomes project will contain no detailed demographic or medical information about the people being sequenced so that data can be shared without the need for complicated consent procedures .
Meanwhile , another major sequencing effort — the Personal Genome Project , headed by George Church of Harvard Medical School — aims to provide full sequences with medical and personal information for up to 100,000 subjects .
Although its goals are less centred on uncovering variation , the Personal Genome Project , together with 1000 Genomes and several other projects looking at genetic variation , will significantly increase the amount of available DNA data for analysis .
The pilot phase of the 1000 Genomes project , which sequenced more than 180 individuals , has identified 4 million SNPs , 22 % of which seem to be previously undiscovered .
These data will be released in December and January , and quarterly releases are expected throughout 2009 up to the completion of the data - collection phase at the end of next year .
But the near - petabyte levels of data to be collected ( by some estimates ) pose significant challenges for storage and accessibility , as well as the analysis and usability of the data , says David Haussler , who leads the genome bioinformatics group at the University of California , Santa Cruz .
In a nod to this need , the NHGRI announced this month that it will make up to $ 14 million available during the next two years for data handling and analysis for the project .
In search of ' dark matter '
Once a better catalogue of variation is complete , it could be used to power the next generation of genome - wide association studies to understand disease , potentially filling in some of the so - called missing heritability ( see ' Personal genomes :
The case of the missing heritability ' ) – the genetic markers for traits or diseases that current association studies have been unable to find .
These missing genetic variants have been called the genome 's ' dark matter ' .
But some believe that the rare variants that 1000 Genomes aims to turn up may not provide useful information about disease .

" 1000 Genomes will be hugely useful for growing the technology to generate and analyse sequence data , " says David Goldstein of Duke University in Durham , North Carolina , adding " But in terms of a catalogue of the variants most important to human biology and disease , it 's less clear how important it will be . "
Goldstein advocates sequencing people with extreme presentations of disease to understand more about common disease pathways .
Altshuler disagrees with Goldstein but is also cautious .
" None of us imagines that we will explain 100 % of disease heritability when this is finished , nor will there be drugs in the clinic immediately . "
Geneticists , however , are excited about the prospect of exploring DNA 's dark matter in a year 's time .
" I do n't think it 's going to be dark matter for too long , " said David Valle , a clinical geneticist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore , Maryland .
" When the light comes , I think we 're going to find some interesting biology . "
There 's no love lost between open access PLoS ( Public Library of Science ) and print journals .
Nature does n't think much of PLoS , for example , and PLoS says they created the company to make science less insular so it is n't any surprise that that a new PLoS essay by Neal Young , John Ioannidis and Omar Al - Ubaydli claims that the current system of publishing medical and scientific research provides " a distorted view of the reality of scientific data that are generated in the laboratory and clinic . "
They apply shade - tree - mechanic economics principles to support their idea of the distortion .
There is an " extreme imbalance , " they say , between the abundance of supply ( science laboratories and clinical investigations ) and the limited venues for publication ( journals with sufficiently high impact to be valuable to the authors - let 's come back to that part later ) .
Scientific information , they say , is an economic commodity and the ' consumers ' are other scientists , patients , funding agencies , etc .
The result of the imbalance , they note accurately , is that only a small proportion of all research studies are chosen for publication in the best journals , and these results are unrepresentative of scientists ' overall work .
They 're interested primarily in biomedical research but they broaden it out and use the general term ' science ' and so shall I .
They argue that there is a ' moral imperative ' to reconsider how scientific data are judged and disseminated .
Unclear on why any business has a ' moral imperative ' to sell its product in a way all people like ?
Me either , else the cigarette business has a brilliant new marketing campaign .
And what do moral imperatives have to do with science ?
Well , not much , but it's an essay ... in PLoS ... so scientific scrutiny is not mandated here .
But it will get attention because AAAS Eurekalert will seemingly print anything PLoS throws into a press release , which may mean that science press release distribution needs fixed just as much as publishing in journals .
They make a good point , despite the fellow traveller appeal to moral imperatives and being published as much as they want - namely that while published articles have risen in quantity , they have not kept pace with the sheer amount of data produced .
This does not mean all studies are great ; a few times per month we make fun of the more ridiculous peer - reviewed studies here .
But journals , they say , have the luxury of only publishing true impact studies and a lot of other research gets less attention .
I 'll come back to that too .
The error they seem to be making is one of methodology .
They say that ' consumers ' ( other scientists ) are somehow hurt if studies are not published in the very best journals .
Since they seek to use an economic justification , I will also .
It 's like saying customers are hurt if they can't buy Cheerios at Niemann - Marcus , though they can buy them at Wal - Mart just fine .
If studies are good , yet they do n't get cited because they 're not in the best journals , then it 's the fault of the other researchers ( the ' consumers ' supposedly being hurt by not having everything in impact journals ) for being elitist and shallow , not the fault of the journals .
In true economics , a preponderance of quality research going into other journals would make the other journals the new place to be read .
The market would adapt .
Seattle once had good music but then Omaha had good stuff instead .
The authors of this essay seem to be arguing that distribution should be nationalized so output will increase - and they think quality will not go down .
Indeed , with so much quality research not getting published in the high impact journals , true economics says more journals will come into existence .
Any time there is high demand and high supply but poor distribution a new distributor will appear .
And if their economic model is true , journals are simply that - a distributor .
This is n't the diamond industry , where one supplier can constrict supply artificially to keep demand high , the supply is already there .
PLoS came into existence because they wanted to make science open access and because of the volume they publish they had a lower threshold for peer review , but two of their publications became quite well respected and the bar is now higher to get published there .
Unlike Nature or other print journals , though , they have no print costs so they can literally publish everything that researchers willing to spend $ 2500 will send them .
That is n't so easy when there is paper and ink involved .
It also has to be considered that there is an agenda in their essay .
' Artificial scarcity ' that can be solved by an online competitor to print journals is an obvious answer ( PLoS ) though they seem to be striving to remain neutral on other ground .
Heck , they are so middle of the road they even manage to cover both the science and religion segments of society when they write ; " Some may accept the current publication system as the ideal culmination of an evolutionary process .
However , this order is hardly divinely inspired ; "
That 's middle of the road , folks .
So what say you ?
Is more competition for a few spots making better scientists get the best rewards ?
The NBA and baseball and all sports tend to think that way .
Being the 26th player on a baseball team makes you really good , just not good enough to get a baseball card .
Or are journals selling the sizzle and not the steak by just choosing the studies that get publicity and generate profitable reprint sales ?
If they are , I do n't see why someone does n't start a new journal .
Scientific
Blogging is doing quite nicely though no one said two years ago there was any huge demand for another science publication .
So I see no reason why a new print journal publisher can't come into existence .
I see no reason why it can't be us .

Last week , the RIAA celebrated the signing of a ridiculous new law in Tennessee that says :
Each public and private institution of higher education in the state that has student residential computer networks shall : [...]
[ R]easonably attempt to prevent the infringement of copyrighted works over the institution 's computer and network resources , if such institution receives fifty ( 50 ) or more legally valid notices of infringement as prescribed by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 within the preceding year .
While the entertainment industry failed to get " hard " requirements for universities in the Higher Education Act passed by Congress earlier this year , the RIAA succeeded in Tennessee ( and is pushing in other states ) with this provision that gives Big Content the ability to hold universities hostage through the use of infringement notices .
Moreover , the new rules will cost Tennessee a pretty penny -- in the cost review attached to the Tennessee bill , the state 's Fiscal Review Committee estimates that the new obligations will initially cost the state a whopping $ 9.5 million for software , hardware , and personnel , with recurring annual costs of more than $ 1.5 million for personnel and maintenance .
Not a penny of this will go to artists , nor to any of the record labels RIAA represents .
Unfortunately , the entertainment industry lobby seems to be succeeding , bit - by - bit , in persuading legislators to coerce universities into buying " infringement suppression " technologies -- expensive technologies that wo n't stop file sharing on campus networks .
Even if the technologies did work ( magical thinking in light of encryption ) , does anyone think they would somehow force students back into record stores or the iTunes Store ?
After all , today students on campus can swap multiple gigabytes hand - to - hand for pennies ( see , e.g. , blank DVD - R disks , or the price of portable hard drives , as well as the ease of copying from iPod to iPod ) .
It makes no sense to force universities to spend millions on technologies that will hobble innovation on campus while failing to stop file - sharing .
Why not use those millions to compensate creators and copyright owners , and thereby make file - sharing legal , instead ?
Now , more than ever , the universities need to come forward with a collective licensing proposal that will protect their campus communities and their own bottom lines .
Meanwhile , universities under the gun should make sure to shun the hype of network filtering when possible and seek solutions more amenable to teaching and academic freedom -- our whitepaper on copyright infringement technologies on campus networks is a good place to start .

Research led by Psychology researchers at the University of Warwick reveals that cell phone conversations impair drivers ' visual attention to such a degree that it can add over 5 metres to the braking distance of a car travelling at 60 miles and causes almost twice as many errors as drivers driving without the distraction of a hands free cell phone conversation .
Some of the participants carried out the task with no distraction .
Others carried out the task while also using speaker phones to simultaneously engage in a normal phone conversation , discussing things such as their hobbies and interests .
The researchers found that on average the reaction times of those engaging in the hands free telephone conversation were 212 milliseconds slower than those who undertook the task without the simultaneous telephone conversation .
A car travelling at 60 miles an hour would travel 5.7 metres ( 18.7 feet ) in that time so the distracting conversation would obviously increase any braking distance at that speed by the same amount .
The test participants who were distracted by a phone conversation also made 83 % more errors in the task than those not in phone conversations .
The researchers also looked at the effect the hands free telephone conversations had on visual attention if the phone conversation was skewed to a more passively orientated task .
To do so they asked the test participants to listen over the speaker phones to a series of words and to repeat each word in turn .
The research team also looked at the effect of a much more complicated conversational task in which the test participants had to listen to a series of words and after each word then think of and say a new word which began with the last letter of the word they had just heard .
For the more passive speaking condition , in which words were simply heard and repeated , they found that performance of test participants in this condition was the same as when they took the task without any distraction .
However , they found the more complicated conversation in which the test participants were required to create and respond with a new word dramatically worsened the participants ' response times which were on average 480 milliseconds slower than those who undertook the task without any form of distracting telephone conversation .
This suggests that hands free telephone conversations which require people to carefully consider the information they hear and then to make complex cognitive choices based on that information ( a business decision for instance ) have a particularly significant negative impact on a driver 's ability to process and act on the visual information that is critical to their driving performance .
Interestingly the researchers also examined what the effect would be of simply listening to a story while carrying out the task – an experience not unlike listening to speech radio while driving .
To test this some of the participants in the experiment tried to complete the task while listening to the first chapter of Bram Stoker 's Dracula .
They were also told they would have to answer questions on the story after the task was finished .
The researchers found that in fact this activity made very little difference to the test participants response times or accuracy
The lead researcher in the project , Dr Melina Kunar from the University of Warwick 's Department of Psychology , said : " Our research shows that simply using phones hands free is not enough to eliminate significant impacts on a driver 's visual attention .
Generating responses for a conversation competes for the brain 's resources with other activities which simply cannot run in parallel .
This leads to a cognitive " bottleneck " developing in the brain , particularly with the more complicated task of word generation . "

On November 30th a referendum will be held among the people of Switzerland about whether to completely legalize possession , sale , and cultivation of cannabis .
The initiative is titled : “ For a sensible cannabis policy with effective protection of the youth ” .
( in German : Für eine vernünftige Hanfpolitik mit wirksamem Jugendschutz . )
P.L.R. ( liberal - radical party ) , swiss - socialist party , Green party and many politicians of popular - democratic party are for “ yes ” in the referendum of 30 November , 2008 about decriminalisation of use of cannabis .
The message of decriminalisation is clear : the use of cannabis could be dangerous and it is forbidden under 18 years old , but for anyone over 18 it should be a matter of personal responsibility .
There will of course be strict regulations , similar to the restrictions on Alcohol and Tabacco .
Many politicians feel that legalisation is the only way to effectively protecting the youth from Cannabis , as current prohibition is clearly not working .
Is Sarah Palin Nipping at Ted Stevens ' Heels ?
Alaska 's Ted Stevens could have some competition for his Senate seat -- and we do n't mean his tight reelection race .
We have a fascinating situation in Alaska .
Convicted felon Sen . Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) is clinging to a 2 point lead over his Democratic challenger , Mark Begich .
If this lead holds and Stevens , 84 , wins reelection , his race will be the biggest shocker of Election Day .
And he 'll hold a place in history as the first convicted felon ever reelected to the Senate .
As the Anchorage Daily News reports , the race may not be decided for two weeks given the roughly 40,000 absentee ballots left to be counted , plus " 9,000 uncounted early votes and thousands of questioned ballots . "
If Stevens does beat the odds and wins his surreal reelection battle , he wo n't be welcome back in the Senate , where Democrats gained at least five more seats last night with the counting still going strong in yet undecided races .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said this week that even if Stevens wins his race , he should n't expect to keep his job on Capitol Hill .
" The reality is that a convicted felon is not going to be able to serve in the United States Senate , " Reid said .
" And as precedent shows us , Senator Stevens will face an ethics committee investigation and expulsion , regardless of his appeals process . "
And what might happen if his colleagues do kick Stevens out of the Senate , prompting a special election ?
Who might be in line to replace him ?
Hint : lipstick ; $ 150,000 wardrobe .
Yep , you betcha !
Sarah Palin .
And although Palin would likely face a legal challenge if she tried to appoint herself or a temporary replacement ( a law passed by the Alaska Legislature after Lisa Murkowski 's appointment to the Senate by her father , former Gov. Frank Murkowski , requires a special election to fill any Senate vacancies ) she would certainly be the frontrunner in any race to replace Stevens .
Palin has no made no secret of her desire to stay on the national political scene .
And - just ask President - elect Barack Obama - what better place than the Senate to launch your bid for the White House ?

My mom visited a month ago , and just before she left I called her and said , “ Mom ? ” The End .
No , that was n’t really the end .
I just like to do that sometimes .
I said , “ Mom ?
Will you please bring your recipes ? ”
Then I batted my eyelashes and waited for her answer .
“ Sure , ” she said .
And I jumped for joy .
Because you see , my mom’s “ recipes ” amount to two enormous — like , the most gargantuan I ’ve ever seen — three - ring binders stuffed with plastic sleeves that contain every wonderful , fabulous recipe she ’s used since The Dark Ages , or at least since around 1968 .
She still collects and tests recipes , so her plastic sleeves are updated with modern , interesting foods .
So I have a confession to make , seriously .
When I looked forward to my mother ’s visit , all I could think about was getting my hands on her recipe binders … and honestly , I secretly had the thought , Maybe she ’ll forget them and leave them at my house .
Then , while she was here and I was tidying up the kitchen , I “ absentmindedly ” put the binders in my pantry so they ’d be out of the way .
And sure enough , when she pulled away from my house the following Monday morning and drove back to Tennesse , she did so without her binders .
And I ’ve had them ever since .
I ’ll have to make my peace with God about whether or not I subliminally , subconsciously , maybe , sorta , kinda , willed her recipe binders into being left here , but boy howdy , have I had some fun with those suckers !
One of the first things I zeroed in on was this recipe for Apple Dumplings .
Emailed to her by a friend known only as “ Donna , ” it uses Granny Smith apples , Pillsbury Crescent Rolls , and …GULP : a can of Mountain Dew .
Oh , and more butter than you ’ve ever seen on this website , ever .
I had no idea what to expect , but it looked so easy , I had to try .
The result ?
I had to throw the pan away .
These apple dumplings were SO indescribably delicious , after I took one bite to try them out , I proceeded to take thirty - four more .
Then I became racked with guilt , fear , and shame , and I took another bite .
Then I tossed the pan into the garbage .
They were evil .
And they had to be destroyed .
For those of you with will power , though , these are really surprisingly delightful !
The texture of the crescent rolls becomes something entirely different during the baking process : the top gets delightfully crisp and flavorful , while the underneath side remains soft and mushy and more “ apple dumpling -y ” .
And the Mountain Dew , coupled with the obscene amound of butter , creates a yummy , sweet sauce at the end .
Serve these beauties with ice cream ( or , if you ’re on a diet , a huge dollup of sweetened whipped heavy cream ) and you ’ll be left wondering how such ordinary ingredients can be so sublime .
The Cast of Characters : Granny Smith apples , Butter , Sugar , Vanilla , Cinnamon , Pillsbury Crescent Rolls , and a can of Mountain Dew .
Start by peeling and coring 2 Granny Smith apples .
It does n’t matter if they ’re a little bruised and battered .
My boys used these to play raquetball earlier that day , and they worked just fine .
Next , cut the apples into eight slices .
Butter a 9 x 13 inch baking pan .
( Mine was a little smaller and I later ran out of room , so please do n’t take matters into your own hands and choose some funky pan that ’s too small .
I ’ll regret it the rest of my life . )
Now I want you to cast aside any preconceived notions you might have about refrigerator crescent rolls .
Then I want you to open the can of crescent rolls and unroll the dough .
Just pretend it ’s puffed pastry .
And really what ’s the big difference ?
( I have a feeling someone out there is going to answer that for me . )
In any event , roll up an apple slice in each of the crescent rolls .
Like this !
Now lay each one into the buttered baking pan .
And let ’s just acknowledge the elephant in the room : the black smudge on my left thumb .
It is n’t mascara .
It is n’t Sharpie pen .
It ’s grease from the underside of my tripod head , which can stick a little .
I would have Photoshopped it out , but that would n’t be keepin ’ it real , now , would it ?
Now , melt 2 sticks regular ( salted ) butter in a saucepan .
Dump in 1 1/2 cups sugar …
And here ’s the kicker : just barely stir together .
Also add in 1 teaspoon vanilla …
And barely stir .
You definitely want the mixture lumpy and grainy .
Now pour the very low - calorie mixture over the top of the dumplings , making sure to thoroughly coat them .
I ’m so pleased to be able to bring you healthy , low - fat cuisine .
Makes me feel like I ’m doing my part in the world .
Now , the recipe calls for a 12 - ounce can of Mountain Dew , but I wound up using only one of these little ones .
And by the way , are n’t these just the cutest little things ?
And there ’s another black smudge .
I ca n’t escape them … they ’re taking over .
But I ’m just happy you guys accept me , black smudgy fingers and all .
So what you want to do is , pour Mountain Dew all around the edge of the pan .
I also deviated from the rules a bit and poured it down the center .
But only because I was feeling dangerous .
NOW .
Sprinkle the top with cinnamon and bake at 350 degrees for 30 - 45 minutes , watching to make sure they do n’t get too brown .
( You ’ll definitely want them golden brown and crispy on top , though . )
And here ’s what they ’ll look like .
Now , when I first pulled the pan out of the oven , there was quite a lot of liquid sloshing around in the pan .
This happened because I used a smaller pan than the recipe called for , and I had to leave out two dumplings .
So if you use a 9 x 13 - incher , you should be fine .
I poured a little of the excess liquid into a separate bowl before I began cutting into the dumplings .
Oh , baby .
Honestly , these are to die for .
See how crispy they are on top , and how soft and dumpling -y they are on the bottom ?
That combination of textures is what ’s so delicious .
Serve it with vanilla ice cream ( cinnamon ice cream would be perfect , too ) , and do n’t be afraid to top the whole thing with some of the sweet sauce from the bottom of the pan .
If you want to just drink that stuff with a straw , that ’d be fine , too .
Enjoy !

Pregnant women exposed to hairspray at work double chances of genital defect in boys
A link between hairspray and a genital defect in boys has been uncovered by scientists .
Researchers found that women exposed to hairspray in the workplace during early pregnancy more than double their chances of giving birth to a son with hypospadias .
The defect normally affects around one in 250 boys in the UK , causing the urinary opening to be shifted beneath the penis .
Pregnant women exposed to hairspray , for instance around the workplace , have double the chance of giving birth to a boy with genital defects
Although it can be corrected by surgery before a boy 's first birthday , more severe cases can lead to urinary , sexual and fertility problems .
Hormone - disrupting hairspray chemicals called phthalates , which can affect reproductive development , are believed to be behind the connection .
But the same study showed that taking folic acid reduces the risk of giving birth to a child with the condition by 36 per cent .
An increased risk was only seen in women whose jobs led to high exposure to hairspray chemicals , such as hairdressers , beauty therapists , research chemists and factory workers .
The link was made after researchers conducted detailed interviews with 471 women whose sons had been referred to surgeons for hypospadias , and 490 ' control ' mothers of boys not born with the defect .
The women lived across 120 London boroughs and local authority districts .
They were asked a range of detailed questions about health , lifestyle and occupation , covering topics such as smoking habits , diet , possible exposure to 26 different chemical substances , and use of folic acid ( folate ) supplements .
Exposure to hairspray in the first three months of pregnancy increased the chances of having a son with hypospadias two - to - three - fold .
The risk was reduced by taking folate supplements over the same period .
Professor Paul Elliott , from Imperial College London , who led the research , said : ' Hypospadias is a condition that , if left untreated , can cause problems in later life .
Although surgery to correct it is usually successful , any surgery will be traumatic for the child and his parents .
' It is encouraging that our study showed that taking folic acid supplements in pregnancy may reduce the risk of a child being born with the condition .
Further research is needed to understand better why women exposed to hairspray at work in the first three months of pregnancy may have increased risk of giving birth to a boy with hypospadias . '
The Department of Health recommends that mothers - to - be take folate supplements up until the 12th week of pregnancy to prevent neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida .
Earlier studies had suggested that hypospadias might be linked to vegetarianism , but this was not born out by the new findings .
Phthalates are found in many cosmetic products , including deodorants , perfumes , and nail varnish , as well as hairspray .
They are also used in adhesives and paints , and added to plastics to make them more flexible .
Research has shown that high exposure to phthalates alters hormone levels and causes birth defects in rodents .
A 2005 study showed that women exposed to the chemicals in pregnancy were up to seven times more likely to give birth to boys with a shortened ' anogenital distance ' - the distance between the anus and penis .
A reduced anogenital distance is seen as a sign of male feminisation .
The use of phthalates in children 's toys has been restricted in the European Union since 1999 .
The religious right has REALLY outdone themselves on this one .
Reader GH alerted me to the new Christmas Cross the extreme - right gay - hating group American Family Association is selling for Christmas .
I pulled up the picture on my phone , showed it to my Jewish friend Matt , and asked him what it was .
He says “ a burning cross . ” Nice .
( Hat tip to Box Turtle for the post title . )
And if you really want a laugh , read the text describing the cross – it is made for parody .
King of Bhutan Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck is World 's Youngest
King of Bhutan , Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck
The Himalayan country of Bhutan crowned their new king , 28 - year - old Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck , yesterday in a ceremony that brought thousands from snowy villages to the capital city of Thimphu .
The new king was crowned by his father , the revered former king , Jigme Singye Wangchuck , at 8:31 a.m. local time , making him the druk gyalpo , or dragon king .
The former king abdicated two years ago as part of his plan to reform and modernize the nation of 635,000 people by ending more than 100 years of absolute royal rule .
The country 's first parliamentary elections were held in March .

General Electric ( GE ) , the legendary American institution , founded in 1878 by Thomas Edison , is in deep trouble .
Its PR machine has been in constant spin mode as the company sinks deeper into despair .
It is one of the few companies in the U.S. that still retains a AAA rating .
Considering Moody ’s and S&P ’s track record , rating companies and financial instruments , that AAA rating is not worth the paper it is written on .
One look at GE ’s balance sheet will convince you they do not deserve a AAA rating .
AAA companies do not need to take the desperate actions that GE has taken in the last few months .

The virtual crash in its stock price indicates that there is something seriously wrong with GE .
The stock reached $ 53 at its peak in 2000 .
It closed below $ 17 this past week , the lowest level since the mid-1990s .
CEO Jeffrey Immelt , who took over from icon Jack Welch in 2001 , has made his mark by managing the company to a 68 % decline in its stock price .
You will not see anyone on CNBC take a hard look at GE ’s financial statements or ask the CEO tough questions , because Mr. Immelt signs their paychecks .
While shareholders have taken a bath , Mr. Immelt , a Harvard MBA , raked in $ 72.2 million of compensation between 2002 and 2007 .
A company that is known for its pay for performance mantra evidently does not hold its CEO to the same standards .
The first signs of cracks in this global institution appeared in April 2008 .
GE has met their earnings projections consistently for decades .
It is widely known that they are masters of “ legal ” earnings manipulation .
Accounting rules allow for wide discretion in reserves and estimates .
GE Capital has always been a black box within the larger company .
GE does not provide detailed financial information about this division .
This lack of detail has allowed GE to use this division as its backstop for meeting earnings estimates .
During a better than expected quarter , they take extra reserves and have the quarter meet estimates or beat by one cent .
During a down quarter , they use those excess reserves to meet estimates .
The GE Capital division would also sell liquid assets at the end of a quarter to guarantee smooth sailing .
This earnings management had lulled analysts and stockholders into being complacent regarding GE ’s business .
In mid-March Mr. Immelt confirmed publicly that GE would meet earnings expectations of $.50 to $.53 per share for the quarter ending March 31 .
With 2 weeks left in a 12 week quarter , Mr. Immelt was confident in their results .
When GE reported earnings of $ .44 per share in early April , the world was shocked .
The stock , which had reached a yearly high of $ 37 , dropped 16 % to $ 31 .
Knowing that GE always has excess reserves to manage their earnings , with only two weeks left in the quarter , made the magnitude of the earnings miss beyond belief .
Former CEO Jack
Welch went on CNBC and said , “ I ’d be shocked beyond belief , and I ’d get a gun out and shoot him if he does n’t make what he promised now .
Here ’s the screw - up : you made a promise that you ’d deliver this , and you missed three weeks later .
Jeff has a credibility issue . ”
Mr. Welch is absolutely right .
Jeffrey Immelt has no credibility left .
His excuse was , " We had planned for an environment that was going to be challenging ...[ but ] after the Bear Stearns event , we experienced an extraordinary disruption in our ability to complete asset sales and incurred marks of impairments and this was something that we clearly did n't see until the end of the quarter . "
A top CEO should have a better handle on his business .
The next daggers into Mr. Immelt ’s credibility occurred in late September and early October .
On September 25 , with the stock trading at $ 25.50 , Jeff Immelt lowered GE ’s earnings guidance , suspended its $ 15 billion stock buyback plan and declared they needed no outside capital .
He reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining a AAA rating with these actions .
One week later he convinced Warren Buffett to invest $ 3 billion in the company by paying him an annual dividend of 10 % while granting him warrants to purchase $ 3 billion of common stock at $ 22.25 .
It then sold $ 12 billion of additional shares at $ 22.25 to the public .
These were not the actions of a company or CEO that is in control .
AAA rated companies do not have to pay 10 % interest rates .
Credit default swaps protecting against GE Capital default traded as if GE is a junk bond credit .
The issuing of $ 12 billion in common stock at $ 22.25 per share is an act of extreme desperation and brings into question whether GE has a lucid strategy .
How can investors have confidence in a company that bought back 97 million shares for $ 3.1 billion at an average price of $ 31.69 in the first nine months of 2008 , and then issued $ 12 billion worth of stock at $ 22.25 in October ?
Not only did they buyback $ 3.1 billion of stock in 2008 , but they also bought back $ 27 billion of stock in the prior three years at an average price of $ 36.46 .
This is a twist on the old saying , buy high and sell low .
If Mr. Immelt was not so focused on trying to beat short term earnings goals by wasting $ 30 billion of cash on share buybacks , he would n’t have had to beg Warren Buffett for $ 3 billion last month at very poor terms from GE ’s perspective .
A CEO is responsible for preparing their company for a worst case scenario and should never risk the company in an attempt to meet short term goals .
Mr. Buffett may have made one of the few mistakes of his glorious investing career .
He has lost $ 762 million on his investment in 1 ½ months , a return of - 25 % .

Most people know GE as an industrial conglomerate that makes light bulbs , appliances , and jet engines .
Their advertising agency has positioned GE as a “ green ” company with an advertising campaign called “ Ecomagination ” , stressing wind power , hybrid locomotives , and environmentally friendly products .
The truth is that GE should have an ad campaign called “ Bankomagination ” .
GE is a bank disguised as an industrial conglomerate .
GE Capital is a division of GE , which truly dominates the results of this company .
GE Capital has three subdivisions ( GE Commercial Finance , GE Money , and GE Consumer Finance ) .
In 2003 , GE Capital generated $ 5.9 billion of GE ’s $ 17 billion of profits , or 35 % .
By 2007 , GE Capital was generating $ 12.2 billion of their $ 29 billion of profits , or 42 % .
Being a bank during the boom years of 2004 to 2007 did wonders for GE ’s bottom line .
Being a bank now is a rocky path to destruction .
GE Capital is enormously leveraged to consumers throughout the world .
It issues credit cards for Wal - Mart , Lowe ’s , IKEA , and hundreds of other retailers throughout the world .
GE Capital provides private label credit card programs , installment lending , bankcards and financial services for customers , retailers , manufacturers and health - care providers .
It also owns 1,800 commercial airplanes and leases them to 225 airlines worldwide .
GE Capital provides credit services to more than 130 million customers — like retailers , consumers , auto dealers and mortgage lenders .
Their financial products and services include a suite of offerings , from credit cards to debt consolidation to home equity loans .
GE Capital has also been a huge benefit to the industrial side of the business .
GE Capital provides financing for customers that buy GE power turbines , jet engines , windmills , locomotives and other big ticket items .
The crucial question is whether the people and companies who received loans from GE Capital can pay them back .
GE ’s future is highly dependent on the answer to this question .
The AAA rating of GE allows GE Capital to borrow funds at lower rates than all banks in the United States .
Their cost of capital has been 7.3 % .
Losing that rating would be disastrous to GE Capital .
Between 2002 and 2006 , GE Capital did what most other banks did and levered up .
Their ratio of debt to equity rose from 6.6 to 8.1 , while profits quadrupled .
GE Capital jumped into the subprime mortgage market in 2004 , buying WMC Mortgage .
It sold it in 2007 , after racking up losses of $ 1 billion in 2007 .
It also unloaded a Japanese consumer lending company at a $ 1.2 billion loss in 2007 .
It is clear that risk management has taken a back seat to profits at GE Capital .
GE Capital ’s profits plunged 38 % in the 3rd quarter , the main reason for GE ’s earnings miss .
Analyst Nicholas Heymann of Sterne Agee wrote : " Investors now understand that GE uses the last couple weeks in the quarter to ' fine - tune ' its financial service portfolios to ensure its earnings objectives are achieved .
It turns out it really was n't miracle management systems or risk - control systems or even innovative brilliance .
It was the green curtain that allowed the magic to be consistently performed undetected . "
Egan -Jones , an independent rating agency , calculates that GE is levered ten - to - one , a more conservative and higher number than the company 's eight - to - one figure .
Cofounder Sean Egan believes that , depending on the off - balance - sheet holdings , actual leverage could be still higher .
His firm rates the company single - A. Looking at GE ’s Balance Sheet between 2003 and today , clearly shows a deteriorating situation .
Long - term debt grew from $ 172 billion in 2003 to $ 381 billion by the 1st quarter of 2008 , a 121 % increase .
Their long term debt to equity ratio grew from 68 % to 77 % .
Short - term debt grew from $ 157.4 billion in 2003 to $ 218.7 billion in the latest quarter , a 40 % increase .
The 70 % increase in profits between 2003 and 2007 were undoubtedly juiced by the use of prodigious amounts of debt .
Stockholder ’s equity is at the same level as 2004 .
With cash of only $ 59.7 billion and short - term debt of $ 218.7 billion , the freezing up of the credit markets has put GE at major risk when trying to rollover their debt .

Americans are giving up their dogs and cats to animal shelters in growing numbers as the emotional bonds between people and pets get tested by economic ones .
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have a big job at hand and recently began a program called Help Out Pets Everywhere ( HOPE ) to provide food , medical care and temporary homes for pets belonging to families with financial difficulties .
They received about eighteen applications in the first week , some of those people have never experienced hardship until now , and therefore , neither have their pets .
A man who turned his two dogs over in order to help pay for his mother ’s cancer treatments , to the New York woman who euthanized her cat rather than keeping it alive with expensive medications , rising economic anxieties make it increasingly difficult for some pet owners to justify spending $ 1,000 a year or more on pet food , veterinary services and other costs .
The population growth at animal shelters shows how the weak economy is also shrinking the pool of potential adopters .
And it coincides with a drop - off in government funding and charitable donations .
The effect has been cramped quarters for dogs and cats , a faster rate of shelters euthanizing animals and some shelters turning away people looking to surrender pets , according to interviews with several shelters and animal advocates .
Of the estimated 6 million to 8 million dogs and cats sent to animal shelters every year , half are euthanized and the rest adopted , according to the Humane Society of the United States .

It ’s definitely discouraging , one major goal is to develop and celebrate the bond between people and animals .
It ’s so tragic when families reach a point when they ca n’t afford to care for their pets .
A 23 - year - old Mel Bail of Worcester , Mass. , had begun feeding leftovers from family meals to her three cats — before recently deciding to give them up .
With two children , a husband on disability and a difficult job search of her own .
“ When I could n’t pay my gas bill , I knew I had to find another home for the cats , ” Bail said , and it was n’t easy to find a shelter for them and had to turn to online classified ads to find homes for them .
Although there is no nationwide data being collected on the reasons dogs and cats are being abandoned by their owners , but shelter managers and advocates for animals say the trend is undeniable .
“ People are embarrassed to admit that ’s why they ’re giving up their pets , ” said Betsy McFarland , the Humane Society ’s director of communications for companion animals .
A recent poll found that one in seven owners nationwide reported reduced spending on their pets during the past year ’s recession .
Of those cutting back , more than a quarter said they have seriously considered giving up their pet .
The average annual cost of owning a dog is about $ 1,400 , while the average annual cost of a cat is about $ 1,000 , according to a survey conducted by the American Pet Products Association .
The survey suggests there are some 231 million pets — excluding fish — in more than 71 million homes in America .
Humane Society spokesperson said the obedience - trained purebreds came into the shelter up - to - date on vaccinations and dental care and were well - groomed .
It is really sad , because for these people , it is not an excuse .
They are absolutely stuck , and they need to downsize and there is no one to take the pets .
You can tell these have been much - loved pets .
“ When it came down to whether I was going to charge food for the month of September or give medicine to my cat , that was a clear decision for me , ” Farrell - Talbot said .
“ It was horrible .
It killed us . ”
In response , one shelter began a program to open its emergency pet shelter — normally reserved for battered women needing a place to keep their pets for a while — to those suffering financially .
So far this year 45 pets have been taken in through the emergency program , compared with eight the previous year .
“ It ’s been devastating , ” said Amy McNally , a spokeswoman for the program .
“ For somebody to say ‘ I ca n’t afford to feed my dog ’ — it ’s a humbling time . ”
What 's this ?
Another Palin - inspired political storm brewing ?
After Sarah Palin 's spirited attacks on elitist media during her acceptance speech at the Republican convention last week ( a tactic , surely , to prevent such a trend continuing ) , there was a school of thought that she had made herself fairly immune to further criticism - for a while at least .
But the American press is getting on with things , and the Washington Post has obtained a log of Palin 's expenses and carried out an analysis of what it reveals .
According to the paper 's research , the Alaskan governor billed taxpayers for 312 nights she spent in her own home during her first 19 months of office .
And , the Post claims , Palin - who earns $ 125,000 a year - charged the state for travel to take her children on official out of town missions and her husband billed for expenses and daily allowances .
All in all , she claimed $ 16,951 as her allowance .
In her defence , officials say this was permitted because Palin's " duty station " is in the capital , Juneau , 600 miles from the family home in Wasilla .
They have pointed out that the expenses are not unusual and , under state policy , her family is allowed to claim per diem expenses for each child taken on official business .
The Washington Post presents an interesting charge sheet because , among other issues she tackled during her widely applauded acceptance speech , Palin painted herself as the kind of politician who did without the frills and bows .
With reference to her use of a state - owned plane , she said : " While I was at it , I got rid of a few things in the governor 's office that I did n't believe our citizens should have to pay for . "
There was also a point made about how her family did n't need a chef and she would rather cook for them .
It all makes you think : has it really only been ten days since the governor of Alaska burst on to the world 's radar as John McCain 's running mate ?
With the dust settling after the Republican convention , national polls show McCain is leading or level with Obama , despite what was viewed as a fairly lacklustre speech on his part .
A USA Today / Gallup poll over the weekend found McCain leading Obama by 50 % to 46 % among registered voters .
And then , of course , there 's the cash : of the $ 47 m McCain raised in August , the Republicans say $ 10 m came in the three days after he announced Palin as his running mate .
Artist 's Statement A couple of ideas I did n’t get to use for this cartoon : 1. ) a variation on the 9/11 Truther delusion in which they would conspire to a . )
Nuke Manhattan and then b. ) frame the Russians , thereby reigniting the Cold War ( if you ’ll permit the oxymoron .
The Cold War is the main thing the Republicans still like to point to as their one great triump ( along with finally kicking those freeloaders off welfare , which is n’t the sort of thing you can build good monuments to ) .
Though it ’s not as if Democrats ever argued for capitulation to the Soviets , if you think about it .
In fact it was that big closet pinko Nixon who introduced detente and opened relations with the Maoist swine .
So I ’m not sure what the Republicans have to lay claim to there except that the Soviet empire happened to collapse on a Republican president ’s watch .
2 . ) “ Return to Their Roots . ”
The idea beiing that they should resurrect some anachronistic , 19th - century platform , like opposing the gold standard .
I researched the origins of the Republican party and learned that they originally formed as an anti-slavery party , specifically opposing the spread of slavery into Kansas .
But somehow , picturing a world in which slavery were to be a controversial issue again , I just ca n’t see the modern Republican Party taking the abolitionist position .
They seem like they ’d be more likely to stick up for property owners and states ’ rights and decry government interference in business .
Even now the Republicans are regrouping , trying to figure out exactly where they went wrong , looking at new approaches and PR angles to rebrand themselves for 2012 .
Even the ones who are pretending to do some real soul - searching about the identity and raison d’etre of the party seem to be missing the point .
I ca n’t help but wonder whether anyone has yet floated the suggestion that they just , like , quit .
Maybe it ’s time to admit that it was n’t a bad candidate or an unfortunate economic crash or a change in demographics but the fact that all their ideas , the core values of conservatism , have turned out to be wrong .
That the current confluence of crises , what some have called a “ perfect storm ” -- is not some freak historical accident but the direct consequence of having implemented all their stated policies .
Their antipathy toward government and deliberate campaign to enervate it led to the fiascoes of Katrina and the financial crisis .
Their insistence on American exceptionalism and the use of force to further our interests abroad led to the disaster of Iraq .
And if they ’d gotten their way with the “ ownership society ” and privatized social security Americans would now be calculating how to live the last twenty years of their lives on a monthly budget of nothing .
The fact is , they got to be in complete charge for eight years and do absolutely everything they wanted , and it was a catastrophe .
They gutted the constitution , wrecked the military , looted the treasury , and left the country an irreperable mess .
So maybe the most gracious possible response would be to shake hands all around , say , Okay , you know what , we fucked that up , sorry , seemed like a good idea at the time but guess not , and all go their separate ways to pursue careers in fields better suited to their talents than governance — stolid , respectable trades with little capacity for inflicting harm , like shoe store managers , window washers , pastry chefs .
Just strike the Big Tent , pull up stakes , split the take and move on .
It should be admitted , in grudging fairness , that the cabal that ’s been in for the last eight years bears roughly the same sort of resemblance to Barry - Goldwater conservatism as did the PTL Network to the twelve apostles , or Starship to The Jefferson Airplane .
( These are , obviously , imperfect analogies -- not even the Bakkers were as deluded and shameless as the Bush administration , and even Starship rocked harder than Karl Rove . )
Their idea of limited government is spying on citizens without warrants and holding them in concentration camps for years without charges .
Their fiscal conservatism gave us deficits that hit the gajillion mark for the first time in history and an economy that now resembles Max Ernst 's painting Europe After the Rains .
They really ought to count themselves lucky .
Faust got his eyeballs pinned to the wall .
Already I can feel myself losing interest in politics .
I was never really what you ’d call a politics junkie , not in the same way that Hunter Thompson or Matt Taibbi seem to be .
It ’s just that for the last eight years the reins of power in this nation were in reckless and untrustworthy hands .
We could n’t afford not to pay attention .
It ’s like if you ’re in the backseat of a car and the driver is blacked - out drunk , you sit forward gripping the front seat with your face sticking out between the two front seats shouting very strong suggestions and pleading with them to pull over .
But if the driver ’s sober , you can sit back , relax , stare out the window and let your mind wander , maybe have a little snooze .
America still has all the same problems it had on November 3rd , and they ’ll take time and work to solve , and I ’ll do what little I can to help .
But I ’m not taking a daily interest in who Obama is appointing to cabinet posts , because I trust that , compromised old Washington hacks though they may be , they at least are n’t all campaign donors , lobbyists , Jesus freaks and old high school friends of Sarah Palin’s .
I for one would be content , at this point , to see us return to the bloated , corrupt and inefficient country we once were .
Note : Mitt Romney is dressed after the sartorial manner of the character Rerun from What ’s Happening ? , the very lamest black character I could think of .

Scientists say that a type of rock found at or near the surface in the Mideast nation of Oman and other areas around the world could be harnessed to soak up huge quantities of globe - warming carbon dioxide .
Their studies show that the rock , known as peridotite , reacts naturally at surprisingly high rates with CO 2 to form solid minerals — and that the process could be speeded a million times or more with simple drilling and injection methods .
The study appears in this week 's early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Peridotite comprises most or all of the rock in the mantle , which undergirds earth 's crust .
It starts some 20 kilometers or more down , but occasionally pieces are exhumed when tectonic plates collide and push the mantle rock to the surface , as in Oman .
Geologists already knew that once exposed to air , the rock can react quickly with CO 2 , forming a solid carbonate like limestone or marble .
However , schemes to transport it to power plants , grind it and combine it with smokestack gases have been seen as too costly and energy intensive .
The researchers say that the discovery of previously unknown high rates of reaction underground means CO 2 could be sent there artificially , at far less expense .
" This method would afford a low - cost , safe and permanent method to capture and store atmospheric CO 2 , " said the lead author , geologist Peter Kelemen .
Kelemen and geochemist Juerg Matter , both at Columbia University 's Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory , made the discovery during field work in the Omani desert , where they have worked for years .
Their study area , a Massachusetts - size expanse of largely bare , exposed peridotite , is crisscrossed on the surface with terraces , veins and other formations of whitish carbonate minerals , formed rapidly in recent times when minerals in the rock reacted with CO 2 - laden air or water .
Up to 10 times more carbonates lie in veins belowground ; but the subterranean veins were previously thought to be formed by processes unconnected to the atmosphere , and to be nearly as old as the 96 - million - year - old rock itself .
However , using conventional carbon isotope dating , Kelemen and Matter showed that the underground veins are also quite young — 26,000 years on average — and are still actively forming as CO 2 - rich groundwater percolates downward .
Many underground samples were conveniently exposed in newly constructed road cuts .
All told , Kelemen and Matter estimate that the Omani peridotite is naturally absorbing 10,000 to 100,000 tons of carbon a year -- far more than anyone had thought .
Similarly large exposures of peridotite are known on the Pacific islands of Papua New Guinea and Caledonia , and along the coasts of Greece and the former Yugoslavia ; smaller deposits occur in the western United States and many other places .
The scientists say that the process of locking up carbon in the rocks could be speeded 100,000 times or more simply by boring down and injecting heated water containing pressurized CO 2 .
Once jump - started in this way , the reaction would naturally generate heat — and that heat would in turn hasten the reaction , fracturing large volumes of rock , exposing it to reaction with still more CO 2 - rich solution .
Heat generated by the earth itself also would help , since the further down you go , the higher the temperature .
( The exposed Omani peridotite extends down some 5 kilometers . )
The scientists say that such a chain reaction would need little energy input after it was started .
Accounting for engineering challenges and other imperfections , they assert that Oman alone could probably absorb some 4 billion tons of atmospheric carbon a year — a substantial part of the 30 billion sent into the atmosphere by humans , mainly through burning of fuels .
With large amounts of new solids forming underground , cracking and expansion would generate micro-earthquakes — but not enough to be readily perceptible to humans , says Kelemen .
" It 's fortunate that we have these kinds of rocks in the Gulf region , " said Matter .
Much of the world 's oil and gas is produced there , and Oman is constructing new gas - fired electric plants that could become large sources of CO 2 could be pumped down .
Matter has been working on a separate project in Iceland , where a different kind of rock , volcanic basalt , also shows promise for absorbing CO 2 produced by power plants .
Trials there are set to begin n spring 2009 , in partnership with Reykjavik Energy , and the universities of Iceland and Toulouse ( France ) .
According to the scientists , Petroleum Development Oman , the state oil company , is interested in a pilot program .
Kelemen said : " We see this as just one of a whole suite of methods to trap carbon .
It 's a big mistake to think that we should be searching for one thing that will take care of it all . "
Hard to believe a shiny pink Dalek would menace anyone , but clearly it would .

Thanks , Joel Gillman !
CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama spoke at a his first news conference as president - elect Friday afternoon .
The following is a transcript of the conference :
President - elect Barack Obama emphasized the economy in a news conference in Chicago , Illinois , on Friday .
Obama :
Thank you very much , everybody .
Thank you very much .
This morning , we woke up to more sobering news about the state of our economy .
The 240,000 jobs lost in October marks the 10th consecutive month that our economy has shed jobs .
In total , we 've lost nearly 1.2 million jobs this year , and more than 10 million Americans are now unemployed .
Tens of millions of families are struggling to figure out how to pay the bills and stay in their homes .
Their stories are an urgent reminder that we are facing the greatest economic challenge of our lifetime , and we 're going to have to act swiftly to resolve it .
Now , the United States has only one government and one president at a time .
And until January 20th of next year , that government is the current administration .
I 've spoken to President Bush .
I appreciate his commitment to ensuring that his economic policy team keeps us fully informed as developments unfold .
And I 'm also thankful for his invitation to the White House .
Immediately after I become president , I 'm going to confront this economic crisis head on by taking all necessary steps to ease the credit crisis , help hardworking families , and restore growth and prosperity .
Watch Obama urge swift action on the economy »
And this morning , I met with members of my Transition Economic Advisory Board , who are standing behind me , alongside my vice president - elect , Joe Biden .
They will help to guide the work of my transition team , working with Rahm Emanuel , my chief of staff , in developing a strong set of policies to respond to this crisis .
We discussed in the earlier meeting several of the most immediate challenges facing our economy and key priorities on which to focus on in the days and weeks ahead .
Watch Obama lay out his economic plan »
First of all , we need a rescue plan for the middle class that invests in immediate efforts to create jobs and provide relief to families that are watching their paychecks shrink and their life savings disappear .
A particularly urgent priority is a further extension of unemployment insurance benefits for workers who cannot find work in the increasingly weak economy .
A fiscal stimulus plan that will jump - start economic growth is long overdue .
I 've talked about it throughout this -- the last few months of the campaign .
We should get it done .
Second , we have to address the spreading impact of the financial crisis on the other sectors of our economy : small businesses that are struggling to meet their payrolls and finance their holiday inventories ; and state and municipal governments facing devastating budget cuts and tax increases .
We must also remember that the financial crisis is increasingly global and requires a global response .
The news coming out of the auto industry this week reminds us of the hardship it faces , hardship that goes far beyond individual auto companies to the countless suppliers , small businesses and communities throughout our nation who depend on a vibrant American auto industry .
The auto industry is the backbone of American manufacturing and a critical part of our attempt to reduce our dependence on foreign oil .
I would like to see the administration do everything it can to accelerate the retooling assistance that Congress has already enacted .
In addition , I have made it a high priority for my transition team to work on additional policy options to help the auto industry adjust , weather the financial crisis , and succeed in producing fuel - efficient cars here in the United States of America .
And I was glad to be joined today by Governor Jennifer Granholm , who obviously has great knowledge and great interest on this issue .
I 've asked my team to explore what we can do under current law and whether additional legislation will be needed for this purpose .
Third , we will review the implementation of this administration 's financial program to ensure that the government 's efforts are achieving their central goal of stabilizing financial markets while protecting taxpayers , helping homeowners , and not unduly rewarding the management of financial firms that are receiving government assistance .
It is absolutely critical that the Treasury work closely with the FDIC , HUD , and other government agencies to use the substantial authority that they already have to help families avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes .
Finally , as we monitor and address these immediate economic challenges , we will be moving forward in laying out a set of policies that will grow our middle class and strengthen our economy in the long term .
We cannot afford to wait on moving forward on the key priorities that I identified during the campaign , including clean energy , health care , education , and tax relief for middle - class families .
My transition team will be working on each of these priorities in the weeks ahead , and I intend to reconvene this advisory board to discuss the best ideas for responding to these immediate problems .
Watch more about a new president 's transition into office »
Let me close by saying this .
I do not underestimate the enormity of the task that lies ahead .
We have taken some major action to date , and we will need further action during this transition and subsequent months .
Some of the choices that we make are going to be difficult .
And I have said before and I will repeat again :
It is not going to be quick , and it is not going to be easy for us to dig ourselves out of the hole that we are in .
But America is a strong and resilient country .
And I know we will succeed , if we put aside partisanship and politics and work together as one nation .
That 's what I intend to do .
With that , let me open it up for some questions .
And I 'm going to start right here with you .
Question : Thank you , Mr. President - elect .
I wonder what you think any president can accomplish during their first 100 days in office to turn the economy around ?
How far can you go ?
And what will be your priorities on day one ?
Obama :
Well , I think that a new president can do an enormous amount to restore confidence , to move an agenda forward that speaks to the needs of the economy and the needs of middle - class families all across the country .
I 've outlined during the course of the campaign some critical issues that I intend to work on .
We have a current financial crisis that is spilling out into rest of the economy , and we have taken some action so far .
More action is undoubtedly going to be needed .
My transition team is going to be monitoring very closely what happens over the course of the next several months .
The one thing I can say with certainty is that we are going to need to see a stimulus package passed either before or after inauguration .
We are going to have to focus on jobs , because the hemorrhaging of jobs has an impact , obviously , on consumer confidence and the ability of people to -- to buy goods and services and can have enormous spillover effects .
And I think it 's going to be very important for us to provide the kinds of assistance to state and local governments to make sure that they do n't compound some of the problems that are already out there by having to initiate major layoffs or initiate tax increases .
So there are some things that we know we 're going to have to do , but I 'm confident that a new president can have an enormous impact .
That 's why I ran for president .
Question : ( off - mike ) ... from House Democrats that the stimulus package may be in trouble , that it 's going to be a hard time getting out of a lame - duck session .
Are you still confident that you would be able to get something done before you actually take office ?
Obama : I want to see a stimulus package sooner rather than later .
If it does not get done in the lame - duck session , it will be the first thing I get done as president of the United States .
Question : Senator , for the first time since the Iranian revolution , the president of Iran sent a congratulations note to a new U.S. president .
I 'm wondering if , first of all , if you responded to President Ahmadinejad 's note of congratulations and , second of all , and more importantly , how soon do you plan on sending low - level envoys to countries such as Iran , Syria , Venezuela , Cuba , to see if a presidential - level talk would be productive ?
Obama : I am aware that the letter was sent .
Let me state -- repeat what I stated during the course of the campaign .
Iran 's development of a nuclear weapon I believe is unacceptable .
And we have to mount a international effort to prevent that from happening .
Iran 's support of terrorist organizations I think is something that has to cease .
I will be reviewing the letter from President Ahmadinejad , and we will respond appropriately .
It 's only been three days since the election .
Obviously , how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should , you know , simply do in a knee - jerk fashion .
I think we 've got to think it through .
But I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time .
And I want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president and I wo n't be until January 20th .
Question : Picking up what we were just talking about , your meeting with President Bush on Monday .
When -- he is still the decider , obviously , stating the obvious .
When you disagree with decisions he makes , will you defer ?
Will you challenge ?
Will you confront ?
And if it becomes confrontational , could that rattle the markets even more ?
Obama : Well , President Bush graciously invited Michelle and I to -- to meet with him and First Lady Laura Bush .
We are gratified by the invitation .
I 'm sure that , in addition to taking a tour of the White House , there 's going to be a substantive conversation between myself and the president .
I 'm not going to anticipate problems .
I 'm going to go in there with a spirit of bipartisanship and a sense that both the president and various leaders in Congress all recognize the severity of the situation right now and want to get stuff done .
And , you know , undoubtedly there may end up being differences between not just members of different parties , but between people within the same party .
The critical point and I think the critical tone that has to be struck by all of us involved right now is the American people need help .
This economy is in bad shape .
And we have just completed one of the longest election cycles in recorded history .
Now is a good time for us to set politics aside for a while and think practically about what will actually work to move the economy forward .
And it's in that spirit that I 'll have the conversation with the president .
Question : Thank you , Mr. President - elect .
With the country facing two wars and a financial crisis , do you think it 's important for you to move especially quickly to fill key cabinet posts , such as treasury secretary and secretary of state ?
Obama :
When we have an announcement about cabinet appointments , we will make them .
There is no doubt that I think people want to know who 's going to make up our team .
And I want to move with all deliberate haste , but I want to emphasize " deliberate " as well as " haste . "
I 'm proud of the choice I made of vice president , partly because we did it right .
I 'm proud of the choice of chief of staff , because we thought it through .
And I think it 's very important , in all these key positions , both in the economic team and the national security team , to -- to get it right and not to be so rushed that you end up making mistakes .
I 'm confident that we 're going to have an outstanding team , and we will be rolling that out in subsequent weeks .
Question : Yes , sir .
To what extent -- to what extent are you planning to use your probably pretty great influence in determining the successor for your Senate seat ?
And what sort of criteria should the governor be looking at in filling that position ?
Obama :
This is the governor 's decision ; it is not my decision .
And I think that the criteria that I would have for my successor would be the same criteria that I 'd have if I were a voter : somebody who is capable ; somebody who is passionate about helping working families in Illinois meet their -- meet their dreams .
And I think there are going to be a lot of good choices out there , but it is the governor 's decision to make , not mine .
Lynn Sweet ?
Question : Mr. President - elect ...
Obama :
What happened to your arm , Lynn ?
Question : I cracked my shoulder running to your speech on election night .
Obama : Oh , no .
( Laughter )
Question : ( inaudible )
Obama : I think that was the only major incident during the -- the entire Grant Park celebration .
Question : Thank you for asking .
Here 's my question .
I 'm wondering what you 're doing to get ready .
Have you spoke to any living ex-presidents , what books you might be reading ?
Everyone wants to know , what kind of dog are you going to buy for your girls ?
Have you decided on a private or public school for your daughters ?
Obama : Let -- let me list those off .
In terms of speaking to former presidents , I 've spoken to all of them that are living .
Obviously , President Clinton --
I did n't want to get into a Nancy Reagan thing about , you know , doing any seances .
I have re-read some of Lincoln 's writings , who 's always an extraordinary inspiration .
And , by the way , President Carter , President Bush , Sr. , as well as the current president have all been very gracious and offered to provide any help that they can in this transition process .
With respect to the dog , this is a major issue .
I think it 's generated more interest on our Web site than just about anything .
We have -- we have two criteria that have to be reconciled .
One is that Malia is allergic , so it has to be hypoallergenic .
There are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic .
On the other hand , our preference would be to get a shelter dog , but , obviously , a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me .
So -- so whether we 're going to be able to balance those two things I think is a pressing issue on the Obama household .
And with respect to schools , Michelle will be -- will be scouting out some schools .
We 'll be making a decision about that in the future .
Question :
You are now privy to a lot of intelligence that you have n't had access to before , in fact , much of what the president sees , I 'm sure all of it .
First of all , do you -- what do you think about the state of U.S. intelligence , whether you think it needs beefing up , whether you think there 's enough interaction between the various agencies ?
And , second of all , has anything that you 've heard given you pause about anything you 've talked about on the campaign trail ?
Obama :
Well , as you know , if -- if there was something I had heard , I could n't tell you .
But ...
Question : ( off - mike )
Obama : I have received intelligence briefings .
And I will make just a general statement .
Our intelligence process can always improve .
I think it has gotten better .
And , you know , beyond that , I do n't think I should comment on the nature of the intelligence briefings .
That was a two - parter .
Was there another aspect to that ?
Question :
Well , just whether -- you know , absent what you 've heard ...
Obama : OK , I get you .
Question : ... whether anything has given you pause .
Obama : I 'm going to skip that .
Question : Mr. President - elect , do you still intend to seek income tax increases for upper - income Americans ?
And if so , should these Americans expect to pay higher taxes in 2009 ?
Obama :
The -- my tax plan represented a net tax cut .
It provided for substantial middle - class tax cuts ; 95 percent of working Americans would receive them .
It also provided for cuts in capital gains for small businesses , additional tax credits .
All of it is designed for job growth .
My priority is going to be , how do we grow the economy ?
How do we create more jobs ?
I think that the plan that we 've put forward is the right one , but , obviously , over the next several weeks and months , we 're going to be continuing to take a look at the data and see what 's taking place in the economy as a whole .
But , understand , the goal of my plan is to provide tax relief to families that are struggling , but also to boost the capacity of the economy to grow from the bottom up .
All right .
Thank you very much , guys .

The periodic table of the elements
The periodic table is an arrangment of the chemical elements ordered by atomic number so that periodic properties of the elements ( chemical periodicity ) are made clear .

The standard form of the periodic table shown here includes periods ( shown horizontally ) and groups ( shown vertically ) .
The properties of elements in groups are similar in some respects to each other .
There is no one single or best structure for the periodic table but by whatever consensus there is , the form used here is very useful and the most common .
The periodic table is a masterpiece of organised chemical information and the evolution of chemistry 's periodic table into the current form is an astonishing achievement .
WASHINGTON  President Bush , warning that terrorists “ would like nothing more than to exploit this period of change , ” said Thursday that he intended to talk to President - elect Barack Obama on Monday about issues that will face his administration , including the turmoil in the financial markets and the war in Iraq .
The White House is especially concerned that the nation will be vulnerable during the transition between the Bush and Obama administrations .
In one sign of that , Mike McConnell , the director of national intelligence , flew to Chicago to present Mr. Obama with his first top - secret intelligence briefing on Thursday .
“ For the next 75 days , all of us must ensure that the next president and his team can hit the ground running , ” Mr. Bush said in an emotional speech to hundreds of employees of the executive branch on the South Lawn of the White House .
He urged them to “ conduct yourselves with the decency and professionalism that you have shown throughout my time in office . ”
Mr. Bush has said he is determined to conduct an orderly transition .
The White House wants to avoid a repeat of the kind of news reports that plagued President Bill Clinton when he left office amid questions about whether members of his staff , irked at having to turn their offices over to Republicans , removed the letter W from some computer keyboards .
Click to view Admit it — you thought your retinal profile and fingerprints were the only unique IDs you could use to get into secret government labs ( or exclusive vampire nightclubs ) .
But there 's a new futuristic identification system on the way , and that is the VeinID finger vein authentication technology from Hitachi , Ltd .
Yes , that 's the same team of geniuses who gave us the legendary Magic Wand vibrator ; I 'd say Hitachi knows what it 's doing when it comes to innovations that involve the human body .
VeinID is already at work at many ATMs and doorways in Japan , and Hitachi scientists say this form of ID scan is faster , cheaper , and more accurate than its alternatives .
As it happens , the pattern of veins inside your body is a truly personal design , an intricate spider 's web that is wholly your own .
By flashing low - wavelength light through your middle finger , Hitachi's VeinID reader can get a digital profile of the vein pattern there in less than a second .
Hemoglobin in the blood absorbs the light , making it possible for the VeinID camera to record a 3 - D image of where that hemoglobin exists in your middle finger .
The image below from Hitachi's website is a bit hard to read , but it still illustrates the process .

The best part ?
All of it happens in less than a second .
You can even register the unique vein patterns of other fingers for back - up purposes .
Plus , you do n't need to wash your hands before identification ; in most cases , there 's no light - absorbing hemoglobin in dirt .
And unlike fingerprints , finger vein profiles cannot be faked by chopping off a digit and holding it up to the light , TimesOnline reassures us :
The gruesome possibility that criminals may hack off a finger has already been discounted by Hitachi 's scientists .
Asked if authentication could be " forged " with a severed finger , the company says : " As blood would flow out of a disconnected finger , authentication would no longer be possible . "

That 's just one advantage of using biometric data that is invisible externally .
So as we celebrate this new wave in identification technology , keep your fingers close and your blood flow closer .

The United States Conference of Mayors has announced that more than 900 mayors have signed the U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement .
Oh , and by more than 900 , they mean 902 .
Miami Mayor Manny Diaz , and Conference President , said that “ with a new Administration that has already committed to make climate protection a priority , we look forward to working with President - elect Barack Obama to help these 900 + cities reach the goal set forth by the Kyoto Protocol . ”
The Kyoto Protocol went into effect on February 16 , 2005 for over 100 nations around the world , but not for the United States .
But Mayor Greg Nickels , Vice President of the Conference who launched the effort three years ago , stated that “ as our nation and metro areas work to reduce carbon emissions , our determination will open new opportunities for clean energy and green jobs , ”
Under this agreement , cities pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 ; strive to meet or beat the Kyoto Protocol targets in their own communities ; and to urge Congress to pass the bipartisan GHG reduction legislation .
The organization says that under this new agreement more than 81 million Americans are represented .
That ’s great because according to Zogby , 75 - percent of Americans support investment in clean energy .
Of course , this is all on the heels of President - elect Barack Obama issuing a major policy statement on global warming .
Wanna know if your mayor signed ?
Here ’s the list .
If they did n’t , urge them to sign or vote them out !

Who will be appointed to Obama 's Senate Seat ?
This is the open question around the Chicagoland area .
We saw Obama with Illinois State Director of Veterans Affairs , Tammy Duckworth , yesterday .
Her name is swirling around on the short list .
We have Jesse Jackson , Jr. who is on every television show ALLOWED , touting and pushing his interest in this senate seat , and privately stating it should be given to an African - American .
Sigh .
He even commissioned Zogby to poll citizens of Illinois and though he came out ahead , the poll is dubious .
The poll only cites 21 % in favor of Jackson , Jr. , which means many are not paying attention , yet .
538 has rumor of Illinois State Senate Leader , Emil Jones , being assigned this seat for the last two years of the Obama term .
The issue is his age .
Mr. Jones is resigning in January , he is 73 years old , and if anyone know Illinois politics he is of the " old school pols " on the track of Daley .
Would he be a good choice ?
Legislatively , yes , politically , I do n't know .
He would kill two stones .
He is African - American , and those that want this seat will have to battle it out in the 2010 primairies .
Others being mentioned are Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( IL - 9 ) , a good choice but her husband was indicted and convicted on federal charges of operating three check kiting schemes that defrauded banks of at least $ 2.3 million .
He served 5 months in federal prison .
Do n't think this issue wo n't be brought up on the trail ?
It will .
Another name being touted is Dan Seals .
He lost his second congressional battle against Mark Kirk ( R - IL - 10 ) .
He too , would fill the void of being African - American , mirrors Obama quite a bit , and is much younger .
But , he is a dark horse candidate .
Governor Blagojevich ( D - IL ) will have the final call on who will replace Obama , but let us not think or believe that Obama will not have any input , he will .
Read more on Obama 's replacement , here .

This is why Joe Lieberman , should not retain his chairmanship .

Minnesota , Alaska and Georgia Senate Update
I lived in Minnesota for 6 years , it is a state of independence .
Remember , they voted Jesse Ventura for Governor .
Al Franken is poised to probably win this seat .
Probably .
When Minnesotans woke up last Wednesday , Republican Senator Norm Coleman led Mr. Franken by 725 votes .
By that evening , he was ahead by only 477 .
As of yesterday , Mr. Coleman 's margin stood at 206 .
This lopsided bleeding of Republican votes is passing strange considering that the official recount has n't even begun .
As for Alaska .
now Begich is 971 behind
And Georgia .
Senator Norm Coleman ( R - MN ) has twice announced that he was the winner .
Even asking Al Franken to concede and not allow a recount , but that request is out of Coleman 's hands .
Minnesota 's law is mandatory recount if under 1 % and this race is under 1 % .
Coleman even went to court to try to stop 32 ballots from being counted , the judge denied the request .
Coleman 's real fear is the undervote that will be examined by the recount / canvass board starting next week .
All ballots will go through a hand recount next week .
Many of these undervote ballots are in Hennepin ( Minneapolis ) , Ramsey ( St. Paul ) and St. Louis ( Brooklyn Center ) counties , all strong holds of Democratic voters .
But Coleman has other problems .
A group in Minnesota is requesting an FBI investigation into allegations that Sen.
Norm Coleman 's family received $ 75,000 in potentially illegal payments from a friend and benefactor .
This was cited in a debate in Minnesota in which Coleman targeted Franken for attacking his wife , but Franken stated that he was not attacking his wife , but Coleman 's " political sugar daddy . "
Yes , only in Minnesota .
Both Coleman and Franken are getting lawyered up , expect this to go to court after the hand recount .
Florida anyone ?
We all know Senator Ted Stevens was convicted , and is now a felon .
He could not even vote for himself .
We also know , if he wins this seat the senate is talking about expulsion .
And he should be kicked out .
We can't have a senator walking around capitol hill who is convicted , what kind of message is that sending ?
He has already been called upon to resign by colleagues on both sides of the aisle .
Well , the Democratic Candidate , Mark Begich was 3500 votes behind .
Alaska has NOW started to count the upwards of 100,000 early vote and absentee ballots , Anchorage Daily now reporting Begich is up by 3 votes .
Begich was in the lead in polling up to the day of the election , by many organizations and many was wondering what the hell happened for Stevens being ahead .
Well , since the votes are being counted , Begich just might win this seat .
Update : here Lastly , the Georgia Senate Seat is going for a December 2nd runoff .
The law in Georgia is that the candidate must get 50 % of the vote .
The tough part for the Democratic Candidate , Jim Martin , is to get everyone to vote again , in fact that may be an issue for Senator Saxby Chambliss .
The Obama Campaign are sending staff to Georgia and have their offices open .
Will Obama make an appearance ?
I do n't know .
That could be a double edge sword , we are talking about Georgia .
It would rev up the black vote , but also rev up the voters who did not vote Obama .
This is stictly a GOTV runoff , whoever get their voters to the polls will win this thing .

Abstract
Functional programming is largely untested in the industrial environment .
This paper summarises the results of a study into the suitability of Haskell in the area of text compression , an area with definite commercial interest .
Our program initially performs very poorly in comparison with a version written in C.
Experiments reveal the cause of this to be the large disparity in the relative speed of I/O and bit -- level operations and also a space leak inherent in the Haskell definition .
1 Introduction Claims for the advantages of functional programming languages abound [ 1 ] but industrial take -- up of the paradigm has been almost non--existent .
Two of the main reasons for this are : ffl lack of proof that the advantages apply to large -- scale developments ; ffl lack of industry -- strength compilers and environments , particularly for high speed computation .
The FLARE project , managed by BT , sets out to address these issues : " The effectiveness of functional programming has been amply ...

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia will stop developing some strategic weapons if the United States drops plans for a missile shield in Europe , Interfax news agency quoted the commander of Russia ’s strategic missile forces as saying on Friday .
Cadets in historical uniforms take part in a military parade in the Red Square in Moscow , November 7 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Denis Sinyakov
The remarks may be another step in Moscow ’s efforts to build ties with the incoming U.S. administration but also reflect difficulties Russia faces in financing its ambitious military programs at a time of global economic crisis .
“ If Americans give up plans to deploy the third positioning region and other elements of the strategic missile defense system then certainly we will adequately respond to it , ” Colonel - General Nikolai Solovtsov said .
“ We will simply not need a number of expensive programs , ” he added echoing earlier Kremlin overtures to the new U.S. administration .
U.S. plans to deploy in Europe elements of its projected missile shield , intended to avert potential strikes from Iran and North Korea , have been a factor in the deterioration of bilateral ties to the lowest point since the Cold War .
Russia says that U.S. plans to deploy interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic , described as the “ third positioning region ” are targeted against it .
President Dmitry Medvedev has said Russia will deploy Iskander missiles in its Kaliningrad enclave bordering NATO members Poland and Lithuania .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Medvedev and his predecessor Vladimir Putin , now prime minister , have also said Russia was designing new weapons , including strategic rockets , capable of breaking through any missile defense in the next 30 - 50 years .
OVERTURES
However Medvedev said last month he hoped U.S. President - elect Barack Obama will review missile defense plans and vowed that Russia will not be the first with missile deployments .
Medvedev has made clear Russia may agree to something less than a full U - turn by Washington on the missile shield if the United States came out with solid confidence - building measures .
“ Such measures cannot compensate a possible imbalance of forces , but they can ease tensions , ” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov , who oversees arms talks , told Interfax .
In the past few years , Russia ’s military budget has been growing by 30 percent a year .
The modernization of strategic nuclear forces was one of the key elements in Moscow ’s efforts .
Russia has planned to replace aging Soviet - era missiles with the new generation of weapons , including RS - 24 and Topol - M .
However , in the past months the Russian military have been actively conducting tests intended to verify whether the life span of the old missiles could be extended by at least 10 years .
Solovtsov said that the lifetime of the most powerful missile in the Russian arsenal -- RS - 20 known in the West as Satan -- could be prolonged to 30 from the current 20 years .
Satans , designed in mid-1970s and deployed throughout 1980s to match the then U.S. missile defense plan known as Star Wars , can carry up to 10 nuclear warheads .
The Russian generals say it can safely break through the new U.S. missile shield .

A PIONEERING
Welsh journalist who alerted the world to widespread famine in Stalin ’s Soviet Union is to receive a posthumous award from the Ukrainian government .
Gareth Jones , who wrote for the Western Mail , exposed the 1932 - 33 Ukrainian famine .
Millions died , but the Soviet authorities – and many western journalists – denied the catastrophe had even happened .
Jones and fellow reporter Malcolm Muggeridge are now revered in Ukraine , and both are to be posthumously given the country ’s Order of Freedom .
The award will be bestowed at a ceremony in Westminster on November 22 .
Discussion of the famine , in which as many as 10 million people died , was strictly suppressed , and Ukrainians themselves have only become fully aware of the events since the fall of communism .
When Jones announced at a press conference in Berlin on March 29 , 1933 , that millions were starving in Ukraine as a result of Stalin ’s five - year - plan , several foreign correspondents rushed to rubbish the story .
The most vocal was Walter Duranty of the New York Times , who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for his own reports on Stalin ’s Russia .
He dismissed Jones ’ eye - witness account as “ a big scare story ” and insisted there was “ no actual starvation ” .
In May 1932 the New York Times printed Mr Jones ’ response to the controversy .
In a furious attack on the coterie of foreign correspondents , Mr Jones congratulated “ the Soviet Foreign Office on its skill in concealing the true situation in the USSR ” .
Gareth Jones , who was born in Barry in 1905 , was regarded as one of the most talented journalists of his generation .
He wrote for The Western Mail , The Times and The Manchester Guardian as well as the Berliner Tageblatt and American newspapers .
In the 1930s he travelled through Russia and Ukraine – where his mother had lived – and was shocked at the famine conditions he encountered .
An estimated five to 10 million people died between 1932 and 1933 , an event Ukrainians call the Holodomor .
His career survived the controversy over the Ukrainian reports but his life was tragically cut short when he was murdered in 1935 while travelling in Inner Mongolia .
He was just 29 years old .
Mr Jones ’ niece Dr Siriol Colley has written a book about her campaigning uncle ’s life , A Manchukuo Incident , and has long sought for his work to be recognised .
She said : “ The Ukrainian people have taken him to their hearts – they call him the unsung hero .
“ He reported on Ukraine but also on the rise of Hitler and the US depression .
He did so much in his short life , and it is such a shame that all that knowledge died with him at such a young age . ”
Fedir Kurlak , chief executive of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain , said : “ I think for people to have lived for so long , for 70 years , without being able to properly tell others that their little brother , their mother or father died , or half the school died – for them to live with that for 70 years , indicates the terror that existed in that part of the world .
“ Look at how Gareth Jones went about the task of reporting in those kind of circumstances , under a ruthless totalitarian regime that was liquidating the population by the hundreds of thousands .
“ I ’m sure Gareth would have known if he had been caught reporting on the famine that he would have faced certain death . ”
He added : “ As far as the Ukrainian community is concerned , anyone who has heard of Gareth ’s exploits will quite simply take his hat off to him , and regard him as an exemplary journalist . ”
The Conservatives ' reaction was fast and furious to news that the opposition parties have signed off on a historic deal to kick them out of office and replace them with a coalition government .
His voice dripping with scorn , Prime Minister Stephen Harper yesterday accused Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion of playing " the biggest political game in Canadian history " and of relying on " socialists " ( New Democrats ) and " separatists " ( Bloc Québécois ) to vault himself into power .
Harper 's ministers and MPs used language like " deal with the devil " and " secret cabal " to describe the arrangement .
The suggestion was that the coalition deal was illegitimate and undemocratic , a coup d'etat .
It is nothing of the sort .
It is the way our parliamentary system works , especially in the immediate aftermath of the election of a minority Parliament .
Furthermore , the Harper government created an opening for the opposition parties last week by tabling a provocative " economic statement " that failed to address the economic crisis but contained poison pills it must have known they could not swallow .
Harper and his government took some steps away from those toxic measures last weekend , but it was too late .
The opposition had made up its collective mind that Harper could not be trusted .
With their demise perhaps less than a week away ( a non-confidence vote is scheduled for next Monday evening ) , the Conservatives are arguing that a change of government at this moment would be " very destabilizing " for the economy .
As if to underscore that point , the markets plunged yesterday ( although most analysts attributed the bulk of the losses to bad economic news from the U.S. ) .
But consider the alternatives to a change in government : either there would be another election ( which would leave the affairs of state suspended for the duration ) or Harper would remain in office with the opposition ready to pounce and defeat his government at every opportunity .
That is as unstable as it gets .
The coalition , meanwhile , has agreed to hold off elections until at least June 30 , 2011 – 2 1/ 2 years from now .
( The Bloc , which would not have a cabinet seat , has signed on until June 30 , 2010 . )
That should provide the stability needed for the government to grapple with the economic challenges facing Canada .
And grapple they promise to do in their accord , which features an economic stimulus package that includes " substantial new investments " in infrastructure and housing , support for the forestry and auto sectors , and enhancements in Employment Insurance .
All this should have been included in last week 's economic statement .
To be sure , there are questions to be answered about the coalition .
Canadians will want to know whether there are any worrisome side deals with the Bloc .
( Bloc Leader Gilles Duceppe said yesterday there is no agreement on " concrete " measures to enhance Quebec sovereignty . )
And what about the coalition 's foreign policy , notably on Afghanistan , where the Liberals and New Democrats have differed sharply in the past ?
Also problematic is the fact that , under the deal , Dion , the Liberals ' lame - duck leader , would serve as prime minister , at least until the new party leader is chosen next spring .
In the Oct. 14 election , Canadians resoundingly rejected Dion , who finished a poor third behind both Harper and Layton as " best prime minister " in all the opinion polls .
A wiser choice for interim prime minister might have been a Liberal stalwart like former finance minister Ralph Goodale .
It is also unclear whether the Liberal leadership candidates – Michael Ignatieff , Bob Rae and Dominic LeBlanc – would be given cabinet posts .
Again , it would be wise to keep them out , as they are going to be busy campaigning for the next five months .
Issues like these could still derail the coalition before the crucial vote next Monday .

That being said , a coalition government of Liberals and New Democrats is preferable at this time to a Conservative regime led by Harper , who has demonstrated that ideology and partisanship are more important to him than providing good government .

A Conservative Estimate of Total Direct U.S. Aid to Israel : Almost $ 114 Billion

Notes : FY 2000 military grants include $ 1.2 billion for the Wye agreement and $ 1.92 billion in annual military aid .
FY 2003 military aid included $ 1 billion from the supplemental appropriations bill .
The economic grant was earmarked for $ 960 million for FY 2000 but was reduced to meet the 0.38 % rescission .
Final amounts for FY 2003 are reduced by 0.65 % mandated rescission , the amounts for FY 2004 are reduced by 0.59 % , and the amounts for FY 2008 are reduced by .81 % .
Sources : CRS Report RL33222 : U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel , updated Jan. 2 , 2008 , plus the FY ’08 omnibus appropriations bill , H.R. 2764 .
This estimate of total U.S. direct aid to Israel updates the estimate given in the July 2006 issue of the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs .
It is an estimate because arriving at an exact figure is not possible , since parts of U.S. aid to Israel are a ) buried in the budgets of various U.S. agencies , mostly that of the Defense Department ( DOD ) , or b ) in a form not easily quantifiable , such as the early disbursement of aid , giving Israel a direct benefit in interest income and the U.S. Treasury a corresponding loss .
Given these caveats , our current estimate of cumulative total direct aid to Israel is $ 113.8554 billion .
It must be emphasized that this analysis is a conservative , defensible accounting of U.S. direct aid to Israel , NOT of Israel ’s cost to the U.S. or the American taxpayer , nor of the benefits to Israel of U.S. aid .
The distinction is important , because the indirect or consequential costs suffered by the U.S. as a result of its blind support for Israel exceed by many times the substantial amount of direct aid to Israel .
( See , for example , the late Thomas R. Stauffer ’s article in the June 2003 Washington Report on Middle East Affairs , “ The Costs to American Taxpayers of the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict : $ 3 Trillion . ” )
Especially , this computation does not include the costs resulting from the invasion and occupation of Iraq — hundreds of billions of dollars , 4,000 - plus U.S. and allied fatalities , untold tens of thousands of Iraqi deaths , and many thousands of other U.S. , allied , and Iraqi casualties — which is almost universally believed in the Arab world to have been undertaken for the benefit of Israel .
Among other “ indirect or consequential ” costs would be the costs of U.S. unilateral economic sanctions on Iran , Iraq , Libya and Syria , the costs to U.S. manufacturers of the Arab boycott , and the costs to U.S. companies and consumers of the 1973 Arab oil embargo and consequent and subsequent soaring oil prices partially as a result of U.S. support for Israel .
Among the real benefits to Israel that are not direct costs to the U.S. taxpayer are the early cash transfer of economic and military aid , in - country spending of a portion of military aid , and loan guarantees .
The U.S. gives Israel all of its economic and military aid directly in cash during the first month of the fiscal year , with no accounting required of how the funds are used .
Also , in contrast with other countries receiving military aid , who must purchase through the DOD , Israel deals directly with the U.S. companies , with no DOD review .
Furthermore , Israel is allowed to spend 26.3 percent of each year ’s military aid in Israel ( no other recipient of U.S. military aid gets this benefit ) , which has resulted in an increasingly sophisticated Israeli defense industry .
As a result , Israel has become a major world arms exporter ; the Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) reports that in 2006 Israel was the world ’s ninth leading supplier of arms worldwide , earning $ 4.4 billion from defense sales .
Another benefit to Israel are U.S. government loan guarantees .
The major loan guarantees have been $ 600 million for housing between 1972 and 1990 ; $ 9.2 billion for Soviet Jewish resettlement between 1992 and 1997 ; about $ 5 billion for refinancing military loans commercially ; and $ 9 billion in loan guarantees authorized in FY ’03 and extended to FY ’ 10 .
Of that $ 9 billion , CRS reports that Israel has drawn $ 4.1 billion through FY ’07 .
These loans have not — yet — cost the U.S. any money ; they are listed on the Treasury Department ’s books as “ contingent liabilities , ” which would be liabilities to the U.S. should Israel default .
However , they have been of substantial , tangible benefit to Israel , because they enable Israel to borrow commercially at special terms and favorable interest rates .
Components of Israel Aid
Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. aid since World War II ( not counting the huge sums being spent in Iraq ) .
The $ 3 billion or so per year that Israel receives from the U.S. amounts to about $ 500 per Israeli .
Most of this money is earmarked in the annual Foreign Operations ( foreign aid ) appropriations bills , with the three major items being military grants ( Foreign Military Financing , or FMF ) , economic grants ( Economic Support Funds , or ESF ) , and “ migration and refugee assistance . ”
( Refugee assistance originally was intended to help Israel absorb Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union , but this was expanded in 1985 to include all refugees resettling in Israel .
In fact , Israel does n’t differentiate between refugees and other immigrants , so this money is used for all immigrants to Israel . )
Not earmarked but also included in congresssional appropriations bills is Israel ’s portion of grants for American Schools and Hospitals Abroad ( ASHA ) and monies buried in the appropriations for other departments or agencies .
These are mostly for so - called “ U.S. - Israeli cooperative programs ” in defense , agriculture , science , and hi-tech industries .
Before 1998 , Israel received annually $ 1.8 billion in military grants and $ 1.2 billion in economic grants .
Then , beginning in FY ‘ 99 , the two countries agreed to reduce economic grants to Israel by $ 120 million and increase military grants by $ 60 million annually over 10 years .
FY ’08 is the last year of that agreement , with military grants reaching $ 2.4 billion ( reduced by an across - the - board rescission ) , and zero economic grants .
Then , in August 2007 , U.S. and Israeli officials signed a memorandum of understanding for a new 10 - year , $ 30 billion aid package whereby FMF will gradually increase , beginning with $ 2.55 billion in FY ’09 , and average $ 3 billion per year over the 10 - year period .

110-497 P.L. 110-161 Notes : H.R. =House Resolution ; S.=Senate Resolution ; H.Rept .=House Report ; the “ public law ” is the final , binding version , as signed by the president .
In FY ’04 , ’05 , and ’08 defense was passed separately and foreign aid was included in the consolidated or “ omnibus ” bill .
In FY ’07 defense was passed separately and foreign aid was included in the continuing resolution , H.J. Res. 20 , which continued ’07 appropriations at the ’06 level with some exceptions — including , of course , for Israel .
As with previous Washington Report on Middle East Affairs , estimates of U.S. aid to Israel , this analysis is based on the annual CRS report , U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel , which uses available and verifiable numbers , primarily from the foreign operations appropriations bills .
Although the CRS report does include such things as the old food for peace program , the $ 1.2 billion from the Wye agreement , the $ 1 billion in FMF included in the FY ’03 Emergency Supplemental appropriations bill , the subsidy for “ refugee resettlement , ” and money from the ASHA account , it does not include money from the DOD and other agencies .
Nor does it include estimated interest on the early disbursement of aid .
The January 2008 CRS report on aid to Israel shows a total of $ 101.1908 billion through FY ’07 .
Table 1 , on the previous page , is drawn from the summary table of that report , plus $ 2.4238 billion from the FY ’08 omnibus appropriations bill and estimates for ASHA and “ other ” amounts in FY ’08 , for a total of $ 103.6147 billion through FY ’08 .
To that has been added $ 10.2407 billion , as detailed below , for a grand total of $ 113.8554 billion .
Estimated Amounts Not Included in Table 1 : .2407 Billion
Defense Department Funds : $ 7.694 Billion .
For previous estimates , a search going back several years was able to identify $ 6.794 billion from the DOD to Israel through FY ” ˜06 .
Adding $ 450 million from the FY ’07 DOD appropriations and $ 450 million from the ’08 appropriations gives a total of $ 7.694 billion .
( The FY ’08 appropriations bill earmarks $ 155.6 million for Israel .
However , AIPAC ’s
Web site reported that the total for earmarked and non-earmarked programs was $ 450 million — and who would know better than the Israel lobby itself ? )
The military aid from the DOD budget is mostly for specific projects .
The largest items have been the canceled Lavi attack fighter project , the completed Merkava tank , the ongoing Arrow anti-missile missile project , and several other anti-missile systems , most recently the “ David ’s Sling ” short - range missile defense system .
Haaretz reported in June that a senior U.S. defense official has said the U.S. will support and help Israel ’s development of the advanced Arrow 3 designed to intercept advanced ballistic missiles .
The fact that the U.S. military was not interested in the Lavi or the Merkava for its own use and has said the same thing about the Arrow and the other anti-missile projects would seem to jettison the argument that these are “ joint defense projects . ”
The FY ” ˜01 appropriations bill also gave Israel a grant of $ 700 million worth of military equipment , to be drawn down from stocks in Western Europe , and the FY ’05 defense appropriations bill includes a provision authorizing the DOD to transfer an unspecified amount of “ surplus ” military items from inventory to Israel .
In addition , since 1988 Israel has been designated a “ major non-NATO ally , ” giving it access to U.S. weapons systems at lower prices , and preferential treatment in bidding for U.S. defense contracts .
Interest : $ 2.089 Billion .
Israel receives its U.S. economic and military aid in a lump sum within one month of the new fiscal year or the passage of the appropriations act .
Applying one - half of the prevailing interest rate to the aid for each year ( on the assumption that the aid monies are drawn down over the course of the year ) , the July 2006 estimate arrived at a total of $ 1.991 billion through FY ’06 .
To that , using an interest rate of 4 percent , is added $ 50 million for FY ’07 and $ 48 million for FY ’08 , for a cumulative total of $ 2.089 billion through FY ’08 .
Other Grants and Endowments : $ 457.7 Million .
The July 2006 report included $ 456.7 million in U.S. grants and endowments to U.S. - Israeli scientific and business cooperation organizations .
The two largest are the BIRD ( Israel - U.S. Binational Research & Development ) Foundation and the BARD ( Binational Agriculture and Research and Development ) Fund .
While these are mostly self - sustaining , the BARD Fund gets about $ 500,000 a year from the Agriculture Department .
Adding $ 0.5 million for each of FY ’07 and ” ˜08 to the ’06 total gives a new total of $ 0.457.7 billion .
For the convenience of those who wish to look up more details , citations for the foreign aid and DOD appropriations bills for the past five years are given in Table 2 above .

This " Just think about it , " said comedian Lewis Black in a recent installment ; " two months before he even takes office , Barack Obama has already earned a permanent place on ' Mount Crapmore . ' "
Black took the time in a recent " Back in Black " segment to chronicle the various ways in which merchandisers have invited hot - pocketed revelers to commemorate President - elect Obama 's historic ascent .
Items available include souvenir coins , collector plates and specially branded prophylactics .
Said Black : " The election of Barack Obama has once again demonstrated America 's greatest gift : Our capacity to embrace hope and idealism ... and then turn it into worthless , disposable crap ! "

This is a lengthy note to myself .
I initially wanted to capture the thinking that went into the construction of mod_atom while it was still fresh in my mind , and dumped out the first dozen or so sections .
Then as I expanded and refactored the code , I find that I ’m keeping this up to date .
This mostly by way of putting it in a place where I wo n’t lose it .
I can write stuff for ongoing faster than for any other medium , and “ On the Net ” is a good place not to lose stuff .
If mod_atom eventually gets picked up and used , this may be useful to me or anyone else who ’s maintaining it ; and if it does n’t , there ’ll still eventually be an AtomPub server module for Apache , and this might be useful to whoever builds it .
But this is not designed to be entertaining or pedagogical ; among other things , it ’s in essentially random order .
I ’m publishing it in November 2008 , 14 months after I started writing it , because I ’m giving the first - ever public speech about mod-atom at ApacheCon 2008 and I want something to point at should anyone be interested .
What ’s a “ Publication ” ?
· mod_atom is built around the notion of a “ Publication ” , which has a one - to - one correspondence with a “ Service Document ” as described in RFC5023 .
There is a strong notion of a publication which is expected to have at least one Entry collection ( to which Atom Entries can be POSTed ) and one Media collection ( to which any old bag of bits can be POSTed ) .
Abbreviations & Nomenclature · By “ Apache ” I mean the code produced by the Apache Software Foundation ’s HTTP Server Project , often called “ httpd ” but this is misleading as the executable sometimes runs under the name “ apache ” or “ apache2 ” .
Specifically , I ’m referring to the version against which mod_atom was developed , 2.2 .*.
To keep function names reasonably short , MLE stands for Media Link Entry , and FP stands for Front Page , i.e. the “ index.html ” thingie that is the face a publication shows to the world .
Pub stands for “ publication ” , which in the mod_atom context means the set of collections described by one AtomPub Service Document .
A “ Feed ” is an Atom document whose root is < atom : feed > .
A “ Collection ” is a Feed as used in RFC5023 , it can accept POST requests to create new resources .
Files and URIs · The default operations of Apache assume file - backed resources .
Thus mod_atom ’s mapping from URI into filesystem space gets quite a bit of support from the infrastructure .
Mostly Static · mod_atom tries to impose the minimum possible tax on the URI processing path .
It has to check every URI going through the server to see if it applies to a pub , and re-write those that do from URI into filesystem space .
Then almost all GET requests can be tossed back to Apache ’s static - file processor without further intervention .
There ’s an exception when you have to fetch anything but the first twenty entries out of a feed .
The feed URI takes count= and start= query parameters and generates the feed dynamically when it sees them .
Otherwise , in general each URI in a publication is mapped to an actual static on - disk file .
Use the Source , Luke ! ·
The main body of code is reasonably well commented , and there are several page - fulls of explanation at the top of mod_atom.c , which are really essential to understanding the details .
Where Stuff Goes · Suppose there ’s a publication with its URI space rooted at / pubs / tim and the corresponding directory space rooted at / a4 / app / tim .
The URI space for a pub has two subtrees , beginning pub / and atom / .
In fact , they are backed by a single directory structure ( beginning / pub ) . mod_atom only allows POST , PUT , and DELETE requests ( as used in AtomPub ) to be routed to the URI space beginning with atom / .
The goal is to keep your security setup simple .
With < Location > directive , you can apply rigorous TLS + authent security to the atom / subtree , while leaving the pub / subtree wide - open .
The actual subtree layout is described at exhaustive length in the comments at the top of mod_atom .c .
The software has knowledge of this directory layout wired in at a deep level .
Changing it much would probably be quite expensive in terms of refactoring / recoding cost .
The “ Extras ” PUT Playground ·
To maintain a publication , you need more than just the Entry and Media files that AtomPub makes it easy to do CRUD on .
You need ancillary files ; CSS and JavaScript and chunks of random XML and logo - ware and so on .
To support this , the top - level pub / directory has an x / ( for “ extras ” ) subdirectory , which starts out populated with templates / and css / and js / and options / directories .
mod_atom allows unrestricted PUT and DELETE to anywhere under atom / x / ; the idea is that you can use it as a sandbox ( probably with the same access - control that applies to the whole atom / subtree ) for your ancillary files .
It allows unrestricted creation and deletion of directories , with automatic recursion as required .
ID Elements · Every Atom feed and entry has to have a unique ID .
mod_atom uses the urn : uuid style .
The directory structure is such that there ’s only one feed per directory , which also contains a file named id .
( note the dot ) that contains only the feed ’s unique identifier .
This exists so that when you re-create a collection you do n’t have to read and parse the existing collection to find the ID string .
Element Updates and the Iterator ·
When you create a new resource with POST , it goes into a directory whose pathname encodes the current date along YYYY / MM / DD lines .
Feeds are generated by a directory iterator ( see iterator.c ) that walks backward through these YYYY / MM / DD directories , returning entries one at a time .
When you update a resource with PUT , it creates a new “ Link ” file with an uninteresting name in the current ( that is , date of the PUT ) YYYY / MM / DD directory , which contains only the actual full pathname of the file that was updated .
The iterator uses these to generate a feed which is still reverse chronologically ordered in the face of updates .
When an entry is updated multiple times , or updated then deleted , there ’s no effort made to remove obsolete link files .
These are detected in later iterator scans and removed on a side - effect basis , making the Link / PUT system self - maintaining .
Object - Orientation , or Not ·
The Apache code manages to have a fairly object - oriented feel even though it ’s in C , because the key routines all expect to take a request_rec as an argument .
mod_atom has three important structures : pub_t and entry_t , packages of information about the things implied by their names .
These are read and written in a fairly ad - hoc way and mostly exist to keep function argument lists under control ; so despite appearances , the design of mod_atom really is n’t very O - O at all .
There ’s a very linear per-request control flow starting at the beginning and proceeding through to the ending .
I wonder , if I were re-doing this now , knowing how it ’s done , I ’d refactor to have seriously Object - like constructs for Entry and Pub and Media .
I do n’t think it would help that much , but at the same time I ’m sure that if I were re-writing it in Java or Ruby , would n’t think twice .
I wonder if there ’s a lesson here ?
Generating HTML
· mod_atom can operate either as a pure “ Atom Store ” , performing CRUD only on Atom Entries and Collections ; or , it can operate as a blog publishing system , generating HTML and public - facing Atom Feeds and so on .
HTML publishing is turned on by the existence of a resource named pub / x / options / html .
HTML and Tidy ·
When mod_atom receives a POSTed or PUT entry , and HTML is to be generated , the content , in particular the “ text constructs ” ( see RFC4287 ) need to be parsed , so that sanitization rules can be applied .
For those that are marked as XHTML , this is trivially accomplished using Apache ’s built - in parser .
Text that comes in marked with type = " html " is a tougher nut to crack .
I found two plausible candidates for HTML parsing : TidyLib and libxml2 .
My research did not find anything online that suggested either was qualitatively better than the other , so I chose TidyLib on the basis that the library you link to is an order of magnitude smaller .
Since Apache ’s XML object model is different from Tidy ’s , this means there is replicated sanitization and persistence code ; oh well .
XML In · Apache has expat compiled in , and there ’s a call that makes it easy to point it at either the client request or file and get a tree structure , both of which mod_atom uses .
Over the years , I ’ve done relatively little with trees , preferring stream parsers , for robustness .
It turns out that Apache already has settings to set a hard limit on the size of XML object it ’ll try to parse , so I figured it would be OK to allow it to parse individual Atom entries into a tree .
Apache ’s XML support has a whole bunch of special - purpose connections to DAV , but you can mostly ignore them .
The object model itself is kind of nice ; it forces you to walk through lined lists of adjacent text chunks , but aside from that I found that it pretty well got out of the way .
I eventually created a separate function bundle in children.c to capture a few repeated patterns of child - walking to pick up this or that .
Tidy ’s is n’t as slick , but it did n’t cause any pain .
I ’ve already complained about the interface you have to use for a memory allocator .
Whatever .
There ’s one instance of fairly horrible code that makes me think I ’m doing something wrong : when I get some media bits POSTed , I have to cook up a Media Link Entry .
So I hand - construct an XML tree for the purpose ; see make_mle_shell .
Blecch .
XML
Out · mod_atom needs to write quite a bit of XML .
Apache does have a an apr_xml_to_text call , but there was a pretty severe impedence mismatch with my needs .
To start with , I wanted to pump stuff into the XML output straight from the program , without having to wire it into a tree .
Second , pumping out the XML as you generate was more natural to code ( and also probably a memory - saver ) .
So I used my own Genx library for the purpose .
It has the virtue of being small - ish and pretty well - tested , in production here & there around the Net .
It makes it really difficult to generate output that ’s not well - formed .
It has a few problems , too .
The API was a little kludgy ; enough that there ’s a chunk of code in genx_glue .c that automates common cases and makes code more readable .
Also , since it generates not only well - formed but canonical XML , you ’ve got a real problem when you find something like &nbps ; in incoming HTML - encoded data .
As a result , there ’s actually a table of all the XHTML 1.1 entity names in the code , and mod_atom turns all those into the actual Unicode character values in the output .
And , as a side - effect , all Text Constructs that come in marked type = " html " go out marked type = " xhtml " .
Which I think is n’t actually harmful .
Error Reporting ·
There are two kinds of errors ; client protocol errors ( e.g. an Entry without a title ) which should be reported back to the client in enough detail that there ’s a chance of fixing them , and internal errors ( e.g. “ Ca n’t open file ” ) .
In each case , the error should probably be recorded in the apache logfile .
Apache does n’t make it particularly easy to send a body back to the client with an error return code .
mod_dav uses a fairly strained - looking techniqe , and at the moment mod_atom does really nothing useful , just returning the best - available HTTP status code with no explanation .
Wiring in mod_dav style error bodies is on the to - do list .
This should probably be done anywhere you see an instance of
return HTTP_<X >
where X is anything but INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR , NOT_FOUND , or NO_CONTENT .
Also , the error - reporting structure inside mod_atom is kind of ad - hoc and maybe needs refactoring .
Some returns return an OK or an HTTP error code ; others return an apr_status_t , and still others return a char * ; NULL on success , otherwise an error message .
There may actually be a case for having both these options , but I ’m not sure the optimal choices have been made .
Finally , when you get an error in the HTML - generation phase , which does n’t start until the Atom Store work is done , this does not cause the client to see an HTTP error ( although it is sent to the server logfile ) .
Is this correct ?
Startup ·
When httd starts up , it invokes mod_atom to process each AtomPub directive in the config file .
There are two directives ; here ’s a sample of each :
AtomPub / joe / Users / joe / Public / blog " Joe ’s Blog " " Joe Smith " AtomMetaPub / blogs / var / blogs " Default title " " Default user "
In each case , the first argument is the root in URI - space , the second the root in filespace .
AtomPub declares a single pub , AtomMetaPub a facility for managing pubs ( more on that later ) .
mod_atom checks to see if a blog specified by the directive exists , and if it does n’t , creates an empty directory framework , and empty feed files , from scratch .
Apache startup is in itself a little weird .
It runs through the config - processing process twice , once to check whether the file is correct and the directive processing does n’t blow up , the second time “ for real ” .
At the moment , mod_atom just does all its initialization twice in a row , not trying to avoid doing anything twice .
This does n’t seem to cause any problems .
Pub CRUD · A publication declared with AtomMetaPub ( let ’s call it a meta- pub ) has an Atompub Service Doc and talks the Atompub protocol , but new publications ( let ’s call them sub- pubs ) are created , updated and deleted as a side - effect .
( Let ’s just say “ meta ” and “ sub ” like in the comments . )
Thus , the collection feed for a meta constitutes a directory of subs .
Suppose the meta is rooted at / foo .
Then there will be 100 subdirectories , s00 through s99 .
When a new sub is created , it gets some sort of short name via regular Slug processing ( say submarine ) , and one of the subdirectories ( say s37 ) is chosen at random .
Then the sub ’s root is / foo / s37 / submarine /
To help discovery , in the meta ’s feed , the entry will contain a link like so :
< link rel=" publication " href= " /foo/s37/submarine/atom/pub.atomsvc " />
When you DELETE the entry in the meta collection that represents ( in some sense ) the sub , the whole sub is just deleted lock , stock , and barrel .
Templating · The HTML generation system is described in Autumnal mod_atom .
I invented a templating system because I could n’t find one that seemed a very good match for mod_atom ’s needs .
It ’s straightforward if fairly tedious code ; check out run_fp_template and run_fp_template_element .
The only trick is that for the front - page template you need to interrupt generating the page in the middle of the template where it says “ put the entries here ” , so there ’s a little bit of recursive shuck - and - jive with a state variable ; the first time , as an adult programmer , that I really wished I ’d had continuations .
Globals · Apache modules are by default constructed with the use of only one global variable , the “ module ” structure , which has pointers to structures describing how to handle that module ’s directives and which which event hooks the module would like to be invoked for .
Since mod_atom ’s code extends across several C source files , this does n’t work .
However , we ’d like to be careful not to pollute the global function namespace .
So , everything that ’s visible outside the scope of one source file has one of the prefixes “ atom_ ” , “ genx_ ” , or “ Tidy ” .
This makes for some long and ugly function names .
In general an Apache module can’t have mutable global variables because Apache can run in threaded mode , requiring you to implement access control .
mod_atom does have some global variables , and even writes to them , but only at initialization time , which is single - threaded ; accesses are read - only at run-time .
atom_join ·
In the process of mapping between URI space and filesystem space , mod_atom does a tremendous amount of cutting and splicing of UNIX - style pathnames .
The book - keeping that goes witih this in order to keep the slashes in the right space is awkward and tedious , so the atom_join ( ) function does this ; it takes a variable number of arguments , the last of which must be NULL , and splices them together , making sure the segments are separated by exactly one slash .
Concurrency ·
It ’s hard ; let ’s go shopping .
For individual resource creation , mod_atom pushes the concurrency issues down into the filesystem , which seems pretty bullet - proof .
There is exactly one place where it is necessary mutex :
When you ’re doing a PUT to a resource , there ’s a critical session while you compute its ETag and compare that to the If - Match request header .
I think there ’s no way around mutexing this ; you have to lock others out while you compute the ETag , decide whether or not to take the update , and then maybe apply it .
This is accomplished with APR ’s file - locking code , not on the resource itself but on a stub file of the same name with “ . mutex ” appended .
Sluggishness · Slug processing is pretty brutal .
The text is de-%- escaped , which is supposed to give you UTF - 8 .
Then any characters which are n’t legal UTF - 8 or XML are silently crushed out .
Then we remove leading and trailing dashes , and all characters which are not XML NameChars , or are ‘.’ , are replaced with hyphens .
If there ’s no slug , or there ’s something horribly wrong with it , and it ’s an Atom entry that ’s being posted , we try to use the text from its atom : title element .
Failing that , filenames are just random numbers .
If you send multiple posts in successions with the same Slug , mod_atom tries appending random numbers , and if that does n’t work after a couple of tries , gives up and declares an error .
Security ·
In a typical publication , there are parts that you want to expose to the world and parts that require access control .
There are a variety of Apache Directives that you can use to support access control .
mod_atom enforces two run-time policies to aid in managing your security setup :
POST , PUT , and DELETE operations are rejected unless their target URI has / atom / immediately after the publication ’s root .
GET operations are also rejected unless the / atom / path - step occurs similarly in the URI .
Let ’s assume the same customization discussed above :
AtomPub / joe / Users / joe / Public / blog " Joe ’s Blog " " Joe Smith " AtomMetaPub / blogs / var / blogs " Default title " " Default user "
Requiring basic authentication for access to the / atom / - based parts of the URI space could be done with Apache configuration directives as follows :
< Location / joe / atom > AuthType Basic AuthName JoeBlog - admin AuthUserFile / var / blog - admin / passwd Require user joe </ Location > < LocationMatch / blogs / s [ 0 - 9 ] [ 0 - 9 ] >
AuthType Basic AuthName Blog- Publishers AuthUserFile /var / blog- admin / passwd Require valid-user </ LocationMatch >
This could be done in a similar fashion using < Directory > directives if you wanted to work from file paths as opposed to URIs .
Supporting app:draft ·
If an entry is POSTED with app : draft set , an Atom entry is created and the collection , but neither the public - facing feed nor the HTML version , is updated to show it .
Should it eventually be PUT with app : draft removed , the public - facing HTML and feeds are created .
Extensions and entry / content@type ·
When the HTML version of an entry is generated , its extension depends on the value of the type attribute of its atom : content element .
If it ’s absent or text , a . text file is created .
If it ’s html or xhtml , an .html file is created .
Lazy Feed Generation ·
Whenever an entry is created , updated , or deleted , a file named timestamp is updated in the root directory of its collection .
When mod_atom is handling a GET request for the collection file , or the public - facing feed file or front page files which are generated from it , the timestamp of the collection file is compared against that of the timestamp file , and all three ( collection , feed , and index.html ) are regenerated prior to serving the request .
This removes some tricky race - condition scenarios and also makes heavy update streams more survivable .
To Do ·
The gunman reportedly asked for a refund and compensation
A man complaining that impotence tablets he bought did not work has shot and injured a saleswoman at a north Moscow sex shop , Russian media report .
He drew a pistol and shot the woman at least once in the heat of a row over tablets he had apparently bought the day before , a police source said .
The saleswoman was being treated in hospital where her condition was not immediately clear .
Police in the Russian capital are hunting for her attacker .
He entered the shop on Angarskaya St at around 1800 ( 1500 GMT ) on Wednesday , complaining the tablets he had bought " did n't help " and demanding both a refund and compensation , an unnamed Moscow police source told Interfax news agency .
When the saleswoman refused his demands and an argument erupted , he produced the gun and shot her once before fleeing from the shop .
Ria-Novosti news agency , again quoting an unnamed police source , reports that the 30 - year - old woman was hit by two shots from the pistol .
Someday , when we stop congratulating ourselves for electing Barack Obama , we may realize that he 's actually a politician and many of his closest advisers are n't washed up left - wing terrorists ideologues , they 're political fixers and fund - raisers .
His very first appointment , naming Rahm Emanuel as his chief of staff , decisively demonstrates this .
As it turns out , Emanuel is not just a product of the Cook County political machinery .
He 's also Wall Street 's favorite lawmaker , garnering more donations from financial firms than just about anyone else on the planet , according to the Washington Examiner 's Tim Carney .
" His record suggests he will be the financial industry ’s man inside the Obama White House , " Tim ( my brother ) writes .
" At a time when the Washington - Wall Street relationship is changing rapidly , will Emanuel be the man to guarantee it ’s change the Wall Street firms need ? "
Tim explains the depth of this connection :
Considering Obama ’s promises to stand up for Main Street and take on Wall Street , Emanuel ’s deep ties with Wall Street are noteworthy .
Emanuel was a chief advocate of the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout this fall , toiling to pass it through the House after it was first rejected .
Just as Emanuel has helped Wall Street , Wall Street has helped Emanuel .
This past election cycle , more than a third of Emanuel ’s campaign contributions from political action committees came from financial sector PACs .
His top source of campaign funds this year was the subprime - rattled UBS ( the Swiss bank ’s PAC and employees gave , corporations cannot give campaign contributions ) , who benefited from the housing bailout which Emanuel supported and has already shown an interest in expanding .
Hedge funds and private equity firms are also close with Emanuel .
Over his career , Emanuel ’s best source of funds has been the private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners .
Hedge funds , facing a new slew of regulations , handouts , and rules , dramatically increased their contributions this year , and Emanuel was also their favorite House member .
The $ 96,900 Emanuel pulled in from hedge funds places him above any Senator besides presidential candidates .
In fact , Emanuel garnered from hedge funds more than the top 11 Republican lawmakers , combined .
Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are also in Emanuel ’s top - five career sources of campaign cash .
As reported by the Center for Responsive Politics , Emanuel received more money from the securities and investment industry — $ 600,500 as of September 30 — than did any other member of the U.S. House , and more than two presidential candidates ( including Joe Biden ) and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee .
Commercial banks lined Emanuel ’s pockets , too , with $ 121,100 , placing him fourth among House members .
The other day , a client called upon me to perform a hardware and software inventory on all of the computers on his network .
There were n't that many machines to inventory , but we needed to gather quite a bit of information about each one .
The client was a Microsoft shop and so I had to deal with about an even mix of Windows XP and Vista with a few Windows 95 , 98 , and ME machines thrown in for good measure .
So off I went , with an Excel spreadsheet in hand .
I visited each machine in person .
For each machine , I wanted the network configuration , the workgroup configuration , and the hardware configuration .
We also wanted to know what software was installed as well as which drivers were being used .
Bonus points for being able to determine what USB devices were being used .
Needless to say , this was tedious work .
Some of the data , such as the network configuration , was available in the same place on each platform , the command line .
Other information was only available at various control panels , and they varied by platform .
Granted , things might have been easier if I was a bit more proficient in using Windows .
But it got me to thinking .
How would I do this job if I were working in a Linux shop ?
How much of this information could I gather ?
Where would I look ?
How hard would it be ?
It turns out that Linux keeps most of this information in fairly standardized locations .
The rest of the information , such as installed software , can be had with just a few platform - specific commands .
I 'm fond of telling people that “ everything is easier in Linux . ”
This statement stems from the fact that I do n't find myself “ hunting ” for just the right menu or GUI widget that I need to get a task done .
Now sure , I 'm demonstrating a bias that I have formed based on years of experience with Linux .
But by the end of this article , I hope you see how easy it is to interrogate a machine with just a few commands .
Now let 's get started .
First , we need to get the complete network configuration .
Once we log in , we see the machine 's hostname as part of our shell prompt .
We can take a quick look at the DNS configuration with “ cat /etc/resolv.conf ” .
Before going on , we 'll simply verify that the DNS configuration looks right .
Then we 'll get a list of network interfaces , as well as their IP and MAC addresses with “ ifconfig - a ” .
eth0 Link encap : Ethernet HWaddr 00:17:31:64:B0 : BD inet addr:10.0.1.56 Bcast : 10.0.1.255 Mask :255.255.255.0 inet6 addr : fe80::217:31ff:fe64:b0bd/64 Scope : Link UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets : 127554145 errors:255 dropped:0 overruns : 0 frame :255 TX packets : 84151845 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns : 0 carrier : 0 collisions :0 txqueuelen : 1000 RX bytes :3916476961 ( 3735.0 Mb ) TX bytes : 4229971584 ( 4034.0 Mb ) Interrupt :16 Base address :0x6000 lo Link encap : Local Loopback inet addr:127.0.0.1 Mask : 255.0.0.0 inet6 addr : ::1/128 Scope : Host UP LOOPBACK RUNNING MTU:16436 Metric:1 RX packets : 68839 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns : 0 frame:0 TX packets : 68839 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns : 0 carrier : 0 collisions : 0 txqueuelen:0 RX bytes :2933412 ( 2.7 Mb ) TX bytes : 2933412 ( 2.7 Mb )
From this , we can gleen the IP address as well as the MAC address of the Ethernet interface .
We 'll ignore the Loopback interface .
We can take a quick look at the routing table to make sure there 's nothing strange going on with the “ route - n ” command .
Kernel IP routing table Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface 10.0.1.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 eth0 127.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 U 0 0 0 lo 0.0.0.0 10.0.1.1 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth0
The default gateway , 10.0.1.1 , looks right , so we move on .
Well , that 's the network configuration , but what kind of machine is this ?
We can gather a lot of information from the / proc filesystem .
For example , we can find out what kind of CPU is installed with the “ cat / proc / cpuinfo ” command .
processor : 0 vendor_id : AuthenticAMD cpu family : 15 model : 35 model name : AMD Athlon ( tm ) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4200 + stepping : 2 cpu MHz : 2200.000 cache size : 512 KB physical id : 0 siblings : 2 core id : 0 cpu cores : 2 fdiv_bug : no hlt_bug : no f00 f_bug : no coma_bug : no fpu : yes fpu_exception : yes cpuid level : 1 wp : yes flags : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush mmx fxsr sse sse2 ht syscall nx mmxext fxsr_opt lm 3 dnowext 3 dnow pni lahf_lm cmp_legacy ts fid vid ttp bogomips : 4425.38 processor : 1 vendor_id : AuthenticAMD cpu family : 15 model : 35 model name : AMD Athlon ( tm ) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4200 + stepping : 2 cpu MHz : 2200.000 cache size : 512 KB physical id : 0 siblings : 2 core id : 1 cpu cores : 2 fdiv_bug : no hlt_bug : no f00 f_bug : no coma_bug : no fpu : yes fpu_exception : yes cpuid level : 1 wp : yes flags : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush mmx fxsr sse sse2 ht syscall nx mmxext fxsr_opt lm 3 dnowext 3 dnow pni lahf_lm cmp_legacy ts fid vid ttp bogomips : 4422.96
As you can see , I 'm using an AMD Athlon 64 ( 4200 + ) with 2 cores .
You can even see that Linux checks for some of the Intel / AMD CPU bugs that have been found over the years , as well some of the special instruction sets that have evolved , such as MMX or 3dnow .
We can determine how much memory is installed by looking at the size of / proc / kcore with the “ ls - lah / proc / kcore ” command , which will print the file size in human - friendly format .
-r-------- 1 root root 897M Oct 15 12:31 / proc/kcore
We 'll just round that 897 M up to 1G , since the kernel uses some of the installed memory .
It sure would be nice to find out what hardware is installed without having to open the chassis .
This is as easy as using the lspci command .

As you can see , I 've got an nVidia GeForce FX 5200 video card and nVidia CK804 AC '97 soundcard on my system 's motherboard .
You can also see that I 've got USB .
More on that in a moment .
Not every Linux distribution installs lspci by default ; you should do this anytime you build a new machine , though .
Sometimes you get called upon to fix a hardware problem where the device just does n't seem to work right .
Soundcards are the typical example and the problem is usually caused by an IRQ conflict or having an IRQ shared with another busy device such as the hard drive or network interface .
We can tell what interrupts are being used by what with the “ cat / proc / interrupts ” command

We can quickly assess our hard drive configuration with the “ fdisk - l /dev / ?d ? ” command .
Disk / dev/hda : 320.0 GB , 320072933376 bytes 255 heads , 63 sectors / track , 38913 cylinders Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System / dev/hda1 1 13 104391 83 Linux / dev/hda2 14 76 506047 + 82 Linux swap / Solaris / dev/hda3 77 3812 30009420 83 Linux / dev/hda4 3813 38913 281948782+ 83 Linux Disk / dev/hdb : 250.0 GB , 250059350016 bytes 255 heads , 63 sectors / track , 30401 cylinders Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System / dev/hdb1 1 30401 244196001 83 Linux Disk / dev/hdc : 251.0 GB , 251000193024 bytes 255 heads , 63 sectors / track , 30515 cylinders Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System / dev/hdc1 1 30515 245111706 83 Linux
Here you can see that I 've got 3 IDE drives .
Using the “ ? ” wildcard in the command line makes this go much faster .
By the way , if you wanted to know what type of hard drive / dev/hda was , you could ask with this command , “ cat / proc/ide/hda / model ”
The results of this command on my machine are “ WDC WD3200JB - 00KFA0 , ” which indicates that my / dev/hda is a Western Digital Caviar 320 Gb .
This is a case where Google is your friend .
Speaking of harddrives , we can determine which filesystems our system supports by looking at the / proc / filesystems file .
The results are intuitive , so I 'll leave it as an exercise for the reader .
If the kernel was configured to support it , the / proc / config.gz file is a compressed file that contains the configuration of the currently running kernel .
This file , once uncompressed , is suitable for use as the .config file found in the root of the Linux Kernel source tree .
By capturing this file , you can reproduce , and make changes to the current kernel configuration .
Of course many of the device drivers in the Linux Kernel load as dynamically loaded modules .
We can determine which drivers are loaded this way by using the lsmod command .
Module Size Used by nvidia 7096684 48 vboxdrv 66928 0
Sometimes a driver requires another driver in order to operate .
This situation would be indicated in the “ Used by ” column .
Remember earlier when I said we'd get bonus points for identifying what was plugged into the USB ports ?
Well we can easily do this with the lsusb command .
Bus 001 Device 001 : ID 0000:0000 Bus 002 Device 002 : ID 413c:1002 Dell Computer Corp. Keyboard Hub Bus 002 Device 004 : ID 413c:2002 Dell Computer Corp. SK - 8125 Keyboard Bus 002 Device 001 : ID 0000:0000
And finally , we need to get a list of the installed software .
RPM - based distributions give us this information with the “ rpm - qa ” command .
I do n't use Debian , but I 'm told you can use the “ dpkg - l ” command to get a list of installed packages .
Under Gentoo , I 'd use “ emerge -- pretend -- emptytree world ” or install the qpkg tool .
At this point , we know almost everything there is to know about the machine .
The Linux Kernel has other secrets though , and I encourage you to poke around in the / proc and /sys filesystems to find them .
Though some of these commands require root privilege , none of them required a GUI , a mouse , or even physical access to the machine .
If you had a login and root password , you could do all of this remotely and even automate it with a script .
See , I told you it would be easy !
[ / caption ]
Images of layered sedimentary deposits and deltas on Mars have provided evidence for lakes and flowing rivers that carried eroded material downstream .
A team of researchers also believes there is evidence for precipitation in the Red Planet ’s past .
“ For years scientists have been suspecting that the current appearance of the landscape has , in part , been shaped by rivers that cut into the surface , ” said Ernst Hauber of the German Aerospace Center .
â€ œWe can see layered sediments where these valleys open into impact craters .
The shape of certain sediments is typical for deltas formed in standing water . ”
Hauber and his team also believe that surface runoff from rain or snowmelt completes the picture of past water on Mars .
The researchers explored the Xanthe Terra area located near the equator in the Martian highlands using image from four cameras on three different spacecraft ; High - Resolution Stereo Camera ( HRSC ) on board the European Mars Express mission , the Mars Orbiter Camera ( MOC ) from NASA ’s Mars Global Surveyor Mission and the HiRISE and CTX camera experiments on board NASA ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) mission .
The images paint this picture of Mars ’ past :
About four billion years ago , there were lakes on the Red Planet which may have been fed by short - lived rivers that were , in turn , fed by precipitation .
These lakes filled craters that were formed by the impact of meteorites .
Water accumulated in places where rivers broke through the crater rims .
Deltas were formed at the mouths of the rivers , similar to how they are formed where rivers flow into lakes or seas on Earth .
The researchers say were also able to narrow down the period when the craters were filled with lakes by analyzing the distribution of impact craters of different sizes , which gives an indication of the age of a planetary surface .
The more craters are counted on a surface , the older the area is .
The crater counts revealed that water was flowing through the valleys between about 3.8 and 4 billion years ago .
The valleys themselves could have formed relatively fast , and the deposits could have formed over a period ranging from decades to millennia .
But what led the researchers to surmise that there must have been precipitation on early Mars ?
“ This is actually not at all self - evident : for a long time , scientists have been trying to figure out whether the valleys on Mars were formed by groundwater seepage and headward erosion , or by surface runoff caused by rainfall or snowmelt ” , said Hauber .
His team believes surface runoff was the cause .
“ Our findings also point in this direction and we are convinced that both processes have played an important role in Xanthe Terra ” .
However , this situation did not last very long .
Between 3.5 and 3.8 billion years ago , the precipitation became less intense and the valleys dried up .
Erosion on Mars has been minimal ever since , which has contributed to the fact that deposits can still be observed although they should in fact be very susceptible to erosion .
Today , Mars is a dry desert planet and water is no longer flowing through its valleys .

This is an Abandoned Missile Launch Site .
What it differs from other of such kind is that it has launched really big rockets that traveled to orbit , and what else – it was not destroyed like all the other sites left by Soviet army but is left untouched in the desert of Kazakhstan for anyone to visit .

All that is solid melts into air .
The sketch of the project .
I grew up Catholic and did go to church quite often some years ago and I never heard any politics mentioned from the pulpit .
This is beyond disgraceful , but in today 's times it happens every day among the extreme religious right .
C&Ler Jay emailed me the info :
Dedication of the Lateran Basilica in Rome 9 November 2008 Dear Friends in Christ , We the People have spoken , and the 44th President of the United States will be Barack Hussein Obama .
This election ends a political process that started two years ago and which has revealed deep and bitter divisions within the United States and also within the Catholic Church in the United States .
Between these two visions of the use of lethal violence against the unborn there can be no negotiation or conciliation , and now our nation has chosen for its chief executive the most radical pro-abortion politician ever to serve in the United States Senate or to run for president .
We must also take note of the fact that this election was effectively decided by the votes of self - described ( but not practicing )
Catholics , the majority of whom cast their ballots for President - elect Obama ...
1 . Voting for a pro-abortion politician when a plausible pro-life alternative exits constitutes material cooperation with intrinsic evil , and those Catholics who do so place themselves outside of the full communion of Christ ’s Church and under the judgment of divine law .
Persons in this condition should not receive Holy Communion until and unless they are reconciled to God in the Sacrament of Penance , lest they eat and drink their own condemnation .

Meg Kinnard writes :
Conservative Catholics criticized Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry in 2004 for supporting abortion rights , with a few Catholic bishops saying Kerry should refrain from receiving Holy Communion because his views were contrary to church teachings .
Sister Mary Ann Walsh , spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , said she had not heard of other churches taking this position in reaction to Obama 's win .
A Boston - based group that supports Catholic Democrats questioned the move , saying it was too extreme .
" Father Newman is off base , " said Steve Krueger , national director of Catholic Democrats .
" He is acting beyond the authority of a parish priest to say what he did .
...
Unfortunately , he is doing so in a manner that will be of great cost to those parishioners who did vote for Sens. Obama and Biden .
There will be a spiritual cost to them for his words . "
If Obama is successful ( and I think he will be ) , the religious zealots ' influence will wane across the country .
I predict that this will lead to actual violent acts of aggression in America influenced by the Father Newmans of the Religious Right , and all in the name of the Lord .
It 's coming .
Eric Rudolph , the Atlanta Olympics bomber , is just one of them , but his religious views were never highlighted by the MSM as they were in the blogoshere .
( Rudolph pleads guilty in series of bombings .
In statement , bomber says ‘ abortion on demand ’ reason for attacks )
Here 's a post I wrote on Apr 13 , 2005 :

Damn thread never seems to want to go in without a fight .
I need the Big Eye Needle now .

CIA Chief : Bin Laden Alive , Worried About ' Own Security ' Gen .
Hayden says the U.S. disrupted a plot that would have rivaled 9/11 .
November 13 , 2008  -- Osama bin Laden is alive and " putting a lot of energy into his own security , " the director of the CIA , General Michael Hayden , said today .
He also claimed , without providing details , that the US intelligence community had disrupted an attack " that would have rivaled the destruction of 9/11 . "
A senior intelligence official said Hayden was referring to the 2006 liquid bomb on airliners plot that was foiled in London .
" American and its friends have taken the fight to the enemy , " Gen .
Hayden said in a broad roundup of efforts to fight al Qaeda .
" Al Qaeda has suffered serious setbacks , but it is a determined , adaptive enemy unlike any our nation has ever faced , " he said .
Without directly referring to the CIA 's offensive blitz of unmanned missile attacks in the tribal areas of Pakistan , the CIA boss said the US had successfully isolated the al Qaeda leader bin Laden , referring to him in the present tense .
" He appears to be largely isolated from the day - to - day operations of the organization he leads , " Hayden said in a speech delivered to the Atlantic Council in Washington .
Hayden said the failure to kill or capture bin Laden in the seven years since the 9/11 attacks , could be explained by the " rugged and inaccessible " terrain of the Afghanistan - Pakistan border area and " the fact that bin Laden has worked to avoid detection . "
The CIA director provided no other details but it was the first public indication of the intelligence agency 's growing effort to narrow the focus of the search for bin Laden and other top terror leaders .
President - elect Barack Obama has not yet decided whether he will ask Hayden to stay on as director .
Several of Obama 's top advisers feel that while Hayden did a good job stabilizing morale and performance at the CIA following the debacle of the Iraq War , his connections to warrantless surveillance and so - called torture techniques make him unacceptable as the continuing director of the CIA .
" The truth is , we simply do n't know what would happen if bin Laden is killed or captured , but I 'm willing to bet that it would work in our favor , " Hayden said .
Hayden said he wanted to give the incoming administration " as clear a picture as possible of the state of the conflict and the shape of the enemy . "
He claimed al Qaeda in Iraq " is on the verge of strategic defeat . "
But he said the " bleed - out " of al Qaeda veterans from Iraq is now a growing concern .
" Iraq veterans also have been involved in planning attacks in Europe and the United States , " Gen .
Hayden said .
The good news of success in Iraq against al Qaeda was measured against the terror group 's alarming growth in North and East Africa and Yemen , he said in his remarks .
Hayden also took a question about his political future as the head of the agency in an Obama administration after his speech to the Atlantic Council .
Hayden said , " I 'll let Adm .
McConnell , speak for himself …we serve at the pleasure of the President … This is a decision for the President …
If asked to stay I would strongly consider it . "
Hayden also said , " The DNI is the top intelligence advisor to the President , so there has to be a personal relationship . "

CHICAGO — The White House has turned down a request from the family of President - elect Barack Obama to move into Blair House in early January so that his daughters can start school on Jan.
5 .
The Obamas were told that Blair House , where incoming presidents usually stay in the five days before Inauguration Day , is booked in early January , a spokesperson to the Obama transition said .
“ We explored the idea so that the girls could start school on schedule , ’ the spokesperson said .
“ But , there were previously scheduled events and guests that could n’t be displaced . ”
It remained unclear who on Bushes guest list outranked the incoming President .
“ It ’s not a public schedule , ” said Sally McDonough , spokeswoman for First Lady Laura Bush , in refusing to disclose who was staying at Blair House .
“ It ’s not a question of outranking the Obamas .
Blair House will be available to them on January 15 . ”
Ms. McDonough said “ there ’s nothing more to say other than that it ’s not available and wo n’t be available until January 15 . ”
She added that “ you ’re trying to make a story out of something that ’s not a story . ”
A State Department official said he did n’t know of any foreign dignitaries staying at Blair House in early January .
A White House official said that Mr. Bush does not have family or friends from Texas staying at Blair House during the period which the Obamas requested .
But Blair House , the official said , has been booked for “ receptions and gatherings ” by members of the outgoing Bush administration .
Those receptions , the official said , “ do n’t make it suitable for full - time occupancy by the Obamas yet . ”
Mr. Obama has been staying in Chicago with his family since the election ; the Obamas have decided to send their two daughters , Malia and Sasha , to Sidwell Friends School in Washington .
Obama transition officials said that the family is considering other housing options and are hopeful the girls will not miss the start of school .
“ The White House has been extremely accommodating to the Obama family needs — and the entire process has been smooth and friendly , ” the transition official said .

the rural studio is different from other university architecture programs .
instead of sitting in a classroom , students gain first hand experience by designing and constructing buildings in rural alabama .
these buildings are the result of collaborating with the clients and community directly .
students in the rural studio actually live in the same community they are working with , understanding the context first hand .
the mission of the rural studio is to ‘ enable each participating student to cross the threshold of misconceived opinions by putting their educational values to work as citizens of a community ’.
their belief is that architecture should be created from within , not from outside .
since 1993 , the rural studio has built over 80 projects , which have helped the community and taught the students valuable lessons .
the studio is based in hale county , alabama , one of the poorest regions in the US .
understanding the particular needs and constraints of this community is vital to the creation of meaningful designs .

The battle over an initiative that would divert drug offenders from prison into treatment and loosen state parole policies has intensified heading into Tuesday ’s vote , with a bipartisan coalition of elected officials joining the state prison guards union to fight the measure .
Supporters of Proposition 5 , whose heavy fundraising advantage has been whittled down , have cast opponents as shills for the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn . and its alleged effort to keep the state prison system overcrowded .
The union has spent $ 1.8 million to fight the initiative .
“ Tell the prison guards the party ’s over , ” Proposition 5 supporters say in a television ad unveiled this week , telling viewers that correctional officers are “ taking overtime pay right out of your pocket . ”
Most of the measure ’s financial backing has come from wealthy philanthropists in New York , including billionaire George Soros , a financier whose Open Society Institute has supported efforts to soften drug laws across the country .
Of nearly $ 8 million raised by supporters , only about $ 350,000 has come from California donors , records show .

Opponents have raised about $ 2.7 million but have won broad endorsements from elected and law enforcement officials .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican , was the target of an aborted recall effort by the guards union and has criticized it as a special interest group .
But he found himself on the union ’s side Thursday when he joined former governors -- Democrats Gray Davis and Jerry Brown , and Republicans Pete Wilson and George Deukmejian -- to oppose Proposition 5 .
“ It is a great threat to our neighborhoods , ” Schwarzenegger said at a news conference outside the Criminal Courts Building in downtown Los Angeles .
“ It was written by those who care more about the rights of criminals . ”
Davis said the measure “ will cost dollars and it will cost lives . ”
Proposition 5 would cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars a year initially , but a nonpartisan legislative analysis said it might save money in the long term by reducing prison overcrowding .
Los Angeles County Dist .
Atty .
Steve Cooley , also a Republican , said he opposes the measure because it shows “ compassion ” for identity and car thieves .
Advertisement
“ These are the types of people who will benefit from Prop. 5 , ” he said .
Sen . Dianne Feinstein , a Democrat , and Brown , the current state attorney general , recently taped television commercials against the initiative .
“ Say no to drug dealers , ” Feinstein says in her ad , while Brown -- whose spot was paid for by the prison guards union -- calls it “ a complicated measure ” that would “ limit court authority over drug dealers and addicts who refuse treatment . ”
Meg Whitman , the former chief executive of eBay who has been mentioned as a possible Republican candidate for governor in 2010 , also contributed $ 250,000 against the measure .
Advertisement
In a statement Thursday , Proposition 5 proponents called the governor and his predecessors “ disgraceful ” for refusing to help alleviate a prison crisis they created .
They said Schwarzenegger has “ failed to reform the prison system ” ; they blamed Davis ’ recall in part on his acceptance of $ 3 million in political contributions from the guards union ; and they accused Brown of “ cozying up ” to the union in anticipation of another run for the state ’s top job in 2010 .

If you love Nike shoes , and also love burgers this is for you .
Designer Olle Hemmendorff was recruited by Nike to make a burger spin off of their famous shoe the Nike Air Max 90 .
Unfortunately for the rest of us , this burger is only a one off , so you wo n't be seeing this available at Mcdonalds anytime soon !
This is probably the only shoe you would ever catch me holding up to my nose and freely sniffing over the course of my entire life .
Come to think of it you probably would n't catch me sticking my tongue in another shoe either .
Here are some pictures of both the original shoe as well as the edible version .

In normal political campaigns , election day -- win or lose -- signals the end .
Not so with Proposition 8 , the constitutional amendment defining marriage as only between a man and a woman that was approved by 52 % of California voters Nov. 4 .
Instead of settling the question of gay marriage in California , the election merely ushered in a new , and in many cases more heated , phase of the campaign , with both sides looking ahead to 2010 , when the matter could be back on the ballot .
This could happen no matter how the state Supreme Court rules .
The court announced this week that it would review the legality of Proposition 8 in response to several lawsuits filed by cities and gay couples .

If justices uphold the proposition , gay marriage backers plan to put their own measure before voters perhaps as soon as 2010 to re-amend the state Constitution to allow the marriages .
If the justices toss out Proposition 8 , some gay - marriage opponents have talked of putting something on the ballot themselves , either to again ban gay marriage or to oust Supreme Court justices or both .
“ Election day has come and gone , but the campaign is clearly far from over , ” said Eric Jaye , a political consultant who has worked on gay rights campaigns around the country and has also advised San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom .
“ The question is not if this will be back on the ballot .
The question is when this will be back on the ballot . ”
To that end , the pro-Proposition 8 side is still paying its political consultants , Frank Schubert and Jeff Flint , who say they are fielding more media requests than they did before the election and are beginning to lay plans for the next campaign .
Advertisement
The No on 8 side , meanwhile , has taken to the streets with dozens of protests and vigils across the state and nation .
A left - leaning political group , the Courage Campaign , has begun collecting virtual signatures to get the matter back on the ballot .
And one lesbian couple from Pasadena have even set out on a well - publicized pilgrimage from Los Angeles to the Supreme Court in San Francisco .
Many on the No on 8 side are also trying to figure out what went wrong with their campaign .
Their side was leading in polls in the weeks before the election and has since been accused of not doing enough outreach to blacks and Latinos and not responding quickly or effectively enough to the other side ’s claims about what effect the proposition would have on public school curriculums .
Both sides also continue to work on organizing their supporters and are waging a fierce public relations battle in which they try to paint their opponents as liars and outside the bounds of civil society .
Leaders of the Yes on 8 campaign say their supporters have become the victims of threats , blacklisting , violence and vandalism , with churches desecrated , supporters told they are bigots and businesses and individuals picketed and harassed because they contributed money to the Yes on 8 campaign .

“ A great number ” of supporters of Proposition 8 “ are being persecuted . . . mercilessly , ” said Andrew Pugno , lawyer for the Protect Marriage committee .
He called on Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to “ help protect people to exercise their rights . ”
Yes on 8 leaders also pointed to rallies and vandalism outside Mormon churches and temples in California , and an instance last week in which white powder was sent to the Mormon Temple in Los Angeles and another to the temple in Salt Lake City .
And several people in the Mormon Church , whose members contributed millions to help pass Proposition 8 , say they have been targeted .
“ This is very frightening , to have them come back here to the back of my house . . . with scissors to boot , ” said Eileen Olson , 80 , who said vandals took her Yes on 8 signs from her frontyard and destroyed them -- four times .
Each time , Olson , a member of the Mormon church in Upland , would replace them , only to have them taken again .
Sometimes the signs were cut with scissors and left on her property ; other times they were dumped in the street .
She said her daughter - in - law attends a Mormon church in Fallbrook that has recently hired more security guards .

On the other side , members of the No on 8 campaign contend that they are victims of a smear campaign by the Yes side to make them seem violent and angry as they stage peaceful protests .
“ The histrionics have been ridiculous . . . some of the same kind of lies they were telling during the campaign , ” said Nick Velasquez , 28 , who works in politics in California and has become increasingly active in the gay rights movement since the passage of Proposition 8 .
The Rev. Susan Russell , an Episcopal priest at All Saints Church in Pasadena and a lesbian , said that supporters on both sides have engaged in some “ unfortunate acts ” but that the Yes on 8 side is trying to exploit those in a campaign of “ disinformation . ”
The No on 8 campaign released its own list of incidents of harassment and violence against its supporters .
Behind the scenes , both sides are also trying to figure out how to mobilize their supporters for the battles ahead .

Rick Jacobs , who heads the Courage Campaign , said he hired two community organizers this week .
Many young gay leaders have also been holding meetings and building online networks on such sites as Facebook and MySpace .
Schubert , campaign strategist for the Yes on 8 side , is taking similar actions .
“ We are going to be in a discussion very soon about things to get ready for a new battle , ” he said .
Advertisement
Schubert took pains to distance the official Yes on 8 campaign from talk of ousting Supreme Court justices .
“ Any discussion of a recall right now is unnecessary and premature , ” he said .
But Pugno , the lawyer for the campaign , said earlier this week that if the court overturned Prop.
8 “ no one would be able to stop ” one .

FOR all its paradisal waters , golden dunes and swanky “ eco-lodges ” , life in Kenya 's coastal district of Kiunga , just a few miles from the border with Somalia , is hard .
The place is remote , hungry and thirsty .
The harvest and the wells have failed again .
Fishermen have no boats , only frayed nets cast from shore .
Their catch rots for want of refrigeration .
But what makes the village elders more nervous than anything is their proximity to Somalia .
During a war in the 1960s between Kenya and Somali bandits , known as “ shifta ” , who were egged on by Somalia , Kiunga was evacuated .
These days a rough track , impassable during the rains , barely connects the two countries .
The border has been closed since December 2006 , when jihadist fighters in Somalia retreated headlong from Mogadishu , the capital , and Kismayo , a southern port , into the mangrove swamps around Ras Kamboni , just inside Somalia .
There they were shredded by Ethiopian artillery and American air raids .
An attack on Kenya by Somali jihadists based near the border is unlikely .
Resurgent fighters still train there but look north .
They belong to the Shabab ( Youth ) , the armed wing of the former Islamic Courts Union that was all but wiped out two years ago .
The presence of hated Ethiopian troops in Somalia , together with a corrupt and hapless transitional Somali government , gave the Shabab a chance to regroup .
Money and arms from Eritrea , which wants to use Somalia to hurt Ethiopia , as well as from some Arab countries , enabled it to recruit .
Several thousand have signed up in the past year .
They attend large training camps in southern Somalia where one of the instructors is said to be a white American mujahideen .
They are expected to disavow music , videos , cigarettes and qat , the leaf Somali men chew most afternoons to get mildly high .
Thus resolved , they wrap their faces in scarves and seek to fight the infidel .
In return , they get $ 100 a month , are fed , and can expect medical treatment and payments if they are wounded , as well as burial costs and cash for their families if they are killed .
The Shabab now controls much of south Somalia and chunks of Mogadishu .
It took Kismayo a few months ago .
The port of Marka , which takes in food aid , fell more recently .
Many fighters are loosely grouped around two older jihadist commanders with strongholds near Kenya 's border , Mukhtar Robow and Hassan Turki .
Mr Robow celebrated the recent festival of Eid al - Adha by hosting prayers in Mogadishu 's cattle market .
How sweet it would be at Eid , he told the gathering , if instead of slaughtering an animal in praise of Allah , they would slaughter an Ethiopian .
On a visit to Marka he was only slightly less belligerent .
He urged reconciliation — except with enemies of Islam .
There are many of those , it seems .
Hundreds of Somali aid workers , human - rights campaigners and journalists have been killed or exiled .
Foreigners have been shot and kidnapped , in two cases just across Somalia 's border , in Kenya and Ethiopia .
Where it cannot exert control , the Shabab excuses banditry .
Borrowing tactics from Afghanistan 's Taliban , it spreads chaos to build a new order .
The Shabab has learnt from its mistakes in 2006 , when it was overwhelmed in a few days by the Ethiopian army .
It is now more pragmatic and more aggressive .
This time round , it is apparently not picking fights with wealthy qat merchants .
Men can chew what they like — but wo n't be “ clean enough ” to get a lucrative job in Kismayo's port .
Education is encouraged .
Girls can go to school .
Charcoal burning is forbidden for the sake of the environment .
But the Shabab has also tightened its own security .
Alleged spies for the transitional government or for Ethiopia are routinely beheaded with blunt knives .
Mr Turki , the jihadist leader who lives mostly in the bush near the Kenyan border , sleeps in different houses when he is in a town .
Public floggings and executions strike fear .
So do masked faces .
“ Before , we knew who killed our relatives , ” says a Kismayo merchant .
“ Now we do n't even know that . ”
Most tellingly , the Shabab has learnt how to get hold of money faster .
It concentrates its fighters in towns where there is money to be earned .
The aim is to create an army that puts Islamist identity above divisive clan loyalties .
Shabab commanders say a pious state will emerge once weaker militias have been disarmed .
Some reckon that the Shabab shares some of the ransoms earned by pirates who operate out of the central Somali port of Haradheere .
Those in Puntland , farther north , are apparently beyond the Shabab 's reach .
Ethiopia says it will withdraw its troops within weeks , once ships evacuate the 3,000 Ugandan and Burundian peacekeepers under the African Union 's aegis holed up in Mogadishu .
Somalia 's transitional government looks even feebler than before .
This week the president , Abdullahi Yusuf , an ageing warlord , sacked his prime minister , Nur Hussein , blaming him for what the president called a corrupt , inept and traitorous government .
Mr Hussein refused to resign , and won a vote of confidence in parliament .
Mr Yusuf went ahead and appointed his own prime minister anyway .
More factional fighting beckons .
The UN says Somalia is the world 's worst humanitarian emergency .
Some 3.2 m people are said to need aid .
The UN , which says 40,000 Somali children could soon starve to death , expects fighting over food to break out , another reason the Shabab wants to control the ports .
Pirates make it hard to deliver aid .
Their activities may be curtailed after the UN Security Council this week let foreign governments chase pirates in Somalia itself as well as at sea .
But the piracy will probably continue as long as the catastrophe on land does .
George Bush 's administration backed some of Mogadishu 's worst warlords as part of its war on terror .
President Obama will have to take a new tack .
The AU force has proved ineffective but a bigger or more robust intervention , by America or any other country , is not expected ; this week Condoleezza Rice , America 's secretary of state , called in vain for UN peacekeepers to be sent .
A new American administration is unlikely to urge negotiation any time soon with the Shabab ; it is still listed as a terrorist group by the Americans and may indeed shelter al - Qaeda people .
It may have sleeper agents in Kenya and even in Britain .
It has certainly become stronger .
Dropping poll numbers , the increase in contested GOP states , and a lack of time to turn around the presidential election are leading to a deep concern among Republicans and inside John McCain 's campaign that the Arizona senator wo n't be able to scratch back against Sen.
Barack Obama by Election Day .
One insider compared the political situation to the end of the 1992 campaign when , despite close tracking polls , Bill Clinton knocked off former President Bush .
" It 's beginning to feel a lot like that , " said one campaign veteran .
The worries about a comeback by the Republican have raised the importance of tonight 's presidential debate .
It 's in a town hall format , a scene McCain has handled well in the past .
Republican officials said that McCain must use the debate to stop his drop in polls and begin a comeback .
" It 's 30 days , and that 's enough time , " said one hopeful official .
" Just look at what 's happened in the last two weeks with the financial bailout .
Four weeks is a long time for something to happen , " added the GOP official .
Unfortunately , added another McCain adviser , the crash of the stock market and the resulting overseas financial crisis will continue through the election , and that will remind voters daily that the economy — considered Obama 's stronger suit — is issue No. 1 .
After the Red Sox won the World Series in 2004 , I did n’t quite know what to do to help myself take it all in .
I found a message board called ‘ Win it For ’ that was started at some point before the World Series and was filled with stories from people who wanted the Red Sox to win the World Series for someone or other .
I spent about 5 hours , reading it straight through , the morning after the World Series and it was the best way I could have celebrated the Red Sox winning .
On November 4 , when Barack Obama was announced the winner of the 2008 Presidential Election I was searching for a similar sort of catharsis .
Not so much because of Obama winning ( which was nice ) but because the election had been building as an event for almost 3 years ‘ from the speculation of who would run , to the announcements , to the campaigns , to the primaries , to the general , and finally , November 4th came and went .
I thought maybe I ’ll collect a few thoughts from friends , or collect all the Facebook status messages , or collect a few links that helped tell the story .
As I thought about it , I decided I would n’t be able to do what I wanted without going overboard .
And I wo n’t lie , despite my attempts at making this document impartial , there ’s no way it could have been .
And though I ’ve tried to make its focus 11/4 , Election Day , there were certain events from the campaign that creeped in .
I wanted to create something to look at a couple years from now to remember the election and hopefully present a good representation of what both sides of America were feeling on that day as evidenced by the response in the press and on the blogs .
I did n’t capture everything , though I ’ve certainly tried .
I want to consume all of this information , have it put on a microchip in my brain .
Until that ’s possible , I just read a lot .

The implosion of Wall Street last week resulted in a near - death crisis for John McCain 's presidential campaign .
His post - Palin bump eviscerated , McCain was staggered by the re-emergence of the economy as the dominant issue in the 2008 election .
His daily - changing positions revealed that McCain , a man who has repeatedly admitted his ignorance of economics , is struggling to cope with his diminished presidential prospects .
Armchair psychologists might call the process John McCain 's five stages of grief over the economy .
Denial .
McCain 's refusal to confront the realities of the failing Bush economy has long roots and was again on display last Monday .
McCain , who has frequently described the economic slowdown as " psychological , " for at least the 18th time proclaimed the " fundamentals of our economy are strong . "
As the Dow plummeted over 500 points , McCain reacted to the white - hot crisis on Wall Street by comically announcing his support for a 9/11 - style commission to study the causes of and make recommendations to address the meltdown .
Willing to kick the can down the road with his since forgotten 9/11 panel idea , McCain also took a head - in - the - sand position in opposing the government rescue of teetering insurance giant AIG :
" We cannot have the taxpayers bail out AIG or anybody else . "
Anger .
Sadly , McCain 's denial of the obvious produced an immediate backlash from the press and the public alike .
Literally within hours last Monday , McCain reversed course on the underlying strength of the American economy and declared the fundamentals of the economy to be " at great risk . "
Then John McCain did what he does best - he got mad .
( Unsurprisingly , McCain also launched a furious tirade in response to accusations 20 years ago about his Keating Five role during the last U.S. financial catastrophe . )
Redefining " economic fundamentals " to refer the U.S. work force , McCain blasted his " opponents " for slandering American workers .
By mid-week , McCain found a convenient - if unconstitutional - target for his rage , SEC chairman Chris Cox .
Bargaining .
His response mocked as incoherent at best , McCain then proceeded to the third textbook phase of grief over the economy : bargaining .
As the Kubler - Ross model describes the bargaining stage , " Now the grieving person may make bargains with God , asking , ' If I do this , will you take away the loss ? ' "
So , fast and furious , McCain started to bargain .
Acknowledging that as President he could n't fire the SEC's Cox , McCain instead called for his resignation .
( This morning , McCain cynically offered up New York Democrat Andrew Cuomo as a replacement . )
Within 24 hours , he changed his tune on AIG , now supporting the bail - out package he opposed just the day before :
" The government was forced to commit $ 85 billion ...
The focus of any such action should be to protect the millions of Americans who hold insurance policies , retirement plans and other accounts with AIG . "
And to be sure , McCain bargained economic surrogate and serial embarrassment Carly Fiorina right out of his campaign .
When the details of her massive $ 42 million severance package from HP became public , the woman who deemed McCain incapable of running a company found herself on the sidelines .
Depression .
By last Thursday , a pall of gloom hung over McCain as he entered the fourth stage of grieving , depression .
In a move that could only draw attention to his own checkered past in the savings and loan scandal of the 1980's , McCain meekly proposed the creation of a Mortgage and Financial Institutions ( MFI ) trust to help the failing firms of Wall Street fend off insolvency .
Ironically , McCain had repeatedly opposed the Resolution Trust Corporation in the past , an institution that ultimately poured $ 400 billion into bailing out the S&L's , including the $ 3 billion lost by McCain sugar daddy Charles Keating 's Lincoln Financial .
That same day , McCain tried to fight back , but his heart was n't in it .
In a foreboding ad fraught with racial overtones , McCain tried to link Obama with former Fannie Mae chairman Franklin Raines .
While the Washington Post quickly debunked the spot by noting that Raines is not an adviser to the Obama campaign , Time suggested McCain was playing the race card .
Acceptance .
By today , it was clear that John McCain had reached the fifth and final stage of grieving over the economic issue .
Just one week after proclaiming the " fundamentals of our economy are strong , " McCain said on the Today Show this morning :
" We are in the most serious crisis since World War II . "
That clarity is letting McCain do what McCain does best - attack .
In a cynical attempt at misdirection the Politico 's Jonathan Martin deemed " tossing more chum overboard , " the McCain campaign aired a new ad once again trying to connect Barack Obama to Chicago dealmaker Tony Rezko .
And on Sunday , McCain ignored his own week of dizzying incoherence on the economy and thundered at Obama :
" At a time of crisis , when leadership is needed , Senator Obama has simply not provided it . "
Apparently , John McCain 's new - found acceptance of the dismal state of the economy lets him rage against the Obama machine without embarrassment .
After all , McCain 's transition manager William Timmons was a lobbyist for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
This morning , the New York Times revealed that McCain 's campaign manager Rick Davis pocketed $ 2 million in lobbying fees from the failed home mortgage giants .
And on Sunday , McCain refused to rule out that his adviser and UBS vice chairman Phil Gramm , of " nation of whiners " fame and himself a possible bailout recipient , as Treasury Secretary in a McCain - Palin administration .
To be sure , watching John McCain wrestle with his demons - and ignorance - over the troubled economy has been painful to watch .
As crypto -conservative columnist George Will put it :
" John McCain showed his personality this week and made some of us fearful . "
But with his 11 houses and 13 cars , John McCain can afford to work through his cognitive breakdown over the state of the broken economy .
Unfortunately , the rest of us can't .
While Americans are mourning the loss of their homes and savings , John McCain is apparently grieving over his potential loss of the White House .

Shrimp grits started out as a seasonal fisherman ’s dish of shrimp cooked in bacon grease served over creamy grits in the Low Country where they were also known as “ breakfast shrimp . ”
The simple seafood breakfast became an iconic Southern dish after Craig Claiborne wrote about it in the New York Times in 1985 .
The shrimp grits that fired Clairborne ’s imagination came from Crook ’s Corner restaurant in North Carolina .
The chef there , Bill Neal , started out with a French restaurant , but with Clairborne ’s encouragement , created his own upscale Southern cooking style in the 1980s .
Bill Neal went on to write some best - selling Southern cookbooks .
Neal ’s shrimp grits featured a spicy sauté of shrimp over cheese grits loaded up with bacon , mushrooms and scallions .
The shrimp and cheese grits ( $ 19 ) at Ouisie ’s Table , Houston ’s original upscale Southern restaurant , were inspired by Bill Neal ’s recipe .
Neal died at an early age , and it seems that every Southern chef has felt obligated to follow his lead and come up with a new spin on shrimp grits .
John Currance makes his grits extra spicy at Central Grocery in Oxford , Mississippi .
Frank Stitt makes a soupy rendition he calls Shrimp and Grits Etouffee at Highland Grill in Birmingham .
At Houston ’s Catalan , Chris Shepherd serves Northern Spanish / Southern Texan fusion shrimp grits ( $ 25 ) with bacon and goat cheese grits and roasted piquillo pepper butter .
The pimientos del Piquillo are fancy roasted red peppers imported from Northern Spain .
Last year , in Hot Plate , Paul Galvani wrote about Zin ’s shrimp grits appetizer ( $ 11 ) of four jumbo shrimp in a cup of grits cooked with andouille sausage and paprika oil and served with some grated parmesan on the side .
At Backstreet Café ’s Sunday brunch , the shrimp are grilled and the grits are topped with green onions ( $ 19 ) .
At So Vino , the Westheimer wine bar that features bottles from the Southern hemisphere ( mostly ) , the shrimp and cheese grits go for $ 17 and are recommended with a New Zealand Sauvignon blanc .
I have enjoyed every version of shrimp grits I ’ve tried .
But my friend , Southern food writer John T. Edge , is wary of all these upscale variations .
And his mama , who comes from the Low Country , does n’t think some of this stuff is really shrimp grits at all .
I can identify .
I remember when Jane and Michael Stern published a book called Chili Nation with recipes for chili from all over the country .
The book included maple syrup chili from Vermont , macadamia nut chili from Hawaii and shrimp chili from Maryland .
The recipes were all well and good -- they just were n’t recipes for chili .
I am not sure Edge would approve of my shrimp and grits either , since I do n’t use the traditional river shrimp from Charleston .
But if you can forgive the Texas brown shrimp , this recipe is pretty close to the original .
Texas Brown Shrimp and Jalapeño Grits
The shrimp fishermen who made the original Low Country breakfast shrimp did n’t serve them with cheese grits , and I do n’t either .
The grits I make at home are Anson Mills stone - ground yellow grits cooked overnight in a crockpot in a mixture of three parts water to one part milk .
I do like them spicy though .
Cut down the amount of jalapeño or substitute green pepper if you are cooking for wimps .
4 cups cooked yellow stone - ground grits 1 stick of butter , divided use .
1 onion , finely chopped 1 jalapeño pepper , minced ( or to taste ) 1 rib of celery , finely chopped 6 green onions , chopped Half cup cream ( or as needed ) 3 cloves garlic , minced 1 pound Texas brown shrimp , shelled Tabasco sauce Sea salt Freshly ground black pepper Green onion tops for garnish
Over medium heat , melt three quarters of the butter in a skillet and sauté the onion , pepper , celery and half of the green onions in it .
Add salt and pepper to taste .
When the onion is softened , add the grits and stir .
Add cream and keep stirring until the grits are the desired consistency .
Over medium heat , melt the rest of the butter in another pan and add the garlic and the rest of the green onions .
Stir until wilted , then add the shrimp .
Salt to taste .
Cook , stirring frequently until the shrimp are just cooked through .
Add Tabasco sauce to taste .
Put a pile of grits in the center of a bowl or plate and top with shrimp .
( Or you can arrange the shrimp around the outside of the grits . )
Sprinkle with pepper and garnish with shaved green onion tops .
Serve immediately with a Bloody Mary .

Pass it .
Back it .
Believe in it , they say .
Just do n’t read the fine print of the 451 page , $ 700 billion bailout plan because , well , things get a little bit wooly .
Like Section 325 which provides essential tax breaks for the “ wool research fund . ”
Seriously .
Section 503 gives tax breaks for the manufacture of wooden arrows used in toys for children .
And Section 309 , a tax credit for economic development , in America .
Actually , American Samoa .
Metro State Political Science professor Norm Provizer says putting in the goodies simply gets votes .
“ As soon as they started discussing sweetening the bill to make it more attractive … in American politics the sweetener is often money , ” he said .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In Section 316 : a tax break for railroad track maintenance .
And Section 317 , a tax break for race tracks .
This was clearly not the bail - out bill most folks expected .
“ I think it ’s wrong , it ’s wrong , ” one voter told us .
“ How does that affect us , where do we profit , what do we expect to gain from it ? ”
In the end , the pork probably wo n’t kill the bill .
And there are tax credits for renewable energy , and tax relief that is popular .
Just makes you wonder about the other wolf - ish provisions , in sheep ’s clothing .
Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar said he wished the un-related provisions would come out of the bill .
But said the renewable energy tax credits were important .
Sen .
Wayne Allard voted against the bill because it cost too much .

Another person who had advised Mr. Paterson said that Ms. Kennedy could offer political advantages to the governor , who was elevated to his position after Eliot Spitzer resigned in March and in two years must ask voters to actually elect him as governor .

“ The upside of her candidacy is that the 2010 ballot will read Kennedy - Paterson , ” said one of those advisers , who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the governor ’s thinking .
“ David craves national attention and money .
If you connect the dots , it leads to her . ”
For Ms. Kennedy , an appointment to the Senate would open a historic and exceedingly high - profile chapter to a life largely shielded from public view , and comes at a poignant time for her personally .
Her uncle , Senator Edward M. Kennedy , is struggling with terminal brain cancer , and his illness has forced members of his extended family to contemplate the possibility that the Senate could be left without a Kennedy for the first time in a half century .
Mr. Kennedy has encouraged his niece , to whom he talks nearly every day , to pursue Mrs. Clinton ’s seat , a spokesman for the senator , Anthony Coley , said .
Associates of the senator say he has made it clear he would not pressure her to do so .
Still , they said nothing would make him happier or prouder than having his niece in the Senate , which  far more than the White House  has been the core of the family ’s long record of public service .
Other members of the family , especially her cousin , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , have also strongly encouraged Ms. Kennedy , who , if she were appointed , would become the first woman to lead the Kennedy dynasty , whose most successful and visible members have been men .
Her brother , John F. Kennedy Jr. , who died in a plane crash in 1999 , had once been urged to run for the seat , which was held by their uncle , Robert F. Kennedy .
Ms. Kennedy , who initially seemed taken aback by questions about whether she would be interested in the position , has grown increasingly excited about and focused on the opportunity in recent days , those who have talked to her said .
She has moved aggressively into campaignlike mode , albeit with careful attention to political protocol .
On Monday , she called dozens of political figures to let them know she was interested in the job .
Besides Mr. Paterson and Christine C. Quinn , the New York City Council speaker , Ms. Kennedy called upstate officials like Representative Louise M. Slaughter and Byron Brown , the mayor of Buffalo ; the Rev. Al Sharpton , the civil rights leader ; and Charles E. Schumer , New York ’s senior senator .
LONDON 
The woman in black wanted an Islamic divorce .
She told the religious judge that her husband hit her , cursed her and wanted her dead .
But her husband was opposed , and the Islamic scholar adjudicating the case seemed determined to keep the couple together .
So , sensing defeat , she brought our her secret weapon : her father .
In walked a bearded man in long robes who described his son - in - law as a hot - tempered man who had duped his daughter , evaded the police and humiliated his family .
The judge promptly reversed himself and recommended divorce .
This is Islamic justice , British style .
Despite a raucous national debate over the limits of religious tolerance and the pre-eminence of British law , the tenets of Shariah , or Islamic law , are increasingly being applied to everyday life in cities across the country .
Cindy McCain is having a secret love affair ?
Everyone in politics is having an affair !
The National Enquirer has published the above photo as proof that Cindy McCain , wife of failed US Presidential candidate John McCain is having a secret love affair .
“ I could n’t believe I was watching Cindy McCain passionately kissing and hugging another man ! ” says a witness .
The wealthy blonde heiress and her secret pal have been spotted together around her hometown of Phoenix , Arizona over the past several years , The Enquirer writes .
The spy photos were snapped when Cindy and her companion attended the Tempe Music Festival says the person who took them .
The photos are somewhat grainy , but the insider says they depict Senator John McCain ’s wife , who was greeted by pals at the event as “ Cindy . ”
Honestly , I remain completely doubtful about this story and its sources .
At least , the Enquirer waited until after the Presidential Elections to go public with this photo .
If it ’s true , let them have their own private dramas , especially now that John McCain did n’t make it to the White House .
( CNN ) --
The Republican Party of Pennsylvania launched a last - minute television ad that calls attention to Barack Obama 's relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
A new ad from Republicans in Pennsylvania highlights Barack Obama 's relationship with Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
" If you think you could ever vote for Barack Obama , consider this : Obama chose as his spiritual leader this man , " the ad's narrator says before clips of Wright 's controversial statements are shown .
" Does that sound like someone who should be president ? " the ad asks .
The retired pastor 's ties to Obama became an issue during the primary season after controversial clips of Wright 's sermons were circulated and widely discussed on the Internet and on television .
Obama later condemned Wright 's remarks and said he would have left his church if his pastor had not retired and had not acknowledged making comments that " deeply offended people . "
Sen .
John McCain has repeatedly said he does not believe Obama 's relationship to Wright should be an issue -- to the ire of some Republicans who feel it raises questions about the Illinois senator 's judgment .
Gov. Sarah Palin appeared to suggest last month that Wright is a fair issue to raise , but said ultimately it is McCain 's decision .
" [ Obama ] sat in the pews for 20 years and heard Rev.
Wright say some things that most people would find a bit concerning .
But again that is John McCain 's call , " Palin told reporters .
The state GOP did not release the extent of the ad buy , but defended airing it .
" We feel that it is necessary that the American people remember that Obama sat in a church and listened to this man preach hate for many , many years , " said a statement on its Web site .
" What does that say about his judgment ?
Do we want the next president of the United States to have spent years listening to hateful rhetoric without having the good judgment to walk out ? "
The ad was paid for by the Republican Federal Committee of Pennsylvania and was not authorized by the McCain campaign .
McCain and Palin have barnstormed Pennsylvania in recent weeks as they try to win the state 's 21 electoral votes .
Obama leads McCain by 7 points in Pennsylvania , 51 to 44 percent , according to CNN 's latest poll of state polls .
Earlier Sunday , Democratic VP candidate Sen. Joe Biden condemned the " politics of division " at a rally interrupted by protesters .
" We can't move past the politics of division unless after this election is over , if God willing we win , we reach out to the very people out in the outer parking lot , " he said , calling out the protesters at the Tallahassee , Florida , event .
" We 've got to reach out , we 've got to end this .
Somebody 's got to be big enough to stand up and end this , " he said .
With two days left until the election , Obama holds a 6 - point lead over McCain , 50 to 44 percent , according to CNN 's average of national polls .
Six percent of respondents said they are still undecided .
McCain on Sunday told supporters that he and his running mate would " shake up Washington " with a win in Tuesday 's presidential election .
" I want to repeat to you one more time , my friends -- we 're going to win , and we 're going to bring real change to Washington , " he said at a rally in Wallingford , Pennsylvania .
" Two days , two days to victory , " he said to roaring applause .
Obama has maintained a steady lead over the last month , but CNN Polling Director Keating Holland cautioned against assuming the election is over .
" Keep in mind that this is not a prediction of the final outcome , " Holland said .
" That 's not an easy task with two full days of campaigning to go , in a country in which roughly one in 10 voters tend to make up their minds in the last few days . "
Watch more on the final days of campaigning »
Obama on Sunday told voters that their future depends on the final days of the campaign .
" Do n't believe for a second this election is over .
Do n't think for a minute that power will concede without a fight .
We have to work like our future depends on it in these last two days , because it does , " he said in Columbus , Ohio .
Obama also continued his push to tie McCain to the current administration , calling attention to Vice President Dick Cheney 's endorsement of the McCain - Palin ticket .
" I 'd like to congratulate Sen. McCain on this endorsement , because he really earned it .
That endorsement did n't come easy , " Obama said .
" Do you think Dick Cheney is ' delighted ' to support John McCain because he thinks John McCain 's going to bring change ?
Because he thinks that somehow John McCain is really going to shake things up ? "
Obama 's campaign on Sunday released a 30 - second ad that highlights Cheney 's endorsement , which came Saturday .
" And boy , did McCain earn it .
He voted with Bush and Cheney 90 percent of the time , " the announcer says of the endorsement .
" And that 's not the change we need . "
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds responded Saturday in a statement : " Barack Obama and Dick Cheney are n't just cousins ; they 've shared support for the Bush energy policy and the out - of - control spending that John McCain has fought to oppose . "
Bounds was referring to research done by the vice president 's wife showing that Cheney and Obama are distant cousins .
CNN 's national poll of polls is an average of six surveys : Fox / Opinion Dynamics ( October 28 - 29 ) ; ABC / Washington Post ( October 28- 31 ) ; Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby ( October 29 - 31 ) ; Gallup ( October 29 - 31 ) ; Diageo / Hotline ( October 29 - 31 ) ; and IBD / TIPP ( October 27 - 31 ) .

All About U.S. Presidential Election
A piece in yesterday 's Times described the frenzy surrounding the appearance Robert Pattison , the star of Twilight , at a mall in Pennsylvania last Thursday .
Squealed one tearful girl , " He was this close ... Close enough to bite my neck . "
I guess this was fresh on my mind the other day when I met up with a young teen whom I 've known since she was born - a smart , independent 15 - year - old .
I asked her if she was a fan of the Twilight phenomenon , and her face grew stormy .
" I 've never read them , " she said .
" I ca n't stand these stupid girls who just follow the trends . "
And I knew exactly how she felt : because for every group of girls screaming at a mall appearance , there 's an equally fierce group of deliberate trend - buckers , defining themselves by their scorn for what 's popular .
I can well remember the burning scorn for my next door neighbor and her overnight love for NKOTB , which included a wall of posters and a comforter .
I have a clear memory of sitting on my lawn reading a Natalie Babbit book ( doubtless in a sunbonnet ) while she and a friend did an earnest a cappella rendition of " Step by Step " over the hedge .
Around the same time , a hand - clapping game swept my second - grade class .
I was , on principle , scornful and refused to play it : I remember arriving at school one day to find my best friend and lone ally clapping and singing along ; that day , I sat by myself on the sidelines while the other 19 members of my class played " Em - pom - pi " in a big circle .
At least I had my vague principles !
Even at the time , I would have been hard - pressed to define my objection to these seemingly innocuous phenomena .
The fact that everyone else liked them - nay , had lost their heads over them - was enough .
In later years , sticker books and Koosh balls and 90210 obviously also aroused my superior contempt .
There were moments when I yearned for the tactile pleasures of a fuzzy sticker , the clandestine thrill of the Walsh siblings '
G- rated antics ; but nothing could provide the satisfaction that my principled individuality did - a thrill as compelling and all - encompassing as the trends that swept my classmates along .
And obviously as the teen years advanced , my commitment to outsider status only hardened .
Twilight has made people think about the mass hysteria such phenomena can provoke in girls , just as matinee idols , the Beatles , boy bands , High School Musical actors and teen pop stars have done for decades .
Hormones , burgeoning sexuality , issues of identity and assimilation are usually invoked .
And everyone 's aware of the trope of the teen outsider , defining him - or - herself against such conformity .
We 've all seen The Breakfast Club , after all , and experienced the rigidity of self - imposed youthful roles .
But I do n't think it 's often said that mass hysteria and anti-establishment posing are two sides of the same coin , and to a teen it can sometimes feel like there is not much of an alternative .
It can be hard to enjoy something without joining in , hard to reject it without making a self - conscious statement .
It can be hard to just kind of like something when you 're defining yourself , even though the bulk of a thoughtful adult life is in fact made up of gray areas and shades of opinion .
When I was talking with my young friend , I tried to be sensitive .
" Really ? " I said casually .
" I 'm kind of interested to take a look at Twilight , just to see what all the fuss is about . "
I could see , with that noncommittal response , that I had failed her .
I should , I guess , have been railing against conformity , not joining the ranks of apathetic adulthood .
After all , she had known me to be an " independent " teenager myself , back in the day .
But the truth is , when I was her age , I know I would have secretly been curious to read Twilight - who does n't like forbidden teen love ?! - and even lose myself in pure hysteria for a change .
One of the blessed reliefs of being a grown - up is that it 's okay to admit that .

Among the RIAA 's latest targets in its campaign to sue its customer base into submission is a 19 year old cancer patient .
Ciaro Sauro was ruled a music pirate after failing to defend herself in against charges from the RIAA that she was sharing music files online .
Ms. Sauro has said she could n't defend herself as she is hospitalized once a week , and vehemently denies the allegations that she is a pirate .
" Look and see where it ( the downloads ) came from , and look and see that it 's not me .
It 's not fair to do to me , " Ms. Sauro told WTAE TV in Pittsburgh , who brought the story to light .
" I already have severe depression .
I mean , it 's so hard to sit there and think that I have to get in trouble for something that I did n't do .
It 's not fair . "
In addition to the Big Four music labels , Ms. Sauro is also battling Pancreatitis , and is in need of an islet cell transplant .
According to WTAE , she is hospitalized weekly , and she and her mother insist that it is Ms. Ciaro 's father , who no longer lives with the family , who opened the account and committed the piracy .
The RIAA has been conducting a campaign against people it claims are pirates for many years , garnering a wealth of bad press that has sometimes resulted in the recording trade organization backing off of specific cases .
That may be what attorney James Brink hopes will happen in this case , as he has volunteered to defend Ms. Sauro , and has asked the courts to reopen her case .
As it stands , this case is sweeping through the tech - oriented online media , and appears to be picking up steam .
Link of the day - Sway : The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior

Great work , Shannyn .
I 'm very glad to see you 've referenced the anomalous NH Primary election in your excellent article .
I was in NH for the disastrous recount , assisting BlackBoxVoting.org in their ground - breaking ballot chain of custody investigation .
You might want to look into what we found there , as it seems like the same exact same pattern of fraud you are reporting from Alaska .
We found : 1 . The Diebold OP SCAN machines had a failure rate 163 times greater than allowed by H.A.V.A. federal standards
2 . More votes than voters ( inflated vote totals )
3 . More voters than votes , in some cases , directly in proportion / corresponding to the wards where the machines had mysteriously inflated vote totals
4 . The resulting " chain of custody " ballot investigation directly reflected these anomalies / we saw some VERY unsettling events while tracking .
I spent 2 months putting together the following video to sum up the investigation :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYz9O_SvIJI
" NH RECOUNT / Manchester Ward 5 : INFLATED VOTE TOTALS "
All of the sources and info in this video are dead accurate / thoroughly vetted by BBV and assisting expert statisticians .
( Bradbloggers , if you have n't seen this and other videos BBV produced re the NH Primary Election disaster , please watch the above video .
I believe what we saw is critical to understanding the problems in Alaska Shannyn is detailing above .
Also sheds some light on just how massive this victory for Obama really is , as some of us believe there was a massive hack attempt to manipulate the primaries / secure the Dem nomination for Hillary .
This might explain why they cemented the odd choice of PALIN as VP -- who they would have LOVED to see take on Hillary in the general election .
Their old script re : ' christian base turnout '/ and ' visceral Hillary haters ' just might 've worked ! )
You might want to give Bev a shout , if you have n't already , as her data might put you leaps and bounds ahead in your research , give you the timely edge needed .
Also , Karen from Illinois , a regular poster here , has all the numbers on file and some VERY intriguing theories on how this was successfully achieved .
Keep up the great work , and please continue to keep us in the loop with what you discover .

GA numbers are down because of their " poll tax " ID requirements .
This was expected .
This can only be countered by a national program of assistance to get the lower - income and elderly their ID's .
Hopefully , Obama will work to get a National Holiday for ELection Day and Paper Ballots For ALL .
I would even be willing to trade a requirement of State ID in exchange for same - day registration ( with said ID ) , knowing we could invest our money in getting those who need them the IDs .

Hmmm ... interesting analysis .
I like the smell of fish ... perhaps even more than fish do .
I am wondering when the last ( mostly ) honest election was held .
My best guess is 1952 .
Any election is on a gradation of the honesty / dishonesty dichotomy .
Does anyone here have any ideas on how to have a mostly ( 99 % and up ) honest election ?

Having lived a short while in Fairbanks I do not find your data provided far fetched in its suggestion that there was some serious hanky panky which occurred in Alaska because of Sarah Palin supporters .
Alaska is a corrupt and entrentched incorrigible retro throwback culture where there should be a federal investigation into the strong possibility that the results of the election were manipulated as a made to order action instigated by Sarah Palin extremists .
I met some very mice people in Alasak but Sarah Palin represents the worst and most ignorant of the rednecks up there in a state that buys off its population with crumbs tossed to them from the oil revenues used to payoff the whole state .

In spirit , perchance , but otherwise just seems to be someone who figured out with the rest of us that proprietary software in public voting was and is by itself a disaster for the voter .
Unfortunately they then locked on to the open source concept as the solution to all e-voting problems and ... froze in mid-step .
Never completed the logical analysis as it evolved and most other folks realized that e-voting itself had insurmountable built - in flaws .
And then this person was persistent enough in his approaches to engage in deceptive ploys here using multiple screen names ... and you can guess what happened when he ignored the warnings about that behavior .

How about : Obama in 2008 had virtually the same vote count as Bush in 2004 ( nationwide ) !
There were a record # of Democratic registrations in 2008 because of the extended Hillary / Obama primary , too !
Maybe it's not so much a low 2008 count in both cases , but you 're further proving the stolen 2004 election , too .
The count was way too high in 2004 .
Are we assuming the 2004 counts were accurate when we 're comparing them ?
Personally , I think the 2004 AND the 2008 counts are n't to be trusted .
That would mean , we are n't concerned that there were problems with the 2004 counts .
Was n't Alaska the state where they were fighting to suppress vote information in 2004 ?
Or was it 2006 ?
Does anyone believe that George Bush got 62 million votes in 2004 and Obama got 63 million votes in 2008 ?
Does anyone believe Kerry got 59 million votes in 2004 and Obama got 63 million in 2008 ?
Somehow , I just do n't believe those numbers .
They 're hard to believe .
How about this one : Bush in 2004 got 62 million , and McCain / Palin got 55 million .
So , Bush got 7 million more votes than McCain / Palin ???
Somehow , that just does n't seem right ( to me ) .
Also , 3 - 4 million total less votes in the 2008 Obama / McCain race than the 2004 Bush / Kerry race ?
After a record new amount of registrations ?
Gee , that 's hard to believe , is n't it ???

I think one could figure out if there was election fraud with the " turn out " facts presented here .
Election boards check off whether or not someone voted .
They keep this record in there voter registration books .
( they check your name off in someway when they hand you a ballot , so they know not to give you another so you do n't vote twice . )
Check this count .
If it matches the number of votes cast then it verifies this voter turn out question .
... BUT these records might have been rigged with also , you might say ...
Well , then a party should randomly audit this record .
( have a party contact a significant random sample of voters that were and were not checked to have voted in this election , to survey if they say they did or did not . ) - no invasion of privacy and can be easily done .
What do you think ?

*[ UPDATE : I have edited this story to clarify that the bike tax is not , at this time , a part of Governor Kulongoski ’s Jobs and Transportation Act . ]
The BTA ’s Karl Rohde ( in red ) says he
supports the concept of a bike tax .
( Photo J. Maus )
Both Metro and the Bicycle Transportation Alliance ( BTA ) are supportive of an idea to create a bike tax .
According to BTA lobbyist Karl Rohde , the idea — which he stresses is still just a “ concept ” at this point — was one of the recommendations of the Governor ’s Transportation Vision Committee ( on which he and BTA director Scott Bricker were a part of ) .
Governor Kulongoski has not included the bike tax in his Jobs and Transportation Act of 2009 that he announced last week .
The bike tax comes up just briefly in a section of a report given to Kulongoski titled , Transitional First Steps : Immediate actions for an evolving transportation system .
The report reads ( emphasis mine ) :
… Existing programs , such as the Safe Routes to Schools program , which receive federal , state and local funding , should be expanded to reach more of Oregons children through education and infrastructure improvements .
Implementing a point - of - sale excise tax on the purchase of adult bicycles should be used to enhance bicycle transportation , including Safe Routes to Schools .
( Update :
The discussion of the tax so far has revolved around a fee of between $ 5 to $ 20 per bike .
The committee also urged a 0.5 % increase in the amount devoted to bike infrastructure in the Oregon Bicycle Bill . )
Rohde says he supports the bike tax concept for two main reasons .
First , he feels like it will be an important political tool to counter arguments that bikes do n’t pay their share to maintain and build roads .

Rohde says the revenue source created by the tax “ would be safer ” than other funding streams .
“ If we ’re relying on gas tax or something like that to pay for bike programs , it could be at risk , ” he told me via telephone yesterday .
He likened the BTA ’s support for the idea to licenses for hunters and fishermen .
Rohde said hunting and fishing groups are supportive of the licenses ( they ’ve even pushed to make them more expensive ) because the money goes to firearm safety education and other programs .
Metro , a regional , elected government agency , also seems to support a bike tax idea .
In their recently published case statement that was sent to Congress as part of a funding effort by the Rails to Trails Conservancy , Metro included the text below in a section titled , New Funding :
Potential for Bicycle Community Contribution .
Pursue a contribution or registration fee for bicycles to engage cyclists and to address concern , however mistaken , that cyclists dont carry their weight .
This may be an important equity effort , rather than a key funding source .
It will be interesting to see how the bike tax idea develops in the coming months .
Depending on your point of view , it can be seen as a massive mistake , or a welcome opportunity to finally silence critics who have long complained that bikes do n’t pay their way .

The " semantic Web " does not sound like it 's fun and easy to use , but it could make surfing Web 3.0 a more rewarding and interactive experience .
Some believe it could even lead to a new form of artificial intelligence .
Spotlets pop up on a ' semantic Web ' kiosk run by a pair of German researchers .
The idea behind the semantic Web , very broadly , is that things on the Internet will be described with descriptor languages so that computers can " understand " what they are .
An object might be a marked as a car part or a person , for instance .
If objects were thus identified , an enormous network of linked data would emerge and machines , with their vast processing speeds , could suggest surprising and useful links that the human mind could never come up with , posing the possibility of a new sort of artificial intelligence .
The semantic Web is considered a key part of the upcoming " Web 3.0 . "
It 's starting to occur here and there , but widespread adoption is still a long way off .
A pair of German researchers have created an experimental kiosk that lets you easily use semantic Web capabilities -- even if you have no idea what they are .
All that is needed is an iPhone and a finger with which to drag icons around on the kiosk 's touch screen .
The kiosk takes advantage of the fact that MP3 files are " things " that have already been described in ways that machines can understand .
That 's because they have ID3 tags , which supply information on the artist and album .
An MP3 file on an iPhone is already a semantic annotated object , which means it 's easily read by a computer .
Place the iPhone on the kiosk 's surface and a circle appears around it .
Next to that automatically appears a list of songs arranged by artist , title or genre .
Nearby on the screen are various " spotlets , " intelligent agents that can perform different actions with the objects .
One spotlet , for instance , plays MP3s that are dragged on top of it .
There 's also a YouTube spotlet .
Suppose you want to find videos related to Coldplay .
Place your finger on the band 's icon next to your phone and simply drag it on top of that spotlet .
Instantly , icons for the first five videos from the YouTube search results appear around the spotlet .
Unwittingly , you 've just done a search using semantic Web capabilities .
Now , if you drag one of those icons onto the spotlet , the video will play .
( Click here to watch a demonstration . )
Searching for new possibilities
These are just simple examples .
Much more can be done with the system .
Other semantic
Web tools are not nearly as fun .
Consider , for instance , SPARQL , a query language .
To find , say , music artists associated with the producer Timbaland , you 'd have to type a long piece of convoluted code that most of us would n't bother to do .
" Complex operations should be hidden , " says Simon Bergweiler , who along with fellow researcher Matthieu Deru , created the kiosk project at the Advanced Tangible Interface Lab at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence in Saarbrücken .
The team also will soon launch a Web - site version of their system , where users can drag icons with a cursor instead of their finger .
Users also can employ speech commands , which has interesting implications for home entertainment systems .
Reaching out to share the moment
But what the team really liked was the use of natural gestures .
" Via simple gestures , one can interact with content of Web 3.0 knowledge - bases without concrete knowledge of SPARQL or other Web 3.0 components , " notes Bergweiler .
The idea is that their system can be used for quick and precise interaction with any rich semantic content .
Real - world settings might include heavily trafficked places like airports or train stations , where they envision their kiosk ending up in the future .
( They do n't actually like the word " kiosk " -- they prefer " shared interaction space . " )
You might want to quickly play a video from your iPhone to a group of friends , for instance , on a larger screen without the hassle of AV cables or any other setup .
" The idea of in - the - moment sharing and exploring in a public place , or even as a public event , is a very interesting one that I am surprised has n't shown up in bars and at concert events , " says Andrew Hawn , a strategist with consumer trend research firm Iconoculture .
Garage mechanics could also use such kiosks .
Suppose mechanical parts have RFID antennas with semantic product memory .
In that case , you could get technical data simply by placing a part on the surface of the kiosk .
The German team will soon set up interactive kiosks for German libraries to help visitors perform searches that involve context .
Consider , for instance , searches like this : " Violin concerto compositions written by Mozart when he was in Salzburg . "
Or : " Books written by Nobel prize winners of the last decade . "
Google and most other search engines cannot easily help with the desired context .
" Only context information that contains the semantics can resolve and give an answer to these questions , " notes Bergweiler .
A few new Web sites , like Cluuz.com , attempt to use semantics for better searching , albeit with their own approaches to the challenge .
Cluuz does better than Google with " Nobel prize winners 1990s , " but it 's worse at many other queries .
The semantic Web , when and if it fully blooms , will complement , not replace , the current Web .
What 's missing so far are enough fun ways to use it .
Beware this Saudi deal to help bail out Britain .
It comes with a devastating IOU
With all eyes fixed upon the political excitements in the U.S , few have paid much attention to a trip made by the Prime Minister several thousand miles in the opposite
direction .
A week ago Gordon Brown , accompanied by his new best friend the Business Secretary Lord Mandelson , went cap in hand to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states to ask them to help bail out the stricken economies of the West by pumping billions into the
International Monetary Fund .
Scroll down for more
Close : King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia meeting Prime Minister Gordon Brown in October last year .
It is more than a little strange that the British Prime Minister should have apparently taken it upon himself to speak on behalf of the IMF .
But the real concern is that asking for help from Saudi Arabia is not like tapping your friendly neighbourhood bank manager for a bigger overdraft .
No , this loan comes with a devastating IOU — nothing less than a big slice of control over Britain and the West by a regime at the heart of the attempt to bring about the Islamisation of the free world .
Granted , this country is facing a truly grave financial crisis .
But does this mean we should remortgage the future of the West to those whose most radical elements are
actively engaged in seeing it destroyed ?
Alarming
I have long been concerned by Britain’s
failure to acknowledge the true nature of the threat from global Islamism .
This latest move is yet more alarming evidence of that process .
Saudi Arabia is at the root of the Islamic onslaught against the West .
It is Saudi ’s Wahhabi form of Islam which , along with its Shi’ite counterpart in Iran , aims to restore the dominance of Islam in the world and destroy rule by ‘ unbelievers ’ .
It is Saudi money which has fuelled the enormous spread of Wahhabi mosques , preachers and educational institutions in this country , delivering the message of holy
war and radicalising countless thousands of British Muslims .
And it is this Saudi ideology which was the inspiration for Al Qaeda .
True , Al Qaeda turned upon Saudi itself on account of its ties with the U.S.
As a result , Saudi regards Al Qaeda as its mortal enemy , and as such co-operates with Britain and the U.S in combating it .
But sometimes , to rephrase the old adage , our enemy ’s enemy is not actually our friend , but our enemy as well .
Saudi Wahhabism seeks to conquer the West through a pincer movement comprising violence on the one hand and cultural infiltration and takeover on the other .
At the very least , Saudi Arabia speaks with the most lethal of forked tongues , and we should actively be seeking to diminish its influence over our affairs .
But instead our Prime Minister is effectively offering it yet more opportunity to control us .
Mr Brown claimed he did not want such investment to be used to gain political influence .
But Lord Mandelson blurted out the truth when he acknowledged that the Saudis and other Gulf states would expect a bigger role in global institutions in return .
Takeover : The Islamic world has already bought Manchester City football club .
This should be enough to chill the British marrow .
Islamic influence is already spreading in Britain and the West , way beyond Muslim communities themselves .
The Islamic world is buying a financial stake in increasing numbers of Western institutions .
Among its latest acquisitions are Manchester City Football Club , which was sold to the ruling family of Abu Dhabi , and Barclays Bank , which has secured an almost £ 6 billion capital injection from Abu Dhabi and Qatar .
Extremist Islamist ideas are also being spread through Islamic study centres attached to our universities .
According to Professor Anthony Glees , eight universities — including Oxford and Cambridge — have accepted more than £ 233.5 million from Saudi and Muslim sources since 1995 , spreading radicalism and helping create within Britain two separate identities and sets of allegiance .
' Bribery '
Shockingly , Saudi blackmail has also forced Britain to suspend its own rule of law by ditching the bribery investigation into the arms deal between Saudi Arabia and BAE systems , in response to an explicit threat made by the Saudi authorities that , if the case continued , ‘ British lives on British streets ’ would be at risk .
Those are n’t my words , they are from Britain ’s former ambassador to Saudi Arabia , Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles .
Thus , the Islamists are already pulling British strings through the supremely manipulative combination of the threat of violence and the lure of unbridled wealth .
Apparently oblivious to all this , however , Mr Brown has pledged to make London the global centre of Islamic banking .
Accordingly , Britain ’s major banks are eagerly embracing sharia finance , on the basis that it is a source of vast wealth .
What they fail to realise is that sharia is also a project for Islamising society , and wherever it is embraced it will use its position to do precisely that .
The assumption is that sharia banking — which has at its heart the prohibition of interest — accords with ancient Islamic religious principles .
Not so .
Sharia banking was devised by mid-20th century Islamist ideologues specifically to further their strategy for global Islamic rule by creating separate administrative systems .
Muslims are required to donate a proportion of their income to charity , including the money that goes through the sharia banking system .
Yet in many instances , the clerics deciding where this ‘ charity ’ money should go are
the spiritual godfathers of terror , such as Sheik Yusuf Qaradawi , who supports suicide bombing in Iraq and Israel , and Sheik Muhammed Taqi Usmani , who has admitted h ran a madrassa that supported the Taliban , yet who sits on the sharia supervisory board of the Dow Jones Islamic Index Fund .
It ’s no surprise , then , that many charitable donations end up being channelled straight into terrorist organisations such as Hamas and Hezbollah .
But apart from being a global money - laundering exercise for terrorism , sharia banking is also a beachhead in the attempt by radical Islam to infiltrate British and Western society .
' Seductive '
The key point is that sharia does not recognise the superior authority of the secular law of the land .
Sharia financial institutions may not be making this clear — they do n’t want to frighten people away — but at some future time they may do so .
This is how they will endeavour to spread sharia beyond their own territory .
There are already examples of sharia regulations over - riding commercial decisions .
Citibank , for example , launched the Saudi American Bank ( SAB ) in Jeddah and Riyadh .
In 1980 , the Saudis abruptly seized the SAB , denied Citibank all future profits and ordered it to train Saudi staffers because the bank was judged insufficiently Muslim .
When trillions of pounds and dollars become locked into Islamic banking and Saudi and other Islamic institutions , who will be in a position to argue with the Islamists when they finally call in their IOUs ?
But our politicians and financiers seem blind to this prospect — because they are mesmerised by the seductive prospect of so much wealth .
Moreover , the British establishment does not believe that what we are being subjected
to is a religious war .
That is why their response to the steady encroachment of Islamic radicalism in our society is so weak .
And that is why I fear the British Prime Minister is in danger of selling this country to those who are intent upon undermining our most treasured freedoms .
More than giving hostages to fortune , he is enabling fortune itself to hold
Britain hostage .
Oregon Territory relied on local jails for the housing of prisoners until 1853 .
Legislature recognized the need for a new prison and authorized the construction of one in 1851 .
In 1853 a site was finally selected in Portland .
An out of business whiskey shop on Front Street was used to temporarily house the inmates .
Oregon 's first state prison ( The Oregon Territory Jail ) was originally located in Oregon City ( the state capital at the time ) in 1842 .
After four years it was moved to Portland and in 1866 it was moved to a 26 - acre site in Salem and enclosed by a reinforced concrete wall averaging 25 feet in height .
The penitentiary currently has special housing units for multi-custody inmates ; disciplinary segregation ; offenders with psychiatric problems ; and inmates sentenced to death .
Executions , which are by lethal injection in Oregon , are conducted at the penitentiary .
The 233 - bed , self - contained Special Management Housing unit provides housing and control for those death row and male inmates who disrupt or pose a substantial threat to the general population in all department facilities .
Most housing in the penitentiary is in large cell blocks with most inmates housed in double cells .
The penitentiary also has a full - service infirmary .
​ Oregon State Penitentiary ( OSP ) is the oldest prison in Oregon and the only maximum - security institution currently operated by the Oregon Department of Corrections .
The Penitentiary has been sited at three separate locations .
Originally , the Penitentiary was called the Oregon Territory Jail and was in Oregon City , then the capitol of Oregon .
The Territory Jail was built in April 1842 .
The Jail was later destroyed by fire on August 18 , 1846 .

MOSCOW , Nov. 1 ( UPI ) -- Russia says its
Navy warships are set to hold drills in the Indian Ocean after leaving Venezuelan waters in several weeks .
A fleet of ships , led by the missile cruiser Pyotr Veliky , plan to conduct combat naval exercises in the Indian Ocean before making a number of calls to ports in the Arabian Sea , RIA Novosti reported Saturday .

The Arabian Sea -- an intersection of major trading routes -- increasingly has been occupied by pirates attacking commercial and civilian vessels .
The planned naval drills will help deter piracy as will a Russian missile frigate that last week began patrolling the waters of the Gulf of Aden , the Russian news agency reported .

If you ’ve never owned a pair of desert boots , now ’s the perfect time to add this quintessential style to your footwear rotation .
As Clarks Originals celebrates the dapper silhouette 's 70th anniversary , they ’re gearing up to launch an updated version — the Desert Boot 221 — that adds some unique twists to an otherwise iconic boot .
Careful not to tinker too much with perfection , the Desert Boot 221 receives an all - new last specifically engineered for superior fit and comfort while a fully molded OrthoLite insole made from recycled materials sits above the signature crepe outsole .
For the uninitiated , the desert boot ’s aptly - named silhouette was created by Nathan Clark , the great - grandson of Clarks Originals co-founder James Clark .
Nathan was deployed to Burma ( present - day Myanmar ) in 1941 for two reasons : to defend his country and scout for any interesting footwear trends to bring home .
That ’s when he noticed local soldiers sporting a type of crepe - soled suede boot that was durable and hardwearing , yet comfortable enough for all - day wear as part of their uniforms .
Nathan soon learned those boots could withstand harsh weather and brutal desert conditions and endeavored to create his own version — the legendary Clarks Originals Desert Boot .

Since its release in 1950 , the Desert Boot quickly rose to prominence thanks in large part to subcultures around the world — from Mod and Britpop to Hollywood figures — adopting it as their footwear of choice .
There was a unique British - ness about the boots that people flocked to , and its most famous supporters included The Beatles , Bob Dylan , and Steve McQueen .
With the latest Desert Boot 221 model , Clarks Originals continues to innovate its most enduring silhouette with a slate of new updates .
The uppers are crafted from chrome - free suede that also provides stain and water resistance , making them ideal for the fall and winter months when weather can become unpredictable .
For an added personal touch , each pair comes with a choice of seven fobs and laces in a variety of colors — from yellow to pastel green to sky blue and pink — so you can rock them your own way .

The Desert Boot 221 comes in white , black , and olive suede at a retail price of $ 210 .

The paparazzi should have been hiding in the hedges that evening .
Cindy Crawford , Goldie Hawn , John Mayer , and some 50 other Hollywood and media types were gathered in the Malibu home of one of L.A. ’s biggest power brokers , Universal Studios president Ron Meyer , and his wife , Kelly .
The guest of honor at this 2005 dinner party : William McDonough .
“ He is , ” Kelly Meyer tells me later , “ the environmental architect of our time . ”

One of the so - called Hollywood eco-wives , Meyer had been introduced to McDonough by Cameron Diaz , who had herself met the architect while filming a documentary on renewable energy .
On the California evening in question , the Meyers ’ guests were to be schooled in McDonough ’s “ cradle to cradle ” concept , his call for the redesign of design itself .
Surrounded by oversize renderings of McDonough ’s iconic works — the 10 - acre green roof atop Ford Motor Co. ’s River Rouge factory , Herman Miller ’s GreenHouse offices — the celebs heard firsthand the environmental legend ’s manifesto for a waste - free world .
“ He talked about moving this forward without deprivation and self - flagellation , ” Meyer remembers .
Of all the people McDonough met that night , Gucci ’s former creative director made the most lasting impression .
“ One of my favorite moments was meeting Tom Ford , ” McDonough told me this summer .
“ I had enough of a conversation with him that I could call him up and say , ‘ Hey , Tom , remember we met at that dinner ?
I think it ’s time for cradle to cradle to move into the fashion industry .
Could I get your help with that ? ’ ” McDonough , born in Tokyo , grew up watching his father , a Seagram ’s president , perfect the art of strategic hobnobbing .
And three years later , he is still harvesting the fruit planted that night in Malibu .
In July , Meyer and her good friend Laurie David , ex-wife of comedian Larry David , traveled with McDonough to Iceland , where McDonough hosts a getaway every year for guests such as PayPal cofounder Elon Musk and actress Daryl Hannah , who voyage north to dream up solutions to the climate crisis over salmon fishing , wine , and Icelandic pony riding .
The Iceland adventure is McDonough ’s homespun answer to Richard Branson ’s gathering at his private Necker Island , which McDonough attended earlier this year — along with former British prime minister Tony Blair , Google cofounder Larry Page , and venture capitalist Vinod Khosla .
“ I have a kind of wonderment when I ’m with all these people , ” he says about the Branson getaway .
“ Like , I wonder how many fabulous things we could come up with .
It ’s literally wonderful — full of wonder . ”
For his own iteration , McDonough , who is repped by the Hollywood agency CAA , cherry - picks people he meets throughout the year .
“ I say , ‘ You must come to Iceland . ’
I do n’t say much more than that , ” he explains , having also learned from his father the power of the soft sell .
The guests pay their own way .
After nearly a week along the Vatnsdalsa River , Laurie David is fired up about making household names of both McDonough and cradle to cradle , his defining idea .
“ Any time you put people in a room with Bill McDonough , they leave there blown away , their mouths agape , ” she tells me .
“ I had a similar feeling when I first met Al Gore . ” Coming from David , that ’s quite a statement :
The former TV exec helped persuade Gore to turn his apocalyptic slide show into a film and took a producer credit on An Inconvenient Truth .
For David and the rest of McDonough ’s legions of acolytes , he is nothing less than an oracle .
“ Al Gore helped us figure out the problem , ” David says , “ and I think Bill McDonough has a lot of the answers . ”
No one has migrated from the fringes of enviro - geek design to the soft spotlight of pop culture as gracefully as McDonough .
Long before the word “ sustainability ” was part of the average CEO ’s vocabulary — and before , as McDonough puts it , “ LEED [ the green building standard ] was even a twinkle in somebody ’s eye ” — he had begun postulating a third industrial revolution , one with the potential to transform how goods are made , cities are built , and literally everything is broken down and reused .
His radical cradle - to - cradle philosophy demands that every product be designed for disassembly at the end of its lifetime , either returning harmlessly to the soil or going back into a “ closed - loop industrial cycle ” to be reused .
With mainstream America beginning to see that we may have a planetary problem on our hands , McDonough has come to be seen as both a prophet and a savior .
If only it were that simple .

McDonough , 57 , now owns or is a partner in four businesses , with cradle to cradle as the common thread : McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry ( MBDC ) is a materials firm that consults with companies on their products ’ “ cradle to cradleness ” and certifies them ; his architecture firm , William McDonough +
Partners , designs buildings that embody cradle - to - cradle principles ; McDonough Consulting manages the designer ’s personal brand ( primarily speaking gigs and corporate consulting ) ; and as a venture partner at VantagePoint Venture Partners ( one of the clean - tech Silicon Alley VC firms behind Tesla Motors ) , McDonough advises on investments with an eye toward producing cradle - to - cradle products .
McDonough has been building this portfolio of businesses , and his credentials as a prophet , for more than half his life .
As early as 1985 , a mere decade after graduating from Yale during the 1970s energy crisis , he landed on page one of the New York Times business section for designing the Environmental Defense Fund ’s national headquarters .
The Wall Street Journal profiled him a few years later on its front page , highlighting his firm ’s breakthrough design for a solar - powered skyscraper in Poland ( the building was never built , says McDonough , due to the fall of the Communist regime ) .
McDonough really began to solidify his visionary status in 1991 , when he met Michael Braungart , a German chemist and former Greenpeace director — and the key to extending McDonough ’s environmental design principles beyond architecture .
Together , they arrived at the cradle - to - cradle idea , which would soon become synonymous with McDonough .
“ I remember Michael saying to me one day , ‘ You ’ve got the ability to carry this message , and you will be really good at it , ’ ” says McDonough , who is known for being as charismatic as he is eloquent .
Braungart introduced McDonough to the mayor of Hannover , Germany , who commissioned him to write a revolutionary manifesto for sustainable design ; a few years later , that document helped win the young and relatively inexperienced architect the coveted post of dean of the University of Virginia ’s School of Architecture .
This lofty position gave McDonough the ideal platform for developing his own voice and spreading his message .
Despite a thin administrative résumé , McDonough had a vision for remaking the world that seduced nearly everyone he encountered .
“ Much of the challenge in the environmental movement is to tell compelling stories in a way that is accessible to a broad public , ” says Maurice Cox , an architecture professor at the university who was part of the team that hired McDonough in 1994 .
“ We were struck by his ability to tell a story , to make environmental issues seem to matter .
I think there was also an incredible urgency that he communicated . ”
During McDonough ’s five years as the “ Green Dean , ” he moved his architecture firm from New York to Charlottesville , Virginia , building environmental landmarks such as Gap ’s corporate campus and Nike ’s European headquarters .
He and Braungart opened MBDC , the materials - research firm , to build a database of “ all chemicals used by humans , ” step one in constructing the commercial platform for their cradle - to - cradle idea .
By this point , few would have guessed that McDonough was once a shy kid who had cycled through 19 different schools before he was 18 , or that he ’d learned his hypnotic oratory by studying a book called The Art of Memory , which chronicles how Roman senators gave gripping three - hour speeches that brought audiences to their knees .
He became a regular on the university speaking circuit and cultivated a passionate corporate following , including Herman Miller and Steelcase .
At the same time , his day job at UVA was slipping through the cracks .
“ It was busy and difficult for him to manage , ” says Judith Kinnard , who became chair of the department during his tenure .
“ I think Bill was focused more on the big picture than the details of integrating his ideas into the school . ”
McDonough left in 1999 .
Now a former academic , an architect , a materials expert , a corporate consultant , and an eco-evangelist , by 2002 McDonough had become the face of sustainable design .
That year , he and Braungart published Cradle to Cradle : Remaking the Way We Make Things .
It was ghostwritten by a poet , and in its wake , McDonough was named a Fast Company Master of Design and ordained by Wired as the “ Prophet of Bloom . ”
Soon enough , it was n’t just companies wanting to pair up with McDonough , it was entire countries , including China .
He currently serves as cochair of the China — U.S. Center for Sustainable Development , as a member of GE ’s Ecomagination board , and as chair of the Future of Sustainable Construction for the 2009 World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .
He is a board member of Prince Charles ’s business and the environment program , as well as the recipient of the Presidential Award for Sustainable Development and a National Design Award .
He was Esquire ‘s 2005 “ Big Thinker of the Year ” and one of Time ‘s “ Heroes for the Planet . ”
Today , McDonough charges some $ 50,000 a speech .
He ’s a regular at thought - leadership conferences like TED , the Clinton Global Initiative , and Google Zeitgeist , where he networks with entrepreneurs and politicians , cementing his role in history .
He and Brad Pitt cofounded a New Orleans nonprofit and are recruiting architects to help rebuild the Lower Ninth Ward .
In May , Vanity Fair , in an adulatory seven - page profile , crowned him “ a prophet of the sustainability and clean - technology movements . ”

“ This is how my life works , ” McDonough says , aglow at his good fortune .
Charlottesville is no Hollywood , no Davos , not even an Iceland .
Although the Green Dean is no more , McDonough still calls the small college town home .
Housed in a lemon - yellow building that looks more dentist office than toxicity - testing chamber , MBDC is marked by a laminated computer printout tacked to the door .
A few blocks away , I meet McDonough at McDonough Consulting , upstairs from his architecture firm , which is now working with NASA to build an office that “ operates like an organism ” and with Google to make its Mountain View , California , Googleplex more sustainable .
As he walks toward me dressed in his signature all - black ensemble , he has a vaporous quality about him , like a mirage coalescing on the spot .
The grin on his face recalls what others have told me :
You are honored to be in his presence — and he knows it .
McDonough waves me over toward a wall adorned with a few framed photos , including one of him shaking hands with a Chinese official .
“ If you gave her a cigarette and shaved her head , she would look just like her dad , ” he laughs .
The official is Deng Nan , Deng Xiaoping ’s daughter and McDonough ’s cochair at the China — U.S. Center for Sustainable Development .
In the photo , as he has told many packed conference halls , Deng Nan had just signed a memorandum for China to adopt cradle to cradle .
Then McDonough points to a rendering he created of an ecologically correct Chinese city .
It is a utopian image of a skyline that looks more like a sugarcane field , he says , with lush foliage in place of conventional roofs .
A mother and son are farming on one .
“ That ’s what ’s so great about having an architecture firm , ” he says .
“ We can render ideas visible — it ’s really fun . ”
McDonough ’s office is accented with his own creations : Herman Miller ’s first cradle - to - cradle - certified chair , the Mirra ; Shaw Industries ’ PVC - free EcoWorx “ A Walk in the Garden ” carpet ; Steelcase ’s 100 % biodegradable nontoxic Climatex fabric .
“ If you look at most of the people in the environmental movement who talk about the environment , they ’re telling other people ’s stories , ” he says .
But what ’s so compelling about his stories , he adds , is that “ I actually create the stories by doing the work .
I am telling my own stories . ”
He cites Oberlin College ’s Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies — “ a building like a tree ” — as a quintessential example .
“ I made this building .
It creates more energy than it needs to operate .
That ’s a great story ! ”
McDonough knows that the more his stories are retold , the more permanent they become .
As someone who believes that “ commerce is the engine of change , ” as he puts it , McDonough has never confined his ambition to the high plains of principle .
The virtue of his cradle - to - cradle idea is that it offers a virtuous result — infinite abundance with no waste — through an unabashedly commercial channel , namely manufacturing .
If he could establish himself in that chain as the arbiter of clean products , there is no limit to what it might yield — for everyone .
“ The faster and larger our business grows , ” he told me , “ the better the world gets . ”
McDonough has struggled , however , to grow that business .
He has dabbled with various models in his hope of making cradle to cradle take off .
There was the “ Ralph Lauren of sustainability ” model , in which McDonough would design product lines and become a multimedia personality ( abandoned three years ago , after he realized that “ really changing the compass of global society is going to require more than a brand ” ) .
Then he and Braungart considered selling MBDC to a larger consultancy , only to realize that would mean handing over the intellectual property , a loss of control he could n’t tolerate .
Then there was the nonprofit model , which , McDonough tells me , he has studied and “ has n’t worked . ”

McDonough did begin taking steps several years ago to formalize cradle to cradle as an official certification , essentially a LEED - style rating system for product design .
He developed 35 criteria — from toxicity to renewable power to social fairness — and began charging companies between $ 5,000 and $ 20,000 per certification .
Every time he certifies a product , whether as simple as a diaper or as complex as a new office cubicle , he records each of its ingredients ’ “ cradle to cradleness ” in a master database .
Ultimately , his plan is for the data to become a sort of Human Genome Project for chemicals .
To date , though , he has certified just 160 products — a good 29,840 short of his stated goal by 2012 .
“ Cradle to cradle ’s been out for seven or eight years , ” says Rob Watson , founding chairman of LEED , which is administered by the U.S. Green Building Council ( USGBC ) .
“ But to 99 % of people out there , they think it ’s baby products . ”
Even McDonough concedes his pace has n’t been exactly breakneck : “ Our situation is sort of spectacularly incipient , ” he beams .
“ We ’re right at the beginning of the rollout , even though we ’ve been working on this for decades . ”
( A former colleague notes , “ Every meeting I ’ve ever had with Bill , he ’s always on the cusp of blowing out something big .
The future is always just around the corner . ” )
In truth , whenever conversation with McDonough veers from his oft - recited script , his elegant tales begin to fray .
His new venture - capital gig with VantagePoint , for example , may eventually be an ideal platform for bringing his world - changing vision to scale , a way to bankroll the design and rollout of cradle - to - cradle products .
But for now it seems to be simply a way to make ends meet .
“ It keeps me from running around making my living by giving miscellaneous speeches to miscellaneous groups , ” he says .
Nor is his 1950s home , the architect tells me after a long awkward pause , a model of sustainability but rather “ what I would call a home that ’s holding my family while I dream about the house that I ’d really like to live in . ”
His entire suburban lifestyle bears little resemblance to the eco-perfect world he describes from the stage .
“ I shop at Whole Foods , that kind of stuff , ” he says .
McDonough is not above poetic license .
When I ask him which building marked the genesis of the sustainable - design movement , he points to the office he designed for the Environmental Defense Fund .
“ It was the first green office in the U.S. , ” he says .
Harrison S. Fraker Jr. , dean of the College of Environmental Design at UC Berkeley , demurs : “ Sustainable design started long before McDonough even opened his office … .
McDonough gets credit for everything because he is such a good promoter of all the good things he has done … .
I hate to see false myths perpetuated . ”
Even the term cradle to cradle , for which McDonough has applied for a trademark , is n’t his at all .
According to Hunter Lovins , cofounder of the Rocky Mountain Institute think tank , “ Walter Stahel in Switzerland actually coined the phrase 25 years ago , long before Bill started using it . ”
For those who came to know McDonough from within the environmental and design movements — those whose labors rarely reach the ears of Laurie David — an alternative narrative exists about him .
Until now , it has been shielded from the mainstream for two reasons : First , McDonough has done more than most to popularize the very idea of cleaning up the world , and for that , even his detractors agree he deserves thanks ; second , if word gets out that he may not be all that he appears , the overall cause of sustainability could suffer .
“ He ’s been incredibly important and valuable in this role as visionary , ” says Auden Schendler , executive director of sustainability at Aspen Skiing Co .
“ The problem is that sometimes the theorists like McDonough will represent themselves as practitioners , and that ’s where the guys in the trenches get frustrated . ”
The carpet company Interface was in the trenches far earlier than most .
Way back in 1995 , it decided to pull together an Eco Dream Team of the most influential thinkers on the environment who believed business could be a force of change ; it included Lovins and her Rocky Mountain Institute cofounder ( and then - husband ) Amory Lovins , Smith & Hawken cofounder Paul Hawken , and McDonough , then the new dean of UVA ’s architecture school .
The group was hired to advise on Interface ’s environmental transformation , which included recycling — a radical move in a famously dirty industry .
At the time , Hunter Lovins says , “ Bill was trying to gain the reputation as the thought leader in this field , going around trademarking terms . ”
( McDonough has applied for more than a dozen trademarks , including “ triple top line ” and “ ride the wind . ” )
And when Interface was preparing to go to market , “ Bill presented a business plan that said he owned the rights , ” says John Picard , an environmental consultant on the team , “ like it was his intellectual property .
He was asking for an obscene amount [ of money ] . ”
Says Picard of the unfortunate falling - out McDonough eventually had with the company : “ The issue is that some of the things he thinks he originated no one owns .
These are things that need to be blown up , not sequestered down with a patent . ”
Interface went on to develop its recyclable carpet , now a nearly $ 1 billion business , without McDonough .
The company confirmed the accuracy of Picard ’s account .
“ I do n’t remember that , ” McDonough says now .

The Interface implosion cost McDonough an early and prominent chance to demonstrate his world - changing model — and to become first mover in the market for cradle - to - cradle products .
( Nearly a decade later , he went on to work with Interface competitor Shaw Industries . )
It was n’t the last time he would cannibalize his own potential .
As McDonough ’s reputation grew , he earned access to higher - profile companies .
When Nike , the largest athletic company in the world , decided to hire him in 1999 , McDonough was handed an incredible opportunity to make his ideas a global reality .
He was suddenly designing “ the protocol for the material for a shoe , ” he tells me , and developing a list of chemicals that would render Nike ’s footwear and apparel environmentally sound and toxin free .
McDonough , who includes a Nike shoe in his standard slide show , recalls the period fondly .
“ The great thing about working with Nike was it had tremendous interest in communicating with its supply chain , and it took cradle - to - cradle ideas to heart and developed its own strategy for communicating across an immense supply chain , over 3,000 vendors , ” he tells me .
“ Incredible .
It inspired us .
A lot of what we do today is inspired by our clients . ”
Working with Nike “ inspired us , ” says McDonough .
The folks at Nike remember the collaboration a little differently .
The folks at Nike remember the collaboration a little differently .
“ It was devastating that we could n’t go forward with it , ” says someone who worked closely on the project and requested anonymity .
When McDonough ’s team finished building a list of approved materials for manufacturing , after two years and a hefty consulting fee , Nike told McDonough the time had come to share the details with its thousands of vendors .
To the company ’s shock , McDonough responded that he owned the list — it was proprietary .
“ He wanted to charge us for every supplier we rolled it out to .
We did n’t own it after we paid all this money , which made no sense , ” says the person from the Nike team .
“ You can develop lists until you ’re blue in the face , but if you do n’t have effective ways to roll that out to the supply chain , it ’s not going to change it . ”
Nike , which went on to improve its supply chain independently , confirmed this account to Fast Company and said that , given the huge amount McDonough was demanding , it decided to terminate the relationship .
The company adds that “ neither Bill nor MBDC designed materials for Nike . ”
McDonough says he does n’t recall this episode , either .
Then there is McDonough ’s “ great story ” about Oberlin College and his “ building like a tree . ”
McDonough ’s stunning Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies facility was completed in 2000 ; by the next year , actress Susan Sarandon , in a voice - over for The Next Industrial Revolution , a documentary on McDonough , was describing how “ the building produces more energy than it consumes , ” a claim echoed later that year in a Metropolis magazine profile on the architect .
Four years later , in a 2005 TED conference speech , McDonough was still highlighting his own achievement , telling conferees , “ Here ’s a building at Oberlin College we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate . ”
However , John H. Scofield , an Oberlin physics professor who has taught in the building , began monitoring its energy use when it was completed in 2000 .
He calculated that it was consuming more than twice the energy projected and drawing 84 % of its power from local power plants , rather than renewable sources .
“ We should sue William McDonough + Partners , ” Scofield told The Oberlin Review in 2002 ( he is not a spokesperson for the university ) .
The ambitious design McDonough had proposed for Oberlin was significantly over budget — and had a number of engineering flaws — and had to be scaled back .
In a 2002 Environmental Building News article about the controversy , Scofield is quoted as saying , “ Even after changed plans went into construction , McDonough and others were using 1997 modeling data in their claims about the project .
It won awards based on those claims ! ” David Orr , former chair of Oberlin ’s environmental - studies program , concedes that the award - winning building did n’t become a “ net energy exporter ” until 2006 , after the school funded a $ 1 million upgrade of the solar - power supply .
Orr says Oberlin never claimed the building would achieve its goals immediately —
“ You have to avoid overpromising what you ca n’t deliver ” — but that did n’t prevent McDonough from inserting the story into his globe - trotting sermons .
The Oberlin case is part of a larger pattern , some of his former colleagues say .
“ McDonough does n’t care if the facts are wrong , ” one told me , “ because he ’s a self - mythologizer .
His job in the world is to convince people that a positive future is possible , and it does n’t help his cause to admit there are hiccups and failures along the way . ”

Inscribed near the entrance of McDonough ’s architecture firm in Charlottesville is a favorite mantra : design is the first signal of human intention .
He repeats it religiously , and for him it means that every object contains clues to whether it was created with the earth in mind .
It is one ’s intention , McDonough believes , that one is judged on .
McDonough ’s willingness to let good intentions obscure very mixed results appears to have sometimes clouded his own — and others ’ — view of his abilities .
In Thomas Friedman ’s 2006 documentary Addicted to Oil , the Pulitzer Prize — winning journalist held up McDonough as the kind of problem solver who could wean China from its voracious energy consumption .
“ Bill invited our film crew to join him in Huangbaiyu [ in rural northeast China ] to see firsthand how cradle to cradle translates to China , ” says Friedman in a voice - over , as a herd of cashmere goats ramble by the world - famous architect .
As McDonough had been telling countless audiences and reporters , he ’d been recruited “ to develop protocols for the housing of 400 million people in 12 years , ” rural Chinese who were to migrate to a series of brand new eco-cities .
In the scene , dozens of partially built homes glimmer in the distance , the first glimpse of McDonough ’s redesign of 21st - century Chinese life .
“ Chinese officials at the highest level of government are listening to Bill , ” says Friedman , a few frames later .
“ And if things go well in this trial village , China , of all places , could become a new model of sustainable development . ”
When LEED ’s Rob Watson saw the documentary , he called Friedman immediately .
“ I was like , ‘ Tom , you should have talked to me about this before you put it on Discovery ! ’ ” says Watson , who has been on the ground in China for the last decade developing green building standards and energy codes .
“ That just made me blow a gasket , because when that was being filmed , things were starting to go south , and [ McDonough ] knew it — they knew it !
And they still put it on film !
The whole experiment was touted as a success long after it failed .
Nobody ’s living there , nobody moved in .
It ’s sitting there , literally , rotting . ” Shannon May smelled the rot firsthand .
An anthropology PhD student from UC Berkeley who lived in Huangbaiyu for nearly two years , May first met McDonough in 2005 , the year the project broke ground .
But within several months , it became apparent to May that everything from the village ’s overall design to its construction was deeply flawed .
The homes were suburban - tract style with garages , despite the fact that only four of the expected 1,400 villagers had cars .
The backyards were too small for growing feed corn or raising animals , which the villagers needed to make their living .
But most absurd to her eye was the plan to use agricultural waste to fuel the biogas plant to power the village : leftover corncobs and stalks were the winter food supply for the cashmere goats , the area ’s leading source of cash .
Using them meant the goats would starve .
“ I started calling Bill and telling him these things , and he would be very responsive and concerned on the phone , ” says May , the blonde seen standing behind McDonough in Friedman ’s documentary .
“ What troubled me was that it was as if he knew nothing about the way these people lived .
And he seemed concerned , but then nothing would happen after these phone calls . ”
May says McDonough visited the village only twice while she lived there “ for one or two hours at a time , and only when there was a video camera following him . ”
The supposedly $ 3,500 homes were costing nearly $ 12,000 to build , more than 10 times the villagers ’ median income .
By 2006 , only two families had moved in , and they did so because their previous homes had burned down .
Even then , they had to use antiquated heating rigs because the renewable energy systems did n’t work .
“ It ’s been deleted as if he ’s never been part of it , ” says May , referring to McDonough ’s and the China — U.S. Center for Sustainable Development ’s Web sites , which have been sanitized of all traces of the village .
McDonough declined to be interviewed for a PBS Frontline documentary on the disgraced project that ran earlier this year .
“ It ’s much more like a cover - up , ” says May .
“ He could be such a leader for true world change , such an amazing man .
But he ’s choosing not to be . ”

“ It ’s been deleted as if he ’s never been part of it , ” says May , of the failed China project .
“ It ’s much more like a cover - up . ”
In our first few China discussions , McDonough never mentioned Huangbaiyu — his most widely publicized and only realized project there .
But over the summer , I finally ask him about the village where he ’d taken Friedman .
“ That little village project ? ” he says , clearly caught off guard .
“ We ’ve basically come to the conclusion that [ China ] should let the villagers live where they are . ”
The plans , he explains , consolidated all the farmers into concentrated areas .
“ What we ’re saying now , based on our experience in this village , is that that ’s not a good idea . ”
The homes , he admits , are sitting vacant , but brushes most of the blame onto the developer .
“ It ’s sitting there like a lesson , ” he says vaguely .
“ A lesson for all of us . ”
Two months later , during one of our last talks , McDonough brings up Huangbaiyu on his own .
“ I had sort of cut you off when you asked about the village and said I did n’t want to talk about it .
But I ’m happy to talk about it , ” he says quietly .
“ It ’s been the process of taking in what we could have done , should have done , wished we had done , did n’t get done . ”
McDonough is vacationing in tony Northeast Harbor , Maine .
He has arranged with a friend to swap one of his famous speeches for two weeks in a turn - of - the - century mansion .
Fresh from his annual Iceland pilgrimage , he is bursting to tell me about the gift he received from two of his guests .
During a bit of whale watching , apparently , John Leggate , the former CIO of BP and a fellow partner at VantagePoint , and Tom Darden , a brownfield developer , had decided that McDonough and Braungart needed a business plan to ramp up cradle to cradle .
Back on dry land , they whipped up a 25 - page PowerPoint presentation and gave it to their host .
“ We applauded , jumped up and down , and gave each other hugs , ” recalls McDonough .
The whole event sounds suspiciously like a business intervention .
And McDonough seems to recognize that something has to give .
He tells me he ’s taking the year off from working on the “ cult of personality ” so he can focus instead on how to make cradle to cradle ubiquitous .
“ I ’m not a hyper entrepreneur business head who wants to get an MBA , ” he says .
“ I ’m a designer who dreams stuff .
I do dreamy stuff .
The level of business that I can operate is like running a hardware store . ”
“ I ’m a designer who dreams stuff , ” McDonough says .
“ The level of business I can operate is like a hardware store . ”
For those who passionately want to see McDonough ’s waste - free philosophy take root , that ’s a serious limitation .
Standing before an audience of designers at the 2003 EnvironDesign 7 conference , he announced , “ We ’re launching the GreenBlue program today to give away the cradle - to - cradle protocol freely . ”
That year , Jason Pearson , GreenBlue ’s first employee , moved from Washington , D.C. , to Charlottesville to serve as the organization ’s director of strategy and development and to bring its mission to life .
“ Bill had conveyed to me that the revenue stream for GreenBlue was guaranteed through a technology development he was involved with that would generate hundreds of millions of dollars , ” says Pearson , who had been silent about these events until deciding to talk to Fast Company .
Two years later , the technology had n’t “ actually materialized into something that was licensable and generating revenue .
In the end , there was no guaranteed revenue stream . ”
And in all that time , says Pearson , McDonough had done nothing to make any of the cradle - to - cradle data publicly available , and “ I concluded that we were not moving very quickly toward anything that would make change in the world . ”
In 2005 , Pearson and his staff pleaded with GreenBlue ’s board that the nonprofit would be more effective if it “ established independence from the founders , ” he says .
“ GreenBlue needed to be able to put its head down and focus on a few clear , realistic objectives .
Bill is always interested in the newest big idea .
We simply could not afford the unpredictability that resulted from his shifting interests . ”
Later that year , McDonough stepped down as chairman .
It was n’t until McDonough left that GreenBlue , specifically its Sustainable Packaging Coalition , took off .
The coalition now includes 190 companies — Procter & Gamble , Kraft , and Starbucks among them — that are working to develop environmentally sound packaging practices .
“ Many people still think of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition as a project that has succeeded because of Bill McDonough , which is simply not the case , ” Pearson stresses .
( McDonough had told me , “ I launched something called the Sustainable Packaging Coalition . ” )
Indeed , some have argued that the coalition is succeeding despite McDonough : Earlier this year , his materials firm , MBDC , told GreenBlue it would have to license the term cradle to cradle if the nonprofit wanted to use it .
“ Our respective lawyers went back and forth at substantial cost to GreenBlue , ” says Pearson , now GreenBlue ’s executive director , “ [ but ]
I do n’t have the financial resources , nor the strong motivation , to stop them . ”
By 2010 , the very nonprofit that McDonough founded will be obliged to use terms such as “ green chemistry , ” “ closed - loop material systems , ” and “ industrial ecology ” to describe its work .
Thanks to McDonough and his lawyers , Pearson says , “ we will eliminate the phrase cradle to cradle from any of our materials . ”

That controlling , even litigious , im - pulse seems to be a recurring theme for McDonough .
In 2006 , a Dutch TV station ran a documentary on McDonough and the cradle - to - cradle concept , igniting a reaction similar to the one caused by An Inconvenient Truth in the United States .
Ever since , local governments have been promoting the idea throughout the Netherlands ; in November , a grassroots group threw the first “ Let ’s Cradle Congress . ”
McDonough is reveling in the excitement — except for the fact that now designers in Holland are proudly claiming to practice cradle - to - cradle design .
“ We ’ve sent a few polite letters to people , ” admits Ken Alston , MBDC ’s CEO , about the unauthorized use of the term .
He ’s hinting that they have n’t sued anyone — yet .
On the back deck of his bartered Maine manse , McDonough is wrestling with a patio umbrella as if it were a python .
In his army green shorts — a jarring departure from his standard bow - tied look — he ’s trying to create a little shade .
“ I think we should take it out , ” he says , referring to the long wooden pole set into the glass table .
Soon , all I can see are his bare legs from the knees down .
He looks like he ’s trapped in a teepee .
McDonough desperately needs to break the logjam that has stalled him .
Just as the global fixation on sustainability is exploding , McDonough ’s design revolution is paralyzed — and he is the paralyzing agent , unable to capitalize on his brilliant , crucial idea , but unwilling to set it free .
Last year , Environmental Building News deemed McDonough ’s cradle - to - cradle certification a “ black box ” : “ You can see what ’s going in and what ’s going out , but you ’re not privy to exactly what ’s going on inside the process , ” says Nadav Malin , the trade journal ’s editor .
In truth , among MBDC ’s 160 certifications , virtually the only consumer brands are the U.S. Postal Service and Kiehl ’s — the latter of which Brad Pitt helped push through as a charity product for his foundation .
Critics argue that McDonough ’s work is not transparent or consensus based , and that because he sometimes consults for companies whose products he ’s also certifying , the whole endeavor is conflicted , if not unethical .
“ All the money stays in one place , ” says Tim Cole , director of environmental initiatives and product development at Forbo Flooring , and treasurer of the USGBC .
The impression that emerges , says Cole , is , ” ‘ Hey , if you want your product certified cradle to cradle , just go to McDonough , pay your price , and it will happen . ’
I think cradle to cradle will either have to get better or become a thing of the past .
You have to evolve with the movement . ”
McDonough is trying .
His latest strategy involves , once again , opening up the work to the public — this time to develop MBDC ’s materials database Wiki-style .
Instead of MBDC assessing each chemical itself , it would partner with design firms , companies , and universities around the world .
Anyone , anywhere would be able to upload assessments of chemicals — with McDonough the lone gatekeeper for certifying products .
At the same time , through VantagePoint , he plans on identifying startups that would make cradle - to - cradle goods that could in theory be sold at scale to one of the firm ’s strategic partners , like DuPont .
He has a long way to go : VantagePoint tells me that in the four years McDonough has been working at the firm , there are “ no examples of that happening ” and no products in the pipeline .
Despite the many accolades McDonough has received in the media , he and his ideas are being left behind .
Companies such as Forbo , Knoll , and Milliken Carpet are starting to reject cradle to cradle in favor of a new transparent certification called SMaRT , administered by a nonprofit coalition of government , companies , and environmental groups .
Back on the deck , McDonough is huffing beneath the hunter - green canvas .
“ I ’m sure this has something to do with it , ” he pants , trying to lock the umbrella in place .
“ We need my son to come down and help us figure this out . ”
The architect tells me his 13 - year - old is quite adept at putting things together and taking them apart .

McDonough continues to scare off the very forces that could bring his idea to life .
One corporate sustainability chief , who asked not to be named , says that when McDonough pitched his company to consult , the architect said , ” ‘ I want to be the Bill Gates of sustainability , ’ and [ that ] he wants to make a royalty off of every green standard and every green product out there . ”
The company saw the statements as a red flag and decided not to bring him on board .
“ There are people in organizations who have passed him by today .
Bill is not the leading expert he was at one time . ”
For his part , Aspen ’s Schendler says he knows more than 100 sustainability executives and “ sometimes when McDonough ’s name gets brought up , there ’s a groan . ”
But it is Picard , who worked with McDonough at Interface , who shares the most ominous evidence that McDonough ’s moment is receding : “ I was with a group at MIT [ in May ] with influential billionaires in the room .
One person said , ‘ Why are n’t we working with Bill ? ’
Three people out of the eight had had dealings with Bill , and they were not favorable , ” says Picard .
“ They were adamant that they did not want to work with him . ”
Sweaty and breathless , McDonough finally flips the umbrella upside down onto the deck .
“ Snap this until it snaps into that , ” he instructs me , pointing to a wooden lever .
He is crouching over as if he were inspecting some kind of beached specimen , his hair like a tuft of grass atop a windswept rock .
It ’s hard not to wonder , even with Al Gore ’s Hollywood engine behind him , whether this is really the man to lead the next industrial revolution .
Or whether , as McDonough says , rising with a gasp , “ there ’s an easier way to do this . ”
Her knee - length dreadlocks wrapped in a green cloth , Cassy hoists her two - year - old daughter up on a hip and shuffles in her socks into her big , clean bedroom .
" This house is a castle , " says the slender , soft - skinned former university teaching assistant , shaking her head in disbelief .
" I 've never had a walk - in closet ... and all this space . "
Two months ago , Cassy ( not her real name ) was homeless , out in the rain with her four kids .
Now she has a three - bedroom , two - bathroom , sky - blue house on a tree - lined street in Miami's Buena Vista neighborhood .
She takes warm showers , cooks vegan dinners , and watches the news on a small , fuzzy TV screen .
The only catch :
The house is n't hers .
Cassy is a squatter and , at any moment , could be arrested for trespassing , even burglary .
Not everybody in Miami - Dade County is crying over this year 's 40,342 foreclosed properties .
Cassy is part of a small , well - executed movement by activists at Take Back the Land to relocate homeless families into empty houses and abandoned government - owned buildings .
Info squatters
The 39 - year - old Haitian mother recently lost her North Miami house after agreeing to a too - good - to - be - true mortgage loan .
She lived in the much less spacious place for years before she was forced to leave .
Ironically , the place where she now stays is owned by Lehman Brothers , a major player in the market for subprime mortgages — thought to be a catalyst for the housing crisis .
Cassy was guided to the home two weeks ago by Take Back the Land , a group with a long record of standing up for the poor and needling authorities who fail them .
During the past year , the organization has risked significant legal trouble to aid several people such as Cassy in getting roofs over their heads .
It hopes to do much more .
" We could virtually empty the streets and shelters simply by filling the vacant houses , " director Max Rameau says .
" Homes should go to people , not kept empty so banks can cash in . "
Take Back the Land , which has 10 volunteers , first gained national media attention two years ago after setting up a contentious shantytown called Umoja Village at NW 17th Avenue and 62nd Street in Liberty City .
Asserting the " black community 's right to own land " in its own neighborhood , they erected 21 shanties on public land using wooden pallets and tarps .
After months of wrangling between city zoning authorities and Rameau , the village burnt down in April 2007 .
Residents suspected city employees had a hand in the fire .
Afterward , the activist leader helped 14 displaced villagers to a warehouse in Liberty City , where they stayed for about three weeks .
A new crisis exploded around the same time across the county .
Empty houses began to pop up in record numbers .
Foreclosed properties nearly tripled from 2006 to 2007 , swelling from 9,814 to 26,691 .
And some displaced homeowners — such as Cassy — became temporarily homeless .
Indeed , between January and July 2007 , the number of homeless on the street increased by nearly one - quarter , according to the Miami - Dade Homeless Trust .
Then , on October 22 , 2007 , Take Back the Land moved its first homeless family into a foreclosed house .
The next day — on the one - year anniversary of the Umoja Village construction — Rameau announced he was cooking up a new strategy .
The plan :
Move the homeless into the deserted houses , with or without permission .
They would carefully choose participants , he told the Miami Herald , to avoid " creat[ing ] crack houses in Liberty City . "
The idea soon faded from the public spotlight .
Since then , Take Back the Land has " liberated " six others , Rameau says , aiming to find them a place to stay for at least three months .
The move-ins work like this : Rameau and four other volunteers screen candidates to measure " urgency of need " — and to ensure they are n't mentally ill or addicted to drugs .
Next the group chooses a house .
Repair costs , safety , livability , and proximity to Take Back 's headquarters in Liberty City are considered .
Volunteers then " visit the location several times in order to gauge if the place is being watched , " Rameau says .
Participants are instructed to enter through the front door and to be honest — even to befriend neighbors and put utilities in their own names .
So far , it has worked .
Moreover , independently of Take Back the Land , dozens of other squatters have moved into properties across the city , particularly in Allapattah , Little Havana , and Little Haiti , says city code enforcement director Mariano Loret de Mola .
A month ago , the city passed a law giving police and zoning authorities more power to deal with them — but it has yet to go into effect .
" We 're putting a priority on it because they are places for criminal activity , for drug dealing and drug use , " Loret de Mola says .
" It 's a quality - of - life problem . "
One of the maverick squatters is T - bone , a gray - bearded , slightly spacey 48 - year - old teddy bear of a man who once lived in Umoja Village .
He borrowed a screwdriver in late October , unlocked the front door of a foreclosed home across from a graveyard in Brownsville , and temporarily moved in .
There 's no power or water , and he flicked a lighter to guide New Times through the pitch - black house .
Walls were ripped out , glass bottles lay broken , and plastic toys from the previous residents were strewn about .
In the back , a bare single mattress lay on the floor .
T - bone gave a bashful look .
" It 's hard to find work , " he said .
" I read the paper .
There ai n't no jobs . "
Dozens of Palestinian villages have to bring water by lorry as it is not piped in Israeli human rights group B'Tselem says the West Bank is facing grave water shortages largely because Israel 's " discriminatory " policies .
The group criticises the distribution of joint water resources and limits placed by Israel on the Palestinian Authority 's ability to drill new wells .
" It will have serious repercussions on the economy and health , " B'Tselem said .
West Bank per capita water use is about 66 litres a day - just two - thirds of the recommended international minimum .
The accumulated effects of a series of dry years would make matters worse in the months to come , the group added .
The shortage will have serious repercussions on the economy and the health of tens of thousands of Palestinians
B'Tselem
Obstacles to peace : Water Per capita water consumption by Israeli settlers in the West Bank is 3.5 times that of Palestinians , B'Tselem says .
Water consumption per head of the population is calculated by including the consumption of livestock .
In some parts of the northern West Bank , a largely agricultural area , consumption is far below the overall average , B'Tselem says .
" The chronic water shortage results in large part from Israel 's discriminatory policy in distributing the joint water resources in the West Bank and the limits it places on the Palestinian Authority 's ability to drill new wells , " its statement says .
A recent United Nations report highlighted water shortages in the Gaza Strip , and said a lack of spare parts and fuel meant sewage plants could not function properly .
The Israeli military administration in the West Bank had no immediate comment about the B'Tselem report .
A spokesman for Israel 's water supplier told Jerusalem Post that it provided 500 million cubic meters per year , which is 30 % more than required under peace accords signed in the mid-1990s .
He said Israel was facing water cutbacks and severe shortage itself but continued to increase supply to Palestinians in the West Bank .

What are these ?

Well , there goes Democrats ' chances of getting 60 seats :
ATLANTA - Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss won re-election Tuesday in a runoff , dashing Democrats ' hopes of capturing enough seats in the U.S. Senate to thwart Republican filibusters .
Chambliss ' election to a second term gives the GOP a firewall against Democrats eager to flex their newfound political muscle in Washington .
The monthlong runoff battle against Democrat Jim Martin captured the national limelight , drawing political luminaries from both parties to the state and flooding the airwaves with fresh attack ads .
Minnesota — where a recount is under way — now remains the only unresolved Senate contest in the country .
With 92 percent of the recount completed , the Minneapolis Star Tribune ’s tally had Republican Norm Coleman leading Democrat Al Franken by 340 votes , with nearly 6,000 ballots challenged .
It just gets more and more fascinating ..
People behind the scenes with knowledge of NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg ‘s plans to install himself for a third term say he ’s willing to spend “ as much as $ 100 million ” on his campaign , should it proceed .
You might recall that , in 2001 , Bloomberg spent $ 74 million on his campaign ( when he was technically an unknown ) and at least that much in his 2005 re-election campaign .
Total : $ 160 million thus far .
If Mayor Mike is so sure of his popularity and so convinced that he is the only one who can do the “ job ” in these tough times , why the need to bulldoze over his competition ?
Clearly , he will do whatever it takes to keep himself in City Hall .
Presently , many are stating , that if he accomplishes his goal , the multi-billionaire should “ abide by the strict spending restrictions in the city ’s public finance system . ”
His advisers told the New York Times that “ the mayor had no intention of limiting his spending . ”
Also announced today , two advocacy groups , New York Public Interest Research Group and Common Cause , filed a complaint with the city ’s Conflicts of Interest Board stating that the Mayor ’s behind - the - scenes deal - making with fellow billionaire Ronald Lauder , Estee Lauder heir , amounts to a violation of city ethics laws .
Bloomberg promised Lauder – whose issue since at least 1993 has been term limits – a position on a Charter Revision Commission in return for not challenging ( with his money )
Bloomberg on overturning voted - in term limits .
Ethics not being Michael Bloomberg ’s strong point , I ’m not so certain this will mean much to him .
The city ’s Conflicts of Interest Board members are all appointed by the Mayor .
( See Decision : Daniel L. Doctoroff . )
A thank you to Council Members Bill de Blasio , Letitia James , and David Weprin for taking stands on this issue to bring the matter to the people .
These three Council Members presented alternate proposals to counter Bloomberg ’s in the City Council .
And as Clyde Haberman wrote in today ’s New York Times :
If the city is forced to shrink the number of police officers or to stint on helping the poor or to stop performing maintenance on decrepit water mains , Michael R. Bloomberg will inevitably be cast as Mayor Culpa .
But it is the recklessness of his old Wall Street buddies that went far to create this fiscal tumult , which has poked enormous holes in the municipal budget , which has led to the prospect of severe belt - tightening , which has fed the sharp debate over political term limits , which has more New Yorkers snapping at one another than is absolutely necessary , which has …well , you can extend this for as long as you wish .

IT IS a central tenet of advertising that thin models sell more products .
The only trouble is , it may not be true .
In the first empirical research into the question undertaken in Australia , health psychologists have found young people 's response to an ad , and their willingness to consider buying what it promotes , is exactly the same whether the featured model is catwalk - slender or of a more average body shape .
Phillippa Diedrichs created a series of mock ads , using regular models - typically size eight - and so - called " plus size " models , about size 12 .
She then presented three ads - for a hair - care product , a party dress and underwear - to 400 young people .
She found there was no difference between their responses , with those who viewed the larger models reporting themselves just as interested in buying the goods as those who were presented with the skinnier women .
But on another question the responses did differ : when asked further questions designed to assess their own body satisfaction immediately after viewing the draft ads , the women completing the survey , who were aged 18 to 25 , felt better about themselves if they had been shown the images of larger models , compared with those who saw the slim models .
" For anything to change , research has to be convincing not just to government and health researchers but also to people in advertising who actually make the decisions , " says Diedrichs , whose study is part of her PhD work at the University of Queensland 's Health Psychology Research Unit .
" Often people make the argument that thinness sells , and that 's why they use [ slim models ] .
I ’ve been getting questions from co-workers and friends about how I have my desktop setup so I can get to any application I need quickly .
I ’ve been flattered by a few people adopting variations of my setup , and realized that I should share it just in case it might benefit some of my readers .
I know that your needs are different than mine , so pick off what you like .
I ’m happy to give quick setup guides for anyone that asks .
First things first : 2 Monitors
For as small of a cost as an additional monitor is , I ’m disappointed that more employers do n’t provide a multi-monitor setup for their developers .
Do the math : if you get an extra monitor for $ 250US and it increases your efficiency by even 1 % , it pays for itself in 6 months or less !
Anyway , I have a somewhat typical laptop + monitor setup , and the extra screen real estate is quite helpful , especially since I can keep my browser on one monitor always and then move to all my other applications with a keystroke .
Nothing too special there , but the point here is play the smart money card to get a multi - monitor setup if you can .
Desktops : 4 - 5 wide , 1 deep
Linux definitely makes it easier on me since I get multiple desktops built - in .
Obviously , you can use Spaces on a Mac or VirtuaWin on Windows ( and I do ) to get the ability .
I use 5 desktops ( VirtuaWin can only assign hotkeys for 4 , unfortunately ) and assign a hotkey ( Ctrl + 6 to Ctrl + 0 ) to immediately switch to the appropriate one :
IM clients and chat windows
E-mail
Browser(s )
Shell(s )
IDE / Text editors
The advantage I see here is that I never have to think to get to any window , I can seamlessly move between exactly what I want all the time .
I never have to search through an expose - like interface or alt - tab through a giant list .
However , I do n’t have the ability to open up a ton of windows or it degrades quickly .
I ’m also lucky in that I do n’t need a whole lot open all the time .
If you do n’t need to keep a ton of different things open constantly , you might give this a shot .
Why it works for me
Any possible time - saving aside , I like to keep complete focus on what I ’m doing .
I do n’t want to have to think about where that IM window is .
I like to think that keeping everything easily accessible saves me brain cycles ** that can quickly go toward the task at hand .
I ’m hoping this will inspire some of you to consider how you can setup your screen real estate for maximum productivity .
Do you have any suggestions , or perhaps you think your desktop setup is better ?
Hey , I ’d like to hear it so share in the comments !
UPDATE : I should have probably mentioned that I use Gnome - Do ( Linux ) and Launchy ( Windows ) as a launcher .
I also use Compiz ’s Place Windows plugin to put all my windows on their respective desktops .
I have most everything I need automatically started at boot time , so I just boot up , login , and go get coffee while my computer sets itself up :)
From the CFS petition page :
In the waning months of the Bush administration , the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) has joined the ranks of federal agencies rushing through new regulations that weaken protections for human health and the environment .
USDA has released a proposed rule that would significantly weaken oversight of all genetically engineered crops , and which continue to allow companies to grow food crops engineered to produce drugs and industrial chemicals .
The USDA began this process over four years ago by promising stricter oversight .
Unfortunately , improvements considered early on have been dismissed , and the proposed rule now has the same gaping holes as the policy it is replacing , and creates a few new ones , as well .
For instance :
* USDA has created a huge loophole allowing biotech companies to assess their own crops to determine whether USDA should regulate them .
And the criteria are open - ended , very subjective , and will certainly reduce USDA ’s oversight of GE crops .
* The proposed rules could also allow companies to grow untested GE crops with no oversight whatsoever : “ Over time , the range of GE organisms subject to oversight is expected to decrease … , ” a move which USDA itself admits will make contamination of conventional / organic crops with untested GE material more likely .
* To add insult to injury , USDA has proposed to write into law its “ Low Level Presence ” policy , which excuses it from taking any action to remove untested GE crops from conventional or organic food , feed and seed .
This contamination often occurs through cross-pollination or seed dispersal , and has cost farmers hundreds of millions of dollars in lost sales and lowered profits .
* USDA rejected options that would have banned outdoor cultivation of pharmaceutical - producing GE ( food ) crops , the only way to ensure that untested drugs do n’t end up in our food , despite strong support from citizens and the food industry .
* USDA has refused to propose any controls on pesticide - promoting GE crops , despite increasing pesticide use and an epidemic of resistant weeds that have been fostered by these crops .
* Finally , USDA snuck in a last - minute “ correction ” that bars state or local regulation of GE crops more protective than its own weak rule .
CFS strongly opposes such preemptive language that would bar local or state authorities from putting meaningful regulations or restrictions on GE crops in place that best suit their communities .
This last - minute change should be cause to extend the public comment period .
The USDA is treading dangerous new ground here .
The structure of the new proposal opens loopholes that can be exploited by biotech companies and expose consumers to more untested and unlabeled genetically engineered foods .
After denying requests for an extension to the short comment period given for the proposed rules , USDA ’s comment period closes on Monday .
Sign our petition to the USDA today and demand stronger — not weaker — regulations for genetically engineered crops !
Dubai to Create World 's First Refrigerated Beach
December 15th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
Most of the time here at Cleantechnica , we report on important technical advances and breakthroughs that help mankind to reduce its harmful impact on the environment .
Once in a while though , a tech story emerges that highlights how willfully unconcerned some people are with the green issues that worry the rest of us .
The latest news from Dubai falls squarely into the latter category .
It seems that planners in the Arab state have stumbled on the great idea of creating a fully refrigerated beach so that tourists do n’t burn their feet .
From late next year , guests at the exclusive Palazzo Versace hotel will enjoy private access to the beach , situated next to the main building .
The beach , to be created by British company Hyder Consulting , will feature a computer - controlled system of coolant - filled pipes under the sand that will help keep temperatures comfortable .
According to Soheil Abedian , president of the company that owns the Palazzo Versace , “ This is the kind of luxury top people want . ”
However , environmentalists have been quick to point out the shortcomings of the ludicrous scheme .
Commenting on the move , Rachel Noble of Tourism Concern said , “ Dubai is like a bubble world where the things that are worrying the rest of the world , like climate change , are simply ignored so people can continue destructive lifestyles . ”
The question is though , are the ‘ top people ’ that have flown half way around the globe to sip mojitos at the resort next year likely to care ?

The famous rocketship of Coney Island is looking for a new home as the long time amusement park Astroland will be forced to close down on January 31st .
As a fanboy this breaks my heart as the spacecraft captures the excitement held by America for the high frontier at the dawn of the space race in the early 60s .
To me this rocket belongs in the Smithsonian or the Seattle Science Fiction Museum , although I ’d love to see it stay here in old New York :
Astroland Rocket Ship Looking For New Home
“ The Coney Island History Project is looking for a new home for Astroland ’s famed Rocket Ship .
The group says a museum , park , or other public venue would be ideal , but they are open to other ideas .
The rocket debuted in 1962 as the first ride at Astroland .
The 26 - seat ride simulates the feeling of being in outer space .
The Rocket Ship has been sealed shut for 35 years and currently sits atop the boardwalk hamburger / hot dog stand .
Owners say they cannot find a way to store it .
Those who know of a good home for the rocket are asked to e-mail Lois Colin at lsastroland at aol dot com . ”
Here ’s a photo by David Shankbone of the soon to be marooned spacecraft :
UPDATED :
CLEVELAND -- R&B singer Sean Levert entered the Cuyahoga County Jail on March 24 clutching the prescribed medication he took regularly for anxiety .
Jail staff took the bottle of Xanax away from him and failed to give him a single pill during the six days he was there , investigators said .
Even when he began suffering horrifying delusions , he was n't given his medication and never saw a doctor .
Instead , on March 30 , jailers strapped Levert into a restraint chair , still fighting the monstrous visions in his head caused by withdrawal from the medication .
Minutes later , the 39 - year - old son of O'Jays star Eddie Levert stopped breathing .
His heart then stopped and doctors could n't save him .
Recently released Cuyahoga County investigators ' reports , interviews and the Cuyahoga County coroner 's report together reveal the details of Sean E. Levert Sr.'s final days in the overcrowded jail , run by the Cuyahoga County Sheriff 's Office .

Cuyahoga jail has new medical policy for inmate prescriptions
County approves $ 3.375 million payment to settle suit over Sean Levert 's death
Levert was sentenced March 24 to 22 months in prison for owing $ 90,988.96 to three children he fathered before marrying 13 years ago .
Deputies brought him from a Cuyahoga County courtroom to the jail in the same building .
During the booking process , Levert surrendered a bottle of Xanax that contained 37 pills .
He began taking the 2 - milligram pills three times a day in November 2007 .
The prescription for 90 pills was refilled on March 12 .
The first few days , Levert and another inmate shared a cell built for one person .
Levert was supposed to sleep on a mattress on the floor .
He could n't sleep that way , he said , so for three nights he tried to sleep sitting with his back against a wall , according to the reports .
Levert told his cellmate that he was supposed be taking medication , but it had been taken away from him .
At 8:30 a.m. March 27 , Levert told a corrections officer that he needed his medication .
The officer contacted a nurse who said Levert would have to " wait like everyone else " to see a doctor .
He was scheduled to be seen on April 8 .
( Ohio law gives jails up to two weeks to have new inmates medically evaluated . )
The jail 's manager of health care services , Christine Dubber , told investigators after the death that Levert 's Xanax was taken because anxiety was not considered an urgent problem , like psychosis , schizophrenia and suicidal thoughts .
The evening of March 29 , Levert told his cellmate he heard a woman screaming outside of the jail .
He said she was threatening to kill a corrections officer .
The cellmate told Levert he could n't hear a woman screaming .
About 3:30 a.m. March 30 , Levert told the cellmate he could hear his wife .
She was telling him that their son just fell into the pool .
Levert became fearful and pushed a call button to summon a corrections officer .
He told the officer that his wife said his son fell into the pool .
He wanted to know if his son was OK .
A short time later , a corrections officer and a nurse came to Levert 's cell .
He was crying .
They took him to a pod of cells reserved for inmates with mental health problems .
He was not given his medication .
At 7:45 p.m. March 30 , Levert told a sergeant that he had just seen a bad car crash .
The sergeant reported the " hallucinative and delusional behavior " to a nurse who took no action .
Levert was pacing in his cell , " acting bizarre " and yelling that his mother and his son were being killed .
Jail supervisor Michael McClelland was called to the cell .
He allowed Levert to call his mother , but she did n't answer the phone .
McClelland wrote in a report that a doctor would see Levert the next day .
At 10:46 p.m. , Levert began shouting and pounding on the cell floor " for no reason . "
McClelland was summoned again .
He said Levert sounded like " there were three pitbulls in the room and he was fighting them off . "
McClelland opened the cell door .
Levert " shot into my arms .
He did n't put up a fight , " McClelland said .
They both slid to the floor , where Levert was handcuffed .
At 10:52 p.m. , McClelland and other officers begin strapping Levert into a restraint chair " to prevent him from injuring himself . "
In a videotape of Levert being placed in the chair , he repeatedly shouts , " No , no , no " and strains against the straps , but he does n't fight the jailers .
His breathing is labored .
With his eyes squeezed shut , he wails , " No , no , no " for four minutes .
At 10:56 p.m. , he shouts , " She did it .
She did it .
She killed my mother .
Andy , your mother killed her .
She did it .
She did it .
She 's gonna pay .
You did it . "
He stops shouting at 10:57 p.m. , seemingly out of breath .
The video camera is turned off .
Nurse Jane Lawrence checked to make sure the restraint straps around Levert 's wrists , ankles and shoulders were n't too tight .
The nurse called the jail 's psychiatrist , described Levert 's condition and told the doctor that Levert had been taking Xanax .
She was told to give Levert an injection that contained three drugs , Benadryl , Ativan and Haldol , to calm him .
The nurse told McClelland she wanted to know more about Levert 's medical history before she gave him the shot .
She called Levert 's mother .
The reports show she and McClelland spoke to Levert 's mother for five to seven minutes .
McClelland assured Martha , " Your son is fine .
He 's not in any danger of hurting himself or anybody else .
Yes , we have him restrained right now because he lost his cool in that cell quite a bit .
He just went a little wild .
We can't allow him to hurt himself , but he 's safe right now and we 'll be watching him very closely tonight . "
McClelland hung up the phone and went to check on Levert , who he could hear was no longer shouting .
It was 11:17 p.m. when he found Levert in a " distressed state , " not breathing .
He called to the nurse and they put Levert on the floor to begin CPR .
Paramedics already entering the jail to treat a woman having difficulty breathing were instead sent to Levert .
His heart was beating erratically and stopped beating on the way to St. Vincent Charity Hospital .
He arrived at 11:42 p.m. Doctors tried for fifteen minutes to restart his heart .
They pronounced him dead at 11:57 p.m. March 30 .
Cuyahoga County Coroner Frank Miller ruled that Levert died of complications of sarcoidosis , high blood pressure , heart disease , diabetes and withdrawal from Xanax .
Miller said withdrawal from Xanax is severe and can cause biological symptoms as well as panic , anxiety , emotional instability and hallucinations .
In a taped interview , McClelland told investigators , " The guilt has just been overwhelming .
I want to tell [ Levert 's mother ] how sorry I am that that happened . "
McClelland said several corrections officers were shook up after " seeing someone about to expire in that room . "
The officer assigned to the psychiatric pod that night did n't report to work the next day .
The Cuyahoga County prosecutor 's office reviewed the case and found that no laws had been broken .
The Sheriff 's Office declined to comment because of pending litigation .
On June 3 , Levert 's wife , Angela Lowe of Streetsboro , filed a wrongful death suit in federal court against Cuyahoga County officials and corrections officers .
A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 12 .
UPDATE : Michael Baskin , the director of the Greater Cleveland chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness issued this statement .
" NAMI believes that individuals have a right to a medical evaluation , including a mental health assessment , prior to jailing .
This ensures continuous care and safety for the person being treated / incarcerated , and protection for corrections personnel as well as those they will share a cell with .
While incarcated , accurate diagnosis , treatment , including medication , and monitoring are essential .
We believe that the county needs to immediately invest in coordination of the criminal justice system , the medical community and the community mental health system and take action to ensure policies will prevent what happened at the jail .
Not only is the safety of the individual at risk , public safety is jeopardized when adequate procedures and funding do not allow for assessment , treatment and monitoring of those with severe and persistent mental illnesses . "

It was his tight , white jeans , snakeskin shoes and the fairy that Nima Daivari wore on a chain around his neck that prompted a stranger to call him a faggot and attack him .
And it was Daivari ’s boxing training that led him to pound back at his assailant , headlocking him until police arrived at the scene on the 16th Street Mall .
What happened next is tougher to explain .
A Denver cop not only refused to press charges , but he would n’t investigate the hate crime or even bother to take the attacker ’s name .
In the end , the bad guy slipped away , the officer was slapped on the wrist and now Daivari has lost his civil - rights case because the city says Daivari , as a gay man , has no constitutional right to require an arrest .
Something is wrong with this story .
“ So basically anyone can walk up , assault a gay man on a crowded street and Denver essentially ignores it .
That ’s messed up , and people there should know it , ” says Daivari , 26 , a recent law school graduate in New York City .
On St. Patrick ’s Day 2007 , he was on his first and only visit to Denver when he , his cousin and her boyfriend were walking home from dinner at a 16th Street eatery .
“ What may be the most embarrassing thing is that I have to admit to everyone that I actually ate at the Cheesecake Factory , ” Daivari quips .
Suddenly , a pedestrian passed by and yelled , “ Keep that faggot away from me . ”
“ Excuse me ? ” asked Daivari , who then was punched in the head by the assailant .
Daivari reacted with a few jabs of his own and held his attacker until police broke up the fight .
Officer Richard Boehnlein refused Daivari ’s repeated demands to press charges , telling him , “ No , go home . ”
Daivari ’s complaint resulted in a finding that the officer should have at least documented the case and probably arrested his attacker .
Boehnlein was reprimanded merely with “ a fine of one regular day off . ”
The city refused Daivari ’s settlement request that Boehnlein undergo sensitivity training .
Assistant City Attorney John Eckhardt touts
Denver ’s support for gay and lesbian rights , saying , “ The training the city provides its police officers is exemplary in these areas . ”
So exemplary , in fact , that Eckhardt asserted it was “ not evident ” to police “ that Mr. Daivari is a homosexual , ” even after he told them his story .
“ Come on , I look like a raging homo , ” Daivari says proudly .
“ Officers must use discretion in deciding when and where ( to take reports ) , ” Eckhardt argued in denying Daivari ’s claim that police inaction was a result of Daivari ’s “ outwardly homosexual appearance , his failure to conform to male gender stereotypes . ”
U.S. District Judge Zita Weinshienk dismissed the case Thursday , holding that no rights were violated .
Gay men are not a protected class under the Constitution .
Says Daivari ’s lawyer , Jessica West : “ The city of Denver essentially claimed that gays and lesbians in Denver live without any right to police protection .
I certainly hope that they are wrong . ”
So should we all .
Justice has failed Nima Daivari , who vows never to return to Denver .
“ I would much rather they arrested the guy who attacked me so there would be a mug shot out there of him with his face — - ed up by a homo , ” he says .
“ But the city deprived me that right and seems perfectly comfortable with its cops letting hate criminals beat people up and walk free . ”

Petra Is Back And Shows Us More Of Her Nice Round Pale Knockers ...
Study Them Bad Boys !!!
Gray Davis had just landed in Pennsylvania on a trip last June when he was struck by the differences between that state and the one whose voters drove him out of office early in his second term , blaming his leadership for state government failures that included deep debt and legislative paralysis .
Pennsylvania roads were clean .
The state ’s budget was balanced .
Lawmakers had socked enough away in a rainy - day fund to build what was then a decent surplus .
Government seemed to run effectively .
“ It ’s not like other people ca n’t do this , ” the former governor said recently .
But California government is arguably more dysfunctional now than it was when Davis , a Democrat , got the boot .
The budget deficit has grown so huge that a shutdown of government services looms .
Partisan gridlock grips the Legislature , and lawmakers bicker as the state plunges into crisis .

“ The recall absolutely has n’t helped at all , ” said Gary Jacobson , a professor of political science at UC San Diego .
The state ’s latest collision course with insolvency has renewed the question in the Capitol : Has California become ungovernable ?
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who ousted Davis with a campaign built on the premise that the state simply needed the right leader , said last week that there is only so much he can do to tame Sacramento .
“ Look , I ’m frustrated , ” the governor told reporters .
“ I ’m sitting here and we have a system where we rely on the 120 legislators to make those decisions .
I can not make them stay here .
I cannot lock them into the building .
I do n’t have those kinds of powers .
Believe me , I would do it otherwise . ”

The governor has no shortage of critics who say the fault lies with him .
If he were a more effective , engaged leader , they charge , the lawmakers would follow .
“ There ’s only 120 people in the state who do n’t care when Arnold Schwarzenegger calls them , and it ’s the members of the Legislature , ” said Democratic strategist Jason Kinney .
“ The fact that he has forfeited his relationship and influence over the Legislature has hurt him . ”
Others say this nation - state is so oversized , Balkanized and polarized that it is destined for dysfunction no matter who is in charge .
They cite its influx of immigrants , its constant tensions over water supply and its large , self - contained regions that bear little resemblance to one another .
It has even been suggested that the state should break into multiple , more manageable pieces .
More than two dozen attempts at that have been tried over the years , the latest by a Northern California lawmaker in the early 1990s .
More recently , a blog called Three Californias was created to advocate carving California out of the union and turning it into a new country with three states .

The state ’s Constitution also makes governing a challenge .
California is one of only three states that require two - thirds of the Legislature to agree on a budget .
A few lawmakers from the minority party can derail a spending plan -- and they do , sometimes to the point of preventing the government from paying its bills .
And California ’s heavy use of the initiative system , intended to let voters solve problems when lawmakers do n’t , has created conflicting mandates that experts say undermine rational policymaking .
Some of the political leaders who for years have been engaged in efforts -- largely unsuccessful -- to make state government run better fret that the current dysfunction creates a fertile environment for more shortsighted ballot measures .
“ If this continues , there is the danger that the public will again express itself through an initiative or some kind of constitutional convention or something that will become a vehicle for their anger with elected leaders , ” said Leon Panetta , a former California congressman and White House advisor who co-chairs California Forward , a bipartisan think tank focused on solving the state ’s problems .
“ God knows where that will take us .
The danger is it will lead to the wrong steps being taken . ”

Panetta said the political process has broken down .
“ For whatever reason , democracy is not working in Sacramento right now , ” he said .
“ I am convinced it can be fixed .
But people have to make sacrifices ” -- in politics and policy .
Davis concurred that , in theory , the state is governable .
But “ in reality , ” he said , “ it has n’t been governed properly for a long time . ”
In his view , the problem stems from extremist politics that began three decades ago with the anti-tax movement that led to Proposition 13 and has continued with gerrymandered legislative districts that make lawmakers accountable only to the party faithful who vote in primary elections .

Analysts say that if Schwarzenegger had the ability to make California more governable , it has declined substantially since the recall , when his immense popularity gave him political capital .
Now he is a lame duck with a financial crisis that he can no longer argue was inherited from another administration .
He has championed multiple efforts to reshape government .
But the public did not embrace his vision for how to do so .
Voters rejected most of his plans at the ballot box , and there was no uprising against lawmakers when they left his legislative proposals to grow moldy on the shelf .
Last month , voters did heed his call to change the way legislative districts are drawn by passing Proposition 11 .
The new rules governing that process take effect next year , and supporters of the measure , including Schwarzenegger , say it will ultimately lead to fewer ideologues in Sacramento .
The governor also managed to push through the Legislature some limited restraints on spending , including a requirement that the state put more money in a rainy - day fund when revenues are up .
Advertisement
But special legislative sessions that Schwarzenegger called on the state ’s fiscal crisis , water supply and healthcare all ended without resolution .
The latest special session on the budget is ongoing .
This year , the governor has threatened and cajoled the Legislature -- even gone to court -- over money management , but his strategies have been met with shrugs .
On Tuesday , as he handed out medals of valor to state employees he said were great examples of “ service and selflessness , ” the governor cracked : “ I wish that the legislators have just a little bit of that . ”
Former state Senate Leader Don Perata ( D - Oakland ) , who has on more than one occasion accused Schwarzenegger of lacking in that department , concedes that the governor may have a point .
He said the state ’s term limits law , which forced him from office last month , has created a group of lawmakers who are well - intentioned but lack the institutional knowledge to deal effectively with the state ’s outsized problems .
In recent months , he said , he witnessed lawmakers failing to recognize the severity of the crisis and unable to respond to it ; they lacked the grounding that comes with years of learning how to govern the state .

“ There is no center , ” Perata said .
“ I ’m not talking about political center .
There is no action center , or moral center , or anything else left in Sacramento . ”

Who could have predicted that the Federal Reserve would abuse its authority by giving away over $ 2 trillion in " emergency loans " and then refuse to disclose the recipients of those loans when faced with a FOIA request by Bloomberg ?
Bloomberg :
The Federal Reserve refused a request by Bloomberg News to disclose the recipients of more than $ 2 trillion of emergency loans from U.S. taxpayers and the assets the central bank is accepting as collateral .
Bloomberg filed suit Nov. 7 under the U.S. Freedom of Information
Act requesting details about the terms of 11 Fed lending programs , most created during the deepest financial crisis since the Great Depression .
The Fed responded Dec. 8 , saying it ’s allowed to withhold internal memos as well as information about trade secrets and commercial information .
The institution confirmed that a records search found 231 pages of documents pertaining to some of the requests .
“ If they told us what they held , we would know the potential losses that the government may take and that ’s what they do n’t want us to know , ” said Carlos Mendez , a senior managing director at New York - based ICP Capital LLC , which oversees $ 22 billion in assets .
Hmmm ...
I wonder why they would want to hide from the public who is getting all that money ?
It 's sometimes hard to wrap your head around that huge sum of money , but when all is said and done , that is our money .
We deserve to know who 's getting it .
Paul Schlesselman ( l ) and Daniel Cowart were arrested last week Two men , who officials describe as neo -Nazis , have appeared in a US court accused of plotting to kill Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
Paul Schlesselman and Daniel Cowart planned a murder spree targeting dozens of black people and culminating in Mr Obama 's murder , officials said .
Mr Obama said he was not worried by the news and it was " not who America is " .
He told reporters that " these kinds of hate groups " had been marginalised and were not part of America 's future .
Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) said the men , aged 18 and 20 , had made their first appearance before a court in Jackson , Tennessee , on Monday after being arrested last week in Crockett County in the same state .
An ATF official said agents had seized a rifle , a sawn - off shotgun and three pistols during the arrests .
They were charged with making threats against a presidential candidate , illegal possession of a sawed - off shotgun and conspiracy to rob a gun dealer .
Court documents showed that the plot did not appear to be very advanced or sophisticated .
The two men have not yet entered a plea but are due to appear in court again later this week .
' Amateurish '
The pair allegedly planned to rob a gun store and then carry out a killing spree at an unnamed predominantly African - American high school , the Associated Press quoted court records as saying .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Jim Cavanaugh , special agent in charge of the Nashville field office of the ATF , told AP that the two men had planned to shoot 88 black people and decapitate another 14 .
The numbers 88 and 14 are symbolic in the white supremacist community .
Mr Cavanaugh said the men had sought to go on a national killing spree , with Mr Obama as its final target .
" They said that would be their last , final act - that they would attempt to kill Senator Obama , " Mr Cavanaugh told AP .
" They did n't believe they would be able to do it , but that they would get killed trying . "
The court documents quoted the two men as saying that they would dress up in white tuxedos and top hats then drive their car as fast as possible toward Senator Obama , shooting at him from the windows .
The BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington says that although the plot seems to have been amateurish and the threat to Mr Obama himself not particularly credible , the US authorities clearly believe that the two had the means and the intent to carry out some kind of attack on black students .
Mr Obama , who if elected will become the first black US president , is leading Republican rival John McCain in opinion polls ahead of the 4 November election .

As the year winds down , financial analysts are predicting that Microsoft will pre-announce negative earnings for the first time since 2000 because of a flat PC market .
But all things considered , 2008 was a pretty good year for the software giant .
Windows is still used on 90 percent of computers and Internet Explorer on 70 percent .
Despite growing Web - based competition , Microsoft Office saw 20 percent growth in Q1 of fiscal 2009 and the company 's server and tools division grew by 23 percent in Q1 2009 .
On top of that , research from NPD Group this week shows that November retail sales for Macs fell 1 percent year over year while Windows PC sales grew 7 percent .
Under new cloud - minded chief software architect Ray Ozzie , Microsoft has been adapting to a changing Web 2.0 world .
Cloud computing operating system Windows Azure , Windows Live , Live Mesh and Office Web Apps are a few examples of Microsoft 's focused attempts to stay innovative .
But even though its finances are stable and its eyes are on the future , Microsoft executed poorly in some major areas in 2008 .
Here are three Microsoft stumbles from the past year that will put more pressure on the company to survive and thrive in 2009 .
Poor Marketing of Windows Vista
The real tragedy of Windows Vista , especially after service pack 1 , is that it 's not as bad as its reputation .
But Microsoft did not do enough in 2008 to let people know that .
It got caught in the crosshairs of bad Vista perceptions and unrelenting anti-Vista marketing from Apple .
But bad perceptions do n't appear out of nowhere .
Compatibility and performance issues plagued Vista from the start .
It was a vastly different OS from Windows XP and there were major changes to security features and the graphics system that created usability problems .
These changes may have been necessary , but adapting to them led to chaos .
The Seinfeld / Gates ads : A good idea gone wrong .
Michael Cherry , an analyst at Directions on Microsoft , says that Windows Vista is n't as bad as Microsoft has convinced us it is .
By remaining silent on Vista , he says , Microsoft did more harm than good .
" The biggest misstep was not using Vista SP1 [ released in February ] as an opportunity to show customers that Vista is a stable and reliable system , especially now that most device manufacturers have updated their drivers , " he says .
Cherry said Microsoft missed an opportunity to " illustrate why the security changes in Vista are so important , to promote security features like UAC and BitLocker , and to help people purchase machines that can best utilize Vista SP1 . "
Microsoft 's self - consciousness about Vista in 2008 was glaring , and it led to timid or non-existent marketing .
Letting the Apple Momentum Build
For most of 2008 , Apple relentlessly lampooned Microsoft in its ubiquitous " I'm a Mac , I 'm a PC " TV commercials .
The ads were often funny and effective in pointing out Vista 's flaws in ways that everyday people could understand .
America waited for a response from Microsoft & and waited & and waited & and waited .
Finally , towards the end of the summer we got & drum roll & a response .
Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Gates hanging out in a mall talking about shoes ?
Huh ?
Putting a beloved comedy legend in your ads is a great idea on paper , but it was as if the ad was completely improvised , and not in a good way .
Gates had a capable deadpan delivery and Seinfeld was being Seinfeld , but the ad was flat , and there was no mention of Microsoft or any of its products .
Viewers were confused .
The follow - up ad where Jerry and Bill move in with a family in the suburbs was longer and even more " out there . "
It worked as a quirky and amusing short film , but not a TV commercial and the campaign was cancelled .
Microsoft rebounded fairly quickly with the " I'm a PC / Life Without Walls " ads that included celebrities and everyday people from around the world talking about how they are proud PC users .
It was a much more effective ad about how PCs connect people and cultures .
But it may have been too little too late .
The ad , though earnest and inspirational , did not mention Vista .
Apple seized on this with a clever commercial about how Microsoft is pouring money into advertising rather than fixing Vista .
Again , Vista was Microsoft's Achilles ' Heel .
Roger Kay , president of consulting and research firm Endpoint Technologies , says Microsoft let Apple get the best of them in 2008 and should have played more aggressively in the marketing game .
" Letting the momentum from the Apple campaign gather for too long before intervening was a big mistake , " Kay says .
" Microsoft should have started punching back much earlier . "
Failed Bid for Yahoo
Microsoft 's efforts to buy all or some of Yahoo dominated the headlines for most of 2008 .
Ultimately , nothing concrete came out of it ( not yet at least ) , but there was no shortage of drama .
And the drama should continue into 2009 : the latest speculation is that Microsoft is lining up to buy Yahoo 's search business .
The saga began in February when the software giant offered $ 44.6 billion for Yahoo so Microsoft could beef up its struggling online search and advertising portfolio .
Criticism arose that Microsoft was not up to the task of integrating both the technology and the culture of Yahoo into the more corporate , proprietary world of Redmond .
And then a funny thing happened : Yahoo said no .
It rejected the 44.6 billion offer .
Most people were expecting Microsoft to either do a hostile takeover or purchase part of Yahoo .
But then another funny thing happened : Microsoft dropped the bid entirely and walked away .
It was around this time that the economy and Yahoo 's stock price went downhill .
A clumsy courtship where the two companies almost get together and then break it off continues to this day .
Recently , billionaire investor Carl Icahn invested his way onto Yahoo's board and pushed for a Microsoft deal .
Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang , who repeatedly resisted the Microsoft offer , was ousted in November .
Many thought Microsoft would strike again , but a day after Yang stepped down Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer declared : " We 've moved on . "
All this Microhoo noise just makes Microsoft look bad and unsure of itself , says Kay .
" I would put Yahoo at the top of my list of Microsoft missteps , " he says .
" It was just badly handled with time and money wasted , not to mention the bad publicity and the lost momentum . "
These days Microsoft seems intent on hiring every top executive away from Yahoo until there is no Yahoo .
The latest high - profile hire for Microsoft is former Yahoo search chief Qi Lu .
Ballmer says that Microsoft has no interest in buying all of Yahoo , but remains interested in discussing a deal for Yahoo 's search business .
If such a deal goes down in 2009 , it will have been one long , strange trip getting there .
2009 : A Pivotal Year
The coming year will be a busy and crucial one for Microsoft .
Windows and Internet Explorer still dominate their markets , but both took unprecedented market share hits in November .
The pressure is on Microsoft in 2009 to compete more effectively against Apple , Google and Mozilla with the expected releases of Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 8 .
The software giant needs to build anticipation for Windows 7 without allowing Vista to fade off into obscurity .
No easy task .
It must also chase Google in the cloud and speak up more about the timetable for that other massive money - maker Microsoft Office , both the Web - based and desktop versions .
As of now , not much is known about Office 14 or Office Live .
Microsoft needs to do all this and more in 2009 .
And some better TV commercials would n't hurt .
But please , let Seinfeld stick to stand - up comedy .
The radio market ’s vibrancy will be tested with today ’s kickoff of the auction for 50 stations owned by CBS .
First - rounds bids are due today , and industry watchers , not to mention CEO Les Moonves , are curious to find out how large the gap is between buyers ’ valuations and the seller ’s sense of worth .
“ We do n’t know what the marketplace is , ” Moonves admitted during a Goldman Sachs conference last week .
“ If we do n’t get the right pricing for it , we ’re not going to sell . ”
CBS , which is not using an investment bank to help with the auction and is instead handling it in - house , is trying to unload 50 stations in 12 markets , including Las Vegas , San Diego , Baltimore , Cleveland and others .
Among those to receive books and expected to bid are : Cumulus Media , Entercom Communications , Bonneville Broadcasting , Connoisseur Communications , and Tribune Co. , as well as former radio industry executive Bobby Lawrence and former CBS Radio CEO Joel Hollander .
Historically , radio stations have sold for a cash flow multiple of 12 times or more .
Given the difficult financing climate and deteriorating nature of the radio business , however , sources said it would be a victory if CBS can get a nine or 10 times cash flow multiple .
But these sources said they expect bids , at least in the first round , to come in between seven and eight times cash flow .
CBS ’ strategy in selling the stations is to slim down its radio unit to focus on the nation ’s Top 20 markets .
But there are some who think CBS would be better off jettisoning the entire radio division in one shot rather than selling some stations now and deciding what to do with the others later .
“ The radio business is a melting ice cube , ” said RBC Capital Markets ’ David Bank .
“ While the cash flow is valuable , CBS would be better off selling the [ whole ] asset today instead of waiting a couple of years and selling the rest for less . ”
Wikipedia states : " During the 1991 Gulf War , Emanuel [ then 32 years old ] was a civilian volunteer in Israel , rust - proofing brakes on an army base in northern Israel . "
Questions :
1 ) Is n't it difficult to perform a tactile function like " rust - proofing brakes " with a missing finger ?
2 ) Does n't it strike you as rather odd that someone as talented and ambitious as Rahm chose to assist his fellow Jews in such a mundane capacity ?
That 's on the one hand ( as it were ) ; on the other , we have this claim by one Sherman Skolnick ( 10/17/05 ) :
" [ Rahm Emanuel ] is Deputy Chief for North America of Israeli Intelligence , The Mossad , even while he is now a Congressman . "
No matter what you may think of Sherman Skolnick ( or Wikipedia , for that matter ) , perhaps Rahm as Mossad - man is more believable than Rahm as grease monkey .
Or perhaps the truth lies somewhere in the middle .
Now consider this bit from www .
theneweditor :
" Rep. Emanuel , who made almost $ 10 million in 2002 , accumulated the bulk of his net worth
between 1999 - 2002 after serving in the Clinton Administration , when , with no experience in the
field , he was hired as an investment banker at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein .
There is nothing
illegal in this , as many trade - off of previous government contacts and reap big rewards . "
Question : Was that $ 10 million " compensation " due to his " previous government contacts , " or was it a down payment for future services to be rendered ?
Or perhaps that answer also lies somewhere in the middle .
The only reason I ask these questions is , not enough others are - especially those with stars in their eyes thinking Rahm and Company will lead the Democrats to the Promised Land in 2008 .
I invite you ( the loyal partisans of Daily Kos ) to take a much harder look at the types of men who are generating " Big Ideas for America " on your behalf .
Rahm Emanuel has quite a gift for attracting money his way - from raising record amounts to re-elect Dirt Bag Daley as Duh Mare of the City of Chicago , to wowing Clinton with his Midas touch , to finding just the right job at the right time to ( well ) become a Midas himself .
Yet he says in his book , " Washington has forgotten that we 're a nation of barn raisers , not fund - raisers , and of shared sacrifice , not special privilege . "
[ Excuse me ? ]
That being said , apparently legions of ever - hopeful Democrats ( many of them self - avowed progressives ) have no qualms about falling over each other to beat a path to Rahm 's door .
Yet some of you can't resist beating me up as a potential spoiler in the 2008 presidential campaign .
You might not want to vote for me , you might believe in the two - party monopoly system , you might believe it's the Democrats turn [ to gangbang us ] .
Be that as it may .
However , I hope you start asking more of your leaders .
It 's one thing to be attracted to aggressive " winner " types ; everybody luvs `em .
It 's quite another to deepen your level of expectation past the layers of charisma .
I 'd like to see the Democratic National Convention in 2008 crowded with presidential hopefuls making speeches while the " peanut gallery " loudly chants : " Contract ! Contract ! Contract ! "
[ As in , " Put at least some of your campaign promises in the form of a written contract , and in that way become the Best Party Available . " ]
As for Rahm 's and Bruce 's book , it 's a featherweight .
Worse than that , I view it as Rahm 's way of giving the naïve among us " the middle finger . "
Read it anyway , since these are your leaders talking .
But also read " American Theocracy , " by Kevin Phillips and " The European Dream " by Jeremy Rifkin for not only better writing but also better thinking .
Then come up with your own proposals for changing American politics .
And insist that you be heard .

With most of the remaining ballots counted in Alaska , Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich appears to have unseated long - time Senator Ted Stevens , widening the Democrat ’s lead to 3,724 votes .
The new count pretty much closes the door on Mr. Stevens ’ hopes of re-election .
According to the latest official count by the Alaska Division of Elections , Mr. Begich has 150,728 and Mr. Stevens trails with 147,004 .
Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York and chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , declared victory on Tuesday night :
“ Mark Begich will be an outstanding senator for Alaska and the country , ” Mr. Schumer said in a statement .
“ And with seven seats and counting now added to the Democratic ranks in the Senate , we have an even stronger majority that will bring real change to America . ”
The Democrats ’ apparent win in Alaska — though there are still some ballots to be counted — moved them closer to achieving a near 60 - vote filibuster - proof count that would enable the majority to avoid the gridlock that has blocked the movement of legislation over the last few years .
Two other critical Senate seats , in Minnesota and in Georgia , remain in contention .
Minnesota ’s bitterly contested race , between incumbent Norman Coleman , a Republican , and Al Franken , the Democrat , is headed for a recount .
Georgia ’s surprisingly tight contest between Republican incumbent Saxby Chambliss and Democrat Jim Martin , is bound for a runoff on Dec. 2 , and has attracted headliners like G.O.P. presidential nominee John McCain and appearing tomorrow , former President Bill Clinton .
Mark Begich ’s lead over Senator Stevens more than doubled on Tuesday , according to the latest tally of the vote in Alaska .
Mr. Begich , the Democratic mayor of Anchorage , has pulled ahead of Mr. Stevens , the Republican incumbent , by 2,374 votes .
Mr. Begich has 146,286 votes and Mr. Stevens , 143,912 .
But elections officials caution that there are still 7,700 additional absentee ballots to be counted today , so the numbers could change in a few hours .
Though elections officials in Alaska may be counting additional ballots for a few more days , the updated vote tally at the end of the day on Tuesday could move the contested race between Senator Ted Stevens and Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich closer to conclusion .
The Division of Elections plans to count 24,000 absentee and questioned ballots from Anchorage , the Kenai Peninsula , and other areas of southern Alaska today , and Wednesday is the deadline for overseas ballots to arrive .
Gail Fenumiai , the Alaska elections chief , said that her office planned to release an updated unofficial count by the end of the day on Tuesday , but cautioned that more ballots will be counted on Nov. 25 .
The lead that Senator Stevens , the Republican , enjoyed over his Democratic challenger , Mr. Begich , after Election Day crumbled last week when the first batch of absentee ballots were counted .
As of Friday Mr. Begich had 138,959 votes compared to 137,937 for Mr. Stevens — a difference of 1,022 votes .
The Achorage Daily News provides a district - by - district breakdown of the Senate vote .
But Mr. Stevens , who was convicted just over a week before the election on seven felony counts , could face another hurdle if he is re-elected .
Many of his Senate colleagues – both Democrat and Republican – are pressing for his expulsion from Congress .
However , it appears that the Alaska senator was spared a potentially critical vote by the Senate Republican Conference to expel him , at least for now .
Senator Jim DeMint , Republican of South Carolina , had intended to ask members of the conference to vote on such a resolution on Tuesday , released a statement today backing down .
“ After talking with many of my colleagues , it ’s clear there are sufficient votes to pass the resolution regarding Senator Stevens , ” Mr. DeMint said in the statement .
“ The question now is timing .
Some who support the resolution believe we should address this after the results of his election are confirmed in Alaska .
For this reason , I will ask the conference to postpone the vote on Senator Stevens until Thursday . ”
Though the race could be all but decided by Tuesday night , Ms. Fenumiai said that elections officials will count several classes of additional ballots on Nov. 25 , including those from overseas .
Could they tip the results of the Senate contest ?
It depends on how many there are — the state elections office plans to provide an estimate on Thursday — as well as where things stand at the end of today .
Stay tuned .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
Let 's start with some uncomfortable truths .
We would n't be publishing an article about the under - the - radar guy who 's most likely to succeed Steve Jobs as chief executive of Apple if Jobs himself had n't shown up at a company event in San Francisco in June looking frightfully skinny and pale .
Jobs , after all , is a pancreatic - cancer survivor , having beaten a treatable form of the disease in 2004 .
Since that appearance last summer , Apple 's excitable investor base and blogosphere have spun full tilt wondering about their hero's health , a topic that - other than the pithy retort here and the acerbic talk - to - the - hand comment there - Apple 's CEO has declined to address .
Then there 's the widespread opinion inside and out of Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) that the Magician of 1 Infinite Loop simply can't be replaced .
There is only one Steve Jobs , one table - pounding visionary who can refashion whole industries with a wave of his hand .
The mere hint of a Jobs health scare knocks billions of dollars off Apple 's market value .
( Temporary hit from a false web post in early October about a Jobs heart attack : $ 10 billion . )
The most influential promoter of Steve Jobs ' indispensability , of course , is Steve Jobs .
But another person who is very much with that program is the one executive who has actually filled in for Jobs as CEO .
That would be Tim Cook , Apple 's chief operating officer and its interim chief executive for two months in 2004 , when Jobs was recovering from cancer surgery .
" Come on , replace Steve ?
No .
He 's irreplaceable , " Cook said recently , according to a person who knows him well .
" That 's something people have to get over .
I see Steve there with gray hair in his 70s , long after I 'm retired . "
Cook may be right ; we simply do n't know the status of Jobs ' health .
Yet succession plans at giant corporations typically are n't built on hope .
Apple 's plan to replace the 53 - year - old CEO is known for sure only to Jobs and the company 's seven other board members .
Though he is highly regarded as a business - operations maestro , few people outside of Apple have any sense of whether Cook ( who , for the record , turns 48 in November and is a fitness nut ) would be a good chief executive , much less a suitable replacement for Steve Jobs .
Even careful Apple watchers do n't quite know what to think .
" By default Tim Cook would be the logical guy , " says Toni Sacconaghi , an influential Apple analyst at brokerage firm Sanford C. Bernstein .
" Yet that has n't been spelled out .
And the stakes are just higher at Apple , because Steve is larger than life , and Tim is n't a known quantity . "
So the " logical " heir to the throne of one of the coolest - never mind most successful - companies on the planet right now is a blank slate .
That is reason enough to find out who the man is .
In interviews with two dozen people who have dealt directly with Cook , a picture emerges that is reassuring if unanticipated .
It turns out that although Cook and Jobs are in many ways opposites , the No. 2 exec is equally obsessive and exacting about his work .
An intensely private Alabaman and Auburn University engineering grad ( class of 1982 ) , Cook is also a workaholic whose only interests outside of Apple appear to be cycling , the outdoors , and Auburn football .
( Talk about tough years : Apple 's stock is down 50 % year to date ; the Tigers , nationally ranked early in the season , were 4 - 5 at presstime . )
What 's more , there 's every reason to believe that Apple would at least be stable for some years to come if Cook were to find himself at the helm .
The reason :
He 's essentially been running much of the company for years .
Demanding and even - keeled
Tim cook arrived at Apple in 1998 from Compaq Computer .
He was a 16 - year computer - industry veteran - he 'd worked for IBM ( IBM , Fortune 500 ) for 12 of those years - with a mandate to clean up the atrocious state of Apple 's manufacturing , distribution , and supply apparatus .
One day back then , he convened a meeting with his team , and the discussion turned to a particular problem in Asia .
" This is really bad , " Cook told the group .
" Someone should be in China driving this . "
Thirty minutes into that meeting Cook looked at Sabih Khan , a key operations executive , and abruptly asked , without a trace of emotion , " Why are you still here ? "
Khan , who remains one of Cook 's top lieutenants to this day , immediately stood up , drove to San Francisco International Airport , and , without a change of clothes , booked a flight to China with no return date , according to people familiar with the episode .
The story is vintage Cook : demanding and unemotional .
Almost from the time he showed up at Apple , Cook knew he had to pull the company out of manufacturing .
He closed factories and warehouses around the world and instead established relationships with contract manufacturers .
As a result , Apple 's inventory , measured by the amount of time it sat on the company 's balance sheet , quickly fell from months to days .
Inventory , Cook has said , is " fundamentally evil , " and he has been known to observe that it declines in value by 1 % to 2 % a week in normal times , faster in tough times like the present .
" You kind of want to manage it like you 're in the dairy business , " he has said .
" If it gets past its freshness date , you have a problem . "
This logistical discipline has given Apple inventory management comparable with Dell's , then as now the gold standard for computer - manufacturing efficiency .
We know what you 're thinking :
Why dwell on the backroom aspects of such a sexy company ?
Because that seemingly dull stuff is as important to Apple 's success as the gorgeous designs and ultracool marketing .
Forecasting demand , for example , and executing against that forecast , are critical in the computer industry , especially when new products quickly cannibalize the old .
Consider what befell Palm ( PALM ) in 2001 .
The company torpedoed an entire quarter 's performance by announcing a new version of its mainstay PDA - which helped dry up sales of the old version - and then failing to deliver the new product when the company said it would .
Those kinds of flubs just do n't happen at Apple , which routinely pulls off the miraculous : unveiling revolutionary products that have been kept completely secret until they magically appear in stores all over the world .
The iPhone , the iPod , any number of iMacs and MacBooks - the consistently seamless orchestration of Apple 's product introductions and delivery is nothing short of remarkable .
A classic example :
In 2006 Apple transitioned its entire computer line to running on processors made by Intel ( INTC , Fortune 500 ) .
For lots of technical reasons we wo n't go into here , doing that was not easy .
But Cook 's team somehow made sure there was nary a blip in sales .
Think of Cook 's contribution like this .
There are two basic ways to get great profit margins : Charge high prices or reduce costs .
Apple does both .
The marketing and design drive consumers wild with desire and make them willing to pay a premium ; Cook 's operational savvy keeps costs under control .
Thus Apple is a cash - generating machine .
Cook has called the company a place that is " entrepreneurial in its nature but with the mother of all balance sheets . "
At last count that meant $ 24.5 billion in cash and no debt .
2008 The Vet Who Did Not Vet

The computer system is not trusted by staff , say MPs A " stupendously incompetent " government efficiency drive designed to save £ 57 m will end up costing £ 81 m , MPs say .
The Department for Transport scheme aimed to cut administration expenses by basing payroll , finance and personnel services all on one site in Swansea .
But the Commons public accounts committee said the project had been rushed through , was not yet fully introduced and was set to make losses .
The new computer system had even issued messages in German , the MPs added .
But the DfT said the scheme was now beginning to bring " real progress " .
' Overly optimistic '
The DfT had attempted to bring in " shared services " project - part of a wider £ 1.4bn
Whitehall savings plan - in a year , the committee said .
The MPs criticised the department for setting itself a deadline of April this year for getting all its agencies involved , calling this " overly optimistic " .
The department knew that it was pushing things with such a tight timetable but , without robust challenge to such a risky strategy , ploughed on confidently
Edward Leigh , Commons Public Accounts Committee chairman
Staff had " little confidence " in the new computer system , which " in some cases " was worse than the old one .
Committee chairman Edward Leigh , Tory MP for Gainsborough , said it was one of the worst cases of " project management " he had seen .
" The department knew that it was pushing things with such a tight timetable but , without robust challenge to such a risky strategy , ploughed on confidently , " he added .
" The result was lamentable .
The underlying computer system was inadequately procured and tested , resulting in an unstable set - up when it was switched on , " he added .
Eight months after the departments own deadline had passed , only two of its seven agencies were using the new system , Mr Leigh said .
' No dismissals '
In its report , the committee said : " Despite the extent of mismanagement in this case , no individuals have been dismissed or properly held to account . "
Mr Leigh called on the department to deliver a functioning , trustworthy and beneficial system .
The shared services centre in Swansea was originally forecast to cost £ 55 m and lead to £ 112 m of savings - a benefit of £ 57 m .
But the department now estimates the programme will cost £ 121 m and save £ 40 m , meaning taxpayers will have to make up the £ 81 m difference .
We continue to develop shared services and believe that the new way of working will result in significant improvements .
Department for Transport A DfT spokesman said there had been " consequences " for some staff of the staff involved in setting up the scheme .
He added : " As with any large scale and long term project , there have been aspects of shared services that have taken longer to implement than others .
" However , the system is now starting to deliver real change within the department with smoother and more streamlined processes .
" We continue to develop shared services and believe that the new way of working will result in significant improvements .
" We welcome this report and will be responding to its recommendations in due course , with an update on our progress . "
Shadow transport secretary Theresa Villiers said : " It is scandalous that at a time when Labour mismanagement has put our public finances in such a disastrous mess that Geoff Hoon 's officials are pouring taxpayers ' money down the drain .
" Hard working taxpayers will be incensed that a project that was supposed to save money will actually cost them £ 81 million - money that would have been far better spent on much needed transport improvements that Labour have promised so many times and failed to deliver . "
Liberal Democrat transport spokesman Norman Baker said : " Here 's yet another Government Holy Grail which has so far failed to bring any benefit .
" It is astonishing that the department failed to meet any of its targets and completely unacceptable that no one has been held to account for this mess . "

This article from the Times Online makes abundantly clear that UK banks do not plan to pass on any future base rate cuts by the Bank of England to customers .
However it does not do a very good job of explaining why the bankers think they will not be sufficiently profitable if they add the same margin they get now to an even lower policy rate .
We have seen a similar problem here , but the reasons are pretty clear .
Spreads on mortgage products have risen even as Treasuries have fallen , leading to only a modest improvement in borrowing rates .
The reason here is that the volatility of interest rates has risen considerably , and that makes the consumer ’s mortgage prepayment option more valuable , which increases the required spread .
From the Times Online :
High Street banks have told Alistair Darling they will not pass on any further interest rate cuts to consumers and businesses .
The banks have warned the chancellor they are “ not charities ” .
They said they could not afford further to reduce mortgage payments and interest rates to businesses if , as expected , the Bank of England continued to cut rates as the economy fell deeper into recession .
Yves here .
One could contest the banks ’ view .
They enjoy a unique role , protected by special licensing requirements , of taking customers ’ deposits .
And as we have seen , at least for large players , large banks are not permitted to fail .
Losses are socialized .
Darling may lack the authority , but he could counter by threatening to pull the banking charter of the non-compliant and tell them to make a go of functioning in those businesses that did not benefit from the state restricting entry .
I am not familiar with the rules here , but a long time ago , I looked into what the consequences for a foreign bank operating in the US of giving up its US banking license .
It would have had a big impact , meaning very significant revenue losses , mainly because they would have lost access to certain clearing and transfer services ( in those days , Fedwire and Swift ) which were very important to their home market clients .
The impact would be far more significant for a native country player .

REXBURG , Idaho , Nov. 19 ( UPI ) --
The mayor of an Idaho town where children on a school bus chanted " assassinate Obama " says he's " extremely sorry " for the incident .
In a letter published Wednesday in the Idaho Statesman newspaper in Boise , Rexburg , Idaho , Mayor Shawn Larsen said the national publicity generated by the story resulted in " numerous e-mails from individuals around the country associating our community with hate and intolerance .

" I am extremely sorry that this incident occurred , and I do not believe that it reflects the values which make our community a great place to live and raise a family . "
Larsen admitted Rexburg and the surrounding areas of eastern Idaho have a reputation as being one of the United States ' most politically conservative areas .
" This reputation and the conservative nature of our community should in no unequivocal terms be an excuse for hate and vile comments , " Larsen wrote .
" Parents must realize that things said in anger or even in jest can have lasting repercussions not only damaging young hearts and minds , but a city 's reputation . "
Today it was confirmed that Caylee Anthony 's body has been found .
I wanted to post a tribute to her .
I have followed this case from the beginning and I am heartbroken .
She was a beautiful girl , and now she 's a beautiful angel .

Things I Have to Say : Ann Coulter ’s Jaw
By now you may have heard that Ann Coulter ’s jaw was broken ( reportedly in a fall ) , and as a result the commentator ’s jaw has been temporarily wired shut .
Yes , Coulter is loud and abrasive and opinionated , and I tend to disagree with her on just about everything that comes out of her mouth .
Yes , it may be the only circumstance under which she does n’t have * something * vile to say .
But , those of you who have said you ’re thankful for her broken jaw and resultant wiring , those of you who have headlined your posts “ There is a God ! ” …
No , just no , I can not go there with you .
Especially those who rejoiced in the news before the cause of the break was reported , when it just as easily could have resulted from an act of violence .
No .
I am not going to join you in relishing , in laughing at , someone else ’s pain .
Even in disagreement with a person ’s general worldview and commentary , I like to think that being giddy and amused that someone was hurt is not somewhere we ’re willing to go .
In the words of Rachel Maddow , somebody may need to “ talk me down , ” because right now I ’m not sure that the line between these reactions I ’m seeing and “ ha ha , bitch deserved it ” or “ she was asking for it ” is a very stark one .
Why this post ?
This post that seemingly is not women ’s health - focused ?
Because I think it ’s important to say , “ No , it ’s not appropriate to be happy that a woman was hurt and as a result will be silenced . ”
Even if the hurt was accidental , even if the silence is temporary .
Even if she were a man , even if we find her words objectionable .
Even if the whole thing smacks of delicious irony in your mind .
No , it ’s not appropriate to be happy that a woman was hurt and as a result will be silenced .
Dennis Quaid Reaches Twin Overdose Settlement with Cedars - Sinai
and his wife Kimberly have reached an agreement with Cedars - Sinai Medical Center and will be paid $ 750,000 as compensation for the accidental overdose of their twin babies one year ago , pending approval of a Los Angeles judge .
Thomas Boone and Zoe Grace , born in November 2007 , were each given massive doses of the blood thinner Heparin , at 1,000 times the common dose for infants .
The babies spent five days in intensive care fighting for their lives .
They have reportedly suffered no lasting side effects and are healthy thirteen - month - old toddlers .
Cedar - Sinai was fined $ 25,000 by the California Department of Public Health after an investigation into the incident .
Court papers filed Monday with L.A. Superior Court said , " The settlement is the result of extensive negotiation between the parties and their respective legal representatives , and is intended to avoid the time , expense and uncertainty of litigation . "
The Quaid 's have also filed a lawsuit again Heparin manufacturer Baxter Healthcare Corporation over negligence in packaging adult and pediatric dosages in similar vials .
This is believed to be how the mix - up occurred .

In “ The Black Swan , ” Taleb wrote , “ The government - sponsored institution Fannie Mae , when I look at its risks , seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite , vulnerable to the slightest hiccup . ”
Globalization , he noted , “ creates interlocking fragility . ”
He warned that while the growth of giant banks gives the appearance of stability , in reality , it raises the risk of a systemic collapse  “ when one fails , they all fail . ”
Taleb believes that our brains evolved to suit a world much simpler than the one we now face .
His writing is idiosyncratic , but he does touch on many of the perceptual biases that distort our thinking : our tendency to see data that confirm our prejudices more vividly than data that contradict them ; our tendency to overvalue recent events when anticipating future possibilities ; our tendency to spin concurring facts into a single causal narrative ; our tendency to applaud our own supposed skill in circumstances when we ’ve actually benefited from dumb luck .
And looking at the financial crisis , it is easy to see dozens of errors of perception .
Traders misperceived the possibility of rare events .
They got caught in social contagions and reinforced each other ’s risk assessments .
They failed to perceive how tightly linked global networks can transform small events into big disasters .
Taleb is characteristically vituperative about the quantitative risk models , which try to model something that defies modelization .
He subscribes to what he calls the tragic vision of humankind , which “ believes in the existence of inherent limitations and flaws in the way we think and act and requires an acknowledgement of this fact as a basis for any individual and collective action . ”
If recent events do n’t underline this worldview , nothing will .
If you start thinking about our faulty perceptions , the first thing you realize is that markets are not perfectly efficient , people are not always good guardians of their own self - interest and there might be limited circumstances when government could usefully slant the decision - making architecture ( see “ Nudge ” by Thaler and Cass Sunstein for proposals ) .
But the second thing you realize is that government officials are probably going to be even worse perceivers of reality than private business types .
Their information feedback mechanism is more limited , and , being deeply politicized , they ’re even more likely to filter inconvenient facts .
This meltdown is not just a financial event , but also a cultural one .
It ’s a big , whopping reminder that the human mind is continually trying to perceive things that are n’t true , and not perceiving them takes enormous effort .
An estimated $ 2 million worth of jewelry and other belongings was stolen from the home of Paris Hilton , according to the Los Angeles Police Department .
The incident occurred at 5 a.m. at Hilton 's Hollywood Hills home on Clarendon Street .
The burglar , or burglars , got into the house through an unlocked door , according to LAPD sources , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing .
According to detectives , a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt and gloves ransacked Hilton 's bedroom , took unknown property and fled , said Officer April Harding .
LAPD sources said they do not believe at this time that the incident is connected to infamous burglaries that have beset the Westside and Hollywood Hills and cost many celebrities hundreds of thousands of dollars in jewelry and other valuables .

“ There was no immediate comment on the Israeli air strikes on Gaza from Obama , who is vacationing with his family in Hawaii , or his staff . ”
This is how our incoming President has reacted to the worst attack on the Palestinian people in 20 years – by not reacting at all .
The Bush White House , of course , has responded as we all know they would : Israel - has - the - right - to - defend itself , let the killing begin , etc. , ad nauseum .
And do n’t expect much better from the Obama camp .
Remember how he scolded the UN for daring to even discuss the Gaza situation ? :
“ We have to understand why Israel is forced to do this …
Israel has the right to respond while seeking to minimize any impact on civilians .
The Security Council should clearly and unequivocally condemn the rocket attacks …
If it can not bring itself to make these common sense points , I urge you to ensure that it does not speak at all . ”
With his silence – or , at least , his very delayed reaction – it seems clear that Obama is taking his own advice .
Even as Israel takes the possibility of a new page in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict off the agenda , and sabotages all his brave talk about a renewed US diplomatic effort , the great “ liberal ” hope is apparently tongue - tied .
And when he finally speaks , “ progressives ” should prepare for the worst : after all , this is someone who endorsed the Israeli re-invasion of Lebanon .
The Israeli-Palestinian “ peace process ” ?
The Israelis , for their part , are having none of it – and neither is our future President .

Scientists say it may be possible to make a pill to wipe painful memories Scientists in the US say they have developed the ability to selectively wipe out uncomfortable memories .
In experiments with mice , researchers from the Medical College of Georgia were able to eliminate memories without any damage to the rodents ' brains .
They suggested that the technique which works on a particular protein in the brain could , one day , be used to help humans overcome traumatic events .
However , the chief scientist said this was " years or even decades away " .
Memories , even painful ones , are an important part of the learning process but for some people recalling traumatic events can be extremely damaging to their lives .
Scientists at the Medical College of Georgia say they have found a molecular mechanism that can rapidly remove specific memories .
Traumatic memories Working with mice , the researchers found that a particular protein has a crucial role in the formation of memories .
Making the mice over - produce this protein while recalling a specific and painful event caused the memory to be completely eliminated .
The scientists say that in the long - term it should be possible to develop a pill that wipes out traumatic and fearful memories in humans .
Dr Joe Tsien , of the Brain and Behaviour Discovery Institute in Georgia said : " First of all I should emphasise the methodology is not applicable to the human clinical situation yet .
" However , it does suggest molecular paradigms which we can explore to perhaps achieve the same kind of effects in humans - but those are probably years or decades away . "
Dr Tsien said the technique might one day be applied to war veterans who " often suffer from reoccurring traumatic memory replays after returning home " .

March of the dustbin Stasi : Half of councils use anti-terror laws to watch people putting rubbish out on the wrong day
More than half of town halls admit using anti-terror laws to spy on families suspected of putting their rubbish out on the wrong day .
Their tactics include putting secret cameras in tin cans , on lamp posts and even in the homes of ' friendly ' residents .
The local authorities admitted that one of their main aims was to catch householders who put their bins out early .
Many councils have been spying on residents and fining them if they put rubbish out on the wrong day
The shocking way in which the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act - an anti-terror law - is being used was revealed through freedom of information requests made by the Daily Mail .
MPs and civil liberties groups last night accused councils of using the draconian powers for trivial reasons .
Shami Chakrabarti of Liberty said : ' Snooping appears to have become the favourite pastime in town halls up and down the land .
' Common sense has gone out of the window and instead of putting out more bins , councils spy on householders as if they were terrorists . '
Tory communities spokesman Eric Pickles said : ' Under Labour , the rights and liberties of law - abiding citizens are being eroded through plans for ID cards , sinister microchip spies in bins and abuse of anti-terror laws by councils .
' Taxpayers ' money is being wasted on bankrolling an army of municipal bureaucrats who have watched too many episodes of Spooks . '
The Mail requested information from all of the 474 councils in England .
Of the 151 which replied , some 77 - more than half - said they had used the legislation in the last three years for suspected ' domestic waste , littering or fly - tipping offences ' .
Although it is ostensibly an anti-terror law , the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 , or RIPA , is worded so loosely that it can be used to justify surveillance operations for a variety of reasons .
These include spying to ' protect public health ' or the ' economic well - being of the UK ' .
This means that councils can use the powers granted by the Act to monitor families ' treatment of household waste .
In Lincolnshire , West Lindsey District Council uses the new powers to place motion - activated cameras on lamp posts to catch homeowners putting their bins out at the wrong time .
One officer told an undercover reporter : ' In some areas , particularly where there is terraced housing , we have a problem with people putting their black rubbish bags out three or four days early .
' When they have been left in alleyways or at the rear of terraced properties , it is difficult to identify exactly who has placed them there .
' The cameras are hidden in tin cans or put on lamp posts and allow us to monitor who is coming out of which property and leaving their rubbish .
Sometimes we are able to put these cameras inside peoples ' homes that overlook the alleyways .
Shami Chakrabarti : ' Snooping appears to have become the favourite pastime in town halls up and down the land '
' These are usually residents who have complained to us about rubbish being dumped outside their house on the wrong day . '
The council said it had been able to hand out ' several ' fixed penalty notices on the basis of the evidence it had obtained .
Officers at Southwark District Council also admitted that they had mounted cameras on lamp posts to spy on residents suspected of leaving rubbish out at the wrong time .
The revelations have raised fresh concerns about the Home Office 's plans to create a ' Big Brother ' database of every citizen 's e-mail and internet records .
Ministers say that councils will not have access to the information .
But critics point out that RIPA , which was passed as anti-terror legislation , is now being routinely used by town halls - and the same could happen with the database .
Phil Booth , of the NO2ID campaign , said that public bodies were ' assembling the tools of a totalitarian state ' .
He added : ' We are no longer living in what most would recognise as a free society .
This is not justifiable or proportionate .'
Mark Wallace , of the TaxPayers '
Alliance , said : ' It is crazy that so many councils are using anti-terror legislation to spy on their residents .
It must cost a huge amount for all these concealed cameras , just to give a few people relatively low - level fines . '
Other local authorities which gave details of how they used RIPA included Lewes District Council in East Sussex .
It admitted that the Act was used to gain evidence on residents who persistently left rubbish out at the wrong time .
South Bedfordshire council also admitted going through phone bills inside rubbish bags to identify who had left them outside .
Officers also electronically tagged certain types of rubbish to find out if they had been dumped illegally .
Wycombe District council in Buckinghamshire put an electronic tag on rubbish left outside a shop to see if it was taken .
A spokesman for the Local Government Association , which represents councils , said : ' The LGA has written to councils to say that surveillance should not be undertaken unless it is absolutely necessary and proportionate to the crime that 's being investigated .
' Councils have a duty to protect their residents and are tuned in to the worries people might have about surveillance .
' These powers are essential in making sure that benefits cheats , fly - tippers , rogue traders and other serious criminals are caught and brought to justice . '

VERY GRUESOME
[ digg- reddit-me ] This blog has a new favorite newspaper – the alternative weekly Boston Phoenix which I actually used to read while I went to college in Massachusetts .
Adam Reilly , media critic for the paper , recently fashioned an argument against the Fairness Doctrine – including the specter of it being used against Net Neutrality :
Regarding Net Neutrality , McDowell asked , “ Will Web sites — will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their Web site to opposing views , rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that ? ”
This is a stupid question .
The Fairness Doctrine involved government mandating , in certain cases , that specific content be added to a particular media entity .
In contrast , Net Neutrality does n’t involve intrusion into content ; it only dictates absolute freedom of ( virtual ) movement .
It ’s the opposite of what McDowell seems to think .
But as Joe Campbell , author of the blog 2 parse.com , recently noted in a post linking Thierer ’s paper and McDowell ’s remarks , this is about tactics , not logic .
If conservative Net Neutrality supporters come to see it as the Fairness Doctrine 2.0 — something that ’s more easily done if the Fairness Doctrine is already on everyone ’s brain , as it is today — they might rethink their support .
Given Democratic gains in Congress and Obama ’s support for Net Neutrality , Campbell argues , “ This is the big corporations ’ only chance to squash Net Neutrality . ”
Now that ’s a scary prospect .
The Web is the future of news media .
( It ’s also a battleground where , at the moment , Democrats are totally dominating Republicans . )
Bringing back the Fairness Doctrine is a dubious proposition , period .
But if doing so could jeopardize the success of Net Neutrality , it ’s downright reckless .

Girl calls police about mom's drug use
WAUKESHA , Nov 19 , 2008 ( Milwaukee Journal Sentinel - McClatchy - Tribune Information Services via COMTEX ) --
A 14 - year - old girl , tired of her mother 's almost daily use of marijuana in front of her and her siblings , called police with the help of a neighbor to report the illegal activity , according to a criminal complaint filed in Waukesha County Circuit Court .
The 30 - year - old Waukesha woman was charged Tuesday with possession of marijuana , possession of an illegally obtained prescription drug , possession of drug paraphernalia and bail jumping , all misdemeanors .
The charges stem from an investigation that started with an anonymous phone call on Aug. 18 that asked Waukesha police to check on the well - being of the 14 - year - old girl and two other children , a 7 - year - old and 5 - month - old infant , at their home .
The caller told police that a female resident at the home was " constantly doing drugs in front of her children , " according to the criminal complaint .
That night , police talked to the 14 - year - old girl , who said she and a neighbor had telephoned authorities .
The girl told police that she first recognized that her mother was smoking marijuana after the girl learned about the drug in sixth grade during DARE classes , according to the complaint .
The girl said her mother has smoked marijuana at the house on almost a daily basis with different people , the complaint says .
She told police she was willing to make a statement so that her mother could get the help she needed , the complaint states .
The woman eventually admitted to police that she uses the illegal drug , and investigators found a pot pipe containing burned marijuana residue in a box in the basement , the complaint says .

After last week ’s election , the Christian Coalition announced that one of its primary goals for the short - term future was seeing that the 20 states that do not currently ban gays from getting married do so and that those states that do allow marriage put an end to the practice .
Presumably , the first step in that battle will take place in West Virginia .
The Family Policy Council of West Virginia is already threatening the Governor that if he does n’t call a special legislative session to put an amendment on the ballot , he ’ll face the wrath of the voters and now the West Virginia Convention of Southern Baptists has joined the call :
The resolution , adopted at the 38th meeting of the West Virginia Convention of Southern Baptists , passed unanimously .
“ As citizens of West Virginia , we avail ourselves of the opportunity to affirm the historic , legal , and reasonable definition of marriage by supporting and promoting a marriage amendment to the state constitution , ” the resolution states . “ …
[ W ]e will strongly encourage Christians throughout West Virginia to engage in the civic process in defense of marriage and in support of the government ’s leadership in defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman ( Romans 13 ) . ” …
The resolution commits to praying regularly for the governor , legislators and judges .
It also makes it clear that West Virginia Southern Baptists believe “ same - sex unions are not the same as opposite - sex couples . ”
“ [ T ] o believe otherwise is to ignore the uniqueness of each gender ’s design and undermines marriage ( Genesis 2:18 ) , ” the resolution reads .
“ The break down or weakening of the institution of marriage has devastating moral , spiritual , economic , and social effects on the whole of society .
Marriage protects children by giving them an opportunity to grow up in the ideal environment : with a married mom and dad .
Knowingly depriving children of that opportunity exposes our children to a great social experiment that is in no one ’s best interest . ”
As the Baptist Press article “ West Virginia does not have a petition process allowing citizens to gather signatures and place a constitutional amendment on the ballot ” so any such amendment must first pass through the state House and Senate , both of which are controlled by Democrats .
But seeing as passing anti-gay amendments seems to be the only thing the Right has been having any success with in recent years , it is probably safe to assume that West Virginia leaders are going to be coming under increasing pressure to put one on the ballot there as well .
Seven Chinese ships or crews have been attacked off Somalia this year China has announced it is to send naval ships to fight rampant piracy in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia .
State media suggested the force could consist of two destroyers and a supply ship , although officials did not confirm the details of the deployment .
On Wednesday , Malaysian naval forces helped foil an attempt to hijack a Chinese ship by Somali pirates .
The latest operation is a first for Beijing , which has until now pursued a policy of military non-interference .
China 's navy , along with the rest of its military , has not often strayed far from home .
But China 's military spending has increased dramatically in recent years as its armed forces undergo a thorough modernisation .
This is its first active deployment beyond the Pacific , and naval analysts will be watching closely to see how the Chinese cope with the complex maintenance and re-supply problems of operating so far from home , the BBC 's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says .
UN resolution Foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told journalists that preparations to dispatch the vessels were under way .
He said further details would be provided when the operation was formally announced .
But the state - run Global Times newspaper said two destroyers and one supply ship would depart from a Chinese naval base on Hainan island after 25 December .
On Wednesday the UN Security Council unanimously approved a resolution allowing foreign military forces to pursue pirates on land in Somalia , though Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said the time is not right for such a mission .
Pirates foiled The Gulf of Aden is a region of key strategic importance for China whose economy depends heavily upon a secure supply of oil and raw materials from abroad , our correspondent says .
Four or five Chinese ships pass through the busy channel every day .
Seven Chinese ships or crews have been attacked this year , Mr Liu said .
On Wednesday , the Zhenhua 4 was attacked by Somali pirates .
The crew used water cannon and bottles to try to fight off their attackers , according to local media reports .
But it was the intervention of Malaysian naval forces , with support from other countries , that thwarted the pirates .

A few days ago , I mentioned
my single best action for saving money in my own life – utilizing the library .
I also encouraged readers to submit their own best actions – and did they ever !
The post has already received almost 250 comments and several dozen more readers emailed me their single best action .
As promised , I ’ve compiled a list of all of these actions .
Here are the top twenty five – basically , these are the ones that were repeated more than twice .
These are n’t in any particular order .
If you want some direct personal finance actions that have actually worked for people , here ’s your list .
1. Utilize the library
Many readers agreed with my statement about
how valuable the library is for those who read avidly .
Not only can it save you on the cost of buying books , it can also provide DVDs for viewing , CDs for listening , and many other interesting cultural experiences if you pay attention to the schedule of events .
2 . Use online bill pay
Not only does
online bill pay save you the expense of envelopes and stamps ( roughly fifty cents per bill paid online ) , it also provides you the convenience of auto - calculating your bills and comparing them immediately to your checking and savings account balances .
No more checkbook math necessary .
3 . Get your paycheck direct deposited
Instead of receiving a paper paycheck , have your paycheck directly deposited into your checking account .
This spares you the need to have to go to the bank to cash your check , plus relieves you of the temptation to have some cash taken out of the check when you deposit it .
4 . Make your own lunch and take it to work with you
Instead of eating out every day ,
brown bag it !
Prepare a lunch the night before and take that lunch with you to work the next day .
It can be leftovers , it can be a fresh meal ( like a sandwich ) , but either way , it can cut into your costs tremendously .
5. Stay home
Instead of going out on the town for entertainment , stay at home and enjoy the activities available in your domicile .
Most of the activities you can do at home – reading , watching television , exercising , playing games with friends , meditating , listening to music , cooking , etc. – are far cheaper than similar activities you might do out of the home .
6 . Set up an automatic savings plan
If you ’re getting your paycheck automatically deposited , consider setting up an automatic savings plan to have some of that money routed into retirement or into a savings account for an emergency fund .
It ’s far , far easier to start saving if the actual transfer of money happens automatically without your intervention .
7. Build an emergency fund
Alongside that advice comes the idea of building an emergency fund , a cash reserve that can help you in the event of a crisis such as a job loss or an automobile breakdown .
It ’s easy to build one – just sweep a small amount of money on a regular basis into a savings account , watch it build , and utilize that cash when the time comes .
8 . Stop smoking or drinking
Expensive consumables can be a huge drain on your financial situation .
Eliminating a consumable habit , such as tobacco or alcohol , can quickly improve your financial situation while also improving your health ( which can also improve your financial situation by reducing health care costs ) .
9 . Use the “ envelope ” system
Many people swear by this method , in which one actually budgets their money for a month using “ envelopes . ”
Whenever you need money for , say , groceries , you take money out of the groceries envelope – when that envelope is empty , you ’re out for the month .
This forces you to be careful with your spending in all respects .
10 . Stop looking at ads
Advertisements of all kinds – from television commercials to flyers from the Sunday paper – simply serve to coerce you into spending money on things you do n’t actually need .
Minimizing your exposure to advertisement minimizes the temptation to spend that money , keeping it at home in your wallet where it belongs .
11 . Ditch cable television
Cable television is often a pricy monthly bill and all it does is provide you with more channels that repeat variations on the same content .
Get a digital converter box instead and watch the channels that come in over the air – ABC , CBS , NBC , PBS , Fox , and often others .
And they ’re free – no monthly bill !
12 . Drink more tap water
Tap water makes you healthier ( most people are somewhat dehydrated , even if they do n’t realize it ) , fills you up ( keeping you from overeating expensive food at meals ) , and is incredibly cheap compared to any other beverage out there .
Take advantage of the tap – it can save you a ton of money on beverages and on food .
13 . Eat out less ( esp. fast food ) and cook at home instead
Every time you purchase prepared food outside the home , you ’re spending more than you would making a similar meal at home .
So why not adopt that as a platform instead ?
Learn how to cook at home , make your own meals , and save a lot of money .
14 . Stop shopping for fun
Shopping is a very expensive form of entertainment .
Instead of shopping with your free time , find other fun things to do – almost anything is cheaper – and leave the shopping trips for the times when you actually need an item .
15 .
Use the “ ten second rule ” ( or some close variation of it )
Whenever you are tempted to spend your money on something frivolous , stop for a few seconds and ask yourself whether you really need this item .
Ten seconds is usually enough – many people also recommend putting the item down and leaving the store , only returning if you ’ve decided you actually want it after some serious consideration .
16 . Accept help from others
It ’s easy to let pride get in the way of accepting help from others .
Do n’t let that happen .
Be willing to accept help if others offer it , and be thankful for it .
Later on , when your situation improves , you can pay it forward and help someone who needs it .
17 . Plan ahead for meals
At the start of a week , make a careful plan of what meals you ’re going to eat during the week , then make a grocery shopping list based solely on those meals .
When you go grocery shopping , stick to that list .
This is a great way to keep your food shopping bill low while keeping the food you want and need on the table .
18 . Go on a diet
Many people recommended healthy dieting as a tactic for saving money .
If you make a conscious choice to eat less , not only will you save money on your food bill , you ’ll also reduce your health care bill and perhaps your clothing bill as well ( since it ’ll be easier to find consignment clothes ) .
19 . Eliminate expensive hobbies
Are you engaged in a hobby that requires a lot of financial upkeep , like golf or collecting ?
Instead of continuing that expensive hobby and watching it drain all your money , choose a different path entirely – find a new hobby to focus your energy on that does n’t require so much upkeep cost .
20 .
Stop reading women ’s magazines
This is perhaps the biggest surprise on this list for me , but several readers swear by it .
They argue that women ’s magazines are extremely effective at convincing you to shop for things you do n’t necessarily need , convincing you that you need some item in order to keep up with the crowd .
Spare yourself the guilt – skip those magazines .
21 . Make a budget / spending plan
If you ca n’t seem to get a grip on your spending , try assembling a budget / spending plan so that you can clearly see where your money is going .
Spend a month or two keeping careful track of what you actually do spend on certain items , then set a spending goal for that type of item .
This can simultaneously serve as a wake - up call and as “ training wheels ” for good financial habits .
22 . Set strong goals
Do n’t fleetingly think about how you wish things were .
Instead , sketch out exactly how you want your life to be in , say , five years , then focus all of your actions toward that goal .
Not only can this cut out frivolous spending , it can also help you to make strong choices to improve every aspect of your life .
23 . Stop worrying about what other people think
Do n’t let the opinion of others rule the choices you make in your personal life .
It ’s not their life to live – it ’s your life .
Instead , make choices that you think are strong – and do n’t worry about the neighbors or the naysayers .
24 . Sell your car
A car is perhaps the worst investment you can make .
It depreciates rapidly , breaks down regularly , and requires constant upkeep .
Instead of dealing with this , sell the car and make do with the other transportation options available to you – a bicycle , buses , trains , and so forth .
25 .
Be accountable to what you spend
Finally , try having a weekly or monthly review of all of your spending .
Make yourself face the mistakes you ’ve made – do n’t let a bad spending move lie in the dust and be forgotten .
Use it as a tool to make sure it never happens again .
Hopefully , these tactics spur you on to great things .
Last month I previewed Kidrobot ‘s Spring 2009 Collection at their showroom and saw lots of cute pieces .
More pieces from the Tarina Tarantino accessories collection which were made according to the availability of the Kidrobot toys along with many apparel collaborations to be released for spring and of course more bags and caps .
The range starts to release in February 2009 , stay tuned for official launch dates .

With Sinus Rinse , however , gravity plays no part and there is no need to tilt the head .
Instead , the user fills the bottle with warm distilled water , mixes in a packet of isotonic sodium solution and squirts the slightly salted water gently up one nostril until the solution drips out the other side .
Then she repeats it with the other nostril .
Both solutions appear to be effective .
Last year , a study by researchers at the University of Michigan showed sinus patients who used a nasal rinse reported fewer symptoms than those who used over - the - counter sprays .
Dr. Mehta said NeilMed sales figures suggested that customers prefer the newer technique .
He noted that Sinus Rinse represented about 65 percent of NeilMed ’s sales , while the company ’s neti pot products represented roughly 30 percent .
The remaining 5 percent includes a variety of other products such as NasaMist , an isotonic saline spray , and NasoGel , a moisturizer .
Dr. Winston Vaughan , an ear , nose and throat specialist and co-director of the California Sinus Institute in Palo Alto , Calif. , shares the medical community ’s enthusiasm for NeilMed ’s products .
Unlike many others in his specialty , Dr. Vaughan said he was now likely to suggest in all but the worst cases that his sinusitis patients try nasal irrigation and some of these other remedies first , resorting to surgery only as a last resort .
These products “ get the junk moving and decrease the amount of mucus that can potentially serve as a source of infection or blockage . ”
Dr. Vaughan said , adding that because the water - based solution in Sinus Rinse contains nothing more than isotonic saline , “ it does not add any medication to a patient ’s treatment regimen , ” so there is no need to worry about how it interacts with medication .
These kinds of reviews have the Mehtas excited about the future ; despite a sagging economy and a downward trend in consumer spending , Dr. Mehta said he expected growth to continue in the years ahead .
Still , the nasal irrigation market is rife with competing products , including SinuCleanse from Med-Systems in Madison , Wis. ; Nasopure from BeWell Health in Columbia , Mo. , and SinuPulse Elite , developed in Switzerland .
Dozens of manufacturers offer neti pots , as well .
Besides contributing at @ TheDailyWTF , I write DevDisasters for Visual Studio Magazine , and involved in various side projects including child rearing and marriage .
This year ’s Corporate Technology Expo was no different than the ones for years previous .
Various departments gathered in the company ’s large , wood - paneled group meeting hall and highlighted their top projects and initiatives that were completed during the past year .
There was everything from the ASP - to - ASP.
NET upgrade of the customer portal to the enterprise - wide implementation of COGNOS 7 .
The scene was a three - hour , seemingly unending procession of PowerPoint slides with enough laser pointers to take down an incoming ICBM .
Nobody would probably show , let alone stay awake , if it were n’t for the free coffee and bagels .
However , you knew that the light at the end of the tunnel was approaching when the AppDev ’s “ big guns ” arrived : a cabal of four MUMPS developers headed up by a hairy yet balding man named Tyson .
They were the brilliant minds behind the company ’s core application , codenamed CASTLE .
This year , they brought t- shirts for the audience .
Tyson went into the usual spiel about the impressive accomplishments of their application , the 99.9 % uptime , and the tens - of - gigabytes doled out by the CASTLE system which fed data to the previous presenters ’ systems .
To wrap things up , Tyson revealed his “ one more thing ” – a brand new , home brewed combination web and mail server written entirely in MUMPS without any use of any common API .
Basically , even with the grandstanding , the presentation was a friendly reminder that everybody ’s livelihood depended on Tyson ’s group .
Quick MUMPS Review
For those who are n’t familiar with exactly what MUMPS is , you ’d be missing out if you did n’t check out A Case of the MUMPS .
To summarize , if you ’re associating MUMPS with the awful disease of the same name , you ’re very close .
Quite possibly created as an exercise in sadomasochism , the “ Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multiprocessing System ” was developed back in the mid-1960 ’s by Dr. Octo Barnett and with the help of federal grant money .
Originally limited to medical information systems , MUMPS has found its way into other fields .
Most notably , the financial sector .
To give a little more “ real world ” example of the horror that is MUMPS , start by taking one part [ [ International Obfuscated C Code Contest ] ] , a dash of Perl , two heaping measures of FORTRAN and SNOBOL , and the independent and uncoordinated contributions of dozens of medical researchers , and there you go .
The Project
Everyone in Steve X ’s department lived in fear of the CASTLE .
While Steve ’s background and job title may not shout “ MUMPS Developer ” , part of his job is to work with the quartet of diehard MUMPS developers who designed the system .
Thanks to the ignorance of management ( and perhaps a “ wink and a nod ” here and there ) , Tyson and his “ boys ” had built CASTLE as a 350,000 - line strong fortress of MUMPS over a period of more than twenty years .
Tyson and his group had pigeonholing down to a science ; everyone had relied on their system so much that they were untouchable and their group was impenetrable .
Except for now .
“ It ’s taken a while , ” the auditor said to Steve “ but we ’ve finally convinced Tyson to let someone go in and clean up some of the ‘ junk ’ tables that have built up over the years . ”
“ How ’d you do that , ” Steve smirked , “ a note from God ? ”
“ No , no , no .
I pulled the Sarbanes - Oxley card on him .
You ’ll see a meeting invitation with his group for Monday morning .
Good luck ! ” the auditor said as he dashed into the nearest hallway .
The following meeting with the quartet of MUMPS - men went relatively smoothly – probably from Tyson ’s desire to get the auditor and Steve out of his hair and out of his system as soon as possible .
Steve got to work .
His investigation could be compared to peeling back layers of wallpaper and seeing the horror it was really covering up .
After a month of work had passed , he showed that , out of the 393 known tables , 225 were no longer in use .
To make things even more interesting , many had been out of use since 1985 or earlier .
Included in the interesting finds were :
• A table called “ GIVE THIS A GO ” with zero records . •
A table called “ Clinician Orders ” , which was apparently used to record what drugs / medical procedures the clinician ordered for the patient at a given time .
It had 133 columns : Date Visit Clncn Student Trtmnt Obsrvtns CrtdUser CrtDtTm LstEdtUs LsEdDtTm [ un-named column ] DscUsrSg DscDtTm DscSgnUs - Discontinued Signed - In User AthCntUs - Authorize Controlled User AthCntDh N1amOrdr - 1 am Order N2amOrder - 2 am Order ... N11pOrder - 11 pm Order N12 mOrder – 12 Midnight Order N1amSgnt - 1 am Signature ... N12mSgnt - 12 m Signature N1 mDtTm - 1 am Date / Time ... N9 mDtTm - 9 am Date / Time [ un-named column ] [ un-named column ] [ un-named column ]
N1 pDtTm - 1 pm Date / Time ... N12DtTm – 12 Midnight Date / Time N1amUser - 1 am User ... N12 mUser – 12 Midnight User N1amCmmn - 1 am Comment ... N12 mCmmn – 12 Midnight Comment
That ’s right :
At least 5 fields for every hour of the day .
God only knows what would be done to this poor table if clinicians decided they wanted half - hour ( or worse yet , 15 - minute ) granularity .
•
The calculation to determine drug pricing was extremely complex and un-commented .
There were three different price fields : PrcUntCs - Purchase Unit Cost SpcRxPrc - Special Rx Price SpclCost - Special Cost Depending on a complex calculation ( including such WTFs as “ Is there an ‘ @ ’ symbol in the field specifying the type of drug ? ” ) , any of the three price fields could be used and a variable markup added .
For bonus - bonus fun , here is the actual code for the calculation : set cost=$s ( spc:spc,1:puc ) * 1.3 ; cost + 30 % set amt=qty / each *cost ... if drug falls into another category ... set amt=amt -( amt *.3 ) Tyson claimed they intended to “ take away that 30 % markup , ” not realizing that ( X * 1.3 * 0.7 ) !=
X . He never quite explained the reasoning behind " amt=amt -( amt*.3 ) " instead of " amt=amt *.7 " .
• Compounding information on the drug table .
Since drugs can be compounded ( i.e. made up of several other drugs ) , the programmer thoughtfully added these columns to the drug table : Item1 Itm1Qty Itm1 Lbl Itm1 Prc Item2 ... Item10 ItmTenQt ItmTenLb ItmTenPr ItmLotNo - Item1 Lot# Itm2Lot - Item2 Lot ... Itm9Lot - Item9 Lot Itm1Lot - Item10 Lot Itm1 Expd - Item1 Expdate ...
Itm9Expd - Item9 Expdate ItmTenExpdate - Item Ten Expdate Fortunately , someone explained how related tables worked to this programmer before CASTLE needed to handle drugs made up of 11 items .
Thankfully , the above compounding system was only used for 15 years or so .
The VISA Problem
After Steve ’s database debridement project was completed , he was given one more task by the auditing group : search for and remove any credit card numbers that may have been stored in the system .
As it turned out , CASTLE had been storing customers ’ full sixteen - digit credit card number for years , just in case someone needed to look up a transaction and the last four digits were n’t good enough .
Eventually , Visa came out with their PCI requirements , making this kind of thing a no - no .
So , to avoid a potential disaster and a hefty $ 500 k fine , Steve built a scrubber tool to seek out and destroy the credit card numbers in the database , including the ones entered into the “ notes ” section of the client records .
Later , just before the scrubber was to be run in Production , Steve was shocked to find the following enhancement made to his code :
set ^tnc ( " scramble " , " notes " , d0,d1 ) =data
In human - speak , this code is a loop where d0 is the client Id and d1 is the number of the note attached to the client ’s record .
data was the note containing a credit card number .
tnc was someone ’s initials .
More specifically , they were Tyson ’s initials .
What Tyson had accomplished was that he had inserted a line into the scrubber that effectively saved all credit card numbers to his personal database right before they were scrubbed .
The untouchable Tyson explained his reasoning as to cover the situation .
It was just in case they needed to recover that data in the future .
Normally , hearing that a developer is storing off live credit card numbers might raise an eyebrow or two , but with Tyson being a nice guy and all , everybody in the department believed him and let it go .
Knowing the path to hell is often paved with the very best of intentions , Steve went about and deleted Tyson ’s “ special file ” .
Conclusion
While it may sound like there ’s enough work to keep an entire department of MUMPS programmers working to fix the application sludge created by Tyson and his cohorts , nothing is going to be done about it anytime soon .
To clean up the tables and remove the credit card numbers robbed Steve of two month of his life that he ’ll never get back .
As a final line of defense against outsiders , the keepers of the CASTLE created enough red tape to ensure that even the simplest change would take long enough to thwart any major changes to their system .
In a best case , if one was very productive , he ’d find himself with weeks and weeks to kill while people try to make meetings to review his code or get back to him on requirements .
Of course , the good news in all this is that Steve ’s efforts just might make a bullet point on the MUMPS team ’s presentation at next year ’s Corporate Technology Expo .
Brutal honesty here : on election day this past November , the entire Engadget staff ( well , those of us with US passports ) collectively agreed that casting our vote via SMS or some other incredibly simple method would be infinitely more awesome than trudging out in the streets and waiting in hour - long lines .
Clearly , some higher - ups in Estonia are on board with that concept , as its Parliament has approved a law that will likely make it the first nation on Planet Earth to give citizens the right to vote by phone in something that matters ( American Idol notwithstanding ) .
' Course , those who choose to take advantage must first obtain a free authorization chip for their handset , which sort of kills the whole " not having to leave your house " aspect of all this .
Ah well , at least we 're moving in the right direction .
WASHINGTON  A Justice Department investigation offers a blistering critique of the political motivations that led to the firings of a group of United States attorneys in late 2006 but stops short of recommending criminal charges against former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales or others in the affair , officials said .
The Justice Department ’s inspector general and its Office of Professional Responsibility have been investigating the firings since last year , trying to determine who in the Bush administration ordered the firings , whether the dismissals were intended to thwart investigations and whether anyone had broken the law in carrying out the firings or in testifying about them .
Officials with the department refused to discuss the report in advance of its scheduled release on Monday , though it has been the subject of Web reports since Friday .
A lawyer for Mr. Gonzales declined to comment .
Mr. Gonzales , who resigned last year after coming under criticism because of the firings , has been the main focus of interest , in part because several members of Congress charged that he may have perjured himself in his testimony through his memory lapses and misstatements about the firings .
Curse da metric system !
It sounded so big when I ordered it !

Early on in Religulous , Bill Maher throws up a bar chart illustrating the number of people in America who are non-religious .
That number is 16 % , more than blacks , more than Jews , more than numerous other minority groups who seem to have no problem making themselves heard and getting Congress to do their bidding .
Maher wonders aloud why non-religious people are so underground ...
Early on in Religulous , Bill Maher throws up a bar chart illustrating the number of people in America who are non-religious .
That number is 16 % , more than blacks , more than Jews , more than numerous other minority groups who seem to have no problem making themselves heard and getting Congress to do their bidding .
Maher wonders aloud why non-religious people are so underground , and why they are n’t having an impact on the national discussion .
His film is aimed squarely at that 16 % of the country , and almost no one else .
His goal , and he clearly has one , is to give those people the motivation they need to come out of the closet and do something … before it ’s too late .
Religulous begins with Bill Maher , standing alone in Israel at a place called Meggido ; a worthless pile of rubble where many of the planet ’s religions believe the end of the world will begin .
From there , Maher pushes us into an intense , honest , and brutally funny discussion of blind belief , presenting the possibility that maybe we should all consider doubt instead .
We follow him around the world , as he travels from place to place talking to religious people of different faiths on different continents .
The surprising thing here is that even though Maher definitely has an agenda , his movie never skews into the realm of propaganda .
It ’s not propaganda , because Maher is n’t running out and finding weirdos to use in smear tactics against the devout .
Typically anyone trying to make a case against
God goes right to the pedophile priests and the suicide bombers , but Maher makes it a point to focus on normal , reasonably sane religious people .
He ’s not stacking the deck in his favor , because he does n’t need to .
He talks to truckers in a roadside chapel , he chats with random , middle - class tourists at a Christian - themed amusement park .
He talks to religious shop owners , small town preachers , televanglists , Jews for Jesus , fundamentalist U.S. Senators , Vatican priests , religious scientists , secular Muslims , gay Muslims , people in America , Utah ( come on , we all know it ’s not really America ) , Europe , and even in Jerusalem .
Though those fumbling for an excuse to discredit him may claim otherwise , these are n’t extremists or lunatics .
These are for the most part sane , rational , even intelligent people who believe something which Maher believes is insane .
Maher lets these people talk , but he does n’t let them get away with fooling anyone , including themselves .
He asks about their beliefs , and then refuses to follow the cultural taboos which demand he let it go when they say something ridiculous .
He talks to them plainly and without fear , asking the tough questions for which religion , any kind of religion , seems to have no answer .
Some of them get angry , most of them simply , and politely , shut down ; their brains refusing to go any further when he brings up a point of view which might cause them to objectively consider their blind faith .
Others , unable to cope with his queries , admit to being genuinely stupid , as did an Arkansas Senator who awkwardly excuses his flawed thinking by admitting that his job as an elected official does n’t require an IQ test .
Maher does n’t ambush any of these people , and I think that ’s the key to why Religulous works .
This is n’t a setup .
He asks intelligent , well considered , extremely direct questions of the people he encounters , with each question leading to another , forming a discussion which while often extremely funny , is also almost scientific in its method .
He ’s not out to trap people or make anyone look like a fool , though if they do it on their own he ’s not going to turn away .
Sarcastic subtitles occasionally appear to turn up the funny , but it never becomes snide or condescending .
Maher himself admits to a past in which he had religious leanings , and when he gets a reasonable answer to one of his queries , he ’s willing to admit his own admiration and surprise .
The smartest answers come , unbelievably , from a guy who makes his living playing Jesus dress - up .
The movie frames itself from the outset as a quest for knowledge , and believe it or not , in large part that ’s what it is .
To keep things rolling , director Larry Charles uses old stock footage between the moments of Maher ’s encounters .
It ’s not meant as mockery , merely comic relief .
I ’m not sure Religulous needed it , Maher ’s discussions alone will have you rolling in the aisles .
But those random little asides provide breaks in the movie ’s intensity , a moment to pause and consider , through the laughter , the truth of whatever it is you ’ve just seen .
Those inserts are n’t manipulative though , merely silly and Charles seems otherwise to go out of his way to give his movie a strange kind of transparency .
The movie ’s edited , yes , but Charles does n’t shy away from showing us the scene around their setup .
The camera crew shows up more than once on screen , and Larry Charles himself is occasionally heard , as if to remind us that he ’s there , and he ’s not trying to hide anything .
Religulous seems to know however , that no matter how genuine or factual or well thought out it is , it ’ll never get through to anyone outside of that 16 % referenced at the outset .
So it is n’t trying .
Bill Maher is not out to change anyone ’s mind , just remind the ones who already know of how dangerously ridiculous this whole thing is .
For most of the movie ’s running time he lets the game come to him , delivering comedy and poignancy with an unwavering , steady style .
It ’s only in the film ’s big finish that Religulous steps back to where it all started at Meggido , and really gets serious .
There , standing on that heap of religious rubble , Bill asks his audience to remember what they ’ve seen , to look at the world around them , and realize where it ’s all taking us .
He calls on those skeptics in the 16 % to stand up and be counted , to make their voice heard , before it ’s too late for the human race .
With an agenda like that , Religulous will likely cause a mental meltdown for anyone with a religious bent .
But for the people Bill Maher is trying to reach , his message comes in loud and clear .
If you ’re in that 16 % , you ’ll be rocked right out of your seat , either from laughter or sheer incredulity .
If Maher has his way , non-believers will see his film , stand up , be counted , and come out of hiding to say “ I do n’t know … and neither do you . ”
Azam Amir Qasab has told investigators that the attack organisers had sent an advance team to infiltrate the city .
Planning for the operation had begun six months ago and ringleaders had instructed the terrorists to kill 5,000 people .
doing it yourself .
Eco-friendly DIY projects are satisfying , challenging and almost always money - saving , and frankly we ca n’t get enough of them .
The fun of going green is that it ’s a personal thing .
You ’re joining the worthiest of causes – securing the future health of the planet you call home – and .
Eco-friendly DIY projects are satisfying , challenging and almost always money - saving , and frankly we ca n’t get enough of them .
Here are 12 fun and challenging green DIY projects :
Milk Paint .
Before oils came along to create an indelible , toxic mess , paints were made from milk , lime and earth .
It ’s one of the oldest human traditions known – for example , the 16,000 year old cave paintings at Lascaux in France use this eco-friendly mixture of pigments .
Fancy making your own ?
Take your pick of methods : dry milk , water and vegetable dye or a quart of skimmed milk , an ounce of lime and some coloring .
If you ’re feeling brave you can experiment with earths and oxides , but places like The Real Milk Paint Company will happily sell you a range of tailored pigments .
Your only problem ?
Every home - made pot will be a slightly different shade unless you measure precisely .
Radiator lining .
Wall - mounted radiators have a design flaw – they radiate heat in all directions , one being directly into the wall .
And with the big wide world on the other side of it , there ’s no way you ’re going to appreciably warm that one up .
The result is a huge amount of lost heat energy – up to 70 % in some cases .
The answer is to put something in the way .
There are various hi-tech solutions , such as this radiator booster , but there ’s a quick and cheap way to do it yourself , which is to line the wall with tin foil , the most reflective side facing the radiator .
The heat will be bounced back into the room and your heating bill will plummet .
I ’m sure you can think of an artful , tasteful way to do it .

Sun Jar .
Some of us thought fireflies , others thought Tinkerbell … but we all agree that Sun and Moon Jars are mesmerizing creations .
And not too complicated to build , either .
Have a look at the detailed walkthrough over at Not Martha ( but pay attention to their closing comment that in this case , the real thing is far superior in sun-gathering and light - emitting ability ) .

Household Cleaner .
Most of the household cleaners you see on the shelves work on a simple principle : people want results .
They cut to the chase by using a truly dreadful cocktail of toxic substances to blast germs into the beyond – and you can smell them even when the lid ’s on .
That ’s not good .
Happily , there are now cleaner , greener alternatives such as products by Ecover and The Clean Environment Company .
But there ’s a more versatile cleaner waiting to be assembled in your larder right now .
All you need is bicarbonate of soda , some lemons , white vinegar ( not malt – too pungent ) and some standard - grade olive oil .
And here ’s how to use them to effectively tackle most cleaning jobs under the sun .
Stain removal .
What about those really stubborn stains that cling on like a limpet in a rock pool ?
Grass , blood , motor oil , ink , or a drop of your favourite organic wine .
Again , the general response is The End Justifies The Means , i.e. absurdly potent bleaches that do the job at the expense of environmental health .
Yet there are plenty of safe , strong alternatives , such as concentrated orange cleaner , table salt or corn starch – all leaving the environment just as you found it .
( Compare this with the headache of safely disposing of toxic household substances ) .
Pillow cases .
Pillow cases , as well as being cases for pillows , are strong - seamed bags in a retro style , lacking handles .
In other words , they ’re unfinished tote bags – chic crusaders against the nuisance of urban tumbleweed .
So at the end of their bed - life or sofa - life , upcycle them into the latest in supermarket fashion – and let Instructables lead the way .
Notebooks .
Everyone has a favorite type of notebook – for example , reporters gravitate towards the spiral - bound flip style .
But the perfect notebook is made at home with care and attention and not a little love .
Any unwanted paper can be hand - stitched into a sturdy little journal .
Get creative ( like the people who use elephant dung to make notebook paper ) .
Horde any good paper , such as the better kind of junk mail .
Make a place for your thoughts that ’s truly you .
Furniture .
There ’s a great way to get an entirely new set of furniture for the house , and all it takes is a few choice materials , a set of handy tools , and the prefix “ re ” .
Threadbare sofa ?
Reupholster it .
If it ’s scratched ?
Restore or repaint it .
And if you ’re feeling particularly brave , you could draw on things with a Sharpie !
Moss .
Do -It - Yourself moss ?
Does n’t moss tend to do things itself already ?
Quite true – in fact , moss is virtually unstoppable .
You can even break it into a blender , whisk it into a paste with a few other substances , and create a living , growing paint .
You can cover entire surfaces , or you can create stunning like the ones seen over at GreenUpgrader .
For a primer , try Instructables .
The Sun .
Our favourite Earth - dwarfing ball of incandescent gas is the source of a million eco-friendly DIY projects .
Not forgetting how human beings are themselves solar powered , there are many ways to use the free energy of sunlight .
Work out where you can get the most sunlight , and rig up heat - absorbing materials , mirrors ( be safe ! ) and solar panelling – Treehugger has details on how to do this yourself as cheaply as possible .
If you have an old satellite dish in the shed , you ’ve got a head start .
Turf Roofs .
A few decades back , “ there ’s something growing on the roof ” was a sentence designed to galvanize the idle into a bout of guilty DIY .
Now it ’s something to be proud of .
Grass roofs keep houses cool in the summer and insulate them in the winter – and now , after a century of architects turning their noses up at the concept , it ’s enjoying a lush comeback .
But how do you do it ?
Securing strips of turf on a sloping roof is no mean feat – but while you ’re reading up on medieval Scandinavian roof designs , there ’s a short - cut .
The Green Roof Tiles by Toyota Roof Gardens ( via Inhabitat ) allow you to cheaply , quickly coat your roof in self - watering rubbed - soled layers of Korean velvet grass !
Strategic Gardening .
Your garden is n’t there to just look pretty .
As well as gently scrubbing the air around your house , it does the same as a turf roof , insulating and cooling as the situation requires .
Think about gardening tactics .
Where does the wind come from in the winter ?
Put trees in the way .
Where ’s the shade in the summer , and water for the local wildlife ?
How about a bird feeder and a bee hotel ?
How about letting it all run a little wilder than you ’re used to ?
If you ’ve recently tackled a novel eco-friendly DIY challenge , tell us about it .

It really depends on a variety of factors including the location of the desk in regards to the overall floor plan , the specific office you are in and how the chi or energy circulates within the entire space .
One of the most important factors to consider is the position of the desk .
You want to be sitting in a position that allows you to have a view of the room and door without being in direct line of the door .
See also how you can apply the command position for a bed Avoid being in direct line with the door or main walkway .
Being in direct line of the door or walkway can cause difficulty with your job and has the potential to decrease your income because you may quit or be let go .
If you have your back to the door , try to get out of the line of the chi or incoming energy .
If you are facing a wall , place a mirror on the wall , on your desk or on the monitor so that you 'll be able to see behind you .
This puts you in a command position so that you wo n't be stabbed in the back by co-workers and you can see what is coming at you in your business .
You want to have the ability to walk around both sides of the desk .
When one side is blocked or pushed up against a wall , this can have an impact on your income or relationships with co-workers , customers and prospects .
Depending on the role you have in the company can determine placement of where a person should sit in the floor plan of the office .
When sitting in the new location , how do you feel ?
Do you feel comfortable or is there shelving with heavy books and items above you creating a downward pressure ?
This can lead to anxiety , headaches and overall frustration .
If you have a door to your personal office , make sure that it opens a full 90 degrees and nothing is blocking a person from walking into the space .
This is about welcoming the wealth energies and allowing you to take advantage of new opportunities .
You will also want to review under your desk to make sure that you have nothing blocking your feet or leg room as this can lead to a feeling of being stuck in your job or career .
Consider adding life energy to your desk area such as bamboo or a money tree plant .
This can improve relationships in the office and among co-workers .
What do you have sitting under your desk ?
Are you sitting in a command position ?
Do you have photos of your office or desk ?
Send an email to ken@kenlauher.com and I 'll post them here with comments for improving the Feng Shui of the space .
The most prominent ethanol energy company in the US , Verasun ( VSE ) , is filing for Chapter 11 .
Among other things the firm has been pinched by falling oil prices , which make ethanol less attractive , and rising corn prices , which makes production more expensive .
When oil was at $ 147 a barrel , ethanol was a savior for car and truck drivers everywhere .
The ethanol industry built tremendous production and transportation infrastructure .
It was a " if we build it , the will come " strategy .
Then , the world fell apart .
Prices for gas at the pump are back down well below $ 3 instead of being headed toward $ 5 as they were in August .

How Madoff Made Off
So everyone has read about how Bernie Madoff has this 14 + year old Ponzi scheme and many have heard that for years now a money manager named Harry Markopolos has had a decade - long running battle to unveil the fraud .
What you may not know is that Markopolos wrote a detailed memo outlining the case titled , “ The World ’s Largest Hedge Fund is a Fraud . ”
In the memo , Markopolos posits two potential scenarios :
Madoff Securities is front - running clients .
That is , he gets a client order for his normal ( and large ) brokerage business and then does a trade for his own account exploiting that inside information .
This is , of course , illegal .
Markolpolos cites this as the unlikely scenario .
Madoff Securities is a Ponzi scheme .
Markopolos cites this as the highly likely of the two scenarios .
Markopolos then lays out 29 “ red flags ” in excruiting detail in his 19 - page memo to the SEC which I have embeded using Scribd below .
There are two big questions : it seems clear that a lot of people in the industry knew about this so why did no one ( other than Markopolos ) turn in Madoff ? and why did the SEC not follow through ?
On the latter , I have no idea and an investigation into that is more than warranted .
On the former question of why no one ratted Madoff out it ’s basically because he used a big carrot and a big stick .
Let me explain .
Madoff set up his “ hedge fund ” as an outsourced service .
He just did the trading in managed accounts and only charged transaction fees ( no 1 % of assets under management and no 20 % of profits ) .
He then outsourced fundraising and client management to hedge fund - of - funds .
A lot of the hedge FoF thought that Madoff was getting his returns by front running and figured they were in on the con , that Madoff was n’t getting greedy and that left them to make a lot of money .
A big carrot .
On the flip side , Madoff held positions of great power ( e.g. Chairman of NASDAQ ) and could exact great retribution on anyone who crossed him ( heck , just read the first page of Markopolos ’ letter to the SEC to get a feel for how scared he was of being tagged as the informant ) .
In short , Madoff ran the perfect con that exploited greed , fear and laziness .

Why I like pip
So yesterday I explained some of the reasons why I do n’t like setuptools .
In essence , my objections boil down to one idea : application packaging and application development should be orthogonal concerns .
The way setuptools works , however , seems to tend , inevitably , toward coupling them to each other .
I gave one example — the way the default behavior of installing zipped packages ( an ironic twist : the man who so eloquently explained how Python is not Java has spent so much time and effort trying to implement Java packaging conventions in Python ) leads to a need to use specialized , non-standard , packaging - system - specific API s to access things like data files — and mentioned that , unfortunately , this is only one example of how use of setuptools ends up changing application code to deal with packaging concerns .
By way of a lead - in , I mentioned that Debian and various Ruby folks are at each other ’s throats right now over a very similar problem : the de facto Ruby packaging system ( gem ) does some very similar things , causing headaches for people who ( like Debian ) want to package and distribute Ruby code without relying on the gem system ( since they already have a package - management framework which handles much more than just Ruby ) .
This debate should stand as a clear example of a real - world problem created by the coupling of packaging systems and application code , and so should make it quite clear that this is an issue with setuptools .
But toward the end of yesterday ’s article I suggested pip as an alternative to the setuptools / pkg_resources / easy_install toolchain , and today I ’d like to explain a bit more about why I prefer pip and some of the concrete benefits it offers .
pip installs packages
Building a bit on what I wrote yesterday , one of the main attractions of pip is the fact that it ’s just an installation tool .
It does n’t really care whether you built your package with distutils or with setuptools or , in some cases , whether it ’s even a package at all ( since it can install from the URL of a Subversion repository if you ask it to ) .
That ’s a really big deal , because it means that pip does not change your packaging workflow in any way .
You just make your package the way you ’ve always made it , and then put it up on the Web somewhere ( preferably listing it in the Python package index , but you do n’t have to if you do n’t want to ) and people using pip can grab it and install it .
Contrast this with the setuptools way of doing things , which requires you to change your packaging workflow and introduce a dependency on setuptools , and which can still cause headaches if you are n’t using it to package your code but someone else is using it to install your code , requiring you to work around setuptools even when you are n’t actually using it .
Plus , if you do build your packages with setuptools , pip can read the dependencies and track them down for you ; originally , I ’d assumed this functionality came from PoachEggs , which seemed like it replicated a lot of setuptools ’ parsing of requirements , but in his response to my article yesterday Ian clarified that pip just uses the setuptools APIs to do this .
Which is saying something : glossing over setuptools ’ warts to the point where you do n’t even realize it ’s being used is a pretty big deal .
Another practical issue with the setuptools way of life is that easy_install can easily create broken installations ; it does n’t do a whole lot of up - front checking to make sure it ’ll actually be able to install both the requested package and the dependencies , and this can lead to problems if something in the dependency chain ends up uninstallable .
Meanwhile , pip looks before it leaps , can bail out early if it ’s not going to be able to install your package and will leave behind a useful log file explaining what went wrong .
This is good stuff .
But it gets better .
Reproducible builds
The point where pip really shines , though , is in the ease of specifying and creating reproducible builds .
If you ’ve ever dealt with having to deploy the same code base across multiple machines , you know what a headache this can be , since a huge number of factors ( operating system and version , pre-installed packages and versions , system package managers and configuration , etc. , etc. ) can change the results of your deployment process , sometimes in subtle and difficult - to - debug ways .
With pip , this is not ( so much of ) a problem .
I mentioned pip requirements files yesterday as an alternative to the way setuptools specifies dependencies directly in setup.py , and that ’s certainly one useful application of the feature , but you can take it much further : once you know which packages ( and , just as important , which versions of which packages ) you need , you can write them down in a simple , plain - text file , point pip at it , and it ’ll install them .
Once you have reproducible builds of Python packages , a whole world of useful techniques opens up : you can just distribute a basic requirements file specifying your application and its dependencies , or you can distribute multiple files specifying various optional configurations , or… well , pretty much anything you like .
This is somewhat similar to what you can do with zc.buildout , but with a few of major differences :
pip only handles Python packages , while buildout can handle pretty much anything you want to throw at it .
pip ‘s format for specifying what to install is , in my experience , quite a lot simpler for the common case ( “ here ’s a list of packages I want ” ) ; buildout ‘s recipe system is a bit more complex up - front , but this does mean more complex setups are a bit easier to manage .
buildout really really likes eggs .
This is the main reason why I have n’t done more with it , but if you really like eggs you might want to give it a spin .
The “ freezing ” feature of pip also adds to the ease - of - use ; given an already - working environment with all the packages you need , pip ( via the command pip freeze ) can spit out a requirements file for you ( which you can then edit , of course , to remove any unnecessary entries ) and you can use that as the basis for replicating your working build .
Better development and deployment
The last piece of the puzzle , for me , is virtualenv ; virtualenv is a tool for creating and working with isolated Python environments , and is basically the only way I work with Python these days .
On the development side , virtualenv makes it easy to try out Python software without screwing up anything you already have installed , or do parallel development of multiple versions of some piece of code .
On the deployment side , virtualenv solves a major problem setuptools has tried to work around with some of its own features : how to handle a situation where different applications require different ( and possibly conflicting ) versions of the same library .
The solution virtualenv supplies is an easy , lightweight and above all isolated environment for installing and using Python software , so that two applications with conflicting requirements can simply run in two different virtualenv environments .
And , naturally , pip integrates quite nicely with virtualenv ; normally , when working in an active virtualenv , Python packaging / installation tools ( pip included ) will install into that virtualenv , but pip also lets you :
Specify a virtualenv to install into ( using the - E flag ) , and Create a new virtualenv and install into it .
The second one is really the killer feature , because it means you can set up a requirements file specifying a list of packages , and get pip to create a virtualenv for you and install the packages into it .
To see how handy this can be , let ’s take a simple example : suppose you have an application which runs fine against the current Django release ( 1.0.2 ) , and you want to play around a bit with the Django development trunk to try out a new feature .
You could create a requirements file specifying docutils ( so the automatic Django documentation will work ) and the Subversion URL for Django trunk :
docutils==0.5 -e svn+http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk#egg=Django
Save this into a file named , say , django - requirements .
txt .
Then ( assuming you have pip and virtualenv installed ) , run the following :
pip install - E django - trunk -r django - requirements .
txt source django - trunk / bin/ activate
This will create a virtualenv named “ django - trunk ” , install docutils and an SVN checkout of Django trunk , then activate it so you can begin working with it immediately ( to exit the virtualenv , simply close your shell or type deactivate ) .
And , of course , you can also drop a copy of your application in there to hack on it and try out trunk - only Django features .
This is pretty handy for local development , but imagine how much easier it could also make deployment : simply have pip and virtualenv preinstalled on your server , then upload a requirements file and let pip do its thing .
You can even point mod_wsgi at a virtualenv to have it use the isolated environment for your applications .

NEW �YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
There 's no indication when - or if - the White House and congressional leaders will reach agreement on the Democrats ' proposal to give troubled U.S. automakers a financial lifeline .
Meanwhile , one key General Motors official is already talking about the need for more help from the government - even before this package is approved .
A senior administration official told CNN that language to modify the proposal was discussed until late Monday .
Some Republicans have been critical of the plan , saying it does n't have enough assurances of automakers viablility .
The companies could get a total of $ 15 billion in federal loans as soon as Dec. 15 , according to a working Democratic draft of proposed legislation and a senior Democratic congressional aide .
The proposal , which was delivered to the White House Monday afternoon , remains a work in progress .
The bailout was worked on through the weekend on Capitol Hill in an effort to produce a bill that the Bush administration could agree to .
A Democratic source conceded to CNN that the White House has concerns with the proposal but that House and Senate staffs sent a revised draft of the proposal to the White House Monday night .
The aim is to finalize a bill for a quick vote by Congress , which is meeting this week in a lame - duck session .
" [ This is ] a fundamental step towards an agreement , " said Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass . , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
" If there is a real desire to get this thing done and prevent adding another disaster to our economic situation , we should have it . "
The Democrats ' bill met some immediate Republican opposition .
Sen. Bob Corker , R - Tenn. , said " at first glance " the proposal was " lacking the benchmarks " it needs to make sure the companies stay afloat .
If the aid package is passed , it could avert the need for General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler LLC to file for bankruptcy and halt operations .
The money is less than the $ 34 billion requested by the industry last week , but the proposed plan would give the new Congress and the incoming Obama administration time to hammer out a longer - range plan to help the industry .
The money would come out of funds designated by the Energy Independence and Security Act to help the auto industry produce the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles .
Democrats had wanted funding for an automaker rescue to come from the Treasury Department 's $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program , but the Bush administration balked .
But according to Democratic leadership , the Energy Act only allows for $ 15 billion to be delivered to the industry , since the loan would be " risky . "
" This is a bad choice we have to make , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif .
" But come Mar. 31 , it is our hope that there will be a viable automotive industry in our country , with transparency and accountability to the taxpayer .
We think that it is possible . "
The Bush administration said Monday evening that it was continuing its talks with lawmakers .
" Long - term financing must be conditioned on the principle that taxpayers should only assist automakers executing a credible plan for long - term viability , " said White House press secretary Dana Perino .
GM Vice Chairman of Global Development Bob Lutz told CNN's American Morning that he expects the industry to go back to Washington next year for more money .
" I do n't think anybody in Congress or the president - elect assumes that this is all the money that is going to be required to bridge this liquidity crisis that the American automobile industry is facing , " Lutz said .
What 's in the bill
Under the proposal being reviewed by the White House , the president would appoint an individual to write the guidelines for the loan , due by Jan. 1 , and oversee the bailout .
This person - a so - called " car czar " - would essentially be in charge of setting the terms for restructuring the Big Three automakers .
The official would have authority to negotiate with unions , debt holders , suppliers and other " interested parties " to help work out restructuring plans .
The plan would also give the Government Accountability Office a special role in overseeing the program .
Under the proposal , the government would receive warrants - the right to buy a stake in the companies at a certain price - equal to 20 % of the loan 's value .
That means taxpayers would take a significant share of GM , which has asked for $ 10 billion in loans .
The companies would also have to drop their lawsuits against individual states that have passed laws on emissions standards that are more extensive than the federal government's .
GM , Chrysler and Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) have been asking for loans to help them survive until 2010 , when some cost cuts and labor contract savings kick in that could help the Big Three eventually return to profitability .
In a statement , GM said it is pleased lawmakers are working on a bill that would give the industry immediate assistance .
" Millions of jobs , America 's manufacturing base and future competitiveness hang in the balance and we urge quick passage of this bill , " the statement said .
Chrysler echoed GM , saying it looks forward to working with Congress so that it can complete its restructuring process in an " orderly fashion . "
GM and Chrysler have warned that they could soon run out of the cash they need for operations without assistance from the government .
Ford has said it has enough cash on hand for now and may not need the federal help but that it would still like the funds to be available as a backstop .

This is too much .
The Republicans are basically admitting that Katherine Harris stole the election for George Bush .
Republicans are also questioning the credibility of Minnesota ’s Secretary of State Mark Ritchie , the man tasked with overseeing the recount .
A background document distributed by national Republicans portrays Ritchie as a far - left , Democratic version of Katherine Harris , the former Republican secretary of state whose actions helped decide the 2000 presidential election .
The document accuses Ritchie , who was elected in 2006 with the assistance of a progressive - led group designed to elected Democratic election administrators , of having connections to the controversial voter registration group ACORN and the Communist Party of America .
As Al Franken gets closer to victory , the Republicans are unraveling .
A recount is definitely on its way .
Oh , what fun ...

The bitterness between Democratic challenger Al Franken and incumbent Norm Coleman has continued beyond their race for a Minnesota US Senate seat .
The Franken campaign claims to have taken the lead in the recount , while the Coleman people say that the Franken camp is lying .
The dispute essentially revolves around how the ballots are counted in the recount .
As the Franken camp posted on their website today , “ By our count , Al Franken leads Norm Coleman by 22 votes with roughly 138,000 ballots left to be hand counted .
Many media outlets are calculating the margin by a different method , relying on raw data from the Secretary of State ’s website to conclude that Coleman holds a lead of over 300 votes .
However , that calculation assumes that every challenge will be upheld by the state canvassing board , whereas our calculation assumes that the original call by the impartial election judge will stand .
So , if the judge calls it for Franken , we say it ’s a Franken ballot .
Likewise , if the judge calls it for Coleman , we treat it as a Coleman ballot – even if we have challenged it . ”
Coleman campaign manager Cullen Sheehan said , “ The Franken Campaign invented a story of an 84 year old stroke victim in a shameless effort to make a political point .
Today , they ’ve invented a story of a lead in the recount .
Both stories are false , and both stories will be held up as evidence of a campaign that has been prepared to say and do anything to win an election that they lost on election night .
We have confidence that on Friday the results of the recount will show Norm Coleman has emerged , again , as the winner of the 2008 United States Senate election . ”

However , late this afternoon , TwinCities.com is reporting that the 37 votes that were found for Franken yesterday in Maplewood have been offset by an error in Minneapolis where 129 ballots were counted twice .
When the error was corrected Franken lost a net 36 votes .
No matter whose calculations are being used , this would mean that Coleman has the lead .
It is likely that we wo n’t know the winner of the election until the entire process is completed on Friday .
The fact that both campaigns are claiming a lead demonstrates just how close the margin is .
The Franken / Coleman race was easily the ugliest statewide race in the country .
This was a campaign that became very personal and was filled with mudslinging by both camps .
Issues took a back seat as this was a brutal contest .
The only things that we can be certain of are that the loser of this election will almost certainly feel cheated , and that a rematch in six years is very likely .
This was not a campaign that will be taught in civics classes as a model of our electoral process .
Franken Recount Update
Coleman Campaign Statement
I ’m reading a lot about how Obama “ reaches out ” to his adversaries , and that ’s why he ’s building a track record of inviting avowed homophobes to stand front and center at his campaign events and now his inauguration .
Okay , I ’m game .
So we know being a gay - basher does n’t disqualify you from a seat at the Obama table – in fact , it seems to be an outright qualification for proving Obama ’s post - partisanship .
If Obama prides himself on reaching out to all sides of every debate , then why is it that Obama has never sat down with , or promoted at his events , an avowed racist or anti-Semite ?
If you ’re going to argue , as some have , that respect for the civil rights of gay and lesbian Americans is somehow now “ liberal ” and “ fringe ” – funny that Obama did n’t think it was fringe during his campaign when he publicly embraced our community and our rights – then respect for the civil rights of African - Americans and Jewish - Americans is no less liberal and fringe .
Civil rights are civil rights , and it ’s well established in American civil rights circles that gay rights are African - American rights are Jewish - American rights are disability rights .
We are all one people , our rights are inextricably linked .
It ’s odd , and therefore telling , that Obama considers all of us equals , yet he only seems to reach out to those who bash gays , and not those who bash blacks , or Jews , or people with disabilities , or any other member of America ’s civil rights community .
Why is that ?
If Obama wants to burnish his independent bona fides with a little Sista Souljah now and then , why is his sista always a dyke ?
At some point , when your victim is always the same , your actions are no longer a sign of your independence .
They ’re a sign of your bigotry .
AUBURN , Ala . --
For most of Tommy Tuberville 's 10 seasons as Auburn coach , the Tigers were the best college football team in a state where that title is almost as important as the national championship .
In 2008 , Nick Saban and Alabama took the state back as Tuberville 's Tigers faltered , and that was enough to make Auburn want a change in leadership .
Tuberville stepped down Wednesday , ending a tenure that included a perfect season and a string of teams that contended for Southeastern Conference championships .
He was 85 - 40 in his decade with Auburn , including a 13 - 0 season in 2004 when the Tigers finished No. 2 in the nation and won the SEC title for the first time in 15 years .
But Auburn went 5 - 7 this year and was routed 36 - 0 at the end by rival Alabama , currently ranked No. 1 .
Tuberville met with university president Jay Gogue on Monday .
The decision was made after Tuberville met with Auburn athletic director Jay Jacobs for the second time in as many days on Wednesday .
" The last 10 years have been a great time in my life , both professionally and personally , " Tuberville said in a statement .
" It 's been a great place to coach and live , and we 've had a lot of success along the way .
I 'm going to remain in Auburn and help the Auburn family however I can .
I 'm very appreciative of the coaches , players , staff and Auburn fans over the last decade . "
Tuberville informed the players in a team meeting at the football complex after three days of meetings with Auburn officials .
The players were not allowed to speak to the media as they walked out or lingered in the parking lot afterward .
" Tommy and I have had the opportunity to discuss the direction of the program , " Jacobs said in a statement .
" Through those discussions , Tommy felt it would be in his and the program 's best interest to step aside as Auburn 's head football coach . "
The decision was first reported by the Birmingham ( Ala . )
News .
The Tigers lost six of their last seven games after a failed move to the spread offense that was abandoned -- along with first - year offensive coordinator Tony Franklin -- at midseason .
Their first five SEC losses came by a combined 23 points , falling just short of the end zone on final drives against Arkansas and Georgia and twice losing by one point after missed PATs .
The season also included an ugly 3 - 2 win over Mississippi State .
Auburn 's offense sputtered badly the past two seasons .
Tuberville gambled with the hire of Franklin and a departure from the team 's more traditional , run-oriented attack , going to the no-huddle , spread at a school noted for turning out NFL - caliber tailbacks .
Senator Robert Byrd ( D - WV ) , the longest - serving member in the history of the U.S. Senate and the oldest current member of Congress , announced today that he will resign his chairmanship of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee effective January 6 .
" A new day has dawned in Washington , and that is a good thing , " said Byrd in a statement .
" For my part , I believe that it is time for a new day at the top of the Senate Appropriations Committee . "
" I want to stress that this is a decision I made only after much personal soul searching , and after being sure of the substantial Democratic pickup of seats in the Senate .
I am now confident that stepping aside as Chairman will not adversely impact my home state of West Virginia . "
Byrd , who also served as Senate Majority leader for 12 years , has been in the Senate for 50 years and has been a member of the Appropriations Committee that entire time .
Senator Daniel Inouye ( D - HI ) , who has also served a lengthy term on the committee , is Byrd 's obvious replacement as chairman and the West Virginia Senator strongly endorsed that move .
" Senator Daniel Inouye has stood in line for many years and now his time has come , " said Byrd .
" He is my friend .
He is a genuine American hero .
He will be a skillful and fair Chairman of the Appropriations Committee because he is a man of outstanding character and great wisdom . "
And Byrd took the time in his announcement to say how thrilled he is with the results of Tuesday 's presidential election and to continue serving in the Senate .
" To be serving in the Senate at such a momentous time in our history fills me with enormous pride .
I endorsed President - elect Obama because I believed that we had taken the wrong course both at home and abroad .
I am delighted with his victory , " he said "
" I thank God for the long life He has granted me and for the opportunity
He has given me to assist this great country through long service in this magnificent institution , the United States Senate .
I look forward to the years ahead and to making a contribution to a better , stronger America . "

The good news ( as noted in the original , popular vegan recipe guide ) , is that plenty of vegan meals are tasty and satisfying for even the most red- blooded steak lover out there .
This post will offer up the sides we all love : dessert , salads , and appetizers – veganized .
Veganism is a fairly restrictive dietary choice , though it ’s getting easier – and plenty of vegans report that it ’s really not difficult at all .
According to research , only about 2.5 % of the American population is vegetarian , with strict vegans being but a fraction of that number .
No one disputes that vegan fare is gentler on the planet .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The international financial crisis has given world leaders a unique opportunity to create a truly global society , Prime Minister Gordon Brown will say in a keynote foreign policy speech on Monday .
Prime Minister , Gordon Brown ( R ) , and former Conservative Party Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher , attend the annual Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall , in central London November 9 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Toby Melville
In his annual speech at the Lord Mayor ’s Banquet , Brown -- who has spearheaded calls for the reform of international financial institutions -- will say Britain , the United States and Europe are key to forging a new world order .
“ The alliance between Britain and the U.S. -- and more broadly between Europe and the U.S. -- can and must provide leadership , not in order to make the rules ourselves , but to lead the global effort to build a stronger and more just international order , ” an excerpt from the speech says .
Brown and other leaders meet in Washington next weekend to discuss longer term solutions for dealing with economic issues following a series of coordinated moves on interest rates and to recapitalise banks in the wake of the financial crisis .
“ Uniquely in this global age , it is now in our power to come together so that 2008 is remembered not just for the failure of a financial crash that engulfed the world but for the resilience and optimism with which we faced the storm , endured it and prevailed , ” Brown will say in his speech on Monday evening .
“ ... And if we learn from our experience of turning unity of purpose into unity of action , we can together seize this moment of change in our world to create a truly global society . ”
According to a summary of the speech released by his office , Brown will set out five great challenges the world faces .
These are : terrorism and extremism and the need to reassert faith in democracy ; the global economy ; climate change ; conflict and mechanisms for rebuilding states after conflict ; and meeting goals on tackling poverty and disease .
Brown will also identify five stages for tackling the economy , starting with recapitalising banks so they can resume lending to families and businesses , and better international co-ordination of fiscal and monetary policy .
He also wants immediate action to stop the spread of the financial crisis to middle - income countries , with a new facility for the International Monetary Fund , and agreement on a global trade deal , as well as reform of the global financial system .
“ My message is that we must be : internationalist not protectionist ; interventionist not neutral ; progressive not reactive ; and forward looking not frozen by events .
We can seize the moment and in doing so build a truly global society . ”
After stalling at 6.1 % in September , the U.S. unemployment rate jumped to 6.5 % .
This was a truly ugly report as we saw payrolls go down by 240,000 – more than forecast and September was revised up significantly from 169,000 to 284,000 .
August was revised up 54,000 as well .
These were enormous revisions , putting total job losses at 1.179 million since January .
Given the large number of layoff announcements recently , we should expect this rate to rise significantly based on expected job losses alone .
A rate over 8 % in 2009 is certainly well within the range of possibilities .
Looking at the second chart below , one can see that non-farm payrolls dipped by a much greater amount in the recession of 2001 than the dip we have seen to date in 2008 .
Given this recession is much deeper , it suggests we will see millions more jobs lost in the coming months .
The unemployment rate has very much underestimated the economic pain being felt in this recession .
There a number of reasons why : the increasing number of workers accepting lower pay and accepting part - time or temporary positions , as well as the decrease in those actually looking full time for employment .
Yesterday , Barry Rithotz had a very good post on this .
Does that relatively mild U3 unemployment rate accurately portray the employment circumstances ?
U3 is the official UE rate , but the BLS also reports a full — and much uglier measure — U6 .
I ’ve long said that the U6 number is more accurate , and more and more people are recognizing that as the case .
Dan Gross of Slate and Newsweek has been in the same camp for quite a while .
A column of his from October is worth resurrecting prior to tomorrow ’s Employment Situation Release .
NFP .
Dan observes : “ It ’s hard to overstate the poor numbers coming out of Wall Street in recent months .
But could it be that we ’re overstating the gravity of the situation ?
As job losses have mounted and consumer confidence has plunged , policymakers , news organizations , econo - pundits , and even some of my Slate colleagues have noted that the unemployment rate , which rose to 6.1 percent in September , seems to be at a nonrecessionary , noncatastrophic , low level .
The unemployment rate is still below where it was in 2003 ; and between September 1982 and May 1983 , the last very deep recession , it topped 10 percent .
But maybe the employment data are much worse than they seem .
In the past year , the two key measures of employment — the unemployment rate and the payroll jobs figure — have been poor but not awful .
The unemployment rate has risen from 4.5 percent a year ago to 6.1 percent .
And in the first nine months , 760,000 payroll jobs were lost .
This is unwelcome but not catastrophic .
So why do things feel so bad ?
It ’s not because , as Phil Gramm suggested , we ’re a nation of whiners .
And it ’s not a matter of columnists and spin doctors shading the numbers to make things look worse .
Rather , these two figures are undermeasuring the weakness in the labor market .
By some measures , in fact , the job situation is worse than it has been at any time since 1994 .
Exactly .
Wanna know why ?
Major changes in the BLS methodology since the 1990s since 1994 .

Undercounting Under - Employment – Barry Ritholtz
The traditional way that Unix kernels boot is to perform some very basic system setup , declare the running code to be a kernel process with PID 1 , initialize all of the various important subsystems ( such as networking ) , initialize drivers , mount the root filesystem from whatever device you told them was the root device , and then just exec ( ) ( from inside the kernel ) / sbin / init .
At least in the somewhat old days , Linux was no exception to this .
The problem for initrds is that the job of initrds is to do things ( such as load driver modules ) to let the system see the normal root filesystem , and a normal Unix system ( and Linux was no exception ) provides no way to change what the root filesystem is once init has started running .
Thus you cannot implement initrds in the obvious way , by having the kernel treat the ramdisk as the root filesystem and exec ( ) ing a program from it as init .
Instead , the original Linux initrd hooked into the boot process just before the ' mount the root filesystem ' step .
If there was an initrd , the kernel diverted sideways ; it mounted the initrd , created a new process , and in the new process exec ( ) 'd / linuxrc .
When this process exited , the kernel resumed the normal process of booting , expecting that the configured root device was present and so on .
( I believe that the initrd could use a magic hack to change what the kernel had set as the root device . )
This magic diversion had some odd consequences .
For example , since the kernel was PID 1 , it had to arrange to reap orphaned processes while it was waiting for the initrd to finish running , because otherwise they could just pile up .
Related to this , you could n't populate your initrd with a normal but minimal system and just run from it since most versions of init become unhappy if they are not PID 1 .
( As you might guess , the fix to make initrds not a hack was to add a way to change what the root filesystem is on a running system . )
The world 's biggest chemical company , BASF , said on Wednesday it would cut its production worldwide and suspend operations at 80 plants , affecting 20,000 workers .
BASF has a manufacturing plant at Altona in Melbourne and employs more than 300 people in Australia and New Zealand , but it was not immediately clear whether these operations would be affected .
The company 's website says BASF 's customers in Australia and New Zealand are from the agricultural , construction , petroleum refining , automotive and chemical industries .
" BASF is taking measures to avoid the creation of overcapacities as a result of a massive decline in demand , " the company said in a statement .
The group " is temporarily shutting down around 80 plants worldwide .
In addition , BASF is reducing production at approximately 100 plants , " following decisions that had already been revealed in part .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
In the biggest number of bank seizures yet on a single day , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . and state regulators have shut down two banks in Southern California and one in Georgia .
The FDIC said late Friday that U.S. Bank USB , - 1.06 % , based in Minneapolis , has acquired the banking operations , including all the deposits , of Downey Savings and Loan Association , F.A. , Newport Beach , Calif. , and PFF Bank & Trust , Pomona , Calif .
The combined 213 branches of the two organizations will reopen as branches of U.S. Bank .
As of Sept. 30 , Downey Savings had total assets of $ 12.8 billion and total deposits of $ 9.7 billion .
PFF
Bank had total assets of $ 3.7 billion and total deposits of $ 2.4 billion , according to the FDIC .
In addition to assuming all the deposits from the two California banks , U.S. Bank will purchase virtually all their assets .
The FDIC will retain any remaining assets for later disposition .
The FDIC and U.S. Bank entered into a loss share transaction .
U.S. Bank will assume the first $ 1.6 billion of losses on the asset pools covered under the loss share agreement , equal to the net asset position at close .
The FDIC will then share in any further losses .
Under the agreement , U.S. Bank will implement a loan modification program similar to the one the FDIC announced in August stemming from the failure of IndyMac Bank , F.S.B. of Pasadena , Calif .
U.S. Bank currently has 353 offices in California .
Downey Savings and PFF
Bank are not affiliated with each other .
Downey Savings has 170 branches in California and five in Arizona , and PFF Bank has 38 branches in California .
The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund for Downey Savings will be $ 1.4 billion and $ 700 million for PFF Bank .
U.S. Bank 's acquisition of all the deposits of the two institutions was the " least costly " option for the FDIC 's DIF compared to alternatives , the FDIC said in a press release .
These were the 21st and 22nd banks to fail in the U.S. this year , and the fourth and fifth banks to close in California .
Earlier on Friday , the FDIC and Georgia regulators announced the seizure of Loganville , Ga. - based The Community Bank .
It was the 20th bank failure so far this year amid the ongoing financial crisis .
All of The Community Bank 's deposits have been transferred to Tappahannock , Va. - based Bank of Essex , the FDIC said , and all four of The Community Bank 's branches will reopen Monday as Bank of Essex .
The Community Bank had total assets of $ 681 million and total deposits of $ 611.4 million as of Oct. 17 .
Bank of Essex purchased roughly $ 84.4 million of The Community Bank 's assets and paid the FDIC a premium of $ 3.2 million for the right to assume the failed bank 's deposits .
The FDIC said it would retain the remaining assets for later disposition .
The FDIC estimated that The Community Bank 's failure will cost its Deposit Insurance Fund between $ 200 million and $ 240 million .
The Community Bank is the third Georgia - based bank to be closed this year .
Live in your world .
Play in Ours .
So went Sony ’s tagline for Playstation 2 a few years ago , though it is a line that could have been spoken by Muhammad , the Buddha , Shiva , Confucius , or Jesus Christ .
I do n’t say this to be disrespectful to any of the traditions that these great people helped to found , but rather to raise the stakes of what is frequently involved in the pursuit of understanding religions .
Religions cause people to juxtapose worlds , living in some , playing in others , and setting stark contrasts between them .
Sometimes arrogantly , sometimes humbly , religions suggest that , in the words of the late great Christian folk rocker Larry Norman , “ This world is not my home , I ’m just passing through … ”
Or , if you like , in a more secular apocalyptic vein , to croon with Willie Nelson , “ I ’ve just destroyed the world I ’m living in . ”
Flanking Norman , Nelson , and Sony , religions collectively operate through a deep understanding that games are more than detached technological environments , but actually can create a world , even if temporarily , for its players .
The buzz last week was a new board game ( yes , board game , as in folded cardboard tables and dice and cards ) called Playing Gods : The Board Game of Divine Domination .
Following essentially the same strategy as Risk minus the armies , Playing Gods has each player assume the role of a different god or prophet in their attempt to take over the world .
As the game ’s Web site suggests : “ This is done by spreading your believers , converting the followers of other gods , or killing them off with Acts of God . ”
The satiric figurines include a laughing Buddha with an automatic weapon , Moses about to bash someone with stone tablets held high , Muhammad armed with a saber and hand grenade , Jesus wielding a bladed cross , and Kali with a sword , shield , and severed head ( oh , wait , that ’s Kali ’s typical depiction , see left ) .
Carl Raschke , a professor of religious studies at Denver University , claims in USA Today that the new game is “ too stupid to go far , ” and that may be so .
Yet , I think there is much worth investigating in the relation between religious worlds and games , both in their board and video versions .
For those still baffled as to why religion works so well in a modern / postmodern world , games might offer some insight .
Take some of the recent board games that deal with religious themes : Missionary Conquest , BuddhaWheel , The Mahabharata Game , Catholic - opoly and Mormon - opoly ( the goal of the latter two is not to raise houses and hotels to charge rent but , you guessed it , to raise churches and cathedrals in order get more people into the respective congregations ) .
Each game includes some element of conflict along the way : Games would n’t be games without some conflict .
While I ’ve never played it , I love Missionary Conquest ’s write - up .
This is produced by the “ Bible Games Company ” and suggests it is a game of “ laughter and strategy , ” in which one must learn to finance their missionary trips through wise investment .
Competition , strategy , some fortuitous roles of the dice , and we are replaying in microcosm the worlds we are living out in macrocosm .
Video games take the basic concepts of board games and create more comprehensive worlds in three dimensions .
Many games created over the last two decades such as Black & White , Power Monger , Sim Earth and Populous , to name just a few , operate through players taking on the role of a god / dess as they try to gain power in subtle and not - so - subtle ways .
The interest in and influence of these has culminated in the generic tag , “ God Games . ”
Wired magazine ’s “ Senior Maverick , ” Kevin Kelly , was writing about this stuff years ago .
In a chapter on God Games in his 1994 book Out of Control , Kelly muses :
I can’t imagine anything more addictive then being a god .
A hundred years from now nothing will keep us away from artificial cosmos cartridges we can purchase and pop it into a world machine to watch creatures come alive and interact on their own accord .
Godhood is irresistible .
It ’s an intriguing statement for a jacked - in society that regularly re-creates the world on screen in myriad ways , simultaneously feeling the power of doing so .
Life itself thrives on creation , on re-creation , through the ongoing human desire to make something new ( even when using old materials ) , and the equally important need for humans to develop mythologies of master creators : gods and goddesses , as well as monsters and devils .
Like games , religions play in differing worlds , with their own sets of rules , beliefs , and behaviors .
In his book Religious Worlds , religious scholar William Paden suggests how :
Religions do not all inhabit the same world , but actually posit , structure , and dwell within a universe that is their own .
They can be understood not just as so many attempts to explain some common , objectively available order of things that is ‘ out there , ’ but as traditions that create and occupy their own universe .
The fact of the matter is that we religious humans live in multiple worlds with multiple , overlapping , intersecting , and even contradicting conceptions of space and time .
Not everyone understands the here and now to be the year 2008 .
For many Muslims it is now 1429 and for many Jews it ’s 5769 .
And this apocalyptic Mayan thing about December 21 , 2012 only illuminates the creative poverty of Eurocentrism by misunderstanding that “ 2012 ” even exists on a Mayan calendar .
The Mayan calendar represents a different world from that of the modern West ; we may play in it , but we ca n’t really live in it .
The point of all this is that there are multiple , interwoven , concentric worlds that simultaneously exist on the planet earth .
Our neighbors are keeping different calendars , and orient their lives to different gods , goddesses , books , and places .
Worlds — religious worlds especially — are relative .
“ God games ” are basically expressions and representations of what many religious traditions have been doing for a long time .
Through creative or coercive means , convincing others to follow your way / world and not another has been fundamental to Christianity since the time of Constantine , fundamental to Islam since the time of Muhammad , and fundamental to Buddhism since the Bodhi - Dharma left for the East .
There is a certain primal desire to suggest to others that “ my world ” is the right one .
Games , and religions , are about creating ever - new worlds , accompanied by the enticing suggestion to come to my world to play .
If we want to understand religions , we have to understand their game - like qualities , and that religion might , at the heart of it all , be a game .
Which does not make it trivial .
Games can have high stakes .
Games can entrance people to the point of risking much , if not all : cars and condos , wives and lives , fortunes and families .
Games excite , annoy , produce joy and anguish , and take their players to great extremes of emotion and rationality , even as the player may still say “ its only a game . ”
So , here ’s a call to learn about religion by playing games .
And vice versa .
Choice and chance , destruction and creation , role - playing and playing one ’s heart , are all at the center of the worlds that we call religions .
We may live in our world , but play in another .
This is n't the first time we 've seen a micro nuclear reactor , and with the looming energy crisis it probably wo n't be the last .
Designed by scientists at Los Alamos , the Hyperion Power Module will retail for $ 25 million , has no moving parts , is about the size of a hot tub ( less than 5 feet wide ) and should generate enough electricity for about 10,000 homes , running up to ten years before it needs refueled .
And if all that is n't enough , the company claims that the module is meltdown proof ( the small amount of enclosed fuel would immediately cool if ever exposed to open air ) , that the enclosed material is unsuitable for proliferation , and in addition to generating inexpensive power the HPM can be used to purify water .

Pure Male - On -Female Violence Accounts for Only 15 % of Cases of Heterosexual Domestic Violence !
By Mark B. Rosenthal
Our nation 's policies for dealing with the problem of domestic violence are based on the presumption that the vast majority of such violence is perpetrated by violent men against non-violent women .
It turns out that cases of purely male - on - female violence actually account for only 15 % of cases of heterosexual domestic violence .
Fully 50 % of cases involve violence perpetrated by both partners , and surprisingly , 35 % of cases involve purely female - on - male violence .
Furthermore the injury rates for men and women were far closer than most would expect .
45 % of all DV injuries were suffered by men .
Yet organizations receiving government funding to treat battered women commonly promote the belief that 95 % of cases of domestic violence are purely male - on - female .
For example , the YWCA 's webpage at http://www.ywca.org/site/pp.asp?c=djISI6PIKpG&b=297539 states that " In heterosexual relationships , 95 percent of all victims are female ; and 95 percent of all perpetrators are male . "
It is no surprise therefore , that every year domestic violence organizations report that the problem is worse than ever , and ask for more and more money .
Throwing money at a problem to fund a solution that is based on such a profoundly incorrect diagnosis is bound to fail !
The study , by CDC researchers Daniel J. Whitaker , PhD , Tadesse Haileyesus , MS , Monica Swahn , PhD and Linda S. Saltzman , PhD , found that a surprising 70 % of cases of non-reciprocal violence were perpetrated by women .
( To obtain a copy of the study , go to http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/97/5/941.)
The researchers studied 11,370 18 - to 28 - year - olds who had been in a total of 18,761 heterosexual relationships .
They found that about 50 % of cases of intimate partner violence were reciprocal , which they define as " perpetrated by both partners " , and 50 % were non-reciprocal .
Cases of violent women and non-violent men accounted for 70 % of non-reciprocal cases , whereas cases of violent men and non-violent women accounted for 30 % of non-reciprocal cases .
Thus : 50 % of all cases of intimate partner violence among heterosexuals involve violence by both partners
35 % of all cases involve a violent woman and an non-violent man
15 % of all cases involve a violent man and an non-violent woman Table 3 in the journal article on this study provides data on injury rates .
The following data has been excerpted to make it easier to compare male - on - female violence to female - on - male violence in both reciprocal and nonreciprocal cases : TABLE 3 — Weighted Estimates of Violence Frequency and Injury Occurrence

I am writing to you , knowing that you will probably delete this email instantly , to express my opinions and ideas on communism .

Hi Braden , Before I get to your allegations of censorship , I want to clear up a couple of misconceptions .
First , we do not seek to rule a single - party state .
Socialism in the United States will almost certainly involve multiple parties , sharing a basic vision of society even though they differ on how to best implement those principles ( just as most Democrats and Republicans basically agree on capitalism ) .
Second , socialism does n't mean that everyone makes the same amount of money .
It means that the working class , which includes everyone from fast food workers to doctors and engineers , will receive the full value that its labor produces .
Since we 'll no longer have to hand over half of the value we produce to ...
Tirades , meltdowns , outbursts ; call them what you like .
The fact is that none of us can honestly say we ’ve never once lost our cool .
It happens to everyone , and unfortunately for these people , it happened when either a camera or tape machine were rolling .
So I invite you to sit back quietly in your chair and enjoy listening to 10 people totally flying off the handle .
WARNING : the clips herein contain language that may offend .
10 Dennis Green Loses To the Bears
Dennis Green was the usually level - headed coach of the Arizona Cardinals from 2004 to 2006 .
However , he revealed quite a different side to the press after an embarrassing loss to the Chicago Bears in which they blew a 20 - point lead in less than 20 minutes .
The incident was later mocked in a well - known commercial for Coors Light .
9 Ed Harris A Violent Man ?
At a press conference for his film “ A History of Violence ” , Ed Harris kills the laughter in the room by demonstrating his own concept of violence .
The footage has been cropped , so there is seemingly no explanation for his sudden change of character .
8 Bob Dylan Glass in the Street
This clip was taken from the 1965 documentary “ Do n’t Look Back ” .
A casual party in Dylan ’s hotel room turns ugly when someone comes to the door inquiring about glass that has been thrown into the street .
At first the rock icon seems out of line , but then you come to find that he ’s really just concerned that someone might get hurt .
7 Lily Tomlin and David O Russel “ I Heart Huckabees ” Out - Takes
Tensions were certainly high on the set of the film “ I Heart Huckabees ” as seen in this clip .
Actress Lily Tomlin and director David O. Russell had been at odds from the first day of shooting .
Keep your eye on Jason Schwartzman sitting in the chair .
He does n’t even flinch as props go flying right over him !
6 Björk Guðmundsdóttir Reporter Attack
Popstar , actress , trendsetter , and apparently , animal .
Björk ’s primal instincts got the best of her while at the Bangkok International Airport when she assaulted this reporter like a mother bear protecting its young .
Björk later apologized for the incident .
5 Casey Kasem Snuggles
Sometimes the best outbursts are the ones from people who you could never imagine losing their cool .
As is the case with Casey Kasem and the late Snuggles .
4 Bill O’Reilly “ Do It Live ”
Before he had his own show , Bill O’Reilly was an anchor for Inside Edition , and had a decent head of hair to boot .
His behind - the - scenes temper tantrum has been widely circulated since the inception of YouTube , becoming a favorite of liberals and conservatives alike .
3 Buddy Rich Bus Tapes
Buddy
Rich ’s reputation for being a hot head almost eclipses his work as a celebrated jazz drummer , thanks to a series of tapes secretly recorded by his band .
These tapes , which feature explosive tirades of Rich horribly insulting and actually threatening members of his band , eventually fell into the hands of comedians like Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld .
Based on the absurdity of some of Rich ’s “ florid , inspired rants of pure rage ” , certain lines were lifted right out of the tapes and used in dialogue for the Seinfeld show .
2 Michael Richards ( Kramer ) Racist Rant
Speaking of Seinfeld , here is an man who ruined his entire reputation / career in a matter of 3 minutes at a comedy club back in November of 2006 .
Unlike most on this list , there ’s nothing funny about this clip , just shocking footage .
1 Orson Welles Frozen Peas
Once the golden boy of Hollywood , poor Orson Welles was eventually reduced to narrating commercials for a line of TV dinners late in his life .
Welles ’ career might have plummeted , but his ego never did .
In this most infamous clip of them all , Welles is recording his voice - over to a screen showing the corresponding video footage .
+ “ Yes , Always ”
This clip comes from the Pinky & Brain show featured on Animaniacs ( the 7th Most Popular ’ 90s Cartoon ) .
Seeing as how the character of Brain was partially based on Orson Welles himself , it makes sense that the writers would feature a show with Brain doing a word - for - word parody of the Frozen Peas recording .
In the last few weeks , the currency market is where the action has been .
We have witnessed massive moves in every major currency and in some not so major ones .
To my mind , all of this is a prelude to some sort of currency crisis .
This crisis has been sneaking up on us as most of us have been transfixed by the U.S. subprime crisis and the subsequent credit crisis .
For some currencies , it has been a sickening ride .
The U.S. Dollar plunged to 1.60 to the Euro only to snap back viciously to 1.25 .
The U.S. Dollar plummeted to below 2.10 to the British Pound but is now above 1.60 .
All of this in the space of a few months .
But , it is in commodity and emerging market currencies where the trouble is brewing .
First , we saw a nightmarish plunge of the Australian and Kiwi Dollar as commodities plummeted .
This all out assault on commodity and emerging market currencies then widened to include the Icelandic Krona , the South African Rand , the Polish Zloty , the South Korean Won , the Hungarian Forint , and the Mexican Peso amongst others .
This speaks to hot money fleeing emerging markets wholesale as the carry trade started to unwind .
And I have slowly started a drumbeat of concern regarding these events .
However , today , I caught two interesting perspectives on this debacle that made me blanch .
One was the cover story in the Economist .
A few months ago , many emerging economies hoped they could take mass casual leave from the credit crisis .
Their banks operated far from where the blood was being shed .
The economic slowdown evident in America and Europe was regrettable , but central bankers in many emerging economies , such as India and Brazil , were busy engineering slowdowns of their own to reverse high inflation .
They were more interested in the price of oil than the price of interbank borrowing .
This detachment has proved illusory .
The nonchalance of the RBI ’s staff , for example , is not shared by the central bank ’s top brass , who , a day before the strike , cut the bank ’s key interest rate from 9 % to 8 % , having already slashed reserve requirements earlier this month .
Their staff ’s complaint about pensions looked quaint on the day that Argentina ’s government said it would nationalise the country ’s private - pension accounts in what looked to some like a raid to help it meet upcoming debt payments .
The IMF , which has shed staff this year because of the lack of custom , is now working overtime ( see article ) .
The governments of South Korea and Russia have shored up their banking systems .
Their foreign - exchange reserves , $ 240 billion and $ 542 billion respectively , no longer look excessive .
Even China ’s economy is slowing more sharply than expected , growing by 9 % in the year to the third quarter , its slowest rate in five years .
The emerging markets , which as the table shows enter the crisis from very different positions , are vulnerable to the financial crisis in at least three ways .
Their exports of goods and services will suffer as the world economy slows .
Their net imports of capital will also falter , forcing countries that live beyond their means to cut spending .
And even some countries that live roughly within their means have gross liabilities to the rest of the world that are difficult to roll over .
In this third group , the banks are short of dollars even if the country as a whole is not .
– A taxonomy of trouble , Economist
This article makes a compelling argument for expecting emerging markets to be the next leg down in this metastasizing credit crisis .
And the Economist devotes much more space to this emerging problem ( pun intended ) .
But , the analysis penned by Ambrose Evans - Pritchard is what really caught my eye .
He makes the case for us to worry about a full - scale currency crisis worse than the 1931 currency crisis of the Great Depression .
The link : Bank credit .
You can think of Sweden in the Baltics , Austria in Central Europe , Spain in Latin America — and you begin to picture the interconnectedness that will imperil Europe ’s banking system much more than either Japan ’s or America’s .
The financial crisis spreading like wildfire across the former Soviet bloc threatens to set off a second and more dangerous banking crisis in Western Europe , tipping the whole Continent into a fully - fledged economic slump .
Currency pegs are being tested to destruction on the fringes of Europe ’s monetary union in a traumatic upheaval that recalls the collapse of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992 .
“ This is the biggest currency crisis the world has ever seen , ” said Neil Mellor , a strategist at Bank of New York Mellon .
Experts fear the mayhem may soon trigger a chain reaction within the eurozone itself .
The risk is a surge in capital flight from Austria – the country , as it happens , that set off the global banking collapse of May 1931 when Credit - Anstalt went down – and from a string of Club Med countries that rely on foreign funding to cover huge current account deficits .
The latest data from the Bank for International Settlements shows that Western European banks hold almost all the exposure to the emerging market bubble , now busting with spectacular effect .
They account for three - quarters of the total $ 4.7 trillion £ 2.96 trillion ) in cross - border bank loans to Eastern Europe , Latin America and emerging Asia extended during the global credit boom – a sum that vastly exceeds the scale of both the U.S. sub-prime and Alt - A debacles .
Europe has already had its first foretaste of what this may mean .
Iceland ’s demise has left them nursing likely losses of $ 74bn ( £ 47bn ) .
The Germans have lost $ 22bn .
Stephen Jen , currency chief at Morgan Stanley , says the emerging market crash is a vastly underestimated risk .
It threatens to become “ the second epicentre of the global financial crisis ” , this time unfolding in Europe rather than America .
Austria ’s bank exposure to emerging markets is equal to 85 pc of GDP – with a heavy concentration in Hungary , Ukraine , and Serbia – all now queuing up ( with Belarus ) for rescue packages from the International Monetary Fund .
Exposure is 50 pc of GDP for Switzerland , 25 pc for Sweden , 24 pc for the UK , and 23 pc for Spain .
The U.S. figure is just 4 pc .
America is the staid old lady in this drama .
Amazingly , Spanish banks alone have lent $ 316bn to Latin America , almost twice the lending by all U.S. banks combined ( $ 172bn ) to what was once the U.S. backyard .
Hence the growing doubts about the health of Spain ’s financial system – already under stress from its own property crash – as Argentina spirals towards another default , and Brazil ’s currency , bonds and stocks all go into freefall .
Broadly speaking , the U.S. and Japan sat out the emerging market credit boom .
The lending spree has been a European play – often using dollar balance sheets , adding another ugly twist as global “ deleveraging ” causes the dollar to rocket .
Nowhere has this been more extreme than in the ex-Soviet bloc .
The region has borrowed $ 1.6 trillion in dollars , euros , and Swiss francs .
A few dare - devil homeowners in Hungary and Latvia took out mortgages in Japanese yen .
They have just suffered a 40 pc rise in their debt since July .
Nobody warned them what happens when the Japanese carry trade goes into brutal reverse , as it does when the cycle turns .
- Europe on the brink of currency crisis meltdown – Ambrose Evans - Pritchard , Telegraph
When the markets open on Monday , I expect the crisis in Emerging markets to take top priority .
Iceland was the first victim of this crisis .
The dreadful events there should be a warning to policy makers to address this now or else we could see some awful writedowns at European institutions in the very near future — not to mention the potential economic destruction this turmoil could cause .

Nestled deep in the third chapter of the seven piece story in Newsweek about the election , titled How He Did It , is this little nugget :
“ That ’s an interesting belt buckle , ” he said to Michelle , mischievously .
She feigned offense and said , “ I am interesting , next to you .
Surprise , surprise , a blue suit , a white shirt and a tie . ”
Obama grinned and bent down until he was almost at eye level with her waist .
He jabbed a playful finger toward her belt buckle , and let loose his inner nerd .
“ The lithium crystals !
Beam me up , Scotty ! ” Obama squeaked , laughing at his own lame joke as Michelle rolled her eyes .
In part one of the Newsweek piece , there was this :
“ When you have to be cheerful all the time and try to perform and act like [ the tape is unclear ; Obama appears to be poking fun at his opponents ] , I ’m sure that some of it has to do with nerves or anxiety and not having done this before , I ’m sure .
And in my own head , you know , there ’s — I do n’t consider this to be a good format for me , which makes me more cautious .
When you ’re going into something thinking , ‘ This is not my best …’ I often find myself trapped by the questions and thinking to myself , ‘ You know , this is a stupid question , but let me … answer it . ’
Instead of being appropriately [ the tape is garbled ] .
So when Brian Williams is asking me about what ’s a personal thing that you ’ve done [ that ’s green ] , and I say , you know , ‘ Well , I planted a bunch of trees . ’
And he says , ‘ I ’m talking about personal . ’
What I ’m thinking in my head is , ‘ Well , the truth is , Brian , we ca n’t solve global warming because I f–––ing changed light bulbs in my house .
It ’s because of something collective ’ . ”
In the comments to the Beastie Boys thread the other night , someone noted the following :
The wife and I were just saying the other night that we ’re pretty sure Obama listens to the Beastie Boys .
We saw an interview with Jeff Tweedy that taught us that Barack likes Wilco , so that kind of narrows down preferred musical era .
Then , we saw an election eve clip of Obama talking about feeling nervous enough to have a heart attack in which he screwed up the famous Sanford and Son “ I ’m coming Elizabeth ” quote , substituting Weezie for Elizabeth , just as Mike D does on Shazam from To the Five Boroughs !
The evidence is starting to add up .

A social scientist in the Army 's controversial Human Terrain program was en route to Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas after being set on fire in and apparent Taliban attack in Afghanistan .
It 's the third time in five months that a Human Terrain Team member has been killed or seriously wounded .
Paula Lloyd was interviewing locals in the southern village of Maywand on Tuesday as part of her duties in a Human Terrain Team , which embeds civilian cultural experts into U.S. combat units .
She approached a man carrying a fuel jug and they began talking about the price of gas .
Suddenly , the man doused Lloyd in a flammable liquid and set her on fire .
She suffered second - and third - degree burns over 60 percent of her body , a Human Terrain source told Danger Room .
The injuries could have been worse .
Lloyd 's teammate immediately threw her into a nearby water source to douse the flames , then Lloyd was sped to a nearby medical facility .
Fortunately , the first doctor to treat her was a U.S. Army burn specialist .
After being stabilized , Lloyd was evacuated to the military 's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany and is now en route to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio .
Lloyd is in " stable , but guarded condition , " the source said .
The Taliban took credit for the attack on their website .
The Taliban has a long history of setting women on fire as a way of punishing them for perceived immodesty .
This is the latest in a series of attacks on Human Terrain personnel .
In May , Michael Bhatia , an Oxford - trained political scientist working in eastern Afghanistan , was killed , along with two soldiers , by a roadside explosive .
Less than two months later , a bomb detonated inside the Sadr
City District Council building in Iraq .
Social scientist Nicole Suveges was inside .
She and 11 others died instantly .
Each incident has been scarring for the few hundred people in the tightly knit program .
But the casualties are almost certain to continue .
" I mean , it 's a war .
That 's what we 're involved in , " a Human Terrain source says .
The Human Terrain program has come under criticism from within the military for its sloppy hiring practices and uneven battlefield training .
Academic social scientists , meanwhile , have accused the program on being unethical , for blurring the line between civilian researcher and armed combatant .
Over the last year - and - a - half in Iraq and Afghanistan , some of the program 's social scientists have dressed in uniforms that make them virtually indistinguishable from ordinary soldiers ; others have not .
Some have carried weapons ; others move around unarmed .
Lloyd knew Afghanistan well , having worked there previously for the
State Department .
She visited Maywand several times and was " very popular there .
She was accepted very positively throughout the village , " one program official says .
The man who attacked her was " from all appearances a non-belligerent . "
Until he struck .
The attacker was shot dead , and the Army is investigating the incident , according to John Stanton , an independent journalist .

I saw that docu-film Supersize
Me the other week for the first time , and I do n't know about you , but it made me really WANT a McDonalds .
So there was the inspiration to create a truly almighty Supersized Big Mac™ ... the PimpedMac® .
Cost :
800g beef mince : £ 1.24
Special sauce : £ 0.18
½ lettuce : £ 0.32
2 onions : £ 0.16
Cheese slices : £ 0.44
½ jar pickles : £ 0.24
Bun ingredients : £ 0.22
Total cost : £ 2.80
Some years back the McDonald 's corporation was kind enough to tell the entire world exactly what was in a Big Mac™ : " Two all beef patties , special sauce , lettuce , cheese , pickles , onions on a sesame seed bun . "
All quite straightforward really , apart from that exotic - sounding elixir , special sauce .
Just what was so special about the sauce ?
I could see this was going to need a huge research effort to find out .
15 seconds later , thanks to my friend and yours – Google – the first link was TopSecretRecipes.com with the precise consituents of special sauce .
It 's not really that special , but the recipe does point out that like many great cordon bleu recipes it needs several hours in the fridge to let the flavours develop .
So let 's make the sauce first :
The dubious - looking substance is a tablespoon of grated onion ( and if chopping onions makes you cry , you seriously DON'T want to try grating 'em ) .
The rest is 125 ml mayonnaise , 2 tbsp .
French dressing , 4 tsp. pickle , 1 tsp. white vinegar , 1 tsp. sugar and 1/8th tsp. salt .
Into my Happy Bunnies bowl it goes :
It looks so appetising already I had to exercise great self - control to prevent myself from eating it .
The chunks of pickle might have caused texture issues so a quick blast from the blender sorted that out :
A quick taste , and amazingly , it does actually taste quite convincing .
Into the fridge with the special sauce and time now for the Sesame Seed Bun .
Like all self - respecting bread machine owners I have a bread machine recipe book .
Happily it contains a recipe for hamburger buns , with the odd specification that the sesame seeds are " optional " - what 's a Sesame Seed Bun without sesame seeds ?
After 90 minutes of the bread machine 's magic we have a rather pleasing dough :
The recipe allegedly makes 9 rolls , or 3 PimpedMac® layers .
I do n't have baking trays big enough for these babies so on to oiled foil they go .
The substance on the far right of this photo that looks like a bottle of urine is actually sunflower oil .
It 's amazing what flash photography does to colours .
Half an hour to rise ..... so let 's check on the special sauce ..
It appears to be thickening nicely .
This is all going suspiciously well .
After rising , one of the three dough pieces needs brushing with milk and sesame seeds .
If you 're keeping up , you will have deduced that this will form the top layer of the Sesame Seed Bun .
After 12 minutes baking , the bun is done ... a bit mis - shapen perhaps but it all adds to its rustic charm :

I thought this comment from " Jo " deserved a bump to the front page :
The coal trend is consistent with steep increases in other forms of supplementary heating that people can use to save money  most of them less messy than coal .
Home Depot reports that it has sold more than 80,000 tons of pellet fuel , a sort of compressed sawdust , for the season to date .
That is an increase of 137 percent compared with the same period last year , said Jean Niemi , a company spokeswoman .
Image Problematic in some ways and difficult to handle , coal is nonetheless a cheap , plentiful , mined - in - America source of heat .
Credit ... Laura Pedrick for The New York Times
Coal may never make economic sense in areas far from where it is mined .
But in places within reasonable delivery range , the price tends to be stable , compared with heating oil or natural gas .
Prices for natural gas more than tripled in recent years before plunging in the last few months amid the downturn .
Coals vary in quality , but on average , a ton of coal contains about as much potential heat as 146 gallons of heating oil or 20,000 cubic feet of natural gas , according to the Energy Information Administration .
A ton of anthracite , a particularly high grade of coal , can cost as little as $ 120 near mines in Pennsylvania .
The equivalent amount of heating oil would cost roughly $ 380 , based on the most recent prices in the state  and over $ 470 using prices from December 2007 .
An equivalent amount of natural gas would cost about $ 480 at current prices .
Mr. Buck said he could buy coal for $ 165 a ton .
On a blustery afternoon recently , he was still studying the manual for his $ 2,300 Alaska Channing stoker , which gave off an intense heat in the den .
An automated hopper in the back slowly dispensed fine anthracite coal chips into the stove ’s belly , and every couple of days , Mr. Buck emptied the ash .
He said he hoped the stove would cut his oil consumption in half .
“ Now , somewhere , you ’ve got to take into account the convenience of turning up your thermostat , versus having two tons of coal to shovel and the hopper and ashes to deal with , ” Mr. Buck said .
But if the $ 330 worth of coal in his makeshift bin “ heats the house for the winter , ” he added , “ you ca n’t beat it . ”
Wesley Ridlington , a homeowner in Fairbanks , Alaska , bought an outdoor coal furnace for $ 13,000 in March and uses it as his main source for heat and hot water .
As the 150th anniversary of the publication of “ On The Origin of Species ” approaches , the moment has come to ask how Darwin ’s insights can be used profitably by policymakers
Illustration by Noma Bar
WEALTH , according to H.L. Mencken , an American satirist of the last century , “ is any income that is at least $ 100 more a year than the income of one 's wife 's sister 's husband . ”
Adjusted for inflation since 1949 , that is not a bad definition .
But why do those who are already well - off feel the need to out - earn other people ?
And why , contrariwise , is it so hard to abolish poverty ?
America , Mencken 's homeland , executes around 40 people a year for murder .
Yet it still has a high murder rate .
Why do people murder each other when they are almost always caught and may , in America at least , be killed themselves as a result ?
Why , after 80 years of votes for women , and 40 years of the feminist revolution , do men still earn larger incomes ?
And why do so many people hate others merely for having different coloured skin ?
Traditionally , the answers to such questions , and many others about modern life , have been sought in philosophy , sociology , even religion .
But the answers that have come back are generally unsatisfying .
They describe , rather than explain .
They do not get to the nitty - gritty of what it truly is to be human .
Policy based on them does not work .
This is because they ignore the forces that made people what they are : the forces of evolution .
The reasons for that ignorance are complex .
Philosophers have preached that there exists between man and beast an unbridgeable distinction .
Sociologists have been seduced by Marxist ideas about the perfectibility of mankind .
Theologians have feared that the very thought of evolution threatens divine explanations of the world .
Even fully paid - up members of the Enlightenment , people who would not for a moment deny humanity 's simian ancestry , are often sceptical .
They seem to believe , as Anne Campbell , a psychologist at Durham University , in England , elegantly puts it , that evolution stops at the neck : that human anatomy evolved , but human behaviour is culturally determined .
The corollary to this is the idea that with appropriate education , indoctrination , social conditioning or what have you , people can be made to behave in almost any way imaginable .
The evidence , however , is that they cannot .
The room for shaping their behaviour is actually quite limited .
Unless that is realised , and the underlying biology of the behaviour to be shaped is properly understood , attempts to manipulate it are likely to fail .
Unfortunately , even as the 150th anniversary of Darwin 's masterwork , “ On The Origin of Species ” , approaches ( it was published in 1859 ) that fact has not been properly accepted .
Time , then , to see what a Darwinian analysis has to offer the hard - pressed policymaker , and whether it can make a practical difference to outcomes .
Mencken 's observation neatly explains two aspects of modern life .
One is the open - endedness of economic growth .
The other is that no matter how rich your country becomes , the poor you will always have with you .
But what explains Mencken 's observation ?
For a Darwinian , life is about two things : survival and reproduction .
Of the two , the second is the more significant .
To put it crudely , the only Darwinian point of survival is reproduction .
As a consequence , much of daily existence is about showing off , subtly or starkly , in ways that attract members of the opposite sex and intimidate those of the same sex .
In humans — unlike , say , peafowl , where only the cocks have the flashy tails , or deer , where only the stags have the chunky antlers — both sexes engage in this .
Men do it more than women , but you need look no further than Ascot race course on Gold Cup day to see that women do it too .
Status and hierarchy matter .
And in modern society , status is mediated by money .
Girls have always liked a rich man , of course .
Darwinians used to think this was due to his ability to provide materially for their children .
No doubt that is part of it .
But the thinking among evolutionary biologists these days is that what is mainly going on is a competition for genes , not goods .
High - status individuals are more likely to have genes that promote health and intelligence , and members of the opposite sex have been honed by evolution to respond accordingly .
A high - status man will get more opportunities to mate .
A high - status woman can be more choosy about whom she mates with .
Life is about survival and reproduction
For men , at least , this is demonstrably true .
Evolutionary biologists are fond of quoting extreme examples to make the point , the most famous being Moulay Ismail the Bloodthirsty , a Moroccan ruler who fathered over 1,000 children .
But kings have powers of coercion .
Some better examples are provided by Joe Studwell , in his book “ Asian Godfathers ” , which dissects the lives of businessmen .
Stanley Ho , a veteran operator in Hong Kong and Macau , has 17 children by several women .
Oei Tiong Ham , a tycoon who died in 1924 , had 18 concubines and 42 children .
The relationship holds good further down the social ladder .
Danile Nettle and Thomas Pollet , of Newcastle University , recently showed that in Britain the number of children a man has fathered is , on average , related to his income , the spread of modern contraception notwithstanding .
Status , though , is always relative : it is linked to money because it drives the desire to make more of the stuff in order to outdo the competition .
This is the ultimate engine of economic growth .
Since status is a moving target , there is no such thing as enough money .
The relative nature of status explains the paradox observed in 1974 by an economist called Richard Easterlin that , while rich people are happier than poor people within a country , average happiness does not increase as that country gets richer .
This has been disputed recently .
But if it withstands scrutiny it means the free - market argument — that because economic growth makes everybody better off , it does not matter that some are more better off than others — does not stand up , at least if “ better off ” is measured in terms of happiness .
What actually matters , Darwinism suggests , is that a free society allows people to rise through the hierarchy by their own efforts : the American dream , if you like .
Conversely , the Darwinian explanation of continued support for socialism — in the teeth of evidence that it results in low economic growth — is that even though making the rich poorer would not make the poor richer in financial terms , it would change the hierarchy in ways that people at the bottom would like .
When researchers ask people whether they would rather be relatively richer than their peers even if that means they are absolutely worse off , the answer is yes .
( Would you rather earn $ 100,000 when all your friends earn $ 50,000 , or $ 150,000 when everybody else earns $ 300,000 ? )
The reason socialism does not work in practice is that this is not a question that most people ask themselves .
What they ask is how to earn $ 300,000 when all around them people are earning $ 50,000 .
A Darwinian analysis does , however , support one argument frequently made by the left and pooh - poohed by the right .
This is that poverty is relative .
The starkest demonstration of this , discovered by Richard Wilkinson of Nottingham University , in England , is that once economic growth has lifted a country out of penury , its inhabitants are likely to live longer , healthier lives if there are not huge differences between their incomes .
This means that poorer countries with low income- variation can outscore richer ones with high variation .
It is also true , as was first demonstrated by Michael Marmot , of University College , London , that those at the bottom of social hierarchies have worse health than those at the top — even when all other variables are statistically eliminated , including the fact that those who are healthier are more likely to rise to the top in the first place .
In the 1970s , when Dr Marmot made this observation , expert opinion predicted the opposite .
Executives were expected to suffer worse stress than groundlings , and this was expected to show up as heart attacks , strokes and so forth .
In fact , the opposite is true .
It is the Darwinian failure of being at the bottom of the heap that is truly stressful and bad for the health .
That , writ large , probably explains the mortality patterns of entire countries .
In this case , therefore , the Darwinian conclusion is that there is no right answer — or at least no Utopian one .
Of course , it does not take a Darwinist to work out that any competition has losers .
The illuminating point is that losing has a real cost , not just the absence of gain .
With the stakes this high — early death for the failures and genetic continuity for the successes — it is hardly surprising that those at the bottom of the heap sometimes seek status , or at least “ respect ” , in other ways .
This is a point that should be taken seriously by policymakers .
For those “ other ways ” are also explicable by Darwinism .
That crime is selfish is hardly news .
But the idea that criminal behaviour is an evolved response to circumstances sounds shocking .
It calls into question the moral explanation that crime is done by “ bad people ” .
Yet that explanation is itself susceptible to Darwinian analysis : evolution probably explains why certain behaviours are deemed worthy of punishment .
The study of the evolutionary roots of crime began with the work of Martin Daly and Margo Wilson , a married couple who work at McMaster University in Canada .
They looked at what is usually regarded as the most serious crime of all , murder .
That murderers are usually young men is well known , but Dr Daly and Dr Wilson dug a bit deeper .
They discovered that although the murder rate varies from place to place , the pattern does not .
Plot the rate against the age of the perpetrator and the peak is the same ( see chart ) .
Moreover , the pattern of the victims is similar .
They , too , are mostly young men .
In the original study , 86 % of the victims of male killers aged between 15 and 19 were also male .
This is the clue as to what is going on .
Most violence ( and thus most murder , which is simply violence 's most extreme expression ) is a consequence of competition between young , unemployed , unmarried men .
In the view of Darwinists , these men are either competing for women directly ( “ You looking at my girl , Jimmy ? ” ) or competing for status ( “ You dissing me , man ? ” ) .
This is not to deny that crimes of violence are often crimes of poverty ( for which read low status ) .
But that is precisely what Darwinism would predict .
There is no need to invoke the idea that people are “ born criminal ” .
All that is required is the evolution of enough behavioural flexibility to respond appropriately when violence is ( or would have been , in the evolutionary past ) an appropriate response .
Crime …
An evolutionary analysis explains many things about crime ( and not just murder ) — particularly why most criminals are males of low status .
A woman will rarely have difficulty finding a mate , even if he does not measure up to all her lofty ideals .
In the world of Moulay Ismail the Bloodthirsty , however , a low - status man may be cast on the reproductive scrap heap because there are no women available to him at all .
Though the world in which humanity evolved was nowhere near as polygamous as Moulay Ismail 's , neither did it resemble the modern one of monogamous marriage , which distributes women widely .
In those circumstances , if the alternative was reproductive failure , risking the consequences of violence may have been are worth the gamble — and instincts will have evolved accordingly .
For similar reasons , it is no surprise to Darwinists that those who rape strangers are also men of low status .
Oddly , considering it is an act that might result in a child , the idea that rape is an evolved behaviour is even more controversial than the Darwinian explanation of murder .
Randy Thornhill of the University of New Mexico , who proposed it on the basis of criminal data and by comparing people with other species , was excoriated by feminists who felt he was somehow excusing the crime .
On the other hand , it has become a mantra among some feminists that all men are rapists , which sounds a lot like the opposite point of view : biological determinism .
Insert the word “ potential ” , however , and this claim is probably true .
To a Darwinist , the most common form of forced mating , so - called date rape , which occurs in an already charged sexual environment , looks a lot like an adaptive response .
Men who engage in it are likely to have more offspring than those who do not .
If a genetic disposition for men to force their attentions on women in this way does exist , it would inevitably spread .
Sexual success , by contrast , tends to dampen criminal behaviour down .
Getting married and having children — in other words , achieving at least part of his Darwinian ambition — often terminates a criminal 's career .
Again , that is a commonplace observation .
However , it tends to be explained as “ the calming influence of marriage ” , which is not really an explanation at all .
“ Ambition fulfilled ” is a better one .

The murder of children , too , can be explained evolutionarily .
On the face of things it makes no sense to kill the vessels carrying your genes into the next generation .
And , indeed , that is not what usually happens .
But sociologists failed to notice this .
It was not until Dr Daly and Dr Wilson began researching the field that it was discovered that a child under five is many times more likely to die an unnatural death in a household with a stepfather present ( whether or not that relationship has been formalised by law ) than if only biological parents are there .
In this , humans follow a pattern that is widespread in mammals : male hostility to a female 's offspring from previous matings .
In some species , such as lions and langurs , this results in deliberate infanticide .
In humans things not are always as brutal and explicit .
But neglect and a low threshold of irritation at the demands of a dependent non-relative can have the same effect .
Intriguingly , though , if a genetic parent is the killer it is often the mother .
Infanticidal mothers are usually young .
A young mother has many years of potential reproduction ahead of her .
If circumstances do not favour her at the time ( perhaps the father has deserted her ) the cost to her total reproductive output of bringing up a child may exceed the risk of killing it .
Not surprisingly , maternal infanticide is mainly a crime of poor , single women .
Many people might sympathise with those driven to commit this particular form of homicide .
But in general crimes such as murder and rape provoke a desire to punish the perpetrators , not to forgive them .
That , too , is probably an evolved response — and it may well be a uniquely human one .
No court sits in judgment over a drake who has raped a duck .
A lioness may try to defend her cubs against infanticide , but if she fails she does not plan vengeance against the male who did it .
Instead , she usually has sex with him .
Yet ideas of revenge and punishment lie deep in the human psyche .
… and punishment
Economists were long puzzled , for example , by the routine outcome of a game in which one player divides a sum of money between himself and a competitor , who then decides whether the shares are fair .
If the second player decides the shares are not fair , neither player gets anything .
What is curious about this game is that , in order to punish the first player for his selfishness , the second player has deliberately made himself worse off by not accepting the offer .
Many evolutionary biologists feel that the sense of justice this illustrates , and the willingness of one player to punish the other , even at a cost to himself , are among the things that have allowed humans to become such a successful , collaborative species .
In the small social world in which humans evolved , people dealt with the same neighbours over and over again .
Punishing a cheat has desirable long - term consequences for the person doing the punishing , as well as for the wider group .
In future , the cheat will either not deal with him or will do so more honestly .
Evolution will favour the development of emotions that make such reactions automatic .
What goes for cheating goes for other bad behaviour , up to and including the murder of relatives and friends .
Moreover , if publicly observed , punishment sends the same message to those who might be considering a similar course of action .
It is therefore one of the marvels of civilisation that punishment and revenge have , for the most part , been institutionalised .
But to be successful , the institutionalised punishment has to be seen as a proper outcome by the individuals who were harmed .
Otherwise , they might mete out their own revenge .
That may worry those who believe that reforming the criminal should be the main goal of sentencing policy .
If people no longer believe that the punishment fits the crime , a Darwinian would predict that they will stop supporting the criminal - justice system .
Even deterrence , however , does not always work .
On the face of things , capital punishment ought to be the ultimate deterrent .
But it does not seem to be .
Satoshi Kanazawa , an evolutionary psychologist at the London School of Economics , suggests that this is further evidence of the reproduction - related nature of murder .
Since failure to reproduce is a Darwinian dead - end anyway , risking death to avoid that fate — or , rather , being impelled to do so in the heat of the moment by an evolved instinct — is not as stupid as it looks .
Some sorts of murder might be discouraged by the threat of the noose or the needle .
But not the most common sort : young man on young man over status and sex .
A woman 's place
Crime , then , is one field in which women are unequal with men .
That does not bother feminists , but perhaps it should .
For it might reflect a wider truth which those who believe that the sexes should not merely have equal rights but enjoy equal outcomes will find uncomfortable .
When outcomes are unequal in socially acceptable areas of behaviour , such as employment , it is often interpreted as a sign of discrimination .
But people who draw this conclusion rarely consider that the discrimination in question might actually be being exercised by the supposedly disadvantaged women themselves .
A classic example is income .
Women earn less than men .
Or do they ?
In fact , younger women do not , or not much .
A recent report by the Institute of Economic Affairs ( IEA ) , a British think - tank , found that British women aged between 22 and 29 who were in full - time employment earned only 1 % less than their male counterparts .
This age group corresponds for many women to the period when they are single .
Once they have found the best available mate , the calculation changes : a woman no longer needs to show off .
In that context , it is less of a surprise that older women are out - earned by their male contemporaries .
One reason is that they now care less about the size of their earnings .
Of the top 25 ideal employers , as chosen by women , the IEA found that 12 were in the public or voluntary sectors — areas where salaries for equivalent work tend to be lower than in the private sector , though job security is higher and job satisfaction is often believed to be greater .
For men , only four employers were in this category .
The other reason , of course , is that women usually look after the children .
Indeed , the study by Dr Nettle and Dr Pollet which found that reproductive success correlates with men's income , also points out that with women the correlation is inverted .
But the IEA study also found that it is women themselves who are taking the decisions about child care .
It reports that two - thirds of the women who had not already had a “ career break ” , as it is euphemistically known , planned to take one at some point in the future .
Less than an eighth of men had similar aspirations .
That , too , would be predicted by a Darwinist .
Although there is a strong argument for making working conditions more sympathetic to the needs of parents of both sexes , the underlying point is that many women — and certainly many women with children — do not care as much about striving ahead in their careers as men do .
Men , the report found , are more motivated by pay and less by job satisfaction than women are .
If managers , they are more likely to work long hours .
They also take more risks — or , at least , are more frequently injured at work .
The consequence , as Len Shackleton , the IEA report 's main author , puts it , is that : “ The widespread belief that the gender pay gap is a reflection of deep - rooted discrimination by employers is ill - informed and an unhelpful contribution to the debate .
The pay gap is falling but is also a reflection of individuals ' lifestyle preferences .
Government can't regulate or legislate these away , and should n't try to . ”
He failed to add , however , that these preferences are often the result of biological differences between the sexes .
What goes for pay probably goes for career choice as well .
At one extreme , it is foolish , as Kingsley Browne of Wayne State University , in Michigan , suggests , to expect equal outcomes in organisations like the armed forces .
Not only are men stronger and more aggressive but , Mr Browne suggests , the psychology of both sexes has evolved to trust men ( and not trust women ) in combat , precisely because of this aggression and strength .
At the other end of the scale , it is probably an opposite mixture of evolved aptitudes and attitudes that causes the domination by females of professions such as nursing .
This is not to say there can be no good female soldiers or male nurses .
Patently , there can .
But it is not clear evidence of discrimination that they are rarer than their counterparts of the opposite sex .
A Darwinian analysis of the matter cannot say where the equilibrium would lie in a world free from discrimination .
But it can say with reasonable confidence that this equilibrium will often not be 50/50 .
Many may harrumph at such a Darwinian interpretation of feminism , and say that it is a circuitous route to a traditional destination .
It is n't : not expecting an equal distribution of the sexes within every profession is not the same as saying that a woman 's place is in the home .
And having dared to question the assumptions of both feminists and their opponents , some evolutionary biologists are now hoping to turn conventional wisdom upside down in another area where civil rights meet long - standing prejudice .
This is the vexed question of race .
Race to the finish
Racial difference is an area where modern Darwinists have feared , until recently , to tread .
This is hardly surprising , given the topic 's history .
Many early evolutionary biologists ( though not Darwin himself ) thought that just as man was a risen ape , so white , European man was the zenith of humanity , and that people from other parts of the world were necessarily inferior .
The consequences of that have been terrible .
It gave a veneer of intellectual respectability to the eugenic horrors which culminated in the Nazi death camps .
Indeed , it is probably one of the roots of the “ evolution stops at the neck ” point of view .
But evolutionary biology is now making amends .
By overturning understanding of what race actually is , it may yet provide the tools that allow people of different backgrounds to live in reasonable harmony .
Revenge and punishment lie deep in the human psyche
Its first observation is a bleak one .
This is that racism , or at least xenophobia , is a deeply ingrained human characteristic .
But its second observation is that , so far as can be determined , the traditional definition of race — the tendency of people living in different parts of the world to have different skin colour , hair colour and physiognomy — has no wider ramifications in areas such as intelligence .
Racial prejudice , then , is just that : prejudice .
What is being proposed instead , by another husband and wife team of Darwinists , Leda Cosmides and John Tooby of the University of California , Santa Barbara , is a theory of ethnicity that explains the mishmash of categories anthropologists have tried to shoehorn into the general class of “ race ” .
Are Jews and Sikhs , who are defined by religious exclusivity , races ?
Are Serbs and Croats , who share their religions with others , but not with each other , and whom no geneticist could tell apart ?
These examples , and similar ones , argue that race has no biological meaning .
But it does .
It is just not the traditional meaning .
Social psychologists have long observed that , on first meeting , people automatically classify each other in three ways : by sex , by age and by race .
But Dr Cosmides and Dr Tooby pointed out that before long - distance transport existed , only two of those would have been relevant .
People of different ages and sexes would meet ; people of different races would not .
The two researchers argue that modern racial discrimination is an overstimulated response to what might be called an “ alliance ” detector in the human brain .
In a world where the largest social unit is the tribe , clan or what - you - will of a few hundred people , your neighbours and your other allies will normally look a lot like you , and act similarly .
However , it is known from the study of modern hunter - gatherers , and inferred from archaeological evidence about ancient ones , that neighbouring tribes are often hostile .
Though an individual might reasonably be expected to know many members of his tribe personally , he would probably not know them all .
There would thus be a biological advantage in tribal branding , as it were .
Potential allies would quickly identify what marked them out from others , and what marked others out from them — and , because those differences would probably be small , the detector would need to be very sensitive .
In the past , such markers would often have been cultural , since local physical differences would have been minimal .
A telling instance is recorded in the Bible :
Then said they unto him , Say now Shibboleth : and he said Sibboleth : for he could not frame to pronounce it right .
Then they took him and slew him .
The questioners were the Gileadites .
The slain , an Ephraimite .
But no physical difference could distinguish the tribes , so the Gileadite ethnic - cleansers had to rely on linguistic tics .
In a world where a syllable can get you killed , having differently coloured skin is a pretty strong brand of identity .
However , it is not a unique signal .
Experiments that Dr Cosmides , Dr Tooby and their students have conducted in both America and Brazil ( another racially mixed country ) suggest it is surprisingly easy to rebrand even people of different skin colour by making other badges of allegiance more significant — as happens when sportsmen clothe themselves in coloured team shirts .
Moreover , Andrew Penner of the University of California , Irvine , and Aliya Saperstein of the University of Oregon have shown that perception of a person 's race can actually change in the real world .
Many people shift from being “ white ” to “ black ” , in both their own eyes and the eyes of others , in response to unemployment , impoverishment or imprisonment .
That is an uncomfortable reminder of the way group solidarity works in America .
The hope this analysis brings , though , is that there is nothing particularly special about biologically based brands such as skin colour .
If other brands of group membership can be strengthened , the traditional ones may diminish , even if they do not disappear completely .
If this theory of race is correct ( and more research is certainly needed ) , it indicates a strong prescription : policies that encourage groups to retain their identity within a society will cause trouble , but those that encourage cultural integration will smooth things over .
In practice , the history of that most racially mixed country of all , the United States , supports this idea .
When integration has been encouraged , as with the descendants of the great flood of European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , ethnic distinctions have vanished .
When integration has been discouraged , as with the descendants of slaves liberated shortly before those European immigrants arrived , differences have been sharpened .
Even in Britain , official policy seems to be shifting from “ multiculturalism ” , which celebrated diversity and thus encouraged distinction , to a deliberate attempt to forge a cultural consensus .
What the brand theory of ethnicity does not require , however , is that minorities submit to the majority 's definition of what the brands should be .
All that is needed is for each generation to be encouraged to form its own identity from the widest range of materials possible .

A Darwinian analysis thus sheds light on a number of pressing questions .
There are others .
The rise of metabolic syndrome ( obesity plus high blood - pressure equals diabetes plus heart disease ) seems to Darwinists the consequence of people trying to sate appetites for sugar and fat that evolution put no brakes on because they were so rare in the natural world .
Pretending young adults are children so that they can be educated en masse in schools is another area ripe for investigation .
And the refusal of people to adhere to the patterns of behaviour prescribed for them by classical economics has already spun off a field called behavioural economics that often has Darwinian thinking at its roots .
No one is suggesting Darwinism has all the answers to social questions .
Indeed , with some , such as the role of hierarchies , it suggests there is no definitive answer at all — itself an important conclusion .
What is extraordinary , though , is how rarely an evolutionary analysis is part of the process of policymaking .
To draw an analogy , it is like trying to fix a car without properly understanding how it works : not impossible , but as likely as not to result in a breakdown or a crash .
Perhaps , after a century and a half , it is time not just to recognise but also to understand that human beings are evolved creatures .
To know thyself is , after all , the beginning of wisdom .

Conservative senator : Paulson may have given bailout money to friends Muriel Kane
Published : Monday November 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Sen. James Inhofe ( R - OK ) is making waves by criticizing Treasury Secretary Paulson 's handling of the bailout and saying that Congress should take back whatever is left of the $ 700 billion " blank check " it issued to the Bush administration in October .
In a letter posted on his website , Inhofe told his Senate colleagues that he intends to push for immediate legislation that would require Congressional authorization for any further payouts .
The ultra -conservative Oklahoma Republican told the Tulsa World , " It is just outrageous that the American people do n't know that Congress does n't know how much money [ Paulson ] has given away to anyone .
...
It could be to his friends .
It could be to anybody else .
We do n't know .
There is no way of knowing .
...
He was able to get this authority from Congress predicated on what he was going to do , and then he did n't do it . "
Paulson is a former CEO of the giant investment banking firm Goldman Sachs , which is assumed to be a primary beneficiary of the bailout plan .
ThinkProgress warned in September , " The conflict of interest provides all the more reason for the bailout legislation in Congress to have more stringent oversight that the administration opposes . "
Inhofe notes that he himself was also skeptical about the bailout from the start .
" I have learned a long time ago , " he said , " when they come up and say this has to be done and has to be done immediately , there is no other way of doing it , you have to sit back and take a deep breath and nine times out of 10 they are not telling the truth .
And this is one of those nine times . "
The Bible- citing , anti-gay Inhofe has been known primarily as an over - the - top global warming denier and supporter of so - called " enhanced interrogation , " and his opposition to the Bush administration on the bailout brings him some strange bedfellows .
On Monday , blogger Atrios quoted Inhofe 's comments about Paulson under the heading , " That 's crazy talk .
Only insane liberal bloggers say stuff like this . "
It 's hard to find something not impacted by our current financial crisis .
Here are 12 examples of what the recession means for specific things , from Spam to sex addiction .
1. Spam
It looks like meat , it tastes like meat , but it 's a far cheaper substitute for meat .
It 's Spam !
And it 's booming .
Though Hormel 's share price has fallen with the overall market , Spam sales are soaring as the economic crisis leaves consumers strapped for cash .
Interestingly enough , Spam , the " crazy tasty " mix of ham , pork , sugar , salt , potato starch and a sodium nitrite , was invented during the Great Depression and became a staple for Allied troops overseas in the 1940s .
2. Marriage and Divorce
Breaking up is hard to do , especially in this economy .
While it may be too early to know the impact of the crisis on divorce rates , it appears divorces may have slowed down since the financial crisis began .
That 's because despite most arguments being over financial issues , it may just be too expensive to pay the legal fees of a divorce and support two households .
In fact , during the Great Depression , divorce rates dropped sharply , though they picked back up immediately thereafter .
3. Recycling
The plunge in commodity prices has taken a toll on recyclers .
In fact , the whole movement may come to a halt as oil and metal prices fall .
Used newspaper , used cardboard , and scrap metal prices have also seen a drop , partially due to dwindling home construction and slower automobile production .
Some recyclers are closing their doors , and in the UK entire city councils are abandoning their recycling efforts , as they are no longer economically feasible .
4. Psychics
" There is no rhyme or reason to the way the market is trading , "  says a personal trader .
" When conditions are this volatile , consulting a psychic can be as good a strategy as any other . " 
Psychics , astrologers , palm readers and " professional advice - givers " say business is booming as clients come to them seeking financial guidance .
Clients will typically pay $ 75 to $ 1000 for an hour 's worth of insight !
5. Holiday Parties
Just as you suspected , companies are cutting back on their holiday galas .
ABC News announced the cancellation of its annual celebration .
American Express did the same and then some " “ announcing the cancellation of 2009 's celebration as well .
But what about the caterers ?
56 % of party planners say that their corporate holiday party numbers will be off more than 10 % this year compared to last .
They 're scrambling to come up with innovative , more somber types of gatherings like luncheons , pot-lucks , and receptions rather than galas , caviar , and glam .
6. Used Car Sales
The used car business is flourishing !
Specifically , used car companies that offer buy - here / pay - here financing for lower credit individuals who have been locked out of traditional lending .
But if used is n't your thing , it may still be a decent time to buy new .
That 's because even steady growth car makers like Honda and Toyota have seen 24 % and 32 % declines , respectively .
Car dealers are desperate to get rid of inventory and are offering invoice and below invoice prices .
Look for dealers that have a lot of inventory , because they 'll likely offer the best deals .
7. Iceland Tourism
Looking for a good holiday or spring trip ?
Look to Iceland !
Once an economic success story , this small country is now , well , bankrupt .
If you were attune to Fannie and Freddie and the big Wall Street break - up , you may have missed Iceland 's fall .
Its three largest banks were oversized and highly leveraged , and seemed ready for collapse in early October .
Iceland 's currency , the krona , is essentially valueless , and foreign trade has come to a halt .
Luckily , the IMF and its Nordic neighbors have stepped in , lending $ 2.1 billion and $ 2.5 billion respectively to help the country recover .
But tourism appears to be on the rise .
Airfare search engines report a 400 % increase in Iceland flight searches .
A recent search of round - trip flights from New York found tickets at a record low of $ 471 .
8. College Endowments
Ivy League schools are n't immune to the financial crisis .
Since many college endowments are invested in alternative asset classes , which have lost value , they 're seeing unprecedented losses .
Many college and university endowments are projected to have decreased by 30 % this fiscal year .
For Harvard , that may mean an $ 11 billion drop .
That may mean a decrease in financial aid " “ especially because lenders can no longer sell their securitized loans in the secondary market to get new money to offer new student loans .
Despite Congress ' Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans
Act of 2008 , which authorizes the Education Department to buy federal student loans from education lenders for the 2008 - 09 and 2009 - 10 school years , there 's a chance financial aid may fall short .
9. Lipstick & Hosiery Sales
The Lipstick Indicator is an economic theory proposed by Leonard Lauder , the chairman of EstÃ©e Lauder Companies .
The theory states that a direct relation exists between rising sales in tubes of lipstick and a falling financial market " “ the worse the economy , the more women indulge in small purchases , like $ 10 tubes of lipstick .
There are conflicting reports as to whether Lauder 's theory is holding up this downturn .
Perhaps hosiery sales will supplant lipstick as the indicator of choice .
Overall hosiery sales rose 2.3 % this year , with Spanx seeing a 77 % increase in sales compared to last year .
10 . NASCAR
Very few sports have been hit harder by the economic crisis than NASCAR .
From ticket sales to souvenir sales to team sponsorship from large companies , racing is reeling .
That 's because an average NASCAR team relies on corporate sponsors for 80 % of its budget .
That 's four times the percentage of an NFL franchise 's budget .
And many of those corporate sponsors , including the Big Three " “ GM spent $ 578 M in sports advertising in 2007 , including NASCAR " “ are facing high - profile hard times of their own .
As a result , some NASCAR teams , including Chip Ganassi Racing and Dale Earnhardt Inc. , have merged in an attempt to attract corporate sponsors .
11 . Personal Maintenance
According to the International Health , Racquet and Sportsclub Association , gym memberships have been on the decline since 2007 .
There 's no sign that these former gymrats are instead opting for cosmetic surgery " “ 53 % of plastic surgeons of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery say business has slowed .
12 . Sex & Sex Addiction
Will the financial crisis spark a baby boom ?
It just might .
According to the Telegraph , sales of sex toys , pregnancy tests , maternity clothes , and baby equipment are soaring .
But that 's not the only place sex may have increased .
Jonathan Alpert , a Manhattan psychotherapist , has seen a big jump in the number of Wall Street workers who seek help for the sex addictions .
Apparently , the economic crisis has sparked " maladaptive coping mechanisms " among bankers , according to Jodi Conway , a sex addiction therapist in New Jersey .

Finnish police admit they did not expect to use an insect to solve a crime
Police in Finland believe they have caught a car thief from a DNA sample taken from a mosquito they noticed inside an abandoned vehicle .
Finding the car in Seinaejoki , north of Helsinki , police saw that the mosquito had recently sucked blood and decided to send the insect for analysis .
The DNA found from laboratory tests matched a man on the police register .
The suspect denies stealing the car and says he was just hitch - hiking a lift with a man .
The car was stolen in June in the town of Lapua , some 380 km ( 235 miles ) north of the Finnish capital , the AFP news agency reports .
It was recovered several weeks later in Seinaejoki , about 25 km from where it disappeared .
Sakari Palomaeki , the police inspector in charge of the case , said it was the first time Finnish police had used an insect to solve a crime .
" It is not usual to use mosquitoes .
In training we were not told to keep an eye on mosquitoes at crime scenes , " he said .
" It is not easy to find a small mosquito in a car , this just shows how thorough the crime scene investigation was , " he added .
A prosecutor must now decide if the sample is strong enough for charges to be pressed .
The former defence chief , who said that he believed the campaign had been successful , was also critical of the US and British governments for failing to " understand fully " the complexity of the situation in Iraq and to create a proper reconstruction plan .
Infamous prosecutor Ken Starr has filed a legal brief -- on behalf of the " Yes on 8 " campaign -- to nullify the 18,000 same - sex marriages performed in California between May and November of 2008 .
Yes , they really did go there after promising repeatedly not to do this .
It 's time to put a face to Ken Starr 's shameful legal proceedings .
To put a face to the 18,000 couples facing forcible divorce .
To put a face to marriage equality .
Because , gay or straight , YOU are the face of the Marriage Equality Movement .

Former Lehman Chief Executive Richard Fuld testifies at a hearing held by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Capitol Hill in Washington October 6 , 2008 .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Prosecutors have stepped up the investigation into the collapse of Lehman Brothers , with at least a dozen subpoenas being issued including one to the investment bank ’s chief executive , Richard Fuld , The New York Times reported on Saturday .
Citing people close to the probe who requested anonymity , the Times said federal prosecutors in Brooklyn , Manhattan and New Jersey were examining events leading to Lehman ’s collapse and bankruptcy filing .
One person said New Jersey prosecutors were looking into whether Lehman executives including Fuld misled investors involved in the $ 6 billion infusion of capital announced by Lehman in June about the bank ’s condition , the Times said .
That infusion came as Lehman disclosed a $ 2.8 billion third - quarter loss , which caused its shares to plunge .
The Times said the New Jersey Division of Investment , which put money into the capital raising , had been subpoenaed , and that the division ’s director did not return a call seeking comment .
Brooklyn and Manhattan prosecutors meanwhile are looking into remarks made by Lehman executives during a September 10 conference call , which was five days before the company ’s bankruptcy filing , the newspaper said , and are also investigating whether Lehman assigned proper values on its large commercial real estate holdings .
It remains unclear whether any of the offices will bring their cases , the newspaper said .
And while the Times said no conclusions had been drawn , legal experts expected prosecutors would likely try to build fraud cases against Lehman executives by finding internal documents that contradicted public statements about the bank ’s status .
Representatives of the prosecutors ’ offices declined to comment , as did a spokesman for Fuld , the Times said , although Fuld has said his statements about Lehman ’s condition were based on the best information he had at the time .
Other subpoenaed current and former Lehman executives include Joseph Gregory , the former president , and Erin Callan , former chief financial officer , the Times said , citing a person with knowledge of the matter .
Parks was arrested and charged for violating segregation laws
The House of Representatives has approved the decision following a vote by the US Senate a day earlier .
The Senate resolution said the honour should allow US citizens " to pay their last respects to this great American . "
The body of Mrs Parks , who died at her Detroit home on Tuesday aged 92 , will lie in honour on Sunday and Monday .
Allowing Mrs Parks to lie in honour here is a testament to the impact of her life on both our nation 's history and future .
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist
Her 1955 refusal to give up her seat to a white man on a bus in Montgomery , Alabama , prompted a mass black boycott of buses , organised by Baptist minister Martin Luther King Jr .
Mrs Parks ' actions inspired the mass movement which culminated in the 1964 Civil Rights Act and an end to segregation .
' Brave act '
Lying in honour is a tribute usually reserved for presidents and soldiers .
Mrs Parks will be the first woman and only the second black American to receive the accolade .
Presidents Ronald Reagan , Abraham Lincoln , John F Kennedy are among the US leaders to have received the honour .
Mrs Parks ' protest inspired a generation of activists

World War II General Douglas MacArthur and the bodies of several unknown soldiers have also been given the tribute .
" Rosa Parks ' brave and simple act ignited a movement that rewove America 's social fabric , " Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said .
" Allowing Mrs Parks to lie in honour here is a testament to the impact of her life on both our nation 's history and future . "
On Friday , more than 500 people attended a memorial service for Mrs Parks in Montgomery , where her body is lying in repose .
After a memorial service in Washington on Monday night , her body will be moved to the Charles H Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit where it will lie in repose ahead of her funeral on Wednesday .
Detroit and Montgomery said the first seats of their buses would be reserved until Mrs Parks ' funeral as a tribute to her legacy .
Mrs Parks was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996 , and the Congressional Gold Medal , the nation 's highest civilian honour , three years later .
