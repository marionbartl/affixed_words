The past few days have not gone well for the secretive religion known for its celebrity followers
Most religious organisations can weather a high - profile defection or two .
Many might successfully explain away a fraud conviction in a foreign criminal court , or deal with the spectacular suicide of a member , or muddle through a less than stellar public performance by a prominent spokesman .
Rarely , though , does a religion have to face up to all these challenges in the same week .
The past few days have been little short of a nightmare for Scientology , the strange , secretive religion that thrives on its coterie of Hollywood celebrities and its promises of personal empowerment through psychological counselling .
First came the defection of Paul Haggis , the Oscar - winning screenwriter and director of such hits as Crash , Million Dollar Baby and In the Valley of Elah , who accused the church fathers of lying about everything from their position on gay marriage to their policy of ordering certain followers to sever their ties with close family members .
Haggis said he knew for a fact that Scientology practices a policy of " disconnection " – something it denied in a recent interview with the cable news channel CNN – because his own wife was ordered to stop talking to her parents for more than a year .
" To see you lie so easily , I am afraid I had to ask myself : ' What else are you lying about ? ' " Haggis wrote in a long resignation letter to church spokesman Tommy Davis , which was meant to be confidential but found its way onto the internet over the weekend .
Davis himself , meanwhile , earned less than positive notices for his decision to walk out of an on -air interview with the British television journalist Martin Bashir .
Bashir invoked both the science - fiction origins of Scientology and what are widely believed to be its deepest secrets when he asked : " Do you believe that an intergalactic emperor called Xenu brought his people to earth 75 m years ago and buried them in volcanoes ? "
Davis called the question offensive , said it was against his religion even to talk about the subject , pulled off his mike and walked away .
Meanwhile , a French court found the church guilty of fraud because of the large amounts of money it charges its members to conduct idiosyncratic counselling sessions ( known as " auditing " ) and other services .
The court , essentially characterising the whole enterprise as a scam , imposed a fine of € 600,000 .
And on the other side of the world in Brisbane , Australian investigators openly criticised the church for failing to hand over documentation they want to examine for clues about the suicide of a 30 - year - old soldier who threw himself at an electricity substation tower two years ago .
A coroner 's report said church officials had been pressing the soldier , Edward McBride , to finish the final stage of his auditing and called him 19 times in the 48 hours before he took his life .
Davis , the church 's 37 - year - old spokesman , has spent much of the past week issuing denials and rebuttals .
He insisted the church never supported an anti-gay marriage initiative in California and that the San Diego chapter 's inclusion in a list of supporters was a mistake .
He told one interviewer his remarks about " disconnection " on CNN had been misunderstood .
He also faced questions about John Travolta , the Hollywood leading man and hitherto loyal Scientologist who recently acknowledged that his dead teenage son Jett suffered from autism - a condition Scientology does not acknowledge along with other mental illnesses ( Scientologists believe that psychiatry is a fraudulent " industry of death " ) .
While Jett was still alive , Travolta and his wife Kelly Preston insisted he suffered instead from Kawasaki disease , a condition characterised by inflamed arteries .
Davis also came under scrutiny for his own activities – including the allegation that he once so displeased the church that he was made to scrub toilets with a toothbrush for a week ( he denies it ever happened ) .
Davis is the son of the Hollywood actress Anne Archer , another prominent Scientologist , and is believed to owe his rapid rise through the organisation as personal minder to the biggest star adherent of them all , Tom Cruise .
Many of the church 's misadventures this week can be traced back to two huge recent defections .
Mike Rinder and Marty Rathbun have been described as Scientology 's equivalent of the top Nixon aides HR Haldeman and John Ehrlichman in the Watergate scandal .
Together , they helped the St Petersburg Times newspaper in Florida put together a huge three - part series last June in which they and other defectors accused church leader David Miscavige of using physical and psychological violence to keep his supporters in check .
They said Miscavige would repeatedly slap and kick his subordinates , and encourage them to do likewise .
He would also force his fellow church members to jump fully clothed into pools or lakes , and play all - night games of musical chairs .
The church said at the time the accusations were baseless and motivated by the defectors ' desire to stage a coup and take over the church for themselves .
The defectors said they had no such interest and merely wished to expose the dark side of the religion to which they devoted most of their lives .
Wind and solar technology made up over half of Europeâ€™s new electricity generating capacity in 2009 , as the number of new coal and nuclear facilities fell
More wind capacity was installed in Europe during 2009 than any other electricity - generating technology , according to statistics released today by the European Wind Energy Association ( EWEA ) .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Wind accounted for 39 per cent of increased European energy capacity , ahead of gas ( 26 per cent ) and solar ( 16 per cent ) .
In contrast , the nuclear and coal power sectors decommissioned more megawatts of capacity than they installed in 2009 , with a total of 1,393 MW of nuclear and 3,200 MW of coal decommissioned .
According to the EWEA report , â‚ ¬13 billion has been invested in wind farms across the EU in the last year , which are now capable of meeting 4.8 per cent of EU energy demands .
Spain is the country with the biggest share of new wind capacity ( 24 per cent ) , followed by Germany ( 19 per cent ) , Italy ( 19 per cent ) , France ( 11 per cent ) and the UK ( 10 per cent ) .
The wind energy sector has grown by an average of 23 per cent over the last 15 years , with annual installations up from 472 MW in 1994 to 10,163 MW in 2009 .

A Lost Fan Film Reveals a 70s Star Trek Cast Reunion Star Trek | Subscribe Posted by Michael Pinto on Feb 24 , 2010 in Fandom
This amazing silent 8 mm film sheds light on an amazing lost moment in Star Trek fandom :
It shows a cast reunion at Chicago convention in late August of 1975 .
I realize today that does n’t sound like a big deal but you have to step into the shoes of fans of that era to appreciate this special film .
This was an age when the only way to watch an episode of Star Trek might have been if you owned a 16 mm film print of an episode .
There was n’t much science fiction on television so desperate fanboys and fangurls wanted Star Trek to come back on the air as much as Beatles fans dreamed of another album .
So the ability for fans to see their heros reunite on stage must have been true magic — and it ’s because of those fans that not only did the cast return to make several films , but that the series still lives on today .
Looking at these photos I have a bittersweet feeling knowing that both DeForest Kelley and James Doohan are no longer with us .
I had hoped with the last Star Trek film that J.J. Abrams might give us one last reunion of Shatner and Nimoy , but sadly I only got half my wish .

( Vanity ) Question Regarding Prescription Meds from Canada
Fatnotlazy
Posted on by fatnotlazy
My insurance company has denied coverage for one of my meds .
I am appealing the denial , but in the meantime , I need this medicine .
I already priced the drug locallly -- about $ 200 for a 3 - month supply without insurance coverage .
Does anyone here use Canadian pharmacies for their prescriptions ; if so , can you recommend one to me ?
If you have had bad experiences with Canadian pharmacies , I 'd like to know about that too .
Thank you in advance , everyone !

Is there a generic available ?
If so , try Wal * Mart .
If not , check your insurance company ’s appeals process .
If necessary , you may be able to get a good deal buying directly from the drug company .
Most have programs to help people who ca n’t afford them .

I am not advising you to DO anything , however , I am telling you what others have done : I am a licensed insurance agent .
I am not advising you to DO anything , however , I am telling you what others have done :
There are “ Canada Drug ” retail outlets in many states which do NOT carry an inventory .
I suggest you go to such a location , if one is in your area .
They simply place orders and most of them require an actual prescription .
Insurance , generally , will not pay for these retail purchases , which will be shipped from Canada to your home .
If you MUST go this route , I understand , but I suggest finding a local firm rather than just getting on the interned , if a local firm is available .

Check WalMart , Target and the local pharmacy in your town .
My husbands $ 125 per month meds cost $ 16 at Target because of their $ 4 per prescription on over 400 different meds .

My mom recently came home from the hospital w/a Rx for a drug that Medicare part D and her secondary insurance denied payment for , and the cost would have been $ 2000 per month .
I found it online at a Canadian pharmacy for around $ 250 per month .
I asked the doctor if he had a problem with the quality of drugs that come out of Canada , and he did n’t seem to think there ’d be a problem .
But we were able to put off the decision for awhile , so we ’ve taken no action yet .

Years ago we ordered a drug from a canadian pharmacy with no problems at all .
It was a drug approved in Europe but still undergoing FDA testing here ...... I wish I could recall the name of the pharmacy but will keep checking to see if someone gives you one .
If not perhaps I can dig back and find the name .
But it was an easy process etc ... if the drug you are needing is fairly new there wo n’t be a generic brand available yet .... think a patent takes 7 years before a generic can be made ............
To : mnehring
Thnis drug is a generic ... in fact , it is one of many drugs in its class and is the cheapest .
The company says they wo n’t cover it because it is a specially formulated vitamin , not a drug .
My contention is that this is not something you can buy off the shelf at the local supermarket or drugstore .... you nedd a prescription for it ... and that for that reason , it should be covered , at least partially .
But as I said , I am appealing the decision ; I just need the meds now .
Thank you for your advice about going to the drug company directly .
It ’s worth a shot .

I can only help by telling you that my mother had nothing but good experiences with the Canadian pharmacies she used .
Honest , accurate and helpful .

It is a generic .
Wal Mart does n’t carry it ; neither does Kmart or other “ discount ” pharmacies .
I ’ve gone to the usual chain pharmacies — Walgreens , Rite Aid , CVS , the supermarket pharmacy ... even s local mom-and - pop pharmacy .
Walgreens actually had the best price , but it ’s still a lot .
Anyway , thank you .

First do some research and see if you really need this drug , or if something else would do just as good a job or better .
Doctors ’ prescription - writing is largely driven by pharmaceutical companies ’ marketing campaigns , meaning a lot of prescriptions are written for things that are a lot more expensive than alternatives that would do just as well .
Example : Coumadin , which was heavily prescribed for many years , and eventually research showed that the vast majority of patients taking it would have done as well or better with plain old aspirin .

Do what you want , but in my view going the Canadian route amounts to becoming an accessory to extortion .
I think our government needs to put an end to their thuggery by any means necessary .

I have ordered from 77 Canada Pharmacy .
They no longer carry what I used to order from them .

I did 2 or 3 orders with 77 and liked working with them .

There used to be a guy who came around to our local supermarket ... he represented at least one Canadian pharmacy .
He would take the orders , send them in and deliver the meds when they came in .
I asked at the market if he was still around .
No .
He was caught and told to cease and desist , or he ’d wind up in jail .

Check info at www.familywize.org to see if you can use the prescription drug discount card there .
It covers all prescription drugs .
United Way is involved with it .

Thank you for your input .
Believe me , if I did n’t really need this med , I would n’t go this route .
I may still try to get it here by some other method .
But if I ca n’t get it here at a reasonable price , I may have no other alternative .
To : fatnotlazy
Some stores have generics on the cheap , etc. ... but $ 66 a month is n’t that bad .
My wife pays $ 40 a month for a prescription that is covered .

I was getting generic Advair and Spiriva from N.W. Pharmacy in Canada , good products , prices and service .
The last order I recieved had a big red warning sticker from the FDA telling me that future shipments might be stopped at the border .
I 've got insurance that helps now but at the time I did n't , and paying Walmart prices would have wiped out over half my retirement check .
If they refuse to allow your shipment you may be out of luck on getting your money back .

I ’ve ordered from several different Canadian on - line pharmacies .
Two advantages : the Canadian price is often better , brand vs. brand and generic vs. generic .
Also , drugs seem to go generic sooner outside of the US .
I was able to order simvastatin ( Zocor ) from Canada for several years before it went generic here , for about 1 / 4 the US price for brand Zocor .
The same is now true for Ranexa , available brand - only in the US but already available as generic “ ranolazine ” in Canada for about 1 / 4 the price of the US brand product .
Try www.canadapharmacy.com; I ’ve used them and several others .
Plan on about four to five weeks for delivery , however .

The fall - out from Flavio Briatore 's historic court victory over the FIA continues .
According to a report in the Independent by Pitpass ' business editor Chris Sylt , an eminent lawyer has predicted that the FIA could face more lawsuits from disgruntled recipients of its decisions and , crucially , its status as the sole arbiter of F1 disputes may have finally come to the end of the road .
" It is reasonable to say that the FIA monopoly on decision - making in motorsport may now be coming to an end and that we can expect increasing court challenges in the future , " says Jonathan Lux , partner at international law firm Ince & Co , adding " indeed , some previous well known FIA decisions may be vulnerable in light of the approach taken by the French court , subject to the relevant time bar limitations . "
The FIA was undone by Briatore 's argument that its then - president Max Mosley was effectively acting as judge , jury and executioner since he launched the investigation into race - fixing claims against Briatore and then presided over his ban from the sport in his role as chairman of the World Council .
The French court ruled that " the decision of the World Council was presided over by the FIA president ... with Mr. Mosley having played a leading role in launching the enquiry ... in violation of the principle of separation of the power of the bodies . "
Briatore claims that as a result of this , " every decision made by the World Council was illegal " and a challenge of one of these decisions in particular could ultimately put the brakes on the FIA .
In 2007 McLaren was of course caught spying on Ferrari and the World Council handed it a $ 100 m fine .
Briatore says he thinks McLaren may take action against the FIA to recover the $ 100 m in light of his court result .
McLaren refuses to confirm this and Matt Bishop , its head of communications , simply says " we have no comment on the Briatore case . "
However , if McLaren were to take action and succeed , the FIA may struggle to repay since it transferred the proceeds of the fine to a motor industry charity .
Ironically , the future of the FIA could be in McLaren 's hands .

I 'm sure someone at Apple has scars on their hands from the major wrist - slapping that 's occurred over their video cock - up of the iPad running Flash — but how could they make the same mistake again ?
Advertisement
When Apple announced the iPad , you may remember some of their promotional videos showed the tablet running Flash on the NY Times website .
They quickly rectified the problem — which was never explained fully , so we still do n't know if they were filming a prototype that did actually have Flash , or if they deliberately added it in to stir hype — but according to a Macrumors reader , the video showing Flash has returned .
The original video caused the FTC to receive complaints about the false advertising , which is n't the first time they 've been hit with that criticism .
Watching the video now , it 's reverted back to the non-Flash enabled version , which just shows broken plug - in icons on the NY Times site .
I would n't suggest reading anything into this video , but it 's pretty surprising they could somehow accidentally switch the videos around again .
What 's going on , Apple ?
And how can I get my eight minutes back , spent re-watching that bloody promo video again ?

Antitrust laws are supposed to prevent this kind of market power .
So why are giant health insurers like WellPoint exempt ?
Chalk it up to an anomaly that began seven decades ago in the quaint old world of regional , nonprofit Blues .
They were created in part by hospitals to spread the costs of expensive new equipment and facilities over many policy holders .
Collaboration was the point , not competition .
The 1945 McCarran - Ferguson
Act made it official , exempting insurers from antitrust scrutiny and giving states the power to regulate them , although not necessarily any power to regulate rates .
The system worked fairly well until about two decades ago when insurers began morphing into publicly held , for - profit cash machines .
A new breed of medical entrepreneur saw opportunities to profit from a rapidly aging population eager to get every new drug and technology that might extend their lives , and a government committed to doling out hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare and Medicaid .
With size has come not only market power but political clout .
Big for - profit insurers deploy enough campaign money and lobbyists to get their way with state legislators and insurance commissioners .
A proposal last year to allow California ’s Department of Insurance to regulate rates , for example , died in committee .
These companies have even been known to press states to limit how many other health insurers they license .
And when they ca n’t get their way , insurers go to court .
In Maine  one state that aggressively regulates rates  WellPoint ’s Anthem subsidiary has sued the insurance superintendent for reducing its requested rate increase .
Political clout can be especially advantageous at the federal level , as the big Wall Street banks have so brazenly demonstrated .
Over the past two and a half years , WellPoint ’s employees and associates have contributed more than $ 922,000 to federal political campaigns , and the company has spent $ 7.8 million lobbying Washington policymakers , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
It should not be surprising that WellPoint was one of the leading opponents of the public insurance option , which would have subjected it to competition even where it had sewn up the market .
Antitrust is no substitute for broader health care reform , but it ’s an important prerequisite .
If a handful of giant health insurers are allowed to dominate the industry , many of the other aspects of reform ( establishing insurance exchanges , requiring people to have insurance , even allowing consumers to buy insurance across state lines ) wo n’t bring down the price of insurance .
Regardless of what happens at the White House ’s health care meeting on Thursday , we ’ve got to make sure health insurers compete for every one of our dollars .
First chance I get I ’m going to find another health insurer here in California  unless Anthem has such a lock on the market I can’t find a better deal .

Al Franken can be a blowhard at times , but occasionally he 's the hero of the tale .
Like when he rips apart Comcast CEO Brian Roberts over some contradictions in the arguments for the Comcast / NBC merger .

The video's well worth watching if you enjoy seeing a CEO flustered and stuttering , but Consumerist sums up what went down rather well :
Sen .
Franken said that Comcatastrophe Roberts had met him in his office and said that the FCC rules " will make sure that you always have a wide variety of programs because they forbid [ Comcast / NBC ] from discriminating against other company 's programs . "
Then Franken pointed to a sign he had printed with a quote from Comcast 's attorneys saying that those same rules were unconstitutional .
" In other words , looking to get approval for this merger , you sat there in my office and told me to my face that these rules would protect consumers but your lawyers had just finished arguing in front of the Commission that it would be unconstitutional to apply these rules , " Franken said .

GUANGZHOU , China 
Auto sales are so strong in China that an unusual conspiracy theory has circulated on Western stock markets this month : the Chinese government must be secretly buying hundreds of thousands of cars and parking them somewhere .
The main evidence presented for the theory is that the number of gallons of gasoline consumed in China has been flat this year .
But auto executives and Chinese buyers deny the rumor , which has spread so widely that economists have begun producing reports on why it is implausible .
Kevin Wale , the president of General Motors China , said that automakers knew who was buying their cars and saw no evidence of a car - buying conspiracy .
Sharp improvements in fuel economy  partly because of government mandates and partly because of a shift to smaller cars  help explain the slow growth in gasoline sales , he said .
A series of recent increases in regulated fuel prices may have also discouraged some driving , he added .
' Catastrophe of Major Proportions ' Haiti Devastated by Massive Earthquake
The impoverished Caribbean country of Haiti was struck by a major earthquake on Tuesday night .
There are no precise figures on the number of victims yet , but initial estimates indicate that hundreds of people have died .
The capital city Port - au - Prince was hit hard and the presidential palace has collapsed .
Online dating is a $ 976 million annual industry in the United States , according to estimates from Marketdata Enterprises , a research firm .
So , to stand out among hundreds of mass - market , open - community sites that attract everyone from people trolling for quick hookups to those headed for holy matrimony , a few services offer more elaborate mate - finding methods .
They build brand identity when they “ target people who are looking for relationships rather than just dating , ” says John LaRosa , the research director at Marketdata Enterprises .
That means matchmaking sites with fewer users can charge more per subscriber than larger sites that list online personals .
Match.com , with an estimated 1.2 million paid subscribers , had revenue of about $ 365 million in 2008 , Mr. LaRosa estimates .
EHarmony , meanwhile , with about 656,000 paid members , had estimated revenue of $ 216 million that year , he says .
But do partner - prediction sites do better at matching people than less - structured dating sites where people seek , sort and select others on their own ?
Success rates for online dating are hard to measure .
But eHarmony says it clearly enhances the process by catering to people who are looking for relationships leading to marriage .
People tend to be adept at heeding that first spark of attraction but may be less dexterous at recognizing the commonalities that are the foundations of good marriages , says Gian Gonzaga , eHarmony ’s senior director of research and development .
The site suggests potential matches based on areas of compatibility like values , beliefs and important experiences  that are predictors of relationship success , he says .
“ In the long haul , you want to be able to manage conflicts , celebrate positives and get through the day - to - day relationship , ” Dr. Gonzaga said .
“ Our system is there to take care of that so you can now focus on who you find really attractive , that you feel really passionate about . ”
Chemistry.com , meanwhile , uses answers to a detailed questionnaire to suggest potential partners based on their brain chemistry , says Dr. Fisher , a research professor in the anthropology department at Rutgers University .
Based on a review of scientific studies on neurotransmitters and chemicals like dopamine in the brain , she determined that humans tend to express one of four dominant temperaments .

Taser wants to help parents , not with jolts of electricity but with a tool which allows parents to effectively take over a child ’s mobile phone and manage its use .
“ Basically we ’re taking old fashioned parenting and bringing it into the mobile world , ” Taser chairman and co-founder Tom Smith said at the Consumer Electronics
Show here , where the Arizona company unveiled the new product .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Because when you give your child his mobile phone you do n’t know who they ’re talking to , what they ’re sending or texting , all of those things , ” Smith told AFP .
The phone application , called “ Mobile Protector , ” allows a parent to screen a child ’s incoming and outgoing calls and messages , block particular numbers and even listen in on a conversation .
A dashboard on a parent ’s phone or a personal computer shows the mobiles being monitored and the permitted callers such as friends and family .
“ You can start it out very restrictive and then as they get older you can relax those restrictions as that trust factor ’s gained , ” Smith said .
An alert is triggered when an unknown number calls a child ’s phone .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I can click on this and it ’s going to say here ’s the person ’s who ’s calling , ” Smith said .
“ I can either choose to block that call , allow that call or even answer that call and find out who it is before I release it through to my child .
“ If it ’s Grandma , who I forgot to add , I can just click ‘ always allow ’ and I ’ll never see that alert again , ” he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Smith said that when listening in on a call “ it ’s going to announce that to both parties . ”
“ We ’re not doing spyware .
This is a collaboration effort , ” he said .
Smith said text messages , emails , photos and videos can be screened for inappropriate language or pornographic content .
“ You can see the image and decide whether you want to let it go through or not , ” he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Mobile Protector also allows a parent to disable a phone for a specified period .
“ I see so many parents trying to wrestle with their kids to try to get them off the phone during dinner , ” he said .
“ You can punch this and say ‘ You know what , for the next hour your phone ’s not going to work during dinner . ’
“ Or , if they get in trouble you can say ‘ You know what , you ’re grounded , for 48 hours your phone does n’t work , ' ” he said .

GPS capability brings up a map showing where a child — or at least their phone — is at any given time .
“ In college I do n’t need to know where you currently are but for young kids I want to see where they are , ” he said .
Mobile Protector also has an “ emergency feature ” that could help locate a missing child , Smith said .
“ I can call up ‘ records release ’ and it ’s going to take all of the data — last known location , phone numbers , texts everything — and that ’s going to go to the local authorities , ” he said .
Along with Mobile Protector , Taser is also releasing a tool known as “ Driver Protector ” designed to cut back on mobile phone use while behind the wheel .
It requires special hardware in the vehicle and a Bluetooth connection .

“ If it ’s a first time driver it ’s going to disable the phone so they ca n’t text while driving or use the phone , ” Smith said .
“ As they get older , we can enable it so they have hands - free talking but still no texting while driving .
“ Maybe it will alert me when they go over 90 miles an hour ( 145 kilometers an hour ) , ” he said .
“ It ’s really going to be up to the parent how much they want to limit or not limit . ”
Smith said Mobile Protector and Driver Protector will be available this summer and will be a subscription service costing between 10 and 30 dollars a month depending on the selected options .
Smith noted that other companies have released similar tools but said “ nobody ’s put the whole thing together ” like Taser .
" He voiced his frustration to us because of his desire to play every day , " Angels manager Mike Scioscia said .
New York wanted another outfielder after Carlos Beltran had knee surgery last week .
Beltran , sidelined for much of last season , is not expected back until May , and Matthews will compete with Angel Pagan to play center field while Beltran is on the disabled list .
" I think it 's going to be open competition , " Mets general manager Omar Minaya said .
" Nobody 's going to be given the job . "
Matthews is owed salaries of $ 11 million this year and $ 12 million in 2011 , plus a $ 500,000 bonus for getting traded .
The Mets will pay just $ 1 million per season , and the Angels will give New York money to cover the remainder of the salary plus the bonus , a person familiar with the details told The Associated Press .
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the financial details were not announced .
Matthews hit .313 with 19 homers and 79 RBIs for Texas in 2006 , when he made the AL All - Star team , then signed the big deal with the Angels that turned out to be the worst contract in the team 's history .
He slumped to a .252 average with 18 homers and 72 RBIs during his first season in Anaheim , then lost his center field job when the Angels signed Torii Hunter .
" It obviously was n't the role that Gary was looking for , " Scioscia said , adding that Matthews ' disappointment was understandable .
" To say that Gary was a disruptive influence or was not happy in our clubhouse is 180 degrees from the situation . "
Matthews had 46 RBIs in 2008 and 50 last year , when he started 80 games .
Now 35 , he is the son of Gary Matthews , the 1973 NL Rookie of the Year .
Minaya called him a " change - of - scenery guy " and said that once Beltran returns , he could back up the center fielder , in addition to left fielder Jason Bay and right fielder Jeff Francoeur .
" It 's an opportunity for him to come into New York and be able to hopefully get more playing time , " Minaya said .
Matthews was briefly with the Mets but got only one at - bat for New York -- he fouled out against Pittsburgh 's Mike Lincoln as a pinch hitter .
The Mets purchased him from the Pirates in December 2001 , then traded him to Baltimore for left - hander John Bale .
SI.com reported in February 2007 that Matthews was sent human growth hormone by Applied Pharmacy in August 2004 , an accusation he denied .
Major League Baseball concluded there was insufficient evidence to discipline him .
New York added Matthews after failing to land two of its free - agent targets : catcher Bengie Molina , who decided to stay with San Francisco , and pitcher Joel Pineiro , who agreed to a $ 16 million , two - year contract with the Angels .
" You always wish that when you put ( out ) these offers , you 're able to get the players , " Minaya said .
The 30 - year - old Stokes , born in Pomona , was 2 - 4 with a 3.97 ERA out of the bullpen last season , setting career highs for games ( 69 ) and innings ( 70 1 - 3 ) .
He spent the last two seasons with the Mets after making his big league debut for Tampa Bay .
" Being from Southern California growing up , I think this is going to be awesome for me , " he said .
While the Angels have n't confirmed Pineiro 's agreement , Scioscia already was referring to him as a member of the team .
" I think that depth moving forward is something that we need to re-establish , " he said .
" I think Brian is going to go a long way to help us in that department , and I think gives us , along with the acquisition of Joel Pineiro , some versatility between our rotation and our bullpen . "
Honolulu , Hawaii ( CNN ) --
Tests that were performed on Rush Limbaugh after he was admitted to a Hawaii hospital for chest pains " found absolutely nothing wrong , " the conservative talk show host said Friday .
" It was a blessing , " Limbaugh , 58 , said at the Queen 's Medical Center in Honolulu , where he was admitted Wednesday .
Doctors gave Limbaugh an angiogram Thursday that revealed no evidence of arterial or coronary disease , he said .
The cause of his pain -- which he called " real " -- has not been determined .
He said one possibility is a spasm in an artery .
He was discharged from the hospital Friday .
Limbaugh said his ordeal started Wednesday afternoon , when he began experiencing pain in his upper left chest " like I 've never experienced before . "
He praised the care of the medical staff and called their work " confidence - inspiring . "
" The treatment I received here was the best that the world has to offer , " he said .
" I do n't think there 's one thing wrong with the American health care system .
It is working just fine . "
Limbaugh said the experience was a good lesson as he approaches his 59th birthday January 12 .
" It takes things like this in life to prepare you for the eventuality that you are getting older , " he said .
" You 're not as young as you were and not as invincible as you once thought you were . "
He urged anyone who experiences heart or chest pain to seek medical help immediately .
" Do n't mess with it , " he said .
Limbaugh 's radio show is broadcast on more than 600 stations and is heard by more than 13.5 million listeners each week .
Last year , he struck a deal with Clear Channel Communications to extend his contract through 2016 .
The deal is worth more than $ 400 million .
Eye test that spots Alzheimer 's 20 years before symptoms : Middle - aged could be screened at routine optician 's visit
A test that can detect Alzheimer 's up to 20 years before any symptoms show is being developed by British scientists .
The simple and inexpensive eye test could be part of routine examinations by high street opticians in as little as three years , allowing those in middle age to be screened .
Dementia experts said it had the power to revolutionise the treatment of Alzheimer 's by making it possible for drugs to be given in the earliest stages .
Simple :
The middle - aged could visit their local optician and have the special eye test as part of a routine examination
The technique , being pioneered at University College London , could also speed up the development of medication capable of stopping the disease in its tracks , preventing people from ever showing symptoms .
Rebecca Wood , of the Alzheimer 's Trust , said : ' These findings have the potential to transform the way we diagnose Alzheimer 's , greatly enhancing efforts to develop new treatments . '
Alzheimer 's and other forms of dementia blight the lives of 700,000 Britons and their families , and the number of cases is expected to double within a generation .
There is no cure and existing drugs do not work for everyone .
Current diagnosis is based on memory tests , and expensive brain scans are also sometimes used .
However decisive proof of the disease usually comes from examination of the patient 's brain after death .
Diagnosis : Eye drops would be used in the test to highlight diseased cells at the back of the eye
The eye test would provide a quick , easy , cheap and highly - accurate diagnosis .
It exploits the fact that the light - sensitive cells in the retina at the back of the eye are a direct extension of the brain .
Using eye drops which highlight diseased cells , the UCL researchers showed for the first time in a living eye that the amount of damage to cells in the retina directly corresponds with brain cell death .
They have also pinpointed the pattern of retinal cell death characteristic of Alzheimer's .
So far their diagnosis has been right every time .
With research showing that cells start to die ten to 20 years before the symptoms of Alzheimer 's become evident , it could allow people to be screened in middle age for signs of the disease .
However , some may not want to know their fate so far in advance .
There is also the fear that insurance companies could increase premiums for those who test positive while still young .
The experiments , reported in the journal Cell Death & Disease , have been on animals but the team are poised to start the first human trials .
Researcher Professor Francesca Cordeiro said : ' The equipment used for this research is essentially the same as is used in clinics and hospitals worldwide .
' It is also inexpensive and non-invasive , which makes us fairly confident that we can progress quickly to its use in patients .
' It is entirely possible that in the future a visit to a high street optician to check on your eyesight will also be a check on the state of your brain . '
The technique could also improve the diagnosis of other conditions , including glaucoma and Parkinson 's disease .
In the short term , an early diagnosis would give patients and their families much more time to prepare for the future .
In the longer term , it would allow new drugs that stop the disease in their tracks to reach their full potential .
Professor Cordeiro said : ' If you give the treatment early enough , you can stop the disease progressing , full stop . '
Dr Susanne Sorensen , of the Alzheimer 's Society , cautioned that the test was still experimental but added : ' This research is very exciting .
If we can delay the onset of dementia by five years , we can halve the number of people who will die from the disease . '
( CNN ) --
Tigers could become extinct in the wild in less than a generation , the World Wildlife Fund warned Wednesday as it launched a campaign to save them .
The number of tigers in the wild has dwindled to 3,200 -- less than the number held in captivity in the United States alone , the campaigners said .
" There is a real threat of losing this magnificent animal forever in our lifetime , " said Sybille Klenzendorf , director of the WWF - US species conservation program .
" This would be like losing the stars in the sky .
" Three tiger subspecies have gone extinct , and another , the South China tiger , has not been seen in the wild in 25 years , " she told reporters .
" Unless we really crack down on illegal trade and poachers , tigers in the wild have very little chance , " said a World Bank official involved in the campaign to save the big cats .
Keshav S. Varma , program director of the World Bank 's Global Tiger Initiative , said the fate of tigers would show how serious people were about protecting wildlife .
" If the tigers disappear , it is an indication of a comprehensive failure , " he said .
" It 's not just about tigers .
If you save the tiger , you are going to save other species .
It provides an excellent indicator of commitment to biodiversity .
" If they survive , it shows we are doing our job right .
If they disappear , it shows we are just talking , " he said .
World Wildlife Fund -- Year of the Tiger
Tigers are threatened by many factors , including " poaching , habitat loss , poorly planned development and illegal trafficking , " the WWF said in a statement .
" And there are few regulations to keep those tigers from ending up on the black market . "
Demand for tiger parts in areas of Asia is a key factor , campaigners said .
" The demand for bones and skin , meat , and even claws and teeth ... is driving a major crime campaign to wipe tigers out in the wild , " said Crawford Allan , director of TRAFFIC - North America , which monitors the trade in wildlife .
He warned that in some parts of the world , tigers were valued more for their body parts than as living creatures .
The WWF is working with the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine to fight the use of traditional remedies such as tiger bones .
" Traditional Chinese medicine does not need tiger bones to save lives , " said Lixin Huang , president of the ACTCM .
" What we are dealing with is an old tradition , an old belief that tiger wine can make their bones stronger .
That is not medicine , that is from old tradition , " she said , adding that the group was spearheading a campaign to educate people about the threat to tigers .
The campaign launch is linked to the Year of the Tiger , which begins on Sunday in the traditional Chinese calendar , said WWF spokesman Lee Poston .
The World Wildlife Fund hopes to find ways to double the current population of wild tigers by the next Year of the Tiger in 2022 , " so the next new year is a time for celebration and hope , as a new year should be , " said Mike Baltzer , the leader of the group 's Tiger Initiative .
To do that , the group needs the help of governments , and at least $ 13 million a year just for its highest priority sites , Klenzendorf said .
She said there was cause for hope .
" Tigers are a cat and can breed faster than prey and recover ... if we can protect them , " she said .
On Wednesday , the WWF published an interactive map that shows 10 tiger trouble spots around the world , highlighting areas where development or legal loopholes have endangered tigers or destroyed their habitat .
Those areas are in Bangladesh , China , Europe , India , Indonesia , Nepal , Russia , the United States , Vietnam , and the Greater Mekong region , which stretches across Cambodia , China , Laos , Myanmar , Thailand and Vietnam .
There were about 100,000 tigers roaming wild at the start of the 20th century , the WWF said .
“ I have embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of [ nuclear ] weapons , and seeks a world without them , ” President Barack Obama claimed during his first State of the Union speech .
“ To reduce our stockpiles and launchers , while ensuring our deterrent , the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest - reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades . ”

Yet , in the budget the Obama White House will send to Congress on Monday , the administration proposes a 10 percent spending increase on the nation ’s nuclear weapons budget , bringing the total to roughly $ 7 billion , according to McClatchy Newspapers .
In a Friday op - ed published by The Wall Street Journal , Vice President Joseph Biden claimed that the increase is due in large part to the decay in nuclear stockades over the last decade , due mainly to neglect by the Bush administration .
“ For as long as nuclear weapons are required to defend our country and our allies , we will maintain a safe , secure and effective nuclear arsenal , ” he wrote .
“ The budget we will submit to Congress on Monday both reverses this decline and enables us to implement the president ’s nuclear - security agenda .
These goals are intertwined . ”
The increased funding would also be used to modernize old facilities and retain the necessary staff to track nonproliferation issues and ensure weapons reduction agreements are upheld , McClatchy added .
“ Our budget request is just one of several closely related and equally important initiatives giving life to the president ’s Prague agenda , ” Biden explained .
“ Others include completing the New START agreement with Russia , releasing the Nuclear Posture Review on March 1 , holding the Nuclear Security Summit in April , and pursuing ratification and entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty . ”

“ Fascinating point : it took a Democratic president and a Democatic Congress to modernize the stockpile , ” The Atlantic ’s Marc Ambinder noted .
“ The Bush administration ’s efforts in this regard failed .
It remains to be seen how and whether the administration ties this achievement into a larger narrative about nonproliferation and national security . ”

Series Introduction
Think for a moment , if you can , back to a time before the Web .
Imagine trying to explain the impending changes to your hapless contemporaries .
It is likely they would simply not be able to fathom the impacts that the Web 's emergence would have on nearly every aspect of their lives .
In retrospect , it feels like a tsunami caught us off - guard and forever altered the landscape around us .
The reality is more pedestrian , however .
It was a deliberate series of technical choices that built upon each other that yielded the results we have experienced .
Now , pause and reflect upon the idea that you are probably in a similar position to those incredulous pre-Web types you were just trying to enlighten .
Unless you have been paying close attention , you are about to be caught off - guard again as it feels like a new wave crashes upon our economic , social , technological and organizational landscapes .
While the resulting changes will feel like they occur overnight , the reality is that they have been in the works for years and are just now producing tangible results .
This new wave is about a Web that has evolved beyond documents into Webs of Data , both personal and private .
We will no longer focus on information containers , but on information itself and how it is connected .
This wave has been in the works for years and is again being driven by the deliberate adoption of specific choices and technologies .
These choices are combining to solve the problems caused by the inexorable march of technological change , business flux , new and varied data sources and the ubiquitous , expensive and failure - prone efforts that have cost millions and delivered insufficient value .
Web Services and Service - Oriented Architectures ( SOA ) were supposed to be part of the answer , but the elegance of their visions have been forever stained by the inelegance of their technical solutions .

The beauty is that we are not starting from scratch .
We are building upon the technology we have in place to grow these data webs organically .
We can wrap our databases , libraries , services and other content sources with a new set of abstractions that will help us off the treadmill we have been on .
We are integrating the public Web of Data with our own , privately held data .
The incremental adoption of these technologies is yielding new capabilities that will , in turn , unlock further capabilities .
This is the first article in a new series to highlight the evolution of information - oriented systems that got us to where we are and provide a roadmap to where we are going .
Despite what it may seem on the surface , these choices are neither ad hoc nor esoteric , but rather foundational decisions based on a long tradition of academia and applied engineering .
We will start by revisiting the REpresentational State Transfer ( REST ) architectural style .
Oft quoted and even more often misunderstood , this manner of building networked software systems allows us to merge our documents , data and information - oriented services into a rich , logical ecosystem of named resources .
From there , we will introduce the vision of the Semantic Web and walk through its core technologies represented by a flexible and extensible data model and the ability to query it .
We will see how to incorporate relational data , content from documents , spreadsheets , RSS feeds , etc. into a rich web of reusable content .
After we present the basics , we will walk through a variety of successful efforts building on these technologies and then return to reclaiming the vision promised to us by proponents of Web Services technologies .
We will describe a process where we can achieve something of a Unified Theory of Information Systems ; one that not only handles , but embraces the kind of technical and social change that has been painful and intractable to manage in the past .
There has been too much hype surrounding the Semantic Web , but there have also been a steady stream of quiet successes .
This series will be a pragmatic guide into both new and familiar territory .
We will connect the technologies in deeper ways than perhaps you have seen before .
We will highlight events and actions by companies , government organizations and standards bodies that indicate that this is happening and it will change everything .
We will show how a very large difference in your system implementation can often be made through subtle shifts in perspective and adoption of standards that are designed to facilitate change .
The first step , is to embrace a common naming scheme for all aspects of our infrastructure .
A Service - Only Architecture usually ignores the data that flows through it .
At the end of the day , our organizations care about information first and foremost .
REST and the Web Architecture puts this priority up front and lays the foundation for the remainder of our discussion .
The Rest of REST
It has become fashionable to talk about the REpresentational State Transfer ( REST ) as something of a weapon in the War On Complexity .
The enemies in this war , according to some , are SOAP and the Web Services technology stack that surrounds it .
This Us vs Them rhetoric brings passion to the table , but rarely meaningful dialogue so people remain confused as to the underlying message and why it is important .
The goal is not to replace SOAP ; the goal is to build better systems .
REST is not even a direct replacement for SOAP .
It is not some kind of technology of convenience ; a simple solution for invoking Web Services through URLs .
The management of information resources is not the same thing as invoking arbitrary behavior .
This confusion leads people to build " RESTful " solutions that are neither RESTful , nor good solutions .
REST derives its benefits as much from its restrictions as it does its resultant flexibility .
If you read Dr. Roy Fielding 's thesis ( which you are encouraged to do ) , you will learn that the intent was to describe how the combination of specific architectural constraints yields a set of properties that we find desirable in networked software systems .
The adoption of a uniform interface , the infamous Uniform Resource Locator ( URL ) , contributes to the definition of REST , but is insufficient to define it .
Likewise , interfaces that simply expose arbitrary services via URLs will not yield the same benefits we have seen so successfully in the explosion of the Web .
It takes a richer series of interactions and system partitioning to get the full results .
Most people understand that REST involves requesting and supplying application state of information resources through URLs via a small number of verbs .
You retrieve information by issuing GET requests to URLs , you create or update via POST and PUT , and remove information via DELETE requests .
This summary is not incorrect , but it leaves too much out .
The omissions yield degrees of freedom that unfortunately often allow people to make the wrong decisions .
In this gap , people create URLs out of verbs which eliminates the benefit of having names for " things " .
They think REST is just about CRUD operations .
They create magical , unrelated URLs that you have to know up front how to parse , losing the discoverability of the hypertext engine .
Perhaps most unforgivably , they create URLs tied solely to particular data formats , making premature decisions for clients about the shape of the information .
Understanding the full implications of REST will help you avoid these problems ; it will help you to develop powerful , flexible and scalable systems .
But it is also the beginning of a new understanding of information and how it is used .
Upon this foundation of Web architecture , the application of the remaining technologies of the Semantic Web will yield unprecedented power in how we interact with each other as individuals , governments , organizations and beyond .
This is why we begin with a deeper dive into the parts of REST that many people do not understand and therefore do not discuss .
These topics include the implications of :
URLs as identifiers
Freedom of Form
Logically - connected , Late - binding Systems
Hypertext as the Engine of State Transfer ( HATEOS )
URLs as Identifiers
We have already established that most people know about URLs and REST .
It seems clear that they understand that a URL is used for invoking a service , but it is not clear that they get the larger sense of a URL as a name for information .
Names are how we identify people , places , things and concepts .
If we lack the ability to identify , we lack the ability to signify .
Imagine Abbott and Costello's infamous " Who 's on First ? " skit on a daily basis .
Having names gives us the ability to disambiguate and identify something we care about within a context .
Having a name and a common context allows us to make reference to named things out of that context .
The Uniform Resource Identifier ( URI ) is the parent scheme .
It is a method for encoding other schemes depending on whether we want them to include resolution information or not .
Librarians and other long - term data stewards like names that will not change .
A Uniform Resource Name ( URN ) is a URI that has no location information in it ; nothing but name is involved .
The good news is that these names will never break .
The bad news is that there is no resolution process for them .
An example of a URN is an ISBN number for a book :
urn :isbn:0307346617
In order to find more information about this book , you would have to find a service that allows you to look up information based on the ISBN number .
If nothing about the context of our systems and information ever changed , we would probably always want to include resolution information in our resource names so we could resolve them .
But anyone who has been handed a broken link knows we want longer - lived names for really important stuff .
Looking at our history of using URLs , we have done some silly things when we created ones such as :
http://someserver.com/cgi-bin/foo/bar.pl
http://someserver.com/ActionServlet?blah=blah
http://someserver.com/foo/bar.php
The problem with these URLs is that the technology used to produce a result is irrelevant to the consumer of information .
There is no good reason to create URLs like that .
The focus should be on the information , not the technology .
Implementation technologies change over time .
If you abandon them , for instance , any system that has a link to the Perl , Servlet or PHP - based URL will break .
We will address some infrastructure to solve this problem in future articles , for now , we will just try to make careful choices in the names we give our information resources .
Despite being fragile , the URL scheme does allow us to disambiguate information references in a global context .
http://company1.com/customer/123456
is distinct and distinguishable from
http://company2.com/customer/123456
in ways that a decontextualized identifier like ' 123456 ' is not .
To ground the concept into a larger information systems framework , you can think of a URL as a primary key that is not specific to a particular database .
We can make references to an item via its URL in dozens of different databases , documents , applications , etc. and know that we are referring to the same thing because we have a unique name in a global context .
We will use this property in future discussions to describe and connect RESTful systems to other content and metadata .
The next aspect of URLs that bears discussion is their universal applicability .
We have a common naming scheme that allows us to identify :
documents ( reports , blogs , announcements )
data ( results , instance information , metadata )
services ( REST ! )
concepts ( people , organizations , domain - specific terms )
We do not need to come up with a different mechanism to refer to each different category of things .
A careful application of some specific guidelines allows us to blur the distinctions between these things which brings us to the last point for now about URLs .
Not only are these names useful in order to refer to information we care about , but systems that receive these references can simply ask for them .
The ' L ' in URL ( locator ) gives us the capacity to resolve the thing , not knowing anything else about it .
We can usually invoke the same basic operations on everything we can name .
Issuing a GET request to a URL representing a document , some data , a service to produce that data or an abstract , non-network - addressable concept all work fundamentally the same way .
For those things we have the permission to manipulate , we can also create , modify or delete them using similar means .
Freedom of Form
Our experience of the Web has been somewhat passive with respect to the shape of information .
When we click on a link , we expect the content to come back in a particular form , usually HTML .
That is fine for many types of information , but the architecture supports a much more conversational style allowing clients to request information in a preferred form .
To understand why this is useful , consider a company 's sales report .
It is easy to imagine this being useful to executives , sales people , other employees , clients and investors as an indication of how a company is performing .
A possible name for such a report could include the year and the quarter in the URL :
http://company1.com/report/sales/2009/qtr/3
We might contrast this with a sales report for the month of March :
http://company1.com/report/sales/2009/month/3
Both are good , logical names that are unlikely to break over time .
It is a compelling vision that people could simply type such a URL into a browser and get the information they seek rendered as HTML .
The reports could be bookmarked , e-mailed , linked to , etc. ; all the things we love about the Web .
The problem is that the information is locked into its rendered form ( until we introduce technologies like GRDDL and RDFa later in this series ! ) .
We used to try to scrape content from pages , but gave up in disgust .
As the page layout changes , our scripts break .
If you were a programmer for this company and wanted to get to the information directly , you might like to request it as XML .
You could get back raw , structured data that you could validate against a schema .
HTTP and REST make this trivial as long as the server knows how to respond .
By passing in an " Accept : application / xml " header to your request , you could indicate a preference ( or requirement ) for XML .
On success , you will get back a byte - stream with a MIME type indicating that your request has been honored .
On failure , the server will indicate via a 406 Error that it cannot help you .
In that case , you might want to contact the department responsible for this information and request they add the support you need ; something they can do without breaking any existing clients .
If you were a business analyst , you might think that XML has sharp points and can hurt you , so you might like to request it back as a spreadsheet , a format that is easily incorporated into your existing workflows , tools and processes .
The point is that the logical name for the report is easily converted into various forms at the point it is requested .
It is equally easy to run systems that accept modifications back in the various forms .
The client has no visibility into how the information is actually stored , they just know that it works for them .
This freedom is wholly underused by people building RESTful systems .
When they stand up a service and decide that they will only return XML , they miss the potential value REST has to an organization .
Because many developers are either unaware of content negotiation or find it difficult to test in a browser , they define different URLs for the different formats :
http://company1.com/report/sales/2009/qtr/3/report.html
http://company1.com/report/sales/2009/qtr/3/report.xml
http://company1.com/report/sales/2009/qtr/3/report.xls
This developer convenience becomes a limitation once you escape the confines of a particular use .
In essence , we now have three information resources , not one that can be rendered in different forms .
Not only does this fork the identity in the global context , it also prematurely commits other clients to a particular form .
If you pass a reference to a URL as part of a workflow or orchestration you are robbing the upstream clients from the freedom to choose the form of the data .
There are several ways to test a proper RESTful service without using a browser , for example :
curl - H " Accept : application / xml " - O http://company1.com/report/sales/2009/qtr/3
using the popular curl program .
Any reasonable HTTP client will provide similar capabilities .
The benefits of supporting a rich ecosystem of negotiable data forms may not be immediately obvious , but once you wrap your head around it , you will see it as a linchpin toward long - lived , flexible systems that favor the client , not the developer .
Logically - Connected , Late - Binding Systems
Once you commit to good , logical names for your information resources , you will discover some additional benefits that fall out of these decisions .
Named references can safely and efficiently be passed back as results without returning actual data .
This has strong implications for large and sensitive data sets , but it also makes possible technical and architectural migration .
For the same reasons pointers are useful in languages like C and C++ , URLs as references to data are more compact and efficient to hand off to potential consumers of information .
Large data sets such as financial transactions , satellite imagery , etc. can be referenced in workflows without requiring all participants to suffer the burden of handling the large content volume .
Any orchestration that touches actual data must consider the security implications of passing it on to other systems .
It quickly becomes untenable to provide perfect knowledge of who is allowed to do what at every step of a process .
If a reference is passed from step to step , it is up to the information source to enforce access .
Some steps may not require access to the sensitive information and could therefore be excluded from receiving it when they resolve the reference .
This means the late - binding resolution can factor in the full context of the request .
A particular user accessing a resource from one application might have a business need to see sensitive information .
The same person using a different application might not have a business justification to the same data .
A RESTful service could inspect session tokens and the like to enforce this access policy declaratively .
This level of specificity is required to prevent internal fraud , often the biggest risk in systems that deal with sensitive content .
The details of such a system are going to be implementation - specific and are largely orthogonal to the process of naming and resolving logically - named content .
Dependency on a logical connection allows clients to be protected against implementation changes .
When popular websites shift from one technology to another , they are usually successful at hiding these changes from their users .
RESTful services do the same thing .
This gives us the freedom to wrap legacy systems with logical interfaces and leave them in place until there is a business reason to invest in a new implementation .
When that happens , clients can be protected from being affected .
In addition to mediating technology changes , RESTful systems allow you to embrace a variant of Postel 's Law : Be Conservative in what you do ; be Liberal in what you accept from others .
You can maintain strict content validation of what you accept and return .
However , if you have an existing client base that is providing you content in a given form , you are free to allow other clients to provide different forms , different schemas , etc. without affecting the existing clients .
Systems that closely associate a contract with an endpoint tend not to have this freedom which makes them more brittle and quickly fragmented .
Hypertext As the Engine of State Transfer ( HATEOS )
As systems come across references to information resources , many people think there needs to be some sort of description language to indicate what is possible or should be done with it .
The reality is that a well - considered RESTful system usually does not require this concept .
This is difficult for SOAP developers to accept , but it has to do with the constraints of the architectural style .
Because we treat information resources as things to manipulate through a uniform interface ( the URL ! ) and restrict our efforts to a small set of verbs , there really is no need to describe the service .
If you find yourself confused on this point , it is probably an architectural smell that you are conflating manipulating resources with invoking arbitrary behavior .
The REST verbs provide the full set of operations to apply to an information resource .
Certainly , you need to know what information is being returned so you know how to process it , but that is what MIME types are for .
While it is usually preferable to reuse known types ( application / xml , image / png , etc. ) , many developers do not realize that they can create their own application - specific data types if necessary .
In the larger arc of this article series , we will address the problems of finding and binding arbitrary resources using rich metadata .
For now , we will simply keep in mind Roy 's underscoring of the importance of " hypertext as the engine of state transfer " ( obliquely referred to as " HATEOS " by RESTafarians ) .
This is perhaps the most misunderstood portion of the thesis .
To get its full implication , we need to revisit how the Web works .
You type a URL into the browser and it issues an HTTP GET request for that resource .
Invariably , the server responds with a bytestream , a response code ( usually 200 on success ) and a MIME type indicating that the response is HTML .
The browser decides it knows how to handle this type and parses the result into a document model of some sort .
Within that model , it finds references to other resources : links , images , scripts , style sheets , etc .
It treats each one differently , but it discovers them in the process of resolving the original resource .
There is no service description ; the browser , as a client , simply knows how to parse the result .
The same mechanism should be employed for RESTful services .
The URLs themselves should not be " magical " .
A client should not be required to know how to parse a URL or have any special knowledge of what one level in the hierarchy means over another one .
RESTful clients should retrieve a resource , investigate the returned MIME type and parse the result .
As such , a client should know how to parse the returned type .
For example , a client might receive a reference to the main RESTful service for the reporting service we described above :
http://company1.com/report/
If requested from a browser , it could return an HTML document that has references to :
http://company1.com/report/sales
which the user could click through to find a list of years to browse .
The point is that the browser has no special knowledge of the URL structure , but it knows how to parse the result and present the content to the user in a way she can explore .
The same can be true of other MIME type responses .
For example , requesting the 2009 quarterly reports as XML :
http://company1.com/reports/sales/2009/qtr
could yield :
< reports > < description > 2009 Quarterly Reports </ description > < report name = " First Quarter " src= " http://company1.com/reports/sales/2009/qtr/1 "/> < report name = " Second Quarter " src= " http://company1.com/reports/sales/2009/qtr/2 "/> < report name = " Third Quarter " src= " http://company1.com/reports/sales/2009/qtr/3 " /> </reports >
You can think of the URL as a vector through an information space .
Each level points you closer to the ultimate resource .
Different paths can yield the same results .
The client will have to know how to parse these results , but by giving the response an identifiable type , we can trigger the appropriate parser .
The structure can be spidered by descending through the references , or presented to a user to browse through some kind of interface .
A RESTful interface becomes a way for clients to ask for information based on what they know .
They start from a known or discovered point and browse the information like you browse the Web .
This is what HATEOS refers to .
The application state is transferred and discovered within the hypertext responses .
Just like the browser needs to know about HTML , images , sound files , etc. , a RESTful client will need to know how to parse the results of resolving a resource reference .
However , the entire process is simple , constrained , scalable and flexible -- exactly the properties we want from a networked software system .
Many people build " RESTful " systems that require the clients to know beforehand what each level in a URL means .
Should the information get reorganized on the server side , clients of those systems will break .
Clients that truly embody HATEOS are more loosely - coupled from the servers they communicate with .
Looking Forward
We struggle daily to solve the problems of rapidly changing domains , technologies , customer demands and actionable knowledge .
We spend too much time writing software to link what we learn to what we know .
Objects and databases have not kept pace with the changes we experience .
We need a new way of looking at the information we produce and consume that is extensible and less fragile than the solutions of the past .
We need technology to help us form consensus .
We should not have to achieve consensus in the form of common models before we can use our technologies .
In this article , we have introduced the series and have begun to look at how REST and Web technologies can serve as the basis of a new information - oriented architecture .
We have established a naming scheme that allows us to unify references to all manner of content , services and documents .
Clients can leverage the freedom to negotiate information into the form they want .
As they resolve references , they can discover new content connected through new relationships .
This architectural style and the technologies surrounding the Semantic Web combine nicely to create powerful , scalable , flexible software systems .
Their capacity to create Webs of Data will have as much impact on our lives as the Web has already had .
This will be an information systems revolution that will turn much of what we know on its head .
It will not only reduce the cost of data integration , but it will enable new business capabilities we can only begin to imagine .
We are moving into a world where information can be connected and used regardless of whether it is contained in documents , databases or is returned as the results of a RESTful service .
We will be able to discover content and connect it to what we already know .
We will be able to surface the data currently hidden behind databases , spreadsheets , reports and other silos .
Not only will we gain access to this information , we will be able to consume it in the ways we want to .
This is one of the main , modest goals of the Semantic Web .
Achieving it , as we are now able to do , is starting to change everything .
WASHINGTON  President Barack Obama plans to announce a new fee Thursday on the country 's biggest financial firms to recover up to $ 120 billion in taxpayers ' money used to prop up corporations during the economic crisis , a senior administration official said .
In proposing a multiyear levy on big banks , Obama is targeting an industry whose political deafness has vexed his administration .
Banks once threatened by the undertow of a Wall Street collapse are now posting profits and proposing robust bonuses for their executives .
The official who described the administration 's plans was not authorized to discuss the fee publicly and spoke only on condition of anonymity .
The $ 120 billion recovery goal is the most that administration officials expect to lose from the government 's $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program that bailed out banks , automakers and other financial firms .
Most of the TARP losses are expected to come from auto industry rescues and the bailout of insurance conglomerate American International Group Inc .
Details of the fee are expected to be spelled out when the president releases his 2011 budget next month .
Congress would have to approve any fee plan .
The proposed levy could put Obama on the popular side of public opinion that is decidedly against Wall Street and angry over shortfalls in a $ 700 billion bank bailout fund .
Obama 's announcement would come one day after the nation 's top bankers testify before the congressionally created Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission .
The hearings come at an ultra-sensitive time for the banking industry .
In addition to Obama 's fee proposal , Congress is writing a full - scale overhaul of financial regulations .
The bankers ' demeanor before the commission , the tone of the commission 's questions and the continuing inquiry could affect public perceptions and influence how lawmakers and the White House deal with the industry .
The administration official said Obama 's plan has been in the works since August and would seek modifications to the law that sent billions of dollars in bailout money in 2008 and 2009 to a flailing Wall Street that was approaching collapse .
The idea received an early boost from Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the top Democrat in the House , where there have been calls for a hefty tax on bank bonuses .
" While we have not seen any specific language from the administration , Congress will certainly examine any serious proposals to lower the deficit and recoup even more of the TARP funds for the taxpayers , " said Nadeam Elshami , a spokesman for Pelosi , D - Calif .
The 2008 law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program requires the president to seek a way to recoup unrecovered TARP money from financial institutions , but five years after the law was enacted .
It does not specify how the money should be recovered .
On Tuesday , the official said Obama 's economic team decided it was necessary to recover taxpayer losses more quickly than the law required .
The administration 's plan raises a series of questions .
Among them :
How will the fee be assessed ?
Administration officials already have ruled out a fee on financial transactions .
Also , will banks be required to pay for the billions of dollars in assistance the federal government gave General Motors , Chrysler LLC and AIG ?
An industry official said consideration of a levy now would be premature .
" Current law does n't trigger this tax proposal for another four years , " said Scott Talbott , chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable , an industry group for some of the largest financial firms .
" We look forward to seeing the details of the complexity of the formula , of who it 's applied to and what the assessment is based on and when it is applied , " he said .
Banks have been repaying their infusions , in part to get out from under compensation limits imposed on the bailout recipients .
Banks have also paid dividends from the government help .
According to the crisis - driven 2008 law that created the bailout fund , the status of TARP must be assessed by late 2013 , five years after it passed .
" In any case where there is a shortfall , " the statute says , " the president shall submit a legislative proposal that recoups from the financial industry an amount equal to the shortfall in order to ensure that the Troubled Asset Relief Program does not add to the deficit or national debt . "
Obama has been strident in his criticism of bankers , calling them " fat cats " last month in an interview that aired on the eve of their visit to the White House .
With public anger over the bailout still strong , Obama has embraced populist rhetoric in an effort to shame bank executives into paying back the government more quickly and their executives less lavishly .
Funds collected from such a levy would go to pay down the $ 1.4 trillion deficit amid the Obama - backed stimulus package and aid to Detroit 's automakers .
Washington spent about $ 245 billion to help banks in the Troubled Asset Relief Program , much less than President George W. Bush 's Treasury Department secured to keep financial firms afloat .
So far , $ 162 billion of that has been repaid , including $ 20 billion each from Citigroup and Bank of America under a special targeted program .

Hockey Hits , specifically hitting from behind has been on the NHL ’s agenda for quite some time , but NHL brass has yet to find a solution for this pesky , recurrent problem .
Kukla ’s Korner highlighted discrepancies in the handing out of suspensions by NHL brass last December .
Fighting in hockey has also been scrutinized , especially coming to the forefront with the unfortunate passing of Don Sanderson earlier this year from injuries suffered from a hockey fight .
Back in February , I had initially expressed my concern over the latest emerging epidemic in hockey – the retaliation after clean hockey hits .
With the recent demolishing but legal hit by Dion Phaneuf on Kyle Okposo ( see video below ) and subsequent retaliation on Phaneuf by the Islanders Pascal Morency , my concerns were again heightened .
In this incidence , the NHL has so far taken the necessary steps and has suspended Morency indefinitely to be reviewed in the near future .
We are left to wonder that the fact that he left the bench might be more of a determinant of why the NHL is going after him in this instance .
It will be interesting to see the outcome of this and if the NHL ’s brass ’ actions are consistent in the future .
As a Flames writer , to show I am not biased on this issue , here is another example involving Rene Bourque attacking Tyler Sloan after his fantastic , vicious clean hit on Daymond Langkow .
Bourque should have been punishing more heftily for this dangerous play .
I like Bourque ’s enthusiasm and his willingness to stick up for and defend his teammates , but with the physical players the Flames have , Bourque should have kept his cool , take Sloan ’s number and pay him back in the “ eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth ” fashion – that is , lay a hit on him so that his coach feels it !
Here ’s a rundown of the usual course of events of the NHL ’s latest epidemic :
The Cause : vicious , but clean , legal hockey hits .
The Symptoms :
An immediate retaliation by the teammate of the victim who was rocked by the above mentioned hit .
The Disease : A player making one of the most exciting plays in hockey , that is : a clean , jarring hit , needlessly and wrongly becoming the victim .
The Cure : Harsher penalties / suspensions by NHL disciplinary officials .
Okay , in the heat of battle , tempers do flare .
I get that and can relate , being an intense competitor myself when partaking in anything from a rec ball hockey game to facing off in a game of NHL 09 on Playstation .
However , when a guy has to defend or stand up for himself immediately after landing a perfectly clean , crushing hit , this is getting annoying and could lead to another potential dangerous situation .
Often after a player delivers such a blow , he is momentarily defenceless , comparable to being hit from behind , when the teammate of the victim immediately starts his attack .
Of course , there are times when it is borderline whether or not bone - jarring hockey hits are clean or dirty .
Nonetheless , it should be left up to the officials or even the NHL higher brass to make that call .
Of course , easier said than done .
Whatever happened to taking a player ’s number and getting payback later in the game or even in the season , but all within the framework of the rules ?
Hitting is obviously a major part of sports like football and rugby .
How do players respond in those respective sports when a tremendous hit is laid ?
Teammates take numbers and revenge can indeed be sweet , but in most circumstances , within the confines of the rules .
Again , sticking up for teammates – good .
But …a player getting punished for performing one of the most exciting plays in hockey – NOT acceptable !
George Johnson ( Calgary Herald ) wrote a ridiculous column after the Phaneuf on Okposo hit that incredibly echoes the sentiments of many a hockey fan .
Johnson thinks Phaneuf should “ stand up ” after making such vicious hits .
Are you kidding me ?!?
Phaneuf ’s expectations from his coaching staff is to no doubt be a physically menacing presence , including utilizing his abilty to dish out crunching hits .
I ’m willing to bet though , that Brent Sutter and staff encourage and enforce that Phaneuf stay out of the ensueing melee that unfolds after one of these hits .
The Flames do n’t need Dion in the sin bin for any more than he needs to be !
I ’m also willing to wager that Phaneuf has fear for nobody or next to nobody that dons a NHL uniform .
A devoted hockey and Islander fan emailed me after this hit and said , although he hated to admit it , it was a vicious , but clean hit .
He also was disgusted by the idea a hockey player should have to fight another teammate of the victim after dishing out demolishing hockey hits .
I could n’t agree more .
Scott Stevens is a name that keeps being brought up .
No doubt Stevens could dish out the hits comparable to Pete Rose and stand up for himself effortlessly without fear of anyone .
However , I do n’t seem to recall Stevens ever leading the league in fighting majors , and , in fact , correct me if I ’m wrong , but rarely did he have the need to defend himself in a fight after a hit .
Of course , the argument can be made he had built up his reputation and his intimidation factor .
I think it was more about respect for each other by players in the generation Stevens played in .
How exactly should these offences be penalized ?
While I do n’t have an exact answer for that , each situation should be reviewed individually , of course .
Having said that , the punishment needs to act as an effective deterrent , whether it be a 10 or 20 game suspension of the offending player .
I would also like to see a coach or team fine tacked on as well .
Then the organization is more accountable for player ’s actions and will be forced to deal with it internaly how it sees fit to prevent such incidents .
Curtis Stock , of the Edmonton Journal , had an interesting , if not far - fetched answer to help defeat the hits from behind epidemic .
“ Following a suspension , a team is penalized the amount of games their player has been suspended in penalty minutes to start the next game . ”
I ’m not so sure a play in one game should effect the outcome of another subsequent game that directly though .
But it does spark an “ outside the box ” type of thinking and discussion on how to deal with these problematic issues .
About a week ago , NHL.com posted an article on how “ National Academy of Neuropsychology ( NAN ) and National Athletic Trainers ’ Association ( NATA ) team up on campaign to raise concussion awareness ” in hockey .
“ As a centerpiece of the NAN and NATA efforts , a 12 - minute educational video titled ‘ Concussions in Hockey : Signs , Symptoms and Playing Safe , ’ has now been released nationally .
The video , sponsored by the National Hockey League and the NHL Players ’ Association , features comments from Mike Modano of the Dallas Stars and retired NHL players Pat LaFontaine and Eric Lindros . ”
I am all for initiatives such as these , but you have to first and foremost get to the heart of the problem .
The NHL and NHLPA brass should be tackling issues such as hitting from behind and attacks after a clean hit more aggressively and effectively .
Overview
uncertainties allows calculations such as ( 2 +/- 0.1 ) * 2 = 4 +/- 0.2 to be performed transparently .
Much more complex mathematical expressions involving numbers with uncertainties can also be evaluated directly .
The uncertainties package takes the pain and complexity out of uncertainty calculations .

In comments on Psalm 14 , John Calvin writes :
The fool hath said .
As the Hebrew word נבל , nabal , signifies not only a fool , but also a perverse , vile , and contemptible person , it would not have been unsuitable to have translated it so in this place ; yet I am content to follow the more generally received interpretation , which is , that all profane persons , who have cast off all fear of God and abandoned themselves to iniquity , are convicted of madness ( emphasis is Jim's ) .
Well said , John .
Atheism is insanity .
Hence , there ’s no more point in arguing with ( or even discussing things with ) an atheist than there is in walking into an insane asylum and attempting to carry on a lucid conversation with persons utterly devoid of the gift of lucidity .

Jim
West anyone ?
After all , look what he thinks of atheists :
He wrote : I venture to say Jim West just does n't personally know an atheist .
What a complete intellectual buffoon to be quoting with approval the writings of someone who sanctioned the killing of heretics .
If Jim West had the political power does anyone doubt what he'd do with it ?
There 's no point talking with someone as deluded as this .
As far as I know he 's more pleased I 'm linking to him so his rankings go up .
That seems to mean more to him than anything .
Sheesh .
Beck is a fake revolutionary who has hijacked the freedom movement and is being used to lead conservatives and libertarians down the rabbit hole
Paul Joseph Watson & Alex Jones
Prison Planet.com
Monday , January 25 , 2010
Glenn Beck is being characterized by the establishment as the leader of the freedom movement and yet a closer analysis of his ideology reveals that Beck is nothing more than a fake revolutionary who has supported and is pushing policies that are diametrically opposed to those embraced by true constitutionalists .
Beck and Fox News have hijacked the patriot movement and are leading conservatives and libertarians down a meaningless partisan rabbit hole in a clear attempt to neutralize genuine opposition to the big government agenda of the Obama administration .
It is important to stress that we are not picking a fight with Glenn Beck or Fox News in general as a crude effort to garner attention .
Glenn
Beck routinely attacks real libertarians , Ron Paul supporters , and those who would define themselves as constitutionalists .
We are constantly forced to rebut his smears against people in the freedom movement while Beck claims to be one of us .
Indeed , Judge Andrew Napolitano , who also appears on Fox News , is an example of a real constitutionalist and we are in full agreement with his views .
As the video below illustrates , despite the fact that Beck claims to be “ a Libertarian at heart , ” he has publicly supported programs and legislation that are universally abhorred by the vast majority of libertarians , such as the banker bailout and the USA Patriot Act .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Beck has also been aggressively pushing for new taxes in order to pay for the bailout that he supported .
On December 4 , he appeared on fellow neo-con Bill O’Reilly ’s show to promote a 2 percent VAT tax to be adopted that would go directly to pay down the national debt .
While lending support to the Tea Party movement out of one side of his mouth , out of the other Beck is promoting the exact thing they are protesting against – more taxes .
Beck is not a real libertarian , he is a performing circus act who is being positioned as a clown to discredit issues that the genuine freedom movement embraces , such as exposing the fact that man-made global warming is a fraud .
Certainly , on several issues Beck jives with populist sentiment , but on all the major fronts – war , the patriot act , warrantless spying , the bailout , and new taxes , he is nothing more than a shill for big government .
Beck ’s agenda is to put out a dual message – to discredit and polarize the conservative movement to the benefit of the two party monopoly .
His bizarre and clownish antics of fake crying , which were proven to be staged when Beck replicated them on demand for a GQ photo shoot , are doing nothing but reinforcing the stereotype that the freedom movement is extreme and unbalanced .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Beck ’s entire 9/12 project has nothing to do with uniting America and everything to do with reinforcing neo-conservative rhetoric about how we should relinquish our rights and accept the police state because terrorists want to attack us and Saddam Hussein had WMD ’s and yellowcake .
During his Monday September 22 2008 TV broadcast , Beck expressed his vehement support for the bailout , stating , “ The $ 700 billion dollars that you ’re hearing about now is not only I believe necessary , it is also not nearly enough . ”
However , as soon as Bush left office and Obama picked up the baton and continued the same financial policy , he changed his tune and routinely attacked the bailout as an example of how socialism was taking over America .
The bailout was bad news for America under Bush just as it is under Obama , both were merely performing a transfer of wealth from America to offshore banks and giving the Federal Reserve total dictatorial control over the economy , but Beck only opposed it when Bush was out of office , proving that his opinions are not wedded to right or wrong , but to which puppet is in the White House .
A host of mainline conservative talking heads opposed the banker bailout , as did the majority of the American people , but Beck went on television and publicly supported it .
This is irreconcilable with Beck being “ a libertarian at heart ” as he claims .
In addition , Beck aggressively attacked Ron Paul and his supporters during the election campaign when it looked like the Texan Congressman might have a real chance of winning the nomination .
Beck implied that Ron Paul supporters were domestic terrorists and should be dealt with by the U.S. Army , but later tried to side with Ron Paul supporters when the infamous and discredited MIAC report echoed his own talking point that people who support Ron Paul were dangerous .
The smear came during a November 2007 show when Beck was on CNN .
Alongside ex-Marxist David Horowitz , Beck demonized Ron Paul supporters , libertarians and the anti-war left as terrorist sympathizers and inferred that the U.S. military should be used to silence them , parroting a talking point that traces back to a September 2006 White House directive .
When asked about the issue , Ron Paul dismissed Beck as “ pretty discourteous ” and a “ demagogue ” .
Beck has also worked with government propagandists Popular Mechanics in an effort to “ debunk ” the existence of internment camps in America .
Beck ’s hit piece consisted of setting up a straw man argument while ignoring the manifestly provable evidence that such facilities exist and that they are admittedly being prepared to house citizens during times of civil unrest .
Beck has ceaselessly attacked 9/11 truthers as dangerous extremists , echoing precisely talking points put out by Obama information czar Cass Sunstein .
Just last week Beck said on his nationally syndicated radio show that there are 9/11 truth activists in the White House and they threaten the life of Obama .
The fact that Beck is repeating White House talking points to demonize political adversaries of the administration proves that his image as an anti-establishment guru is a manufactured fraud .
Beck has been a vehement cheerleader for the wars of aggression launched since 9/11 and in addition called for Iran to be attacked , claiming that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is preparing a “ second holocaust . ”
Once again , these political opinions stand completely contrary to libertarian principles , which follow the founding fathers ’ view that an expansionist aggressive foreign policy is bad for America .
Beck has attacked Obama for unraveling the Bush war machine , when in fact Obama has done everything in his power to expand Bush ’s wars , beefing the campaigns in Afghanistan and Pakistan while removing a token amount of troops from Iraq and replacing them with an even greater number of contractors .
By attacking Obama for being different to Bush , when in reality he offers no change whatsoever , Beck keeps people locked in the left - right paradigm and ensures that instead of coming to the realization that the whole system is rigged , they will merely vote in another puppet for the new world order in 2012 .
Beck is the perfect example of controlled opposition , he is there to co-opt and ensure the Tea Parties are under control and that they never focus on taking on the real power behind the American economy – the Federal Reserve .
Glenn
Beck is a fake revolutionary whose job it is to lead conservatives and libertarians away from uniting behind the real issues , while absorbing the successes of the patriot movement and in turn discrediting it by way of his clownish antics and easily derided mannerisms .
He is part of a wider approach on behalf of Fox News to become a beacon for freedom movement and then act as a steam valve for its issues , deluding people into thinking their interests are being represented when in reality they are merely being sucked up and spewed out as something entirely misrepresentative .
It is vital that we alert the freedom movement to the fact that Beck is a wolf in sheep ’s clothing , and one must only scratch beneath the surface to discover that his true political standpoint is the complete opposite of that embraced by true constitutionalists .
If we continue to let Beck and Fox News pose as our leaders the entire movement will crash and burn because we will be allowing the foxes to guard the henhouse .

Used Originally :
" You are REALLY pushing the envelope , and as a result , a plane is going to explode . "
You'd be forgiven for thinking that the " envelope " in question is a paper one , but you 'd be wrong .
It 's mathematical .
Now , you may think that by adding math to an article that 's already about words and history that we 've officially thrown ourselves into a perfect storm of perpetual nerd virginity , but first hear us out .
Mathematics is used to calculate a plane 's limits in a construct called its " flight envelope . "
That is , the particular combination of speed , height , stress and other aeronautical factors that form the bounds of safe operation .
Go beyond these limits , or " push " the " envelope , " and you 'll be dancing into the danger zone where the dancer becomes the dance , and the plane becomes a giant fireball .

Test pilots , of course , have to push the flight envelope all the time .
By flying a plane beyond its mathematical limits , they can check that it 'll be safe when flown within its limits and find out what parts might fail if the limits are pushed , all while running the risk of having the plane burst into flames .
There 's also the rarely spoken about unofficial risk of having the moon collide with the plane as a result of the strong , gravitational pull brought on by the pilot 's massive , massive balls .
TSA Publishes Standard Operating Procedures
BoingBoing is pretty snarky :
The TSA has published a “ redacted ” version of their s00 per s33 kr1t screening procedure guidelines ( Want to know whether to frisk a CIA operative at the checkpoint ?
Now you can ! ) .
Unfortunately , the security geniuses at the DHS do n’t know that drawing black blocks over the words you want to eliminate from your PDF does n’t actually make the words go away , and can be defeated by nefarious al Qaeda operatives through a complex technique known as ctrl - a / ctrl - c / ctrl -v .
Thankfully , only the most elite terrorists would be capable of matching wits with the technology brilliance on display at the agency charged with defending our nation ’s skies by ensuring that imaginary hair - gel bombs are kept off of airplanes .
TSA is launching a “ full review ” to determine how this could have happened .
I ’ll save them the effort : someone screwed up .
In a statement Tuesday night , the TSA sought to minimize the impact of the unintentional release — calling the document “ outdated , ” “ unclassified ” and unimplemented — while saying that it took the incident “ very seriously , ” and “ took swift action ” when it was discovered .
Yeah , right .
The original link to the document is dead , but here ’s the unredacted document .
I ’ve skimmed it , and have n’t found anything terribly interesting .
Here ’s what Wired.com noticed :
One of the redacted sections , for example , indicates that an armed law enforcement officer in or out of uniform may pass beyond the checkpoint without screening after providing a U.S. government - issued photo ID and “ Notice of LEO Flying Armed Document . ”
Some commercial airline pilots receive training by the U.S. Marshals Service and are allowed to carry TSA - issued firearms on planes .
They can pass through without screening only after presenting “ bonafide credentials and aircraft operator photo ID , ” the document says .
Foreign dignitaries equivalent to cabinet rank and above , accompanying a spouse , their children under the age of 12 , and a State Department escort are exempt from screening .
There are also references to a CIA program called WOMAP , the Worldwide Operational Meet and Assist Program .
As part of WOMAP , foreign dignitaries and their escorts — authorized CIA representatives — are exempt from screening , provided they ’re approved in advance by TSA ’s Office of Intelligence .
Passengers carrying passports from Cuba , Iran , North Korea , Libya , Syria , Sudan , Afghanistan , Lebanon , Somalia , Iraq , Yemen or Algeria are to be designated for selective screening .
Although only a few portions of the document were redacted , the manual contains other tidbits that were n’t redacted , such as a thorough description of diplomatic pouches that are exempt from screening .
I ’m a little bit saddened when we all make a big deal about how dumb people are at redacting digital documents .
We ’ve had a steady stream of these badly redacted documents , and I do n’t want to lose that .

A female conductor is still seen as such a novelty in the UK , yet one of our most internationally acclaimed maestros is a woman
Julia Jones rightly upbraided me when I interviewed her for tomorrow 's Music Matters on Radio 3 .
" It 's only in England that I get asked questions like this " , she said , whereas in Portugal , or Vienna , or Berlin , or even America , it 's not an issue .
Have n't heard of her ?
You should have .
Julia Jones is one of Britain 's most successful conductors – it's just that she 's made her entire career in the continent and the rest of the world rather than in the UK .
Born in Droitwich , brought up on the Isle of Man , and schooled at Chetham 's specialist music school , the Guildhall and the National Opera Studio , Jones left Britain for a job as a repetiteur at the opera house in Cologne .
And she has n't looked back .
She worked her way through the German system , from rehearsal pianist to assistant conductor , eventually running her own opera house in Ulm ( the same place that Herbert von Karajan started his career ) .
She 's now chief conductor of the San Carlo Opera House in Lisbon and its symphony orchestra , she frequently works at the Vienna State Opera , conducting the musicians who play as the Vienna Philharmonic when they give orchestral concerts , and she 's a regular guest in Berlin , in Hamburg , and all over Italy .
Now 48 , Jones is making her debut at Covent Garden , with a revival of Jonathan Miller 's production of Mozart 's Cosi fan Tutte .
You can probably guess the line of questioning that had been annoying her in interviews she 's been giving to the British press : her gender , and the sexual politics she has inadvertently had to face in her career , like , for example , when the Italians made a fuss of her being the first woman to conduct Wagner there .
( Mozart or Rossini would not have been a story , but the perceived Teutonic machismo of Wagner was another matter . )
The reasons that conductors ' gender is still an issue for us are twofold : there are still too few female conductors in charge of orchestras ( apart from Jane Glover at the Royal Academy of Music , there are no women currently in posts high up the orchestral or operatic hierarchy anywhere in Britain ) , and the methods and opportunities for training conductors here are pitifully patchy .
That lack of opportunity allows the cliched image of the male , tousle - haired maestro to perpetuate itself unchecked , and means , according to Jones , that there are proportionally fewer female conducting students in the UK than in the US , Portugal or China .
In Lisbon , half of the six conducting jobs in the city are taken by women – which makes Jones remarkably unremarkable over there , and allows her to concentrate on musical questions rather than what should be outdated sexual politics .
That ratio is also , of course , the ideal gender balance .
Despite the work of Glover with the London Mozart Players , Sian Edwards at English National Opera , and American conductor Marin Alsop at the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra over the past couple of decades , we 're still an embarrassingly long way off that in the UK .
Just months after rushing to order enough swine - flu vaccine to protect their citizens , European governments are cancelling orders and trying to sell or give away extra doses as they sit on a glut of the vaccine .
The main reason : European health officials decided that only one shot per person was needed , instead of the two originally planned .
Low demand is also to blame .
Many Europeans believe the pandemic has turned out to be fairly mild , and do n't see a reason to get vaccinated .
Some are also concerned that they will suffer ...
The European autoblogosphere is buzzing today with more details about legendary Porsche tuner Gemballa 's latest creation .
After years of modifying the flat engined sports cars from Zuffenhausen , Uwe Gemballa has turned his attention south to Maranello and a Ferrari Enzo .
We 're not saying it 's Darth Vader approved , but the new Gemballa MIG - U1 , is …uhhh … well … probably best if everybody just kept their opinions to themselves .
Underneath the exterior modifications we 're guessing will cause some screaming amongst the Ferrari faithful , the modified Enzo includes a boosted engine to 700 horsepower thanks to a new exhaust and reworked ECU .
Roughly 35 pounds of the all important un - sprung weight has been shaved from the forged wheels in another effort to increase performance .
The exterior , which has been called jet fighter inspired , stormtrooperish , and simply ugly , does include practical aerodynamic improvements .
Gemballa says will increase downforce 77 pounds at the front and 187 pounds at the rear .
For those times when you need to clear a driveway and clearance is more important than downforce , a button will raise the body of the MIG - U1 a few inches to keep the scraping to a minimum .
But do n't think all of Gemballa 's efforts were performance minded .
Inside the limited edition car , connoisseurs will find a custom leather interior made to each individual customer 's , ummm , taste .
Following the sports car minimalist tradition , owners will enjoy a multimedia center complete with a seven inch touch - screen control and a 950 - watt stereo with a subwoofer between the seats .
After all , who would want to listen to a Ferrari V - 12 all day ?
Only 25 of these MIG - U1's will be made and no price has been announced .
You can go to the company 's microsite to choose your color .
Let us know when your MIG arrives so we can come and have a look at it in person .

" [ A child ] does not despise real woods because he has read of enchanted woods : the reading makes all real woods a little enchanted .
This is a special kind of longing . "
-- C.S. Lewis , On Three Ways of Writing for Children
Writing about videogames is not generally the stuff of Woodward and Bernstein .
Occasionally , a hostile public relations manager will make your life difficult , or you 'll lose a scoop to a rival publication .
Trying to get a good interview while a game 's in development can be challenging , especially if that game is n't in its official PR swing yet .
But for the most part , this is the entertainment industry :
The consumers want to read about it , the producers want to talk about it , and the rest is just details .
So it was with some surprise that I encountered a wall of fear and paranoia when I called around , asking developers to talk about religion in gaming .
What I found is a small handful of people who think about the issues a lot , and wanted desperately to be part of the conversation ... and a vast , silent majority who did n't want to touch the topic with the proverbial 10 - foot pole .
" There can not be a hotter potato than this hot potato , " explains Peter Molyneux , Creative Director of Microsoft Game Studios Europe and Lionhead Studios , and one of the brave few not only willing , but , to talk about issues of faith .
" Religion is one of those things where -- if you 're specific about it -- you 're going to get yourself into a mountain of trouble , " he suggests .
" You have to be very , very careful .
" It 's a touch ironic that he seems so cautious .
As one of the earliest developers of so - called God games ( the Populous and Black & White series ) , he started his career in the realm of belief .
In those games , players take on the role of God , seeking to engender belief in the hearts of primitive populations , and generally messing with their lives through divine intervention .
But Molyneux is quick to point out a critical difference between talking about faith and talking about organized religion .
"
If you look at what Assassin 's Creed or a lot of Japanese games do , I think they 're talking about how Man has corrupted a pure and simple and wonderful message : ' Hey , be nice !
Someone loves you !
God loves you !' " he says .
But how carefully can developers dance back and forth across that line in the sand , between commentary and offense ?
Clearly , God -- the divine as a concept -- plays a huge role in modern gaming .
Virtually every fantasy role - playing game , from World of Warcraft to the simplest roguelike , explicitly includes the divine in the form of priests calling down healing prayers or smiting evil foes .
How , then , does this square against the subtext of games like Assassin 's Creed II , which -- on close reading -- can be parsed as a kind of atheist screed ?
( Unsurprisingly , after extensive e-mail negotiations , AC2 developer / publisher Ubisoft refused to discuss the matter in any way , sticking to the disclaimer that runs at the front of their game -- which states that it was crafted by people of many backgrounds and faiths . )
How do we reconcile this ?
Is the divine -- a present and supernatural divine -- only OK when it 's a convenient mechanic , but relegated to the corner with a dunce cap , suitable only for mockery , when it comes to the idea of actual faith ?
Wizards of the Coast 's James Wyatt is one of the rare people in the broader game industry that has street cred on both sides of the issue .
Wyatt 's best known as the design manager for the Dungeons & Dragons pen-and - paper game .
He 's also written numerous fictional novels set in the D&D world of Eberron , and co-authored the game 's sourcebook on gods , he's a former preacher -- a minister for the United Methodist Church .
He thinks the fantasy worlds presented in our games are the perfect place to play with God .
" Games are n't a place where you are expected to cling to a belief in something that can't be seen or proven , " Wyatt explains .
" It 's a world where the power of gods is demonstrated daily . [ ']
Gandalf was -- almost literally -- Jesus walking around with the adventuring party . "
I 'll admit to being somewhat shocked when Wyatt , in a calm and fatherly tone , explains how awesome it was to cast aside the preconceptions of our shared faith : " Fantasy has this ability to open our eyes to the enchantment of our world , and to view real things with more wonder .
" To illustrate his point , Wyatt invokesauthor ( and notable Christian scholar ) C.S. Lewis : For days after my conversation with Wyatt , as I simultaneously fumed over the gaming industry 's reticence to discuss the topic , I played through games that inspired that kind of wonder in me -- everything from Turbine 's Lord of the Rings Online to Daniel Benmergui 's Today I Die -- and I tried to open myself up to this kind of enchantment .
And then the demo for EA 's upcoming Dante 's Inferno dropped .
A UN watchdog has called for a new international agreement on privacy following a review of the expanding global array of surveillance measures and databases advanced by governments in the cause of counter - terrorism .
The special rapporteur on human rights , Martin Scheinin , said the UN should create a " a global declaration on data protection and data privacy " in response .
His report , delivered to the UN's Human Rights Council , describes the expansion of watchlists , border checks , financial data sharing , interception of communications , biometrics and ID registers in recent years .
" States no longer limit exceptional surveillance schemes to combating terrorism and instead make these surveillance powers available for all purposes , " he added .
" Most worrying , however , is that these technologies and policies are being exported to other countries and often lose even the most basic protections in the process . "
He singled out UK police 's stop and search powers as a worrying example , questioning whether they are " really necessary in a democratic society " .
The European Court of Human Rights - which is not an EU institution - earlier this month ruled that section 44 of the Terrorism Act , which allows police to stop and search without grounds for suspicion , was illegal .
Alan Johnson said the government would appeal .
Scheinin noted that parliaments had generally been given little opportunity to debate such counter - terrorism powers .

Health check : Red Hat -
This year 's model
By Richard Hillesley
Red Hat has long been the poster child of Linux and open source , the distribution that has been there since the beginning , grew up right , got all the luck , usually made the right decisions , and fetched up on top of the pile .
Staying at the top of the pile may present a different set of problems .
Free and open source software has made its presence felt , the operating system has become increasingly commoditised , free software is rising up the stack , cloud computing and virtualisation are transforming the market for operating systems , and open source ( in some form or another ) is being adopted or proclaimed by many different companies .
In a changing market the operating system may not be enough .
Red
Hat has to stay ahead of the game , or play catch up where it can , which is why it has moved into middleware with JBoss and acquired Qumranet and its virtualisation software , KVM .
JBoss , in conjunction with Linux and KVM , gives Red Hat perfect leverage into the cloud , which is where the operating system may be going .
JBoss uses free software licenses , albeit the LGPL , and KVM has been included in the Linux kernel as of version 2.6.20s .
Imitators & clones
Even then , Red Hat has to stay on its toes .
Its Linux and ' open source ' competitors are not standing still , and are pushing Linux and open source further up the stack and putting their software on alternative versions of Linux , or in some cases , on clones of Red Hat 's own enterprise - hardened versions of Linux such as CentOS .
This can be done because Linux is free software , and Red Hat recognises this as both a pro and a con of its business model .
From Red
Hat 's point of view Red Hat wins because it provides a better quality of service .
If you have a Red Hat subscription or you pay for the maintenance and upkeep of your JBoss installation , you get extra benefits , access to the original developers , instant response from Red Hat 's security teams , rapid updates , and a better all - round experience , or so the theory goes .
There is of course nothing to stop you trying Novell or CentOS , Oracle , SpringSource or any other service provider to see if they can provide a better model for supporting your software , or its near equivalent .
As a vendor there are two perspectives you can take on this .
One is that the competition is bad .
The other is that it puts you on your toes and makes you more competitive .
Red
Hat has remained relatively sanguine in the face of imitators and clones and sees advantage in the model it uses .
Rivals may flinch , look for ' mixed source ' solutions or make deals with antagonists , but Red Hat remains more or less true to its founding idea .

Note :
When letter writers sign with their first names instead of a pseudonym or nickname , I randomly change their name for added anonymity .
Hello Richard ,
Thank you for taking the time to read my email , I sincerely hope that you are able to answer it .
My situation is this , my fiancé and I are both in our mid-twenties , and atheists .
He is an only child with parents who are not religious in the slightest .
My family …. well , they ’re Mormon .
Very Mormon .
I have been openly atheist to my family for three years ( took two years to get the courage to do this , and to get out of their financial influence ) and they still do n’t respect my beliefs .
They claim to love me , but they continually mention their religion around me and mock my principles both political and religious .
Recently , I asked my mother with utmost kindness and respect that she speak to the family about respecting my opinions when my fiancé and I are around .
She grudgingly , after much uncalled for theatrics , claimed that the family would do so .
Here is where I am in the wrong : I did n’t trust that my mother forwarded my message to the family because , well , I expected to be getting some angry calls / emails about it despite how much I labored over that message to make it respectful and non-combative .
So , in my weakness and suspicion , I hacked into her email and saw that she wrote an extremely offensive , condescending and outright petty email about me to my siblings claiming I had gotten very angry with her and that my demands were “ childish ” and that if the family showed me Christly love , that I would eventually “ come around ” and that she “ wanted to strangle me ” sometimes .
I find this deeply offensive , especially given how I have made special efforts to be kind to her ever since I moved out a few years ago because I still wanted a relationship with the family .
My fiancé and friends all think I am too nice to them , and I think I agree now .
I obviously can’t reveal to her what I read , as reading her email was absolutely and utterly wrong of me to do , but I ca n’t exactly believe her or my family anymore when they say they love and respect me …. knowing how they REALLY feel about me .
I feel as if I do not have a family of my own anymore .
I have my fiance , in - laws and friends , but I love my parents and siblings and nothing can replace them , but I can not be around toxic people who do not respect me…respect is very important to me …and I do n’t see myself having a relationship with them without it , but I ca n’t make them give up their deep felt hatred of me and my atheism either .
Any advice to help me deal with this loss would be appreciated .
Sincere thanks ,
Alice
Dear Alice ,
There ’s an old saying , “ If you want something done right , do it yourself . ”
I can understand your wanting your mother to act in the role of a diplomat , using her credibility and influence to appeal to the rest of the family to treat you and your fiancé with courtesy .
Unfortunately , to do that she would have to actually want there to be a reconciliation based on mutual acceptance instead of a reconciliation based on you complying entirely with her wishes .
Instead , she mischaracterized you , and it appears that she was more interested in gathering more family agreement with her opinion of you than in fostering understanding .
Her suggestion that they show you “ Christly love ” may be why you did n’t get the negative blowback from them that you expected .
One very important thing to sort out is the difference between respecting your beliefs and treating you respectfully .
Let go of the former , and demand the latter .
They ’re never going to respect your beliefs , any more than you will ever respect theirs .
You think their beliefs are absurd , and they have a similar opinion of yours .
However , you can still treat them respectfully as persons , and they can show you the same courtesy .
Remember , you are not your beliefs , any more than you are your clothes or your other possessions .
You were a person before you had these particular beliefs , a person just as deserving of respectful treatment as you are now .
Your beliefs are important to you , but they do not define you , they only distinguish you .
What you actually are is what you actually do .
Live , act and behave respectably , and respect others for their respectable behavior .
In this way , agreeing or disagreeing about beliefs becomes unimportant .
They can be set aside in favor of being loving , warm and respectful .
Those are all doings , actions , behaviors .
You are what you do .
Thoughts , opinions and beliefs cannot tilt the most sensitive scale .
They are insubstantial .
They are not you , they are not others .
During the time that has passed since you wrote to me , if their “ Christly love ” has manifested itself as treating you and your fiancé with graciousness and decency , refraining from the mockery and deliberate emphasis of touchy subjects , then great !
Enjoy the affection of a mature family that can value people over opinions .
Then there ’s no need to read further .
However , the family gatherings may still be filled with passive - aggressive remarks or thinly disguised disdain , or “ the chill ” may still be difficult to tolerate .
At the end of your letter you speak in a tone of grief , as if all hope for any relationship is lost .
Perhaps not quite yet .
Your relationship with your mother seems to be currently entangled in a power struggle .
She wants you to comply , to obey , to return to the faith , and that is simply out of the question for you .
So she will be the last person to give up the manipulations and the divisive tactics .
Your siblings on the other hand , may be more open to accepting you .
If you still wish to , you can still take action on this .
You can make another attempt to express yourself , but this time directly to the whole family .
The fact that you know about your mother ’s misrepresentation by hacking into her email does n’t matter .
Yes , it was wrong .
Now forget about it .
Your explanation for taking this direct action would simply be because nothing has improved .
Do n’t even mention the conversation you had with your mother .
If someone asks , say that you had spoken to her about your concerns , but for some unknown reason , nothing had changed .
Then leave it alone .
A direct , all - at - once letter to every person in the family would prevent anyone from being able to mischaracterize it to others .
Revise your original respectful and non-combative message , the one that never got forwarded to them .
Tell them that you love them and that you would like to be able to feel loved and accepted by them .
Make it warmhearted , but not pleading .
You come with open arms but not on your knees .
Tell them that your love for them does not require that they change their beliefs , and that they should not require such a price of you .
Explain how all of you can treat each other with respect and warmth even if you disagree on certain things .
Include some specific suggestions about how you can “ get along ” at family gatherings , such as by talking about the things you have in common rather than the things on which you differ .
Conclude with your hopes of being part of a family that supports each other without demanding that everyone see things exactly the same , a family that simply gives love freely , rather than uses love as a way to persuade someone about an opinion or belief .
Of course , it may not work .
But since you sound like you ’re about to declare your relationships dead at the scene , you do n’t seem to have much to lose by trying .
Maybe one of your siblings will become more relaxed and accepting of you , maybe others will follow suit in different degrees .
Maybe in time they will prevail upon your mother to soften , rather than the other way around , as you had originally hoped .
Alice , you are creating a new family that is quite different from the one that created you .
This says a great deal about your intelligence and strength of character .
I applaud your values of kindness and respect , and I am sure that you will bestow those values onto all of your loved ones , and everyone who comes into contact with you .
How much they let in is up to them .
Richard
At a glance , it ’s obvious that the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary , published in the fall to worldwide lexicographic acclaim , took a lot of work .
The two thick blue volumes sort roughly 920,000 words into 797,120 meanings and organize those meanings into 236,400 numbered categories and subcategories .
Like Peter Mark Roget ’s famous thesaurus , first issued in 1852 , the H.T.O.E.D. not only lists synonyms but also provides what its editors call a “ modified folk taxonomy ” of English ’s meanings — carefully placing deity , for example , among the supernatural elements of the external world , while slotting worship among the manifestations of faith in the social world .
It draws on the second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary , as well as a few Old English sources .
The task of dicing up the O.E.D. and reassembling it into the H.T.O.E.D. took 44 years , and most of the intellectual labor was performed by humans , working with pencils and slips of paper .
A 1978 fire would have proved disastrous if the slips had not been stored in metal drawers in metal filing cabinets .
It ’s not immediately apparent , however , what the H.T.O.E.D. is for .
Like Roget ’s , it could be used by a hack to tart up his prose .
Indeed , consulting the two volumes , an inferior writer may come to know himself by the names paper - blurrer , feather - driver , blotter , squitter - pulp , spoil - paper and penster .
Unfortunately , no one uses these names any more , and rare is the editor indulgent enough to permit an ink - dabbler to be indifferent to currency .
But archaism , it turns out , is the point of the H.T.O.E.D. , which includes outmoded words as well as contemporary ones and indicates when words came into and fell out of use .
The equivalents for “ inferior writer ” mentioned above , for instance , all flourished in Shakespeare ’s day .
Did the golden age of English poetry somehow call forth a treasury of antiwriter invective ?
The H.T.O.E.D. is designed to occasion such speculations .
What does it mean that in Old English there were 40 words for the Christian God in his capacity as ruler ( e.g. , wundorcyning ) , whereas today we have just six ( e.g. , the Almighty ) ?
Why were there 44 ways to call someone wise in Old English , but we can add only that he is sage or judicious ?
Whereas a dictionary makes it possible to follow the history of a word , a historical thesaurus — the H.T.O.E.D. claims to be the world ’s first , in any language — makes it possible to follow the history of a meaning .
It ’s like watching an actor try on new costumes and shed old ones , or like cruising down a river that in one stretch narrows to a rapids and at another broadens to a marsh .
With a little effort , a historical thesaurus can even serve as a vehicle for a kind of linguistic time travel .
“ For any given period in the past , ” the editors write , “ the user should be able to ascertain the exact state of the vocabulary ( i.e. , the ‘ lexical system ’ ) which existed at that time . ”

British woman ‘ arrested in Dubai after being ’ raped
Published by onlines on January 8 , 2010
A BRITISH woman on a break in Dubai went to police after being raped – but SHE was arrested for having illegal sex .
The 23 - year - old Londoner was attacked by a waiter in a hotel toilet after celebrating her engagement to her boyfriend with drinks .
But after she admitted boozing and sharing a hotel room with her fiancé , cops in the strict Islamic state arrested her for “ illegal drinking ” outside licensed premises and having sex outside marriage .
Her 44 - year - old fiancé , also from London , was charged with the same offences .
And both were thrown in police cells by officers who paid little heed to the rape .
The devastated couple were last night understood to be on bail awaiting trial and have had their passports confiscated .
They could be jailed for up to six years if found guilty of the illicit sex charge .
British embassy officials in the desert emirate are helping them .
A diplomatic source said : “ There have been some truly appalling injustices in Dubai but this one tops the lot .
“ A desperate , distressed rape victim went with her boyfriend to report the attack to police .
And both wound up behind bars .
“ The police and authorities in Dubai have shamed themselves by yet again displaying a breathtaking lack of compassion and humanity . ”
The ordeal of the rape victim , a pretty Muslim of Pakistani descent , began after she joyfully accepted a marriage proposal from her boyfriend during a three - day New Year break .
She admitted drinking too much afterwards as they celebrated at Dubai Marina ’s luxurious Address Hotel – and passed out in a ladies ’ loo .
The waiter is said to have followed her into the toilets and raped her while she was semi-conscious .
Her fiancé was initially unaware of the attack and helped her to their room , where they slept until the next day .
Quizzed
But the horror of the rape came back to her when she woke – and the pair went to Jebel Ali police station to report it .
Yet unsympathetic cops immediately quizzed them about breaking the emirate ’s severe decency rules , which contain elements of Sharia law .
Medics were said to have shunned rape case procedures – but made sure they obtained a blood sample from the woman to prove she had been drinking .
After being locked up , she told a cellmate she was terrified the rapist had made her pregnant or given her a sexually transmitted disease .
She was given access to proper medical checks and a morning - after pill only after an appeal from British embassy staff .
She and her fiancé spent several days behind bars before being freed .
The cellmate , held for alleged cheque fraud , said : “ She ’s a British girl but a Muslim , so I think they were tougher on her because of that .
“ She was trying to report the rape but soon realised the policemen were more interested in how often she has sex with her boyfriend .
“ They even asked if she did just normal sex or anything else in bed . ”
Her attacker , who is understood to be Syrian , is believed to have denied rape .
He claimed the Briton consented but has also been charged with “ illegal sex ” .
A spokesman for the Address Hotel said : “ The matter is being investigated by the authorities . ”

Seit einigen Tagen liegt mir und auch der Presse ein Schreiben des Rektors des Canisius - Kolleg vor , einem von Jesuiten betriebenen Gymnasium in Berlin .
In dem Schreiben entschuldigt sich der Schulleiter und schämt sich für den sexuellen Missbrauch von Schülern durch lehrende Patres , der an der Schule offenbar in den 70er und 80er Jahren stattgefunden hat .
Also genau in der Zeit , in der ich die Schule besuchte .
Das Canisius - Kolleg galt — und gilt — als Elite - Schule .
Als ich dort 1974 mit Beginn der fünften Klasse anfing meine Schulzeit fortzusetzen , wusste ich jedoch noch nicht einmal , was Eliten sind .
Wie alle Eltern wollten auch meine , dass ihre Kinder eine bessere Ausbildung genießen sollten als sie selbst , und da es einige meiner Freunde zum „ CK “ zog , es außerdem für Grundschulabgänger mit früher Gymnasialempfehlung nicht besonders viele Alternativen gab und das CK einen guten Ruf hatte , war mir die Wahl recht .
Dass die meisten meiner Mitschüler / innen ( wir waren der erste Jahrgang mit Schülerinnen , denn bis dahin war das Canisius - Kolleg eine reine Jungenschule gewesen ) aus „ besserem Hause “ kamen als ich , wurde mir dennoch schnell klar .
In den ersten Stunden , in denen wir uns den Lehrern , ein erheblicher Teil davon Patres , vorstellen sollten , gehörten dazu die Angaben des eigenen Namens , des Wohnbezirks und der Berufe der Eltern .
Meine Klasse war voller Anwalts - , Ärzte - und Politikersprösslinge , die sich vor Lachen kaum halten konnten , weil mein Vater „ Heizungsbauer “ und meine Mutter „ Hausfrau “ war .
Freunde habe ich natürlich dennoch gefunden und im Großen und Ganzen war es eine gute Zeit , die mich durch den hohen Anteil verklemmter Junge - Union - Anhänger , die morgens von Pappas Chauffeur zur Schule gebracht wurden , früh politisiert hat .
Die konstant spürbare katholische Ausrichtung der Schule ( vor dem Unterricht wurde gebetet ) konnte ich ganz gut ignorieren , ich war evangelisch und bekam daher gemeinsam mit drei , vier anderen Schüler / innen gesonderten Religionsunterricht .
Da dieser meist ausfiel , wurde mein Tischtennisspiel etwas besser .
Für die freiwillige Nachmittagsbetreuung sorgte die „ GCL “ , die „ Gemeinschaft Christlichen Lebens “ , eine Art Klub , in dem man sich in einem eigenen Gebäude der Schule mit Brettspielen beschäftigen konnte .
Der Klub wurde von Patres geleitet und stand , wenn ich mich korrekt erinnere , nur den Jungs zur Verfügung .
Ein paar Mal war ich mit Freunden dort , doch die Patres waren mir unangenehm und meine Mutter erzählte mir gerade am Telefon , dass ich recht schnell darum gebeten hatte , dort nicht mehr hingehen zu müssen .
An einen besonderen Anlass für diese Bitte kann ich mich nicht erinnern , ich glaube , mir war das einfach zu langweilig .
Erinnern kann ich mich jedoch sehr gut an das Erwachen unserer Sexualität .
Wir waren vielleicht 13 , 14 Jahre alt und gerade dabei , unsere eigenen Körper zu entdecken .
Zu dieser Zeit gab es merkwürdige Berichte einiger Mitschüler , die Stammbesucher des Nachmittagsklubs an der Schule waren .
Sie hatten eine Kerze als Geschenk von einem Pater erhalten , welche die Schüler jedesmal dann anzünden sollten , wenn sie onanierten .
Die benutzte Kerze sollten sie später wieder mit den Club bringen , der Pater würde im persönlichen Gespräch klären , ob sie sich zu oft angefasst hätten .
Es tut mir heute so leid , dass wir nur blöd kicherten und das Thema beiseite schoben .
Dass wir als Gleichaltrige nicht erkennen konnten , dass diese Geschichten vielleicht der einzig mögliche Hilferuf , ein erster Hinweis auf Missstände von denjenigen war , die sich einfach nicht ihren Eltern , geschweige denn anderen Lehrkräften mitteilen konnten .
Mir wurde erst viel später klar , dass das relativ offene Verhältnis , dass ich zu meinen Eltern hatte , keineswegs die Norm war , dass es viele Mitschüler gab , deren Eltern ihnen das „ Nein “  - Sagen aberzogen hatten : Lehrern und Eltern widerspricht man nicht , Punkt .
So kehrte ich die Geschichten unter meinen persönlichen Erfahrungsteppich oder hielt die Mitschüler für Wichtigtuer und wunderte mich höchstens darüber , dass sie dieses blöde Spiel mitmachten .
Lange nach der Schulzeit erfuhr ich aus Erzählungen ehemaliger Mitschüler , dass Kerzen anscheinend nicht das einzige waren , was benutzt wurde .
In den 80er Jahren soll es einen Missbrauchsfall an der Schule gegeben haben , auf Grund dessen ein Pater aus dem Schuldienst entfernt worden sein soll .
Und schon früher , in den 70ern , soll ein mir damals bekannter Schüler im Rahmen der GCL von einem mir damals ebenfalls bekannten Pater missbraucht worden sein , wovon er einigen Mitschülern berichtet habe .
Als es später innerhalb des Ordens Hinweise auf solche Taten gegeben habe , soll der betreffende Pater ebenfalls aus dem Schuldienst entlassen und in der Provinz in der Jugendarbeit eingesetzt worden sein .
Der Mitschüler habe nach seiner Schulzeit einen Mordanschlag auf den betreffenden Pater verübt , welcher dadurch schwer verletzt worden sei — der Attentäter habe daraufhin eine Zeit in einer psychiatrischen Klinik verbracht , wo er sich wenig später das Leben genommen haben soll — nicht der einzige Selbstmord von ehemaligen CK - Schülern , behaupten einige .
Dies alles sind Berichte von ehemaligen Schülern .
Sie stammen aus unterschiedlichen , aber inhaltlich deckungsgleichen Quellen .
Keinerlei Berichte gibt es über Anklagen oder gar Verurteilungen der betreffenden Patres .
Und ebenfalls kein Wort darüber fällt in dem Entschuldigungsschreiben der aktuellen Schulleitung .
news The Fantabulous Contraptions of Matthias Wandel
Matthias Wandel is living the twenty - first - century dream .
In 2007 , he quit his engineering job at Research in Motion , turned his attention to his website , and now makes most of his living doing what he loves , tinkering in his workshop and posting his creations online .
Over the last few years , Wandel ’s innovative and beautifully crafted wooden machines have become viral sensations : his YouTube videos alone have been watched almost ten million times .
This week , Torontoist had the opportunity to talk to Wandel about his machines , the success of his website , and some of his other projects .
According to Wandel , his fascination with woodworking began at a young age in his father ’s workshop .
“ My dad also used to make custom furniture for people , ” he explains on his site .
“ This has always been lucky for me , as it meant having access to a large and well equipped workshop , as well as lumber . ”
Today , he has his own workshop in his basement in Ottawa , and although other materials might be better suited for some of his projects , he still prefers to work with wood .
“ I have wood and you can make things out of wood a lot faster than you can make things out of metal , ” Wandel told Torontoist .
“ You can also cut wood a lot faster than you can cut metal , so it ’s quite logical . ”
While some of his machines , like his combination lock , were built to drive traffic to his website , others were born from necessity .
In 2003 , when a neighbour ’s apple grinder was unavailable for his parents to use , Wandel decided to construct his own , and in 2009 , he built a marble run track out of wooden blocks to give to his nephew for Christmas .
Wandel admits that the gift was probably too complex for a three - year - old , though he reports that his nephew ’s parents had “ a blast playing with the blocks . ”
One of Wandel ’s most time - consuming projects was his pipe organ , which he was inspired to build after taking an introductory music course in his final year of university .
“ The organ was also quite a challenging project , ” said Wandel .
“ I wanted some kind of keyboard instrument and I did n’t really feel like buying one , so I started experimenting …
It ’s a good conversation piece for whenever I have visitors here . ”
In addition to woodworking , Wandel has also built Lego marble machines , domino stackers , a digital camera from the components of a flatbed scanner , and a few online games , including an eyeballing game that tests geometric perception .
( Warning :
If you start playing the eyeballing game you wo n’t get anything else done today . )
“ I always felt that some people are better at [ eyeballing ] things than others , ” explained Wandel .
“ So I thought , well , would n’t it be neat to write a little test for that ? ”
So far , working from home has been pretty lucrative .
In October 2008 , after receiving dozens of emails from fans wanting to buy plans for his machines , Wandel started selling some of his schematics online .
“ If you have a customer base , and the customer base keeps asking for something , they ’re telling you there ’s an opportunity , ” he said .
“ A year ago I was selling one or two plans a week .
Now I ’m selling about thirty to forty plans a week . ”
From ad revenue and design sales , his site pulled in more than three thousand dollars in December 2009 , and he expects to make around $ 3,500 this month .
Wandel told us that he ’s still somewhat amazed by his site ’s success , but added that while he appreciates feedback from his fans , he ’s sick of people suggesting that he build a wooden clock .
“ Why would I build a wooden clock ? ” asked Wandel rhetorically .
“ That ’s been done before . ”
It looks like the revolution will not be televised , after all .
It looks like the revolution will not be televised , after all .
At least not the Tea Party ’s revolution .
Word from Nashville on Monday was that the First National Tea Party Convention next month will be closed to the press , other than for a limited number of “ selected ” journalists .
No word on who or how many .
This from the people who brought us last summer ’s media - saturated Town Hall meetings .
The restrictions apparently apply to the much - anticipated speeches by Sarah Palin and Minnesota ’s own Michele Bachmann .
Organizers say that journalists without passes will not be allowed into the convention at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel .
( A Star Tribune request for a pass was denied , the paper ’s interest in covering its home - state congresswoman notwithstanding ) .
Convention spokesman Judson Phillips informs us that most of the sessions are closed “ at the request ” of the presenters .
“ Given the media interest , I do n't want the sessions disrupted and overrun with the media , ” he said .
While organizers are offering to help set up interviews with speakers , they said Palin will not be available .
The Tea Party is also planning two unspecified events that the media can cover , Phillips said .
As of this writing , neither has been finalized .
If the secrecy sounds a little , well , un-American , Phillips has this explanation :
It ’s not a political convention , but a “ working convention . ”
It appears that sometimes the right of the people to peaceably assemble is best conducted out of view .
At a conference in Moscow , Marc Faber laid out the crisis that he sees coming in the next 10 years : Interest on U.S. debt will crush other spending , then inflation and depression will take hold and eventually lead to war .
“ Maximum , within 10 years time more than 35 percent of tax revenues will have to be used to pay the interest on the government ’s debt , and then you ’re in trouble , because then there is not enough money out of the budget to pay for other stuff , ” Faber said .
“ I am convinced that the U.S. government will go bankrupt , but not tomorrow , and before they go bankrupt they ’ll print money , and then you get very high inflation rate , then you get depression with high inflation and eventually they ’ll go to war . ”
Social obligations will cause Western countries to default , in Faber ’s view .
“ Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece , Spain — I think eventually they ’ll all default , ” he says .
“ The obligations of Western governments are far too high .
They wo n’t be able to pay . ”
Faber suggests that governments raise the retirement age to 70 and cut back on social spending , but says that even that wo n’t be enough to solve the problem .
The perceived credit risk of Western European nations overtook that of high - grade U.S. companies for the first time yesterday , Reuters reports , reflecting rising concerns over high debt loads taken on by governments attempting to spend their way out of the financial crisis .
The SovX credit default swap index , a measure of the credit risk of 15 Western European countries , rose to 94 basis points , compared with 92 basis points for the benchmark U.S. index of investment grade companies .

OK , I admit it .
I was wrong .
How could I have bought into all that idealistic nonsense at the start of the decade , about the prospects for Middle East peace ?
Why did I foolishly assume that Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat had shattered taboos at Camp David in the summer of 2000 ?
And why did I want so desperately to believe the two sides when they claimed , at Taba , in January 2001 , that " significant progress had been made " and they had " never been closer to agreement " ?
Perhaps the heady optimism of the 90s had seduced me .
That was the decade of hope ; of the Madrid conference , the Oslo accords and the historic handshake on the White House lawn .
During his first stint as Israeli prime minister in the late 90s , even uber - hawk Binyamin Netanyahu agreed to territorial withdrawals at the Wye River summit .
That was then , this is now .
Palestinians and Israelis remain locked in conflict .
Netanyahu has returned to office , 10 years on , speaking only of a demilitarised Palestinian state and refusing even to consider allowing East Jerusalem as its capital .
His far - right foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , who lives in an illegal West Bank settlement , has long been opposed to meaningful peace talks with the Palestinians .
A decade that began with Bill Clinton bringing together Arafat and Barak to attempt to conclude the Oslo process , at Camp David , has ended with Barack Obama unable to persuade the government of Netanyahu and Lieberman to agree to a partial settlement freeze .
On Monday , the Israeli housing ministry announced plans to build nearly 700 new apartments in occupied East Jerusalem .
It is time to acknowledge that the peace process , as we know it , is dead .
There is no longer a two - state solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict .
Why ?
Because , as Virginia Tulley wrote in the London Review of Books , " the conditions for an independent Palestinian state have been killed off by the inexorable and irreversible advance of the settlements " .
Or , to borrow an analogy from Palestinian lawyer Michael Tarazi : " It 's like you and I are negotiating over a piece of pizza .
How much of the pizza do I get ?
And how much do you get ?
And while we are negotiating it , you are eating it . "
Consider the facts .
According to Peace Now , there are 120 illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank , with a settler population estimated at around 300,000 .
Some 200,000 Israelis live beyond the Green Line in occupied East Jerusalem – almost the same number as Palestinians allowed to reside within the city .
The UN 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs ( OCHA ) has calculated that settler numbers continue to grow at a rate of 5.5 % a year – which is the equivalent of adding one a half bus-loads of new settlers each day to the 500,000 already living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
On current trends , says the UN , the settler population is likely to double to nearly a million in the next decade .
Throw in Israel 's infamous " facts on the ground " – the roads , barriers , checkpoints , buffer zones and military bases – and the settlement project takes up almost 40 % of West Bank land .
The past 10 years have seen the territory further fragmented , by Israeli soldiers and settlers , into a series of isolated enclaves , with Palestinian communities scattered around the West Bank , disconnected from one another and from the outside world .
So , one has to wonder , what will emerge from any future negotiations ?
A Palestinian state or a bantustan ?
It is difficult to disagree with the verdict of the former UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , that settlement expansion is " the single biggest impediment to realising a viable Palestinian state with territorial contiguity " .
Confronted by half a million settlers living on the territory of a future Palestinian state – one of whom includes Israel 's own foreign minister – and another half a million on the way , I can no longer support an illusory two - state solution : on pragmatic , if not principled , grounds .
The two peoples are so enmeshed and intermingled that I now believe the land can no longer be divided , it must be shared .
The egg can not be unscrambled .
In November , the chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat – a veteran of Madrid and Oslo – startled reporters in Ramallah when he too confessed it may be time for President Mahmoud Abbas to " tell his people the truth , that with the continuation of settlement activities , the two - state solution is no longer an option " .
The alternative left for Palestinians was to " refocus their attention on the one - state solution where Muslims , Christians and Jews can live as equals . "
Erekat added : " This is the moment of truth for us . "
The truth is that the dream of " two states for two peoples " , born in the 90s , died in the noughties .
The two - state solution , the popular and principled option for so long now , is neither practical nor possible .
In the words of Israeli academic Jeff Halper , " Israel by its own hand has rendered a viable two - state solution impossible . "
Its time has passed .
So the moment has come , as we enter the teenies , to forget the idea of a Palestinian state existing side by side with a Jewish state , and to argue and agitate instead for the only remaining , viable and democratic option : a single , secular and binational state for Israelis and Palestinians .
No longer " two states for two peoples " , but " one person , one vote " .

Sunday , February 14 , 2010 Why Wo n't They Read My Unsolicited Spec ?
Q. Do TV shows toss unsolicited scripts because of company policies ?
Or just because showrunners strongly prefer to read work that has been referred by someone else ?
In other words , is it a strict rule or a guideline they abide by ?
Companies toss unsolicited scripts for legal reasons .
They may be developing a script with a similar concept .
They do n't want to take a chance that you will sue them for " stealing your idea . "
Pro writers know how common it is for writers to think of the same ideas , entirely honestly , but aspiring writers do n't .
For example , Lisa and I were partly put out , and partly pleased , to see that HBO is coming out with a show about groupies called I 'M WITH THE BAND .
Put out , because we had a pitch for a show about groupies called I 'M WITH THE BAND , and now it 's dead .
Partly pleased , because it means we were on the right track .
I 've had that happen to a script about Pretty Boy Floyd and a show about teenage models .
I have a script that 's " Moby Dick in Space . "
I was in the library yesterday and happened to notice a graphic novel which is Moby Dick in Space .
We were working on a show about peacekeepers till we heard about ZOS .
And so forth .
When it comes to spec scripts of the show they 're producing , it is practically guaranteed that whatever you are sending in , if it is at all in the ballpark for the show , it 's an idea that the staff has kicked around .
Aspiring writers may not understand that .
There 's a guy who sued George Lucas because the guy was convinced that he had invented Ewoks .
Yah .
Teddy bears with spears .
There 's an idea that only comes once a millennium .
If you 're going in to pitch a show , on a meeting set up by your agent , then you probably understand that your ideas may not be original .
You hope they 'll give you a script to write anyway if your take on the story is more interesting .
But that 's a different process .
You go in with a pitch idea , and the showrunner has a chance to say , " We did n't want to go in this direction , but I 'm interested in this aspect of your pitch , " and develop it from there .
STAR TREK : TNG was famous for being a show that actually did read specs , and buying a few of them .
But I 've never heard of another franchise doing it .
It is also very hard for a showrunner to read a spec script of his show .
It is going to read slightly off .
Or very off .
It just is .
I can't read a NAKED JOSH spec ; they just irritate me .
I can read a spec MODERN FAMILY and not get bent out of shape ; I have no stake in the show .
But if it 's a show I was in the room for , then it 's going to feel very out of the room .
Generally no TV show is going to read unsolicited scripts in the first place .
But at least , if your agent is submitting your LIE TO ME spec to Hart Hanson , he does n't have to worry that you 'll think you invented the BONES episode they 've been talking about for years .

Dobb was unusual .
Though a more moderate socialism did come to hold political sway in Britain , the nation consistently rejected the extremist politics that swamped the rest of Europe .
Even at the outbreak of World War II , Communist and fascist parties counted their combined memberships at around 40,000 — less than one percent of the population — and few of those were active .
In 1933 , Wyndham Lewis ’s sympathetic biography of the new German chancellor , Adolf Hitler , was displayed in a famous bookshop on London ’s Charing Cross Road .
Twice a day , the window had to be hosed down to remove all the accumulated spittle .
While British politics remained resolutely mainstream , science flirted with the fringes .
Social hygienists recommended that girls eat cakes and porridge to avoid sexually awakening themselves .
Psychoanalysts applied their theories to “ the insanity of nations . ”
Eugenicists claimed that a “ defective ” generation was being bred , arguing that criminality as well as physical and mental characteristics were inherited via “ germ plasm . ”
Those classed as defective could include vagrants , inebriates , drug addicts , prostitutes , perverts , imbeciles , deaf - mutes , the blind , the insane and epileptics — totaling , in one estimate , 9.5 million people , almost one - quarter of Britain ’s population .
The birth control pioneer and eugenicist Marie Stopes , concerned with the decline in what she called the “ imperial race , ” disowned her own son because he married a woman who wore spectacles .
The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 pitted the democratic republic against nationalist authoritarians .
The conflict made a profound impact on Britain — one which , as Overy rightly says , has often been underrated .
His chapter on it is one of the most affecting sections of the book , telling of how 4,000 Britons — scientists , philosophers , poets and manual workers alike — volunteered to fight Fascism in a country to which they had no connection , simply because they believed it to be a just cause .
George Orwell was among those who went , hand grenades dangling from his belt , accompanied by a small dog with the initials of the Marxist party to which he belonged painted on its side .
Orwell ,
Overy says in the course of a particularly winning description , was “ so fastidious about completing his toilet each day that if there was no water to shave in , he would shave in wine . ”
That certainly brings a whole new dimension to Champagne socialism .
Orwell was wounded in action , shot through the neck by a nationalist sniper .
He was lucky to survive .
Many did not .
Such had been the horrors of World War I that pacifism , and the avoidance of war by any means , was a dominant theme of the interwar years .
The Spanish Civil War and the enormities of the Nazi regime in Germany changed that .
“ I hate war with as much venom as you do , ” the novelist Storm Jameson wrote to her pacifist colleague Vera Brittain , “ but I have come to believe that there are certain values for which it may be necessary to fight . ”
When the crisis of civilization really did arrive in the shape of World War II , there was no choice about how to deal with it .
Britain fought for its liberty and its life .
“ The Twilight Years ” was published in England as “ The Morbid Age . ”
Overy notes that Leonard Woolf was obliged to retitle some of his books for American publication : “ Barbarians at the Gate ” became “ Barbarians Within and Without , ” and after some debate “ Quack Quack , ” his critique of capitalism , became “ Quack - Quack , ” with a hyphen .
These may be trifling , but Overy ’s British title is more memorable and more appropriate to the content than the American one .
It is hard to see why a publisher would prefer “ The Twilight Years ” — unless putting the word “ Twilight ” on the cover is enough to persuade Stephenie Meyer ’s audience of teenage vampire fans to buy scholarly British cultural history .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Americans are still too fat , but the obesity epidemic in the United States appears to be waning a bit , U.S. researchers said on Wednesday .

New government data show that 68 percent of U.S. adults are considered overweight , having a body mass index or BMI of 25 or higher .
A third are obese , having a body mass index of 30 or higher .
“ Obesity continues to be a significant health concern , ” Cynthia Ogden of the National Center for Health Statistics at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a telephone interview .
Additionally , around 17 percent of children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 were considered obese .
BMI is equal to weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared .
A person 5 feet 5 inches tall is classified as overweight at 150 pounds ( 68 kg ) and obese at 180 pounds ( 82 kg ) .
Obesity - related diseases account for nearly 10 percent of medical spending in the United States or an estimated $ 147 billion a year .
Being overweight or obese raises the risk of heart disease , diabetes , some cancers , arthritis and other conditions .
In the past several decades , obesity rates climbed fast .
The number of adults who were overweight or obese rose 8 percentage points in the 1988 - 1994 survey period compared with the 1976 - 1980 survey .
Obesity rates were relatively stable between 1960 and 1980 .
MEN GETTING FATTER
“ Over the last decade , which would be 1999 through 2008 , we found no significant increase in the prevalence of obesity among adult women , but we did find a significant increase in men over that same period , from about 27.5 percent to 32 percent , ” Ogden said .
But more recently , those increases in men appear to be slowing , Ogden said , noting there has been no change in obesity among males between 2003 and 2008 .
“ It ’s slightly good news to see that it ’s not increasing at the rate it was before , but we ca n’t really relax .
We still have a third of our population that ’s obese .
That is among the very highest in the world , ” she said .
Ogden said the study continued to find disparities by age , with younger adults less likely to be obese than older adults .
She noted that African Americans and Mexicans tended to be more obese than whites .
Overall , 32.2 percent of American men were obese .
Among non-Hispanic whites , the number was 31.9 percent compared with 37.3 percent of black men .
The study found 35.5 percent of all women were obese .
Among whites , the proportion was 33 percent , compared to 49.6 percent among blacks .
In children , the team found obesity rates slowed over the decade , except in severely overweight boys .
Miina Matsuoka lives by herself in New York City .
She owns two cats and routinely screens her calls .
But before you jump to conclusions , note that she is comfortable hobnobbing in any of five languages for her job as business manager at an international lighting - design firm .
She just strongly prefers not to socialize , opting instead for long baths , DVDs , and immersion in her art projects .
She does have good , close friends , and goes dancing about once a month , but afterward feels a strong need to " hide and recoup . "
In our society , where make up three - quarters of the population , loners ( except Henry David Thoreau ) are pegged as creepy or pathetic .
But soloists like Matsuoka can function just fine in the world — they simply prefer traveling through their own interior universe .
Loners often hear from well - meaning peers that they need to be more social , but the implication that they 're merely black - and - white opposites of their bubbly peers misses the point .
Introverts are n't just less sociable than extroverts ; they also engage with the world in fundamentally different ways .
While outgoing people savor the nuances of social interaction , loners tend to focus more on their own ideas — and on stimuli that do n't register in the minds of others .
Social engagement drains them , while quiet time gives them an energy boost .
Contrary to popular belief , not all loners have a pathological of social contact .
" Some people simply have a low need for affiliation , " says Jonathan Cheek , a psychologist at Wellesley College .
" There 's a big subdivision between the loner - by - preference and the enforced loner . "
Those who choose the living room over the ballroom may have inherited their temperament , Cheek says .
Or a penchant for solitude could reflect a mix of innate tendencies and experiences such as not having many friends as a child or growing up in a family that values privacy .
James McGinty , for one , is a caseworker who opted out of a as a lawyer because he did n't feel socially on - the - ball enough for the job 's daily demands .
He has a small circle of friends , but prefers to dine solo .
" I had a bad cold over the Thanksgiving holiday , but that spared me from having to go to my brother - in - law's , " he says .
" I 'm not a scrooge ; it 's the gatherings I dread . "
Matsuoka feels his pain : " I can't do large crowds with a lot of noise , " she says .
" It 's to maintain positive interactions and introduce yourself 20 times .
I really have to turn on my motor to do that . "
Solitary Pleasures
Matsuoka , who is , is open to , but " whomever I 'm with must know that at least one day a week I need to lock myself in my room and stick feathers on a sculpture , " she warns .
Artwork is a form of for her .
" I get completely sucked in .
It clears my mind until nothing disturbs me . "
While a few studies have shown a correlation between , originality , and , perhaps more striking is the greater enjoyment introverts seem to reap from creative endeavors .
Amanda Guyer , a psychologist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Maryland , has found that socially withdrawn people have increased sensitivity to all kinds of emotional interactions and sensory cues , which may mean that they find pleasure where others do not .
Guyer separated child subjects into " outgoing " and " reserved " groups and then had them play a game in which they had to press a button in order to win money .
The reserved subjects showed two to three times more activity in the striatum region of the brain , which is associated with reward , than did the more outgoing ones .
Previous MRI studies have shown that during social situations , specific areas in the brains of loners experience especially lively blood flow , indicating a sort of overstimulation , which explains why they find parties so wearying .
But Guyer 's results suggest that introverts may be more attuned to all sorts of positive experiences as well .
This added sensitivity , she speculates , could mean that people who are reserved have an ability to respond quickly to situations — such as coming to your aid in a moment of need — or show unusual to a friend , due to their strong emotional antennae .
Research by psychotherapist Elaine Aron bears out Guyer 's hunch , demonstrating that withdrawn people typically have very high sensory acuity .
Because loners are good at noticing subtleties that other people miss , Aron says , they are well - suited for careers that require close observation , like writing and scientific research .
It 's no surprise that famous historical loners include Emily Dickinson , Stanley Kubrick , and Isaac Newton .
The Unhealthy Case of the Lonely Loner
The content introverts ' camp closely borders the land of the socially .
Matsuoka , for example , says she was " pathologically shy " as a child , which likely laid the groundwork for her current lifestyle , even though she grew much more confident in her 20s .
Those who remain " enforced loners " long to spend time with people , but and anxiety inhibit them from doing so .
" Introverts are people who like to be alone , " says Paula Montgomery , an accountant from St. Louis .
" I prefer to be around other people , but because of my shyness , it 's difficult for me to join groups and make friends . "
Such loners have several stress - inducing strikes against them :
They may get butterflies whenever they have to face in - person encounters , and they are subject to outside pressure to be sociable .
When major life problems crop up , loners are also less likely to seek out social support .
John Cacioppo , a psychologist at the University of Chicago , has highlighted as a health - risk factor on par with and .
" Loneliness is like hunger and thirst — a signal to help your survive , " Cacioppo says .
" When you 're lonely , there 's a stress response in your body , and it 's not healthy to sustain that for a long time . "
Philosophers have argued for centuries over whether it is ever justifiable to break the law in the service of a higher cause .
The question acquired a new complexity with the advent of societies such as the United States , in which laws were enacted by elected representatives and not decreed by a monarch or dictator .
Few today would criticize civil rights activists , including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , for participating in or condoning the violation of laws that perpetuated white supremacy -- with the understanding that they would face punishment for their actions .
But such civil disobedience is rightly regarded as the exception that proves that the proper redress for unjust laws lies in legislation or in court rulings based on the Constitution .
That cautious approach has been thrown to the wind by Christian religious leaders who , even as they insist on their right to shape the nation ’s laws , are reserving the right to violate them in situations far removed from King ’s witness .
Last week , a group of Catholic , Protestant and Orthodox leaders released a “ declaration ” reminding fellow believers that “ Christianity has taught that civil disobedience is not only permitted , but sometimes required . ”
Then , after a specious invocation of King , the 152 signers hurl this anathema at those who would enact laws protecting abortion or extending the rights of civil ( not religious ) marriage to same - sex couples :

“ Because we honor justice and the common good , we will not comply with any edict that purports to compel our institutions to participate in abortions , embryo - destructive research , assisted suicide and euthanasia , or any other anti-life act ; nor will we bend to any rule purporting to force us to bless immoral sexual partnerships , treat them as marriages or the equivalent , or refrain from proclaiming the truth , as we know it , about morality and immorality .
. . .
We will fully and ungrudgingly render to Caesar what is Caesar’s .
But under no circumstances will we render to Caesar what is God’s . ”
Strong words , but also irresponsible and dangerous ones .
The strange land described in this statement is one in which a sinister secularist government is determined to force Christians to betray their principles about abortion or the belief that “ holy matrimony ” is “ an institution ordained by God . ”
The idea that same - sex civil marriage will undermine religious marriage is a canard Californians will remember from the campaign for Proposition 8 , as is the declaration ’s complaint that Christian leaders are being prevented from expressing their “ religious and moral commitments to the sanctity of life and to the dignity of marriage as the conjugal union of husband and wife . ”
This sweeping claim is supported by anecdotes of the sort radio talk - show hosts purvey .
For example , the declaration says that “ a Methodist institution was stripped of its tax - exempt status when it declined , as a matter of religious conscience , to permit a facility it owned and operated to be used for ceremonies blessing homosexual unions . ”
( In 2007 , New Jersey did strip a Methodist camp of its tax privileges under a state recreation program because it no longer was open to all . )
For other examples , it must search beyond the United States : “ In Canada and some European nations , Christian clergy have been prosecuted for preaching biblical norms against the practice of homosexuality . ”
The impression left is that the legal environment in which churches must operate is reminiscent of the Roman Empire that threw Christians to the lions .
Never mind that advocates of same - sex civil marriage and legal abortion have made significant concessions to believers or that religious groups have recourse to courts , which have aggressively protected the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the 1st Amendment .
In 1993 , Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , exempting believers in some cases from having to comply with applicable laws .

This apocalyptic argument for lawbreaking is disingenuous , but it is also dangerous .
Did the Roman Catholic bishops who signed the manifesto consider how their endorsement of lawbreaking in a higher cause might embolden the antiabortion terrorists they claim to condemn ?
Did they stop to think that , by reserving the right to resist laws they do n’t like , they forfeit the authority to intervene in the enactment of those laws , as they have done in the congressional debate over healthcare reform ?
They need to be reminded that this is a nation of laws , not of men -- even holy men .
It appears Geithner will not be fired after all ( for now ) .
From Bloomberg :
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner “ was not involved ” in decisions by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York when it told American International Group Inc. to withhold details from the public about the bailed - out insurer ’s payments to banks in 2008 , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said .
Geithner , who was head of the New York Fed at the time , “ was n’t party to the decision , ” Gibbs said at a White House briefing .
Asked if President Barack Obama continues to have confidence in Geithner , Gibbs said , “ Of course . ”
Republicans and Democrats have called for Geithner to testify about the New York Fed ’s effort to limit disclosures by AIG during the height of the financial crisis .
Geithner was recused from working on issues involving specific companies at the time because he had been named by Obama as his choice for Treasury secretary , a spokeswoman said yesterday .

The plight of young children in Pakistan forced to act as suicide bombers has been exposed by a 13 - year - old girl who has spoken to the BBC .
She explains that her brother , a Taliban commander , has trained many bombers - including her younger sister .
Her claims can not be independently verified but local police say her information is credible .
Orla Guerin reports .
Sure , we 're all plugged in and online 24 / 7 .
But fewer American kids are growing up to be bona fide computer geeks .
And that poses a serious security risk for the country , according to the Defense Department .
The Pentagon 's far - out research arm Darpa is soliciting proposals for initiatives that would attract teens to careers in science , technology , engineering and math ( STEM ) , with an emphasis on computing .
According to the Computer Research Association , computer science enrollment dropped 43 percent between 2003 and 2006 .
Darpa 's worried that America's " ability to compete in the increasingly internationalized stage will be hindered without college graduates with the ability to understand and innovate cutting edge technologies in the decades to come ....
Finding the right people with increasingly specialized talent is becoming more difficult and will continue to add risk to a wide range of DoD [ Department of Defense ] systems that include software development . "
The agency does n't offer specifics on what kinds of activities might boost computing 's appeal to teens , but they want programs to include career days , mentoring , lab tours and counseling .
Of course , Darpa 's launched student - oriented publicity stunts before .
But events like last year 's red balloon hunt were directed at pre-existing geeks – the balloon - finders were a team of MIT aces .
Now , Darpa 's now hoping someone , somewhere , can come up with a way to make future philosophy majors change course .
And they want to get 'em while they 're young : Darpa insists that programs be " targeted to middle and high school students , and include methods " to maintain a positive , long - term presence in a student ’s education . "
A long - term presence that includes evenings and weekends .
Rather than incorporate computer - based activities into academics , Darpa wants the programs to be extracurricular , " perhaps as an after school activity , weekend , or summer event . "
Tween girls and minorities take note , because Darpa 's especially got it out for you :
A single mother wounded during a July 10 drive - by shooting in South Los Angeles is due to be evicted Thursday .
Rashaun Williams , 29 , was a home health aide and crossing guard , but she has been out of work since she was shot in both legs , an innocent bystander caught in gang crossfire on Imperial Highway .
Williams has been surviving on $ 328 in monthly CalWorks welfare payments , but she said she can no longer afford the two - bedroom apartment in Lancaster that she shares with her 6 - year - old daughter , Ky'mariy Redd .
Williams said Ky'mariy ’s father had been helping with the bills until he was hospitalized last month with a heart attack .
She said her only option now is to move in with relatives , probably her mother , who lives in a section of Torrance where Williams said gang violence has surged recently .
“ In my condition , that ’s the last place I would want to be , ” she said , but “ I really have no options . ”
Williams said her application for federal disability assistance was denied .
A doctor recently told her that she may needed additional surgeries on her right leg .
She is on Medi-Cal and has been on a waiting list for rehabilitation since the shooting .
The attack “ changed my life .
It just changed everything completely , ” she said .
“ I have n’t been able to provide for my daughter like I want to . ”
[ Updated , 9:45 p.m. : Community activists Earl Ofari Hutchinson and Eddie Jones announced late Wednesday evening that they plan to hold a meeting at 12:30 p.m. Thursday at Lucy Florence Cultural Center , 3351 W. 43rd St. , Los Angeles , to demand that state officials approve Williams ' application for disability assistance .
In a statement , they called the denial " shameful and unconscionable . " ]

Woman teacher gets 20 years for sleeping with boy pupil,13
Jailed : Ashley Jo Beach slept with a 13 - year - old student
A teacher who was caught having sex with a 13 - year - old boy pupil has been jailed for 20 years .
Ashley Jo Beach wept in court as a judge told her she was a disgrace to her profession and had abused her trust .
The 37 - year - old mother of three had admitted to a four - month affair with the boy who was in her class at a junior school in Idaho .
Prosecutors said Beach , whose children are aged from three to ten , had ' groomed ' the boy to be her lover from when he was 12 - years - old .
She described the youth as ' the light of my life ' and gave him presents to win over his affection .
Beach , who was married to a prison officer , admitted having sex with the boy in a locked classroom at her school in Meridian , Idaho .
The affair was discovered after she was caught partially undressed hiding with the boy in some bushes near the school .
Prosecutor Jean Fisher said : ' The grooming was methodical and it was calculated . '
Ashley Jo Beach during sentencing :
She was jailed for 20 years in total
Beach wept as she begged for forgiveness , telling the court : ' The trust that I destroyed with my family and the community haunts me daily . '
Jailing her , Judge Ronald Wilper said : ' You cashed in your family , your husband and your children , your reputation .
And you did this for the sake of lust . '
Her husband Shawn is also facing jail after it was revealed he took intimate photographs of female prison inmates in revenge for his wife 's affair .
He is facing charges of video voyeurism .
Beach pleaded guilty to one charge of lewd conduct .
She will be eligible to apply for parole after serving four years .
SFWA removes Amazon.com links from website
Due to Amazon.com ’s removal of many of our authors ’ books from its ordering system , we are removing Amazon.com links from our website .
Our authors depend on people buying their books and since a significant percentage of them publish through Macmillan or its subsidiaries , we would prefer to send traffic to stores where the books can actually be purchased .
To that end , our volunteers are in the process of redirecting book links to indiebound.org , Powell ’s , Barnes and Noble , and Borders .
Many authors are being hit hard by this , so we encourage you to seek out new places to find their books .
Edited to add :
It is worth noting , that if a book is only available on Amazon , we are leaving the link in place .
Our goal is to make sure that it is possible to order our members ’ fiction .
Hurting authors to make a point about a publishing model is bad business , for anyone .
When I heard that ten American missionaries are on trial for kidnapping 33 Haitian children and attempting to take them to an orphanage in the Dominican Republic , I , like most other people , was outraged .
But I can't say I was surprised .
To be sure , the thought that some people , whether missionaries or traffickers , would take advantage of an earthquake to steal children and place them in orphanages - or the sex trade , or the slave trade , or whatever - stirs the conscience .
The Baptist missionaries , mostly from Idaho , would have us believe that they were trying to do some good , except that a number of the " orphans " had living parents .
And so they were trying to do good deeds , as many of the other missionaries before them .
We 've been down this road before .
This would not be the first time that missionaries kidnapped Third World children in the name of God .
A look back into history reveals the troubling role of religion and its practitioners in the colonization of black and brown countries .
Now , I am not condemning those dedicated and committed people of faith who are helping poor communities throughout the world and saving lives .
I am sure they are making a difference .
But we would be deluding ourselves if we denied the sordid history of missionaries .
After all , missionaries served an important role in the conquest and taught them they were heathens and evil sinners who were bound for Hell .
They convinced the so - called natives that their culture and customs were filthy and backward , and told them to abandon their ancestors and belief systems .
The missionaries separated the conquered from their sense of self , a psychic conquest if you will , and replaced the old gods with a god who , not surprisingly , looked just like the conquerors .
Now softened up , the natives were susceptible to alcohol abuse and other distractions , and ripe for physical conquest in the form of subjugation , enslavement , forced labor , genocide and the like .
Part of the cultural genocide was committed by white Christian missionaries in the name of Jesus Christ .
Missionaries worked with the Australian government to rip thousands of half - Abroriginal children from their families and place them in government orphanages , where they were abused .
The plan was to " breed " the Aborigine out of them and force them to conform to Western ways .
The plight of these stolen children was dramatized in the film Rabbit - Proof Fence , in which three kidnapped Aboriginal girls who were to be trained as servants escaped from their captors , and roamed through the outback alone .
And as for the Native Americans , European missionaries tried to convert and " civilize " the so - called heathens from the first point of contact .
When the U.S. divided the Native peoples ' lands into reservations , they assigned the reservations to Christian missionaries .
Reservation schools , both boarding and day schools , served the goals of Manifest Destiny by " killing the Indian " in order to " save the man " .
Subjected to a regime of forced assimilation , Native students were prohibited from speaking any language other than English .
And they were kept from practicing their traditional spiritual beliefs , and were indoctrinated with Christian teachings .
Separated from their language and their culture , sometimes they were separated from their families by hundreds of miles .
Supposedly , it was for their own good .
So , the kidnapping , exploitation , and abuse of darker children by missionaries are nothing new .
Haitian children , victims of a devastating earthquake , are also victims of an ancient game that is as old as colonization itself .
It is a cold - blooded crime , but for hundreds of years the criminals were immune from prosecution and never saw the inside of a courtroom .
Note that you must , of course , consider what is going on with the cat and its environment .
Do n't decide on the cat 's mood solely by tail positioning alone .
* One visitor wrote that his Turkish van swishes his tail back and forth vigorously when he 's apparently very happy .
A Top Gear card game made by the BBC will cost children £ 800 to collect the set , experts warned .
The 276 cards , which include 55 " rare " cards , are being given away in packs every fortnight in Top Gear Turbo Challenge magazine .
The BBC publication aimed at children aged seven to 14 , costs £ 2.50 .
Extra card packs are £ 1.50 .
But researchers at Cult - Stuff said in order to get the full set it would cost £ 792 .
A spokesman added it was " scandalous " only one rare card was in every 24 packs .
He said : " It will not only put off parents but also future collectors . "
A bbc spokesman said : " The cards are for children to swap with their friends to build their collection . "
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China ’s top economic planner said on Friday that it had launched venture capital funds totaling 9 billion yuan ( $ 1.32 billion ) jointly with several provincial governments and private investors to support the country ’s growing high - tech sector .
Investments will focus on electronic and information industries , the biological and pharmaceutical sector and environmental and energy - related projects , the National Development and Reform Commission , the powerful planning agency , said in a statement on its website ( www.ndrc.gov.cn).
It said that seven provincial - level governments had joined the venture capital scheme : Beijing , Jilin , Shanghai , Anhui , Hunan , Chongqing and Shenzhen .
“ The purpose of setting up the funds is to direct capital to invest in competitive high - tech enterprises and to improve their capacity for innovation , ” the statement said .
The money will be spread among a total of 20 venture capital funds .
The central government contributed 1 billion yuan , local governments pitched in 1.2 billion yuan and the remainder came from private investors , the official Xinhua news agency said .
It did not provide any details about who the private investors were or about how the venture capital funds would be structured .
SOMETIMES it helps to be a Jennifer or a Lisa in the workplace rather than a Martin or an Andrew .
While women are paid considerably less than men and suffer discrimination , in some jobs it appears it is easier to get in the door if you are a woman .
A study by Australian National University economists Alison Booth and Andrew Leigh found '' substantial discrimination ' ' against males in jobs that women dominate .
The economists sent thousands of job applications to four female - dominated occupations .
For applications with male names the average call - back rate was 25 per cent - for candidates with female names the call - back rate was , on average , 32 per cent .
Update : Both campaigns react to the Demon Sheep uproar , after the jump .
The Carly for California campaign has created an ad so weird , it would make Salvador Dali say “ WTF ? ”
It ’s a negative attack aimed at Carly Fiorina ‘s opponent , Tom Campbell , but if there ’s any justice , it will now become the political equivalent of Star Wars Kid , or those “ Hitler reacts ” videos .
It ’s not only strange , but it seems to be counter - productive .
In the ad , Fiorina seems to be saying that voting for lambs is good , but for my money , I ’ll vote for the guy dressed as a lamb who can shoot death rays from his eyes , even if he does seem to be eating poo at one point .
Who wants to vote for a lamb ?
Seriously , is Fiorina going for the Clarice Starling vote ?
Even if you grant that this was some kind of creative misfire , what is the purpose of obscuring Fiorina at the end of the commercial ?
Is she in witness protection ?
Is she being forced to exploit CTU ’s computers for her convict ex-boyfriend ?
Is she Keyser Soze ?
Here ’s the ad .
Re-mix away .
( h/t Political Hotsheet )
Update : Earlier today , the Fiorina campaign was asked for their reaction to the online uproar over the ad .
A spokesperson for the Fiorina campaign sent the following response to Asylum :
“ The response to our web video exposing Tom Campbell ’s support for tax increases and bigger government has been exactly as intended – it ’s intentionally edgy and controversial to get people talking and watching .
And that ’s exactly what has happened and we could n’t be more pleased . ”
I also emailed Tom Campbell ’s campaign for their reaction to the Demon Sheep ad , and here ’s what their spokesman told me :
This bizarre video is just the latest sign that the Fiorina campaign is in complete meltdown mode .
Tom Campbell will stick to talking about how to rein in federal spending .
We ’re happy to let Carly Fiorina talk to California voters about demon sheep .
I thinkwhichever candidate can get Demon
Sheep to go on the stump will run away with this one .
Have a tip we should know ?

How different is the winter of 2010 from 1963 ?
By Vanessa Barford
BBC News
Arctic weather continues to create chaos across the UK in what some are saying is the coldest winter since 1963 .
Two men wait at a bus stop amid heavy snow in Kent in 1963
That winter , the snow started on Boxing Day 1962 and the big freeze lasted until March 1963 .
Blizzards caused snowdrifts up to six metres deep , telephone lines were brought down and temperatures fell so low the sea froze over .
But with thousands of schools remaining shut , travel problems continuing and power cuts affecting thousands of homes , how different is it in 2010 ?
SCHOOLS
On Wednesday about 9,000 schools were shut across England , with 950 in Wales , and at least 250 in Scotland and 16 in Northern Ireland .
While some schools were forced to close in 1963 , Peter Hennessy , professor of contemporary British history at Queen Mary University of London , said the large number of closures this week indicated the UK had become a " health and safety nation " .
But he said people usually lived within walking distance of their schools in 1963 - while more parents and staff drive to school now - so snow on the roads has more impact on closures these days .
Wading to school through inches - not centimetres - of snow is something Christine Hewitt , 64 , from Prudhoe , Northumberland , remembers well .
She said at the age of 18 she had no choice : " You put wellies on and walked .
If you could get on a sledge , you went to school .
Sledging was skiving . "
Cultural historian Christopher Cook said the " technology of schools " had also changed .
He said : " You do n't hear of frozen loos - heating is much more efficient .
" In 1963 my brother was at primary school and had to break the ice in the toilets - he was told not to hit it too hard with the stick in case he broke the porcelain too . "
HOMES
The majority of homes in 1963 had no central heating Thousands of homes across the UK have been affected by power cuts , often because of falling trees on power lines and ice weighing down cables .
National Grid issued its second gas alert in three days - and demand was expected to hit a new record of 454 million cubic metres .
But Prof Cook said it was a very different picture in 1963 .
Gas and electricity was restricted , most people had no central heating and some people had to resort to collecting coal from frozen depots .
" A few had Agas or fuel burners but most people relied on gas fires in one room or had no fires at all .
" Maybe they had a water bottle to warm the bed , " he said .
" I remember waking up to find the inside of my window completely iced up , " he added .
He said central heating had made a huge amount of difference .
" Everything is warmer , pipes do n't freeze outside the home because of the amount of warmth being lost from houses .
In 1963 , cold water tanks froze - there was a constant fear of pipes bursting , " he said .
Frozen pipes affected thousands of people in 1963 , with some getting drinking water from corporation carts driven round the streets .
By 24 January water was being rationed in Wales , as the water board struggled to get supplies from reservoirs .
TRANSPORT
More snow is predicted as ice continues to cause chaos on the roads Freezing temperatures and icy roads have created " nightmare " road conditions in 2010 and rail services have been severely disrupted .
Air travel has been beset by delays and cancellations .
Many councils are limiting gritting to major roads only as salt supplies are stretched .
Roads faced similar disruption in 1963 , but former policeman Tom Taylor , 68 , from Gloucester , said the biggest problem was not a lack of grit - but a relentless , blustering wind .
" It was an unbelievable winter - I used to go out on the beat and on snow patrol in the Cotswolds , sometimes in a Land Rover recovery vehicle , and find people stuck in snowdrifts .
" Most of the country roads were impassable - the wind was horrendous .
A snow plough would go down a road , but the wind kept blowing snow back on to the road and it would refill within hours - this went on week after week , " he said .
" It was bitterly cold - I used to wear my pyjamas under my police uniform , " he said .
There were hardly any motorways - the M1 had only opened in 1959 .
But Prof Cook said parts of the sea - and the whole canal system - froze at a time when canals were still being used to transport goods .
He recalled one train having to be " dug out of the snow " .
At Coaley Junction in Gloucestershire , the mail train froze and a fire had to be lit underneath it to defrost parts of the engine .
SPORTING FIXTURES
Cheltenham racecourse had to be cleared by hand to preserve the turf Sporting fixtures have continued to fall foul of the weather , with race meetings at Kempton and Lingfield having been called off and the weekend 's racing , rugby and football fixtures under threat .
But that was nothing compared to 1963 - when the third round of the FA Cup took 66 days to complete - according to Prof Cook .
Most horseracing events in the winter of 1963 were also cancelled , he said .
Amid the hardship however a new sport took off - ice yachting .
Pam Gershon , from Harrow , recalls land yachts on wheels being sailed on the frozen Welsh Harp reservoir in north - west London .
BUSINESSES
People tended to stay with one company for their entire career in 1963 On Wednesday insurer RSA predicted severe snow could cost the UK economy £ 690 m a day , while the Federation of Small Businesses estimated one in 10 employees did not make it into work .
British factories are facing gas rationing as supplies drop and demand surges .
But although the CBI business organisation said the cold weather was causing " massive disruption " for companies , it said broadband internet had made it easier for people to work from home .
But Prof Cook said the nature of industry had also dramatically changed .
" In 1963 , we were an industrial and manufacturing society - when factories closed the UK really suffered .
Now it 's financial services , which allows people to keep making money when it snows , " he said .
Back then , employees had single careers - joining a company at 16 or 22 and staying for life - whereas now people had " portfolio careers " and " travelled and moved around a lot more " , he said .
Businesses were affected in 1963 , but people generally " made a greater effort " and " were prepared to put up with more " , he added .
Elwyn Davies , then 29 , walked six miles in terrible conditions to go to work at Aberthaw Power Station near Barry because it had an essential role to play during the big freeze .

Sanity has triumphed in the U.S. military , as they have pressured the company behind “ Jesus Rifles ” to only make normal rifle scopes from now on :
Bowing to Pentagon concerns and an international outcry , a Michigan arms company said Thursday that it would immediately stop embossing references to New Testament Scriptures on rifle sights it sells the military .
The company , Trijicon Inc. , has multimillion - dollar contracts with the Pentagon for advanced telescopic sights that are widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Trijicon also said it would provide the Pentagon with 100 free kits to use for removing the lettering on existing weapons .
For years , the company acknowledged , it has put small scriptural references near the model numbers on some products , a practice started by its founder , who was a Christian .
The references , like JN8:12 and 2COR4:6 , referring to passages in the Gospel of John and in Second Corinthians , had not been widely noticed or debated until an ABC News report this week .
Scopes with biblical references were also sold to the Australian , New Zealand and British militaries .
Obviously , it ’s not smart for the U.S. military to shoot at Islamic militants with Christian - themed guns .
Unless , that is , their goal is to start a new Crusade or give extremists some extra motivation for their next suicide bombing .
This controversy had been growing throughout the week , and Trijicon was widely condemned from both sides of the political spectrum ( though notably , Stephen Colbert came to their defense ) .
The military claimed they were unaware of the coded Bible passages until very recently .
While this is possible , no one should have been surprised by the revelation , since the company never disguised their Christian roots .
Indeed , one of Trijicon ’s values statements is :
We believe that America is great when its people are good .
This goodness has been based on biblical standards throughout our history and we will strive to follow those morals .
Considering how religious the company is , they ca n’t be happy about having to eliminate their beloved tradition of inserting secret Bible references .
But I suppose with a $ 660 million contract with the Marines on the line , they have some incentive to sacrifice .
Although I ’d prefer the military to find a different company for this contract , I ’m just happy to see some progress .
It ’s comforting to know that the next time a soldier takes a shot at a Muslim extremist , it will be from a secular rifle .
WASHINGTON — Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin lauded the virtues of the Constitution in her Tea Party Convention speech Saturday , but some of her claims appear markedly flawed .
Reports over the weekend also challenged her account of recent history on national security and terrorism .
In her speech , Palin made numerous claims related to Obama , the constitution and terrorism .

“ The [ constitutional ] protections provided , ” Palin said , “ we ’re going to bestow them on a terrorist who hates our Constitution and wants to destroy our Constitution and our country ?
This makes no sense because we have a choice in how we ’re going to deal with the terrorists . ”
But a 2008 Supreme Court ruling , Boumediene v. Bush , declared that alleged terrorists who are n’t convicted of a crime — irrespective of their citizenship — have the constitutional right to have their case heard in federal court .
The case declared unconstitutional some of the Bush administration ’s decisions to strip rights from those who are designated enemy combatants by the Executive Branch .
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said such actions fail to meet “ the fundamental procedural protections of habeas corpus ” guaranteed in the constitution , as the New York Times reported .
Referring to Christmas bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , Palin said “ [ T ] here are questions we would have liked this foreign terrorist to answer because he lawyered up and invoked our U.S. Constitutional right to remain silent .
Our U.S. Constitutional rights . ”

“ He was questioned for only 50 minutes , ” she added .
“ We have a choice in how to do this .
The choice was only question him for 50 minutes and then read his Miranda rights . ”
This too , appears to have been false .
Central to Palin ’s claim was that this approach is failing as Abdulmutallab has refused to cooperate with authorities .
But an FBI official informed Reuters last week that “ Abdulmutallab is talking and has been talking since last week providing useful , actionable and current intelligence that we ’ve been actively following up on . ”
FBI director Robert Mueller added that “ Abdulmutallab has provided valuable information ” without being subject to harsh techniques , as the liberal watchdog Media Matters first noted .

“ He has been cooperating for days , ” one Obama administration official last week told the New York Times , which confirmed that authorities were extracting important information form the suspect .
In her speech , Palin said , “ There are questions that we would have liked answered before he lawyered up , like where exactly were you trained and by whom .
You are bragging about all these other terrorists just like you , who are they ?
When and where will they try to strike next ? ”

Reports reveal that such information has also been obtained by authorities despite not breaking the law .
The Associated Press found that FBI agents interrogated Abdulmutallab in a hospital for “ about an hour ” with the following result :
The suspect spoke openly , said one official , talking in detail about what he ’d done and the planning that went into the attack .
Other counterterrorism officials speaking on condition of anonymity said it was during this questioning that he admitted he had been trained and instructed in the plot by al - Qaida operatives in Yemen .
Newsweek ’s Michael Isikoff delivered the same news :

The agents learned a wealth of information from Abdulmutallab about his connections to Al Qaeda ; who he met with in Yemen ; where he got the bomb that was sewn into his underwear ; and “ who trained him in Yemen . ”
Added another official : “ We got a lot of leads . ”
Palin also accused Obama of “ politicizing our security ” in part by using the word “ war ” insufficiently .
“ New terms used like ‘ overseas contingency operation ’ instead of the word ‘ war . ’
That reflects a world view that is out of touch with the enemy that we face . ”
However , the Obama administration regularly uses the word “ war . ” Following the Christmas Day bombing , the president declared publicly , “ We are at war ” — clarifying , “ we are at war with Al - Qaeda . ”
In the State of the Union , the president reportedly said the word seven times .
Palin also appeared to suggest Obama ’s actions led to North Korea testing nuclear weapons .

“ Our president spent a year reaching out to hostile regimes , writing personal letters to dangerous dictators and apologizing for America , and what do we have to show for that ? ” she said .
“ North Korea tested nuclear weapons and longer - range ballistic missiles . ”
But North Korea became recognized as a nuclear nation in October 2006 , before Obama was elected president , when it tested its nuclear capabilities , as the New York Times points out .
Almost daily , we learn about new problems with the formerly respected UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) :
In their 2001 report , they claimed that the 20th century was " unusual " and blamed it on human - released greenhouse gases .
Their infamous temperature graph shown there , shaped like a hockey stick , did away with the well - established Medieval Warm Period ( around 1000 AD , when Vikings were able to settle in Southern Greenland and grow crops there ) and the following Little Ice Age ( around 1400 to 1800 AD ) .
Two Canadians exposed the bad data used by the IPCC and the statistical errors in their analysis .
The most recent IPCC report of 2007 predicted the disappearance of the Himalayan glaciers within 25 years ; the imminent death of nearly half the Amazon rain forest ; and major damage from stronger hurricanes -- all in contradiction to expert opinions offered by its appointed reviewers , but ignored by IPCC editors for mostly ideological reasons .
More scandalous even , the IPCC based their lurid predictions on anecdotal , non-peer - reviewed sources -- not at all in accord with its solemnly announced principles and scientific standards .
These events showed not only a general sloppiness of IPCC procedures but also an extreme bias -- quite inappropriate to a supposedly impartial scientific survey .
By themselves , they do not invalidate the basic IPCC conclusion -- that a warming in the latter half of the 20th century was human - caused , presumably by the rise of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide .
Yet all of these missteps pale in comparison to ClimateGate , which calls into question the very temperature data used by the IPCC 's main policy result .
As the leaked e-mails from the University of East Anglia ( UK ) reveal , this IPCC conclusion -- that Global Warming is anthropogenic -- is based on manipulated data and therefore flawed -- as are demands for the control of CO2 emissions , like the Kyoto Protocol and the Copenhagen Accord .
In my opinion , ClimateGate is a much more serious issue than simply sloppiness and ideological distortion ; ClimateGate suggests conspiracy to commit fraud .
Let us recall :
The e-mails leaked in the fall of 2009 allow us to trace the machinations of a small but influential band of British and US climate scientists who played the lead role in the IPCC reports .
It appears that this group , which controlled access to basic temperature data , was able to produce a " warming " by manipulating the analysis of the data , but refused to share information on the basic data or details of their analysis with independent scientists who requested them -- in violation of Freedom of Information laws .
In fact , they went so far as to keep any dissenting views from being published -- by monopolizing the peer - review process , aided by ideologically cooperative editors of prestigious journals , like Science and Nature .
Woe to these dissenting scientists , however .
The younger ones were denied an opportunity to advance or receive academic tenure -- or were simply fired .
The independent ones were maligned as " deniers " and ostracized .
In many instances , commercially operated ' smear blogs ' invented slurs ; the most common ones being " tool of the oil industry " or " paid by the tobacco lobby . "
In my own case , my Wiki bio also carried additional malicious accusations ; the most bizarre one was that I believed in the existence of Martians .
We learn from the e-mails that the ClimateGate gang was able to " hide the decline " [ of global temperature ] by applying what they termed as " tricks , " and that they intimidated editors and forced out those judged to be " uncooperative . "
No doubt , thorough investigations , now in progress or planned , will disclose the full range of their nefarious activities .
But it is clear that this small cabal was able to convince much of the world that climate disasters were impending -- unless drastic steps were taken .
Not only were most of the media , public , and politicians misled , but so were many scientists , national academies of science , and professional organizations -- and even the Norwegian committee that awarded the 2007 Peace Prize to the IPCC and Al Gore , the chief apostle of climate alarmism .
In this enterprise , the group was aided not only by environmental zealots , anti-technology Luddites , utopian one - worlders , and population - control fanatics , but also by bureaucrats , businesses , brokers and bankers , who had learned how to game the system and profit from government grants and subsidies for exotic schemes to produce " carbon - free " energy and from the trading of carbon permits .
Hundreds of billions have already been wasted -- most of this in transfers of tax revenues to a favored few .
These sums pale , however , in comparison to the trillions that would have been spent in future if some of the mitigation schemes had come to fruition -- such as an extension and major expansion of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to control greenhouse - gas emissions .
Fortunately for the world economy and for taxpayers in industrialized nations , these schemes collapsed at the Copenhagen climate conference in Dec 2009 .
Clearly , developing nations did not want to take on the sacrifices and restrictions on growth .
There was little concern expressed about climate ; Copenhagen was mostly about transfer of money from rich to poor countries - or more precisely , from the poor in rich countries to the rich in poor ones .
Of course , this breakdown in negotiating global controls does not stop unilateral actions .
Major developing nations , like India and China , have already refused to act .
Australia 's parliament has so far turned down attempts to impose limits on the emission of greenhouse gases , which many still believe to cause significant global warming -- in spite of contrary evidence .
The European Union is likely to persist in its misguided efforts to continue and expand the Kyoto restrictions .
In the US , the House has ( barely ) passed the calamitous Waxman - Markey " Cap & Trade " bill ; the US Senate likely will not pass a similar bill in 2010 , an election year .
There is still the US - EPA 's drive to extend the Clean Air Act to include carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as " pollutants . "
But with the evidence of ClimateGate in hand , EPA 's attempt to provide the necessary scientific justification for its " Endangerment Finding " will surely fail .
Whoever leaked the incriminating e-mails deserves a medal for saving the US economy from certain ruin .
Last November , in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el - Sheikh , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao announced a series of new pledges for Chinese assistance to African countries -- and in the process , made many observers in the West very uneasy .
Westerners think they know what Africa needs to do in order to develop : liberalize markets , get prices right , promote democracy .
And they think they know what China is doing there : offering huge no -strings - attached aid packages to resource - rich countries that prop up pariah regimes .
But a closer look reveals a somewhat different story .
Over the past few decades , China has managed to move hundreds of millions of its people out of poverty by combining state intervention with economic incentives to attract private investment -- the kind of experimentation that the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping once described as " crossing the river by feeling the stones . "
Today , China is feeling the stones again but this time in its economic engagement across Africa .
Its current experiment in Africa mixes a hard - nosed but clear - eyed self - interest with the lessons of China 's own successful development and of decades of its failed aid projects in Africa .
The first prong of Beijing 's efforts is to offer African states resource - backed development loans , an initiative inspired by its experience at home .
In the late 1970s , eager for modern technology and infrastructure but with almost no foreign exchange , China leveraged its natural resources -- ample supplies of oil , coal , and other minerals -- to attract a market - rate $ 10 billion loan from Japan .
China was to get new infrastructure and technology from Japan and repay it with shipments of oil and coal .
In 1980 , Japan began to finance six major railway , port , and hydropower projects , the first of many projects that used Japanese firms to help build China 's transport corridors , coal mines , and power grids .
Since 2004 , China has concluded similar deals in at least seven resource - rich countries in Africa , for a total of nearly $ 14 billion .
Reconstruction in war - battered Angola , for example , has been helped by three oil - backed loans from Beijing , under which Chinese companies have built roads , railways , hospitals , schools , and water systems .
Nigeria took out two similar loans to finance projects that use gas to generate electricity .
Chinese teams are building one hydropower project in the Republic of the Congo ( to be repaid in oil ) and another in Ghana ( to be repaid in cocoa beans ) .
So far , most of these loans have been issued by China 's export credit agency , the Export - Import Bank of China ( China Eximbank ) .
Offered at market rates , they do not qualify as official foreign aid but nonetheless can help development .
In poor , resource - rich countries , which are often cursed rather than blessed by their mineral wealth , resource - backed infrastructure loans can act as an " agency of restraint " and ensure that at least some of these countries ' natural - resource wealth is spent on development investments .
Of course , China 's loans pose some risks for the African recipients , particularly if Chinese firms are awarded infrastructure contracts without competitive bidding or if prices for the resources , the basis of the loan repayments , are fixed in advance .
There is always a risk that African governments will not maintain infrastructure investments and that the Chinese projects ' environmental and social safeguards will be too lax .
Chinese construction companies often bring in Chinese manpower -- on average about 20 percent of the total labor their projects require -- reducing opportunities for Africans .
When they do employ locals , Chinese firms often offer low wages and low labor standards .
But there are ways to mitigate these dangers .
Under most of the agreements , the earnings from exports of natural resources are deposited directly into escrow accounts and their value is assessed at that moment , not fixed in advanced .
This removes the potential for unfair pricing .
Moreover , African governments are already driving harder and better - informed bargains .
Angola required Chinese companies to subcontract 30 percent of the work to local firms and insisted that the Chinese solicit at least three bids for every project they planned to undertake .
The Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) will receive a $ 3 billion copper - backed loan from the Chinese government , which will help finance railways , roads , hospitals , and universities .
According to some reports , the Congolese government has stipulated that 10 to 12 percent of all the infrastructure work undertaken under this arrangement must be subcontracted to Congolese firms , that no more than 20 percent of the construction workers involved be Chinese , and that at least one - half of one percent of the costs of each infrastructure project be spent on worker training .
The terms of Chinese loans also tend to be better than those of deals from Western companies .
As Congolese President Joseph Kabila has pointed out , a $ 3 billion joint mining venture in the DRC gives his government a 32 percent share , compared with the 7 to 25 percent that is typical for mining deals with other companies .
Former Angolan Finance Minister José Pedro de Morais has said that by setting " a new benchmark , " a $ 2 billion loan from China Eximbank in 2004 helped Angola negotiate better terms for other commercial loans .
Thanks to its trillions in foreign exchange reserves , China can offer loans at highly competitive interest rates .
Eximbank gave the Angolan government three loans at interest rates ranging from LIBOR ( the London Interbank Offered Rate , the rate banks charge each other on loans ) plus 1.25 percent to LIBOR plus 1.75 percent , as well as generous grace periods and long repayment terms .
Commercial lenders , such as Standard Chartered Bank , have charged Angola LIBOR plus 2.5 percent or more , without any grace period and while requiring faster repayment .
In its second major experiment , China is helping to build special trade and economic cooperation zones in Africa .
Seven such zones are in the works : two in Nigeria ; the others in Egypt , Ethiopia , Mauritius , Zambia , and , possibly , Algeria .
Special economic zones were an important feature of China 's early development ; today , China has more than one hundred such areas .
The economists Paul Collier , author of The Bottom Billion , and John Page , of the Brookings Institution , argue in a recent report for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization that special economic zones can be a very promising strategy for industrialization and employment in Africa 's least developed countries .
It allows countries to improve poor infrastructure , inadequate services , and weak institutions by focusing efforts on a limited geographical area .
And a targeted focus on boosting manufactured exports can help countries overcome the exchange - rate appreciation and the weakening of local non-energy industries that often accompany natural - resource exports .
The Chinese government is mindful that these zones must be sustainable in the long term .
For decades , Chinese teams in Africa constructed agricultural projects or built factories only to turn them over to inexperienced and sometimes uninterested host governments .
Once the Chinese left , the benefits of the projects declined , prompting the host governments to ask the Chinese to return .
Now , Chinese companies are taking responsibility for both designing and building the zones and then managing them as businesses .
Beijing will subsidize part of the start - up costs , including some of the expenses that Chinese companies incur by moving operations overseas .
Several of the agencies involved in China 's own successful zones are advising -- and in some cases , investing in -- the projects in Africa .
China 's venture - capital fund for Africa , the $ 5 billion China - Africa Development Fund , has taken equity shares in three of the seven planned zones .
A new $ 1 billion fund for small and medium enterprises in Africa , which was announced at the November summit in Egypt , will help African entrepreneurs set up businesses in the zones .
Why would the Chinese government push some of its labor - and energy - intensive industries to move to special economic zones in Africa , even as the U.S. Congress bans the U.S. Agency for International Development from financing any activities that could relocate the jobs of Americans overseas ?
Because Chinese planners want industrialists at home to move up the value chain .
Polluting industries such as leather tanneries and metal smelters are no longer tolerated in many Chinese cities .
And as the world economy recovers from the recent economic recession , wages and benefits will resume rising in China 's coastal belt , as they had been before the crisis .
Some factories will move further inland , but others will go offshore , closer to both the sources of and the markets for raw materials .
The early stages of industrialization might bring pollution , low wages , and long workdays , especially if the Chinese zones are successful .
But like China 's resource - backed loans , the planned economic zones promise to provide African countries with some things they very much want : employment opportunities , new technologies , and badly needed infrastructure .
This is an opportunity for African states to ride into the global economy on China 's shirttails rather than remain natural - resource suppliers to the world .
While the West supports microfinance for the poor in Africa , China is setting up a $ 5 billion equity fund to foster investment there .
The West advocates trade liberalization to open African markets ; China constructs special economic zones to draw Chinese firms to the continent .
Westerners support government and democracy ; the Chinese build roads and dams .
In so doing , China may wind up supporting some dictatorial and corrupt regimes , but -- and this is an inconvenient truth -- the West also supports such regimes when it advances its interests .
And given the limits of the West 's success in promoting development in Africa so far , perhaps Westerners should be less judgmental and more open - minded in assessing China 's initiatives there .
As mentioned in What Perl 5's Version Numbers Mean , the written Perl 5 support policy must explain several guidelines and their implications .
If you 've ever upgraded between major versions of Perl 5 on the same machine , you 've likely noticed that you have to install new versions of modules .
Various resources spread across the Internet suggest the use of CPAN autobundles , but even that 's likely enough to make you curse a little bit as you babysit a CPAN shell for an hour or two to get back to where you started .
This is due to the binary compatibility guidelines to which the Perl 5 Porters adhere .
While there 's a strong desire to ensure that programs and modules written in the past several years will continue to work unmodified on new major versions of Perl 5 , it 's almost impossible to ensure that compiled XS code remains compatible across major versions of Perl 5 .
Certainly the porters attempt to maintain source code compatibility of XS wherever possible , but ensuring that an XS module compiled in 2000 for Perl 5.6.0 will continue to work unchanged on Perl 5.12 in 2010 requires a great deal of foresight , plenty of tolerance for workarounds in the core , and no small amount of luck .
There 's a limit to what 's practical to provide for how long , and the price of reinstalling extensions ( and recompiling a few ) is worthwhile .
While this choice may seem odd , considering the degree to which Perl 5 retains backwards compatibility , it reflects a philosophy from the earliest days of Unix : source compatibility is important , but everyone should have access to the source code to recompile as necessary .
Within a release family — Perl 5.8.0 through 5.8.9 , for example — the porters attempt to maintain binary compatibility .
If you installed DBI on a fresh Perl 5.8.0 , it should continue to work even if you install 5.8.9 and remove 5.8.0 .
That 's the intent .
Note that the Perl 5 configuration and installation process enforces this by default ; minor releases within a major release family reuse the same module installation paths .
Major releases have new installation paths .
You can reconfigure Perl 5 to use paths of your choosing , but you do so at your own risk .
The Middle East peace talks are at a deadlock .
Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians to move ahead with the plan established by the so - called Quartet – the US. , U.N. , EU and Russia -- have faltered and come to a complete standstill .
Continuing with this inertia will have a long - term negative effect on the future of the region both from a political point of view as well as from a business perspective .
With the exception of a few risk - takers , what company or business executive would be willing to invest in the Middle East once the region plunges onto the abyss amid renewed violence ?
And whenever trouble brews in the Middle East it tends to spill over into other parts of the world .
The risk that Mideast violence could spread to nearby Europe might have been one of the reasons that pushed Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to say that Israel should be admitted into the European Union earlier this week .
Berlusconi made the statement during an official state visit to Israel .
Berlusconi , of course , is one of Israel ’s strongest supporters .
Regardless of that the question remains does Israel belong in Europe ?
Does Israel joining the European Union make any sense ?
And is this proposal likely to carry any weight ?
The idea has been floating around for a number of years .
And if Turkey feels it belongs in the EU , then why not Israel , where a large portion of the population has direct ties to Europe .
The knee - jerk reaction from much of the Arab world will most likely be to throw a temper - tantrum .
There will likely be anti-Italian demonstrations , threats to boycott Italian goods ( which will be short - lived given the Middle East ’s attraction to pasta ) and in the extreme case , some maniacs will attempt to carry out terrorist acts against Italy .
But anyone with an ounce of logic should jump on the Italian bandwagon .
Support the initiative .
To what end ?
Why ?
Think about it for a minute or two .
What would it mean to have Israel join the EU ?
To begin with , the European Union has very strict rules regulating multiple aspects of how a member country should function .
First of all , no prospective partner of the Brussels club can be allowed to join the European Union while it occupies territory that is not legally recognized as part of its own .
Israel ’s adhesion into the European Union would have to be preceded by a complete withdrawal of Israeli military and civilian forces from all Palestinian territory .
That would mean that before such a withdrawal can happen a peace deal will have to be reached beetween the Palestinians and the Jewish State .
Israel ’s admission into the European Union would mean that the highways and security roads that Palestinians are not allowed to travel on would have to disappear .
It would be inadmissible to have segregated roads in the European Union .
Imagine if Italy , France or Germany , for example , banned certain ethnic groups from traveling on its national highways .
The Separation Barrier ( official United Nations designation ) which Israel calls a “ fence , ” and Palestinians refer to as an “ Apartheid Wall ; ” in reality a series of segments of a wall resembling the Berlin Wall , ditches and moats , erected between Israel proper and the West Bank to keep potential terrorists out , would have to come down .
It would be unimaginable for a member of the EU to maintain such a symbol of segregation .
Similarly the situation regarding Gaza would have to be resolved .
Again , it is unimaginable for a European country to lay siege to a neighboring territory .
But that is not all .
The whole concept of the European Union , the world ’s largest economic and political zone , which saw the day shortly after the end of World War II , was to tie the economies of Europe ’s countries in such a way that war would simply become unimaginable .
Nations that spent centuries fighting each other – England and France , France and Germany , Germany and its neighbors to the east , and so on and so forth – began building the foundation to make those wars a thing of the past and inconceivable in the future .
And it worked .
Today war between once former foes in Europe is just not possible .
To be sure , there may well be disagreements between members of the EU , but the disputes are settled in the European Parliament or at the International Court of Justice in The Hague .
Not on the battlefield any longer .
This is an example from which the Middle East could greatly benefit .
Israel in the EU would also mean that peace with Syria would have to be attained and the occupied Golan Heights returned to its rightful owners .
Going a step further , Israel would have to finalize its withdrawal from the Shebaa Farms and the village of Ghajjar in south Lebanon and find a way to make peace with Lebanon and by default , with Hezbollah .
Is any of this possible ?
Yes , would say the optimist in me , but with a caveat .
Unilateral withdrawal from Arab lands is unrealistic and dangerous for the security of Israel .
And Israel ’s domestic and foreign policy is driven by its security needs .
So the bottom line is this :
If Israel wants to become a member of the European Union , even with all the backing of the Italian prime minister , and others , it would first have to negotiate peace with its Arab neighbors .
And that is a good thing .
So , Israel in the European Union ?
Yes , by all means , bring it on .
And if Israel joins the EU , why ca n’t Lebanon be next ?
With Cyprus now a member of the EU , Europe is but a 20 - minute airplane ride from the Middle East .

Last week we posted an eBay auction where the seller — an ex-employee of Apple — was selling a broken step from the Fifth Ave New York Apple store .
Threatened with legal action , he was forced to remove it .
Here 's his story .

Hi. Iʼm Mark Burstiner .
I host a show called The Circuit .
Iʼm an all around geek , Iʼm a project manager on a freelance basis , and I consult in digital strategy .
I want to talk to you about a story that ʼs still unfolding .
Advertisement
It may seem trite , but for me , itʼs about the principle at this point .
I also want to thank Gizmodo for taking this story , and allowing me to publish it in my own words .
Multi billion dollar corporations should not be able to bully an innocent ex-employee into cooperation , especially when the corporations are at fault .
A year and a half ago , I was an Apple employee at the Fifth Ave flagship store .
In that time , there was a silly , unfortunate accident .
A woman came down the magnificent spiral staircase , and dropped a Snapple bottle .
Yes , a Snapple bottle .
After bouncing once or twice , the bottle severely cracked one of the steps .
Since these steps are so well engineered , the structural integrity of the step was n't compromised , but it was certainly a cosmetic problem .
Later that month , four or five very big men came to replace the step with a new one .
After they were finished , and the steps that were replaced were out on the curb , I left the store .
Off the clock and in civilian clothes , I asked the contractors who were there on behalf of Seele , the manufacturer , if I could have a step .
" It could be a collectible some day , " I said .
They , of course , saw no problem with it , and even collectively helped me lift it into a vehicle .
That is the story of how I came to be in possession of a step from the spiral staircase at Apple Fifth Ave .

Fast forward to six days ago , February 20 , 2010 .
Iʼve been cleaning up my apartment , because I ʼm going to be moving soon , and I realized I really did n't want to move ( for the third time ) with this step .
It should be about time I put it up on eBay , see if anybody wants it and see if I canʼt make some cash to help with moving at the same time .
That makes sense , right ?
I mean people end up with rare memorabilia all the time .
After all , I did procure it through totally legitimate means .
I asked for permission from the person whoʼs possession it was in .
They helped me lift it into the vehicle for chrissakes .
We should be all hunky dory , right ?
Wrong .
The very next day , the eBay posting got a lot of press , and it even ended up here on the Giz .
Not 24 hours later , the stair was up to $ 255 , dozens of eBay questions , and 200 + watchers with 9 days to go on the auction .
Things were looking good until I was reached out to by a Seele VP .
This gentleman informed me that Apple has caught wind of this and is quite unhappy .
He requested I remove the eBay listing so that we may work this out when we both had more time .
Of course , Iʼm a reasonable guy , so I complied immediately .
Advertisement
Later that same day , we spoke again .
He assured me he was doing me a favor by reaching out to me and requesting that I remove the posting and return the glass step .
He repeatedly made the point that if I complied that he would be so kind as so email Apple and tell them Iʼve been cooperative .
" Oh , how magnanimous of you , " I thought to myself .
As tempting as it might be to relinquish what is now my property , I passed on the offer .
The VP continuously threatened me with " thousands of dollars in legal fees " because both Seele and Apple would not hesitate to take legal action .
Even after repeated explanations of how I came into possession of the step , he continued to mitigate for Apple and attempt to make the point that it was Appleʼs position that since I was on Apple payroll as an employee ( part - time , non- exempt , off the clock , out of uniform ) , that requesting the step was on par with giving a direct order to the contractor .
That , if you will pardon my language , is bullshit .
I donʼt buy it .
He proceeded to assure me that Apple would take the position that anything that began in its stores is Appleʼs property .
Frankly , Apple can take any stance they like , it does n't change the facts .
Advertisement
This man then attempted to convince me that if I were to move forward with not relinquishing the step , that it would be my responsibility in a court of law to prove that I had not stolen it .
This , again , is bullshit .
In the United States , we are innocent until proven guilty .
If Apple would like to attempt to prove that I managed to wrestle a 250 lb step from the five very large men handling it , then they are on the good drugs , and I want to know where I can get some .
What this sounds like to me is Seele trying to save face because Apple is furious that they were irresponsible enough to relinquish ownership of the tread .
Though it may be embarrassing for both corporations , it may simply be a lesson learned at a high price .
Let me put it this way :
If you caught a foul ball at a World Series game , got it signed by a player , received a high five from the security guard on the way out of the stadium , and went home , that ball is now yours , right ?
It started as one entityʼs property , and through a series of consensual transactions , it ended up in your hands .
Now , letʼs say a year and a half later , the player who signed it is huge , and you decide to put it up for auction .
If the MLB reached out to you and said , " Hey !
No way , buddy .
That was OURS .
Hand it over ! "
Guess what ?
That would n't fly .
Advertisement
The next day , we spoke once more over the phone .
Again , I heard the same points from the man , but this time I did not take a passive approach .
I made it quite clear that if he wanted the step , heʼs more than welcome to purchase it from me , or participate in the eBay auction .
He made me an offer lower than the most recent bid on the auction , and I declined .
At this point , Iʼve lost time and money due to dealing with this .
Not to mention , now that the step has seen some press , the demand is growing .
( Iʼve been receiving eBay messages all the way up until this morning . )
He assured me if I did not comply , my information would be forwarded to Apple , and the conversation ended .
As far as I ʼm aware , I have done nothing illegal .
I have not stolen .
I have not deceived in any way .
The step is not confidential , and it is not IP .
The step is the very same that any New Yorker could see by walking into Apple Fifth Ave .
The only thing I am guilty of is taking the risk of throwing out my back through having to move the step multiple times .
I saw an opportunity , I asked for permission , received it , and proceeded .
I wonʼt allow a major corporation to bully me into a corner .
At the time of this posting , it has been seven full days since I put the listing up , and I havenʼt heard from Apple directly a single time .
I have every right to sell my property , and I plan to do so .
Advertisement
Hereʼs what I ʼm going to do .
Iʼve put the tread back up for auction , but have shortened the auction period from 10 days to 3 , starting at the same $ 200 price point and I ʼm dropping the buy - it - now option .
I just want to get rid of this thing .
If it sells for a lot , great .
If it sells for a little , whatever .
Either way , Iʼll keep you posted if I hear from Apple or on any other developments .
I realize this has been long - winded , but it was important to me to share this .
I just donʼt think itʼs right for corporations to take cases that might otherwise be passed off as trivial and turn them into a week - long ordeal , all for the sake of paranoia .
If youʼve read through all this , thank you .
I appreciate your attention and time .

The Launch Of Mass Effect 2
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Friday , 22nd of January 2010 - 12:29 AM ]
Honestly my words wo n't be able to describe the clip as well as just watching it .
But if you still have yet to skip past my words to the video , let me sum it up .
It is a perfect montage of scenes from the game showcasing just enough of the game to get one excited and not ruin the story .
You know like the way that a good movie trailer does .
You know , suspenseful music , just enough action and dialog to make you question what is happening , the standard trailer fair .
But I will also say that it has grabbed my attention more than it had before this .
It almost makes me want to play through the first so I can pick up this one at launch and not be confused .
Which if you know me , that is completely saying something .
Enough of my rambling , since I am sure these words are falling on blind eyes .
Enjoy the new trailer .
At 10 a.m. sharp , the central room at the Golden Age center started thumping with rap music .
Staff members scurried around , urging everyone to set aside their cards and conversation .
“ Exercise time !
Exercise time ! ” the activity coordinator shouted as she began marching in place .
“ Up , up ! Arriba , arriba ! ”
Gilberto Hernandez wheeled himself to the front of the room and took his place in a semicircle of wheelchairs .
His left arm remained limp , but he lifted his right arm into the air and moved it in circles to the beat .
Hernandez , a former construction worker left partially paralyzed by a stroke and heart attack 12 years ago , needs help eating , bathing , changing and going to the bathroom .
Each weekday , he and about 130 others spend several hours at the Golden Age Adult Day Health Care Center in Lynwood .
“ When I am here and listen to the music , I forget about my problems at home , ” Hernandez , 48 , said with a slur .
“ In my home I feel very alone . ”
Hernandez is n’t the only one who relies on the center , decorated with brightly colored balloons and Valentine ’s Day coloring sheets .
While he is here , his wife , Emiliana , gets a brief respite from her duties as his caretaker .
Under the most recent cost - saving budget proposals , 327 adult day healthcare centers throughout California would be eliminated .
Cuts could save the state $ 135 million in fiscal 2011 , state projections show .
But advocates and center operators said care for many of the 37,000 low - income participants -- who suffer from diabetes , brain injuries , dementia and other chronic conditions -- would cost the state even more money if the centers close .
More than 40 % of participants would end up in nursing homes , said Lydia Missaelides , executive director of the California Assn. for Adult Day Services .
Others would be hospitalized .
Missaelides and nearly 20 others testified at a recent state Senate budget committee hearing in Sacramento against the elimination of the centers , which could occur as early as March 1 .
“ We are taking this extremely seriously , ” she said .
“ We are in as much danger as we have ever been . ”
Medi-Cal pays the vast majority of a center ’s care costs , which run about $ 76 per person per day , Missaelides said .
The average age of a participant is 78 , but centers serve centenarians as well as people in their 20s .
All centers have nurses , dietitians , social workers and occupational , speech and physical therapists .
Eliminating adult day healthcare services would affect family members as well as participants , operators said .
“ They would have to figure out how to take care of their family members , ” said Cástulo de la Rocha , chief executive of AltaMed Health Services Corp. , which runs Golden Age and seven other centers in Southern California .
“ It would impact their jobs . ”
Emiliana Hernandez said her husband is more relaxed and less depressed after spending the day at the center .
At Golden Age , he sings , dances , plays bingo , attends church and chats with his friends -- activities that take his mind off his life before becoming disabled .
Closing the center , Gilberto Hernandez said , “ would ruin me . ”
He dabbed the drool on the side of his mouth with a towel tucked into his shirt as he prepared for a physical therapy session .
Therapist Charlie Evans maneuvered the wheelchair in between two bars and braced herself so she could help Hernandez lift himself up .
“ You ready ? ” she said .
“ Take your time .
One . . . two . . . three .
Lift .
Breathe in .
Breathe out .
“ Good !
You got to do that four more times , ” she said .
“ It will help you stand up for your wife . ”
One morning at another center , in South Los Angeles , staff members welcomed participants and took their vital signs .
Paper snowflakes hung from the ceiling .
Aretha Franklin could be heard softly in the background .
A sign at the front said , “ Graceful Senescence -- Where Seniors Are Celebrated . ”
About 60 “ young men and women ” come to the center each day , said program director Nina Nolcox .
Adelina Lindo , 98 , who has dementia , wore a plastic apron over a lavender sweater and bluejeans .
A nursing student fed her French toast with a plastic spoon .
Lindo stared into space , communicating by nodding and shaking her hand .
Lindo ’s great niece Adelina McCloud said she might have to put her in a nursing home if the center closed .
“ I would do the very best I could , ” said McCloud , a single mom studying to be a nurse .
“ But who would watch her while I go to school ? ”
Another participant , Dorothy Greenwood , her silver hair pulled back in a bun , arrived just after 8 a.m. and greeted a staff member enthusiastically .
“ Good morning , baby , ” she said .
Her daughter Mary Nonnette kissed her cheek and jumped back into the car , running late for her job as a hairdresser .
When Nonnette , 66 , started taking care of her mother in 2003 , she had to learn how to bathe her , change her diaper and monitor her medicine .
She said her mother going to the center three days a week is like “ a child going to school . ”
“ I am able to know she is being taken care of for that period of time , ” she said .
“ If it was not for that center , I do not know what I could do for her .
. . .
I would have to quit my job . ”
Greenwood , 85 , has diabetes that resulted in a leg amputation , a hand deformity that prevents her from feeding herself and a swallowing disorder that requires her meals to be pureed .
Sitting in a shiny blue wheelchair and wearing hoop earrings , she said she feels at home at the center , where she goes to art class , exercises and chats .
“ I used to pray that the Lord would take me so I do n’t be a burden on anybody , ” she said in a Southern accent .
“ But he do n’t listen .
So here I am . ”
Now Greenwood looks forward to art class .
“ It ’s just fun to come and be with other people , ” she said .
“ If this place closes , I would be home with me and the puppy because my daughter works . ”
In the afternoon , a volunteer led the participants in spiritual songs .
Some sang along .
Others clapped .
“ Oh Lord ! ” one yelled out .
Greenwood sat at her table , swaying gently .
I ’ll fly away , oh glory , I ’ll fly away .
When I die , hallelujah , by and by , I ’ll fly away .

After facing a barage of withering criticism from fellow Republicans -- including a former RNC chairman who told him to stop serving " two masters " -- Michael Steele is firing back :
ABC News ’ Aaron Katersky and Rick Klein report : RNC Chairman Michael Steele is lashing out his critics , with a series of blunt messages for prominent Republicans who have blasted him over his leadership for the Republican Party .
“ I tell them to get a life .
That ’s old Washington , that ’s old ways , and I do n’t represent that , and that kills them , ” Steele told ABC News Radio in an interview today .
“ I ’m telling them and I ’m looking them in the eye and say I ’ve had enough of it .
If you do n’t want me in the job , fire me .
But until then , shut up .
Get with the program or get out of the way . ”
At issue : today 's Washington Times report that leading Republicans are furious at Steele for tending to his own private financial interests while the party 's anemic fundraising continues to suffer .
According to the Times report , the RNC has just $ 8.7 million cash on hand , nearly $ 5 million less than the DNC and far below the $ 35 million it had entering the last mid-term election .
When Steele took the reigns of the RNC , it had $ 23 million cash , but it spent heavily on Congressional special elections and Gubernatorial races .
Steele , who has been accepting hefty fees for speaking engagements while earning over $ 200,000 as RNC Chairman ( with unlimited expenses ) , is busy promoting a new book , drawing criticism for former RNC chairmen like Jim Nicholson .
" Under those circumstances , I do not see how a chairman can do book tours and give speeches for fees that go to him and not the RNC , which needs more money badly , " said Mr. Nicholson , who was President George W. Bush 's secretary of veterans affairs .
" You can not serve two masters in that job , " Mr. Nicholson said .
" I think when elected , you agree to give the RNC and its mission 100 percent of your efforts . "
Buried in the last line of the Times article is a suggestion that Nicholson may actually have the RNC rulebook on his side :
RNC ethics rules appear to forbid anyone working for the national committee from taking outside income or using a committee position for personal gain .
If that 's true , Michael Steele may be in a ton of trouble .
Although it 's unclear to what extent he will profit from the book , he has made money giving speeches .
And now that he 's telling his Republican critics to " shut up " or " fire me , " it will be entertaining to see which it will be .
Join the discussion in brooklynbadboy 's diary , Steele : " Fire me or shut up ! " .
An Atheist civil rights group today denounced a statement by a representative of the American Family Association that gay and lesbian Americans should be forced to receive " Reparative Therapy " and compared homosexuals to intravenous drug users .
Dr. Ed Buckner , President of American Atheists , said that the proposal " borders on Orwellian totalitarianism and seeks to further criminalize behavior over which the churches and the government should have no control whatsoever .
Atheists have a wide variety of opinions about these
matters , and ours is not a gay rights organization , but we do firmly and consistently oppose privileging religious posturing in determining what is legally acceptable or to set government policy .
Religionists who want to enlist government in their efforts to persecute others must be firmly
opposed . "

Brian Fisher of the American Family Association told a radio audience earlier this week that homosexuals should be compelled to receive government - ordered psychotherapy for the same reason that drug users are often pushed into treatment .
" Compelling gays and lesbians to receive ' treatment ' for consensual , adult behaviors is not only ineffective but politically unacceptable and ethically wrong , " said Buckner .
" This is the old religious right canard that gays are under the influence of Satan and are ' sick ' because of
their sexual proclivities . "

In a web posting , Fisher tried to justify his earlier statement by citing government statistics ; he noted that the FDA , for instance , says that gay men have a greater chance of contracting HIV and other diseases than straight males .
" That 's a public health issue , " said Buckner .
" The AFA is n't really interested in public health hygiene ; they 're pushing a relentless religious agenda that stigmatizes Americans based on sexual preference . "
Dave Silverman , Communications Director for American Atheists , said that Fisher 's remarks reflect the anti-gay , bible - based agenda of the AFA .
" Since its founding in 1977 by Rev. Donald Wildmon , the American Family Associating has targeted gay men and women and done everything possible to deny this group of millions of Americans their civil rights . "
" This proposal for government - mandated therapy sounds more like the old Soviet Union than the United States , " added Silverman .
" What is Fisher going to do when people refuse to be ' treated ' ?
Will homosexuals who do not cooperate with this offensive bullying be put in jail or camps ? "
Mr. Silverman says that when he learned of this proposal by AFA , he laughed at how the group is often mischaracterized as a " conservative " organization .
" Conservatives used to be suspicious of too much government .
Now , we have AFA calling for the ultimate in government surveillance , control and compulsion .
I wonder , if this proposal somehow became law , how much money and many police agents it would take to enforce it ? "

The clothing retailer H & M promised on Wednesday to stop destroying new , unworn clothing that it cannot sell at its store in Herald Square , and would instead donate the garments to charities .
The practice was discovered by Cynthia Magnus , a graduate student at the City University of New York , who found bags of unworn but mutilated clothing that had been thrown away by H & M on West 35th Street .
She also found bags of new Wal - Mart garments with holes punched through them .
After Ms. Magnus wrote to H & M’s headquarters in Sweden and got no response , she contacted The New York Times .
More slashed clothing was found Monday night on 35th Street and reported in the About New York column on Wednesday .
“ It will not happen again , ” said Nicole Christie , a spokeswoman for H & M in New York .
“ We are committed 100 percent to make sure this practice is not happening anywhere else , as it is not our standard practice . ”
Here , for your convenience , we have assembled a checklist of all the equipment we recommend having on hand , just in case today is the day .
We will add to it as we add articles .
Each item on the list has a number associated with it ( 1 through 5 ) .
If the item is a 1 , it is either not that critical , or only useful in unlikely apocalypse scenarios .
However if an item is a 5 , having it on hand will be the difference between life and death .
Of course , this is not just a simple check list one can blindly follow , each item requires careful consideration .
For example if you ’re in Mexico , a brimmed hat would be on your list , rather than a winter hat .
To help , each item has links to our articles related to it .

Being a bit of a freak I actually tend to read my boot output .
Well , when I 'm not using that time to go grab a cup of coffee first thing on a Monday morning .
However I do n't always find Debian 's default output as clear as I 'd like ( especially when I have n't had that coffee yet , or when I 'm half watching a remote machine boot over its serial console ) .
ISTR that RedHat had much nicer boot output ( I 'm talking about text based here , not the fancy Plymouth stuff ) with a row of OK / FAILED etc down the right hand side that made it nice and obvious what was happening .
Of course we can do that with Debian , at least for packages that use the lsb - base logging functions .
Drop the following into / etc / lsb - base - logging.sh and enjoy a slightly prettier boot .
I 'm slowly filing wishlist bugs with patches for those bits and pieces I use that do n't use lsb - base for their init script logging .
# Colour our init scripts output # int log_end_message ( int exitstatus ) log_end_msg () { #
If no arguments were passed , return if [ - z " $ { 1 : -} " ] ; then return 1 fi retval=$ 1 log_end_msg_pre " $ @ " #

( This is mostly for my own future reference , because I keep trying to search for details on it and not finding exactly what I want .
I forget where I even found the basis for this , though there are lots of similar snippets out there .
I 've not tried it with a concurrency based boot so it may well look horrible under that . )

And the winner is Michael Steele , the GOP chaiman .
From an AP report on a debate between Steele and Harold Ford Jr. , a former Democratic House member , at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock :
“ Trust me , after taxes , a million dollars is not a lot of money , ” Steele said .
Yes , he said after taxes .
( Steele was attacking President Barack Obama ’s plan to let George W. Bush ’s tax cuts for the wealthy expire . )
So is the Democratic attack ad finished yet ?

An on - camera Q&A session between Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama today was less of an open discussion of the big policy debates and more about giving senators in tough re-election fights the chance to be seen questioning the president .
All but two of the eight questioners face stiff challenges this fall .
And they mostly asked questions that are central to their campaigns .
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York wanted to know about health care for 9/11 responders in New York .
Sen. Barbara Boxer of California spoke about California ’s ailing economy .
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania wanted to know about trade with China .
And Sen. Blanche Lincoln or Arkansas wondered whether Democrats would push back against ideologues in the party and work with Republicans .
Obama told many of them what they wanted to hear–and gave them an opportunity for high - profile coverage in their home states .
“ Blanche is exactly right , ” Obama said .
“ Sometimes we get ideologically bogged down .
I — I just want to find out what works .
And I — I know you do too .
And I know the people in Arkansas do too . ”
There was little if any discussion about how to move forward with health care , energy , financial regulation , education or any of the other tough issues that are stuck in the Congress — or , in some cases , the Senate in particular .
As the event concluded , might Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont , be a little worried ?
He is considered to be a safe bet for re-election , but he did get the chance to ask a question .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ’s spokesman assured Washington
Wire that there are no such concerns .
One of the things I love best about the winter in Texas is being able to have a salad from my garden .
If you are anything like me , you might find cold weather greens a little hard to take with a light salad dressing .
That 's why I developed this hearty , intense miso tahini dressing .
It complements hardcore salad greens really nicely , though it goes well on good old romaine lettuce too .
This dressing also tastes great drizzled over cooked vegetables of any sort , especially greens .
I love it with kale or collards .
One of the best things about this dressing is that it 's very nutritious .
Every single ingredient is good for you .
The tahini is a good source of minerals , including calcium .
Miso is a fermented soy product that 's easy to digest , with tons of good bacteria to boot .
Ginger and garlic are both good for boosting your immune system .
1 clove garlic , minced
1 inch piece ginger , minced
1 tablespoon tahini
1 tablespoon miso
2 - 4 tablespoons water
Mix all of the ingredients together with a fork or a small wisk .
Start out with just a bit of water , and keep adding water until you reach your desired consistency .
( The amount of water you need depends on how thick your tahini and miso are . )
Variations : Squeeze a bit of lemon juice in this dressing to lighten it up .
Or make it a little heavier with a dash of sesame oil .
An attorney for the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office told a federal judge that the agency destroyed documents it should have retained as part of a racial - profiling lawsuit , opening the door for sanctions against Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's agency .
Tim Casey , an attorney representing Arpaio , admitted to U.S. District Judge G. Murray
Snow that deputies destroyed " stat sheets " generated in Arpaio 's controversial " crime suppression operations " and had also failed to retain thousands of emails , all of which the agency could have turned over to plaintiffs ' attorneys in the lawsuit .
The plaintiffs ' attorneys , who represent five people claiming sheriff 's deputies detained them because of their skin color , filed a motion asking Snow for sanctions in November .
The hour - long hearing Thursday was the first chance for both parties to make their case in front of Snow , who essentially separated the destroyed " stat sheets " from the deleted emails .
Casey said that confusion among deputies over which stat sheets to retain and a lack of communication about keeping emails led to the lost and destroyed documents .
Attorneys for the plaintiffs claim the material would show the Sheriff 's Office engaged in selective enforcement during the crime - suppression operations .
" Does n't that make information that might have been contained on those stat sheets relevant ? "
Snow asked , which Casey did not dispute .
Snow then asked if the legal requirement for sanctions was met when it came to the destroyed stat sheets .
" Yes , " Casey replied .
Snow held off on the sanctions ruling and told both parties to return for a conference in mid-March .
By then , the sheriff 's attorneys should have turned over thousands of emails related to the activities of the Human Smuggling Unit .
Attorneys for the plaintiffs , including the American Civil Liberties Union and lawyers from Steptoe and Johnson , who also represent The Arizona Republic , claim the emails should have been preserved from the time the lawsuit was filed in December 2007 .
Sheriff 's officials either ignored that stipulation or did n't adequately communicate it to members of the Human Smuggling Unit .
Casey told the court on Thursday that any Human Smuggling Unit emails generated before Oct. 31 were gone , unless they were specifically saved .
Casey said emails from the unit during a 28 - day period in November added up to more than 400,000 documents while about 3,800 emails remained from all of 2007 and about 9,800 from 2008 .
" It 's a problem that has to be addressed with the ( Sheriff 's Office ) so it 's not repeated , " he said .
Casey reminded the court that sheriff 's personnel testified that the deleted emails were " chit chat " and anything relevant to the case was produced .
In the last two months , the Sheriff 's Office has turned over about 1,000 pages of documents to the plaintiff 's attorneys .
Peter Kozinets , an attorney for the plaintiffs , said the case represents an egregious violation of the sheriff 's discovery duties .
" More than two years have gone by and for us to be getting this now is simply intolerable , " Kozinets said .

Today 's Theorem on Thursday 1 October , 2020
Yesterday 's Theorem Tomorrow 's Theorem Complete Listing Welcome to a gallery whose exhibits are the crowning achievements of mathematics : her theorems .
Each day offers a different theorem ( or lemma , law , formula or identity ) , each one worthy of adorning the walls of a mathematical Abattoirs , Baltic , Duniya , Guggenheim , Louvre , Nail Factory , Staatliche Museen , Tate , Uffizi or Zach Feuer .
Each theorem has been presented so as to be appreciated by as wide an audience as possible .
If the statement of the theorem appears obscure , pass on to the illustration and its accompanying explanation .
If it still seems hard it is probably because it is hard .
But no more than O'Keeffe 's Blue and Green Music , say , is a ' hard ' painting or Hepworth 's Two Figures is a ' hard ' sculpture .
It is there for you to engage with on your own terms .
By ' engage ' I mean : admire it , turn it over in your mind , try to follow the example , if one is given ; if you are studying it on - line , follow the web link , which will provide a pictorial interpretation , a proof or even a clever animation .

Some days are harder than others .
I hope even the most difficult days offer something of wonder .

Here is an excerpt :
In Haiti … human trafficking is a problem at the best of times .
Even without the pandemonium unleashed by a 7.0 earthquake , an estimated quarter - million Haitian children are trafficked within the country each year .
These slaves , known as restavecs , are typically sold or given away to new families by their own impoverished parents .
Physical and sexual abuse is common for restavecs .
Many owners use the girls as in - house prostitutes , sending them to live on the street if they become pregnant .
Not all of these trafficked children end up as domestic slaves within Haiti:plenty of others are promised work in the Dominican Republic but are instead sold to work in agricultural fields or brothels across the border .
Poor children who escape a life in bondage most often end up in street gangs ; if they are fortunate , they may be accepted into overcrowded orphanages .

The head of one of the world ’s most prominent Jewish advocacy groups has accused Rush Limbaugh of making “ borderline anti-Semitic comments ” by linking Jews to banking .
Discussing the Massachusetts Senate race and President Obama ’s proposed financial reforms on the Rush Limbaugh Show Wednesday , the controversial commentator said :
To some people , “ banker ” is code word for Jewish ; and guess who Obama is assaulting ?
He ’s assaulting bankers .
He ’s assaulting money people .
And a lot of those people on Wall Street are Jewish .
So I wonder if there ’s starting to be some buyer ’s remorse there ?

Limbaugh ’s invocation of an old stereotype about Jews and their role in banking got the attention of Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League .
“ Rush Limbaugh reached a new low with his borderline anti-Semitic comments about Jews as bankers , their supposed influence on Wall Street , and how they vote , ” Foxman said in a statement emailed to media on Thursday .
Foxman said :
Limbaugh ’s references to Jews and money in a discussion of Massachusetts politics were offensive and inappropriate .
While the age - old stereotype about Jews and money has a long and sordid history , it also remains one of the main pillars of anti-Semitism and is widely accepted by many Americans .
His notion that Jews vote based on their religion , rather than on their interests as Americans , plays into the hands of anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists .
Foxman added that “ Limbaugh should apologize . ”
Limbaugh “ is on uniquely dangerous grounds here , ” writes M.J. Rosenberg at TalkingPointsMemo .
“ The ‘ Jews = Bankers ’ meme is not that common in this country .
It is European , and was put to its most deadly use by Hitler . ”

Last year , Limbaugh raised eyebrows when he criticized President Obama for bringing up the Holocaust during a visit to Germany .
Limbaugh argued that Obama should n’t be criticizing Germany “ for what it did 60 or 65 years ago . ”
That was interpreted by some as demeaning the significance of the Holocaust .
During the 2008 presidential campaign , Limbaugh drew the attention of the Jewish community when he said that Jewish Americans ’ overwhelming support for Obama was the result of “ white guilt , ” among other things .
The following audio was broadcast on The Rush Limbaugh Show , Wednesday January 20 , 2010 , and uploaded to the Web by MediaMatters .

There are quite a few comic book creators who have illustrated very good original album art for bands over the years , which is why i find it particularly painful to see the sub - par art coming out of Bluewater for their new series , " Rock N Roll Comics . "
It 's bad enough that The Flaming Lips had to release their something - of - a - let - down cover of " The Dark Side of the Moon , " but now we have to suffer through cover art like this :
There is absolutely no reason for this .
None .
And while it 's pretty obvious that Bluewater will make a comic for , literally , anything or anyone .
But , I really wish they would leave things like Led Zeppelin alone .
Is nothing sacred ?!?!
Apparently not .
So while Bluewater prepares to make us suffer through 70 biographies in 10 volumes of this stuff -- and since Topless Robot has already written a good run-down of 10 worst album covers by comic artists -- we'd like to highlight some of the best , to help wash the taste out of our mouth .
1. Richard Corben - Meat Loaf 's Bat Out of Hell
Because really , how can you top it ?
2. R. Crumb - Big Brother and the Holding Company 's Cheap Thrills
Jam - packed with telling - cultured clues , this is probably the most famous comic - inspired album cover .
3. Raymond Pettibon - Sonic Youth's Goo
It 's sort of cheating as Pettibon is n't a really a graphic - novelist .
Still , much of his work is very comic - like , single - panel political pieces .
So , I 'm including it because I set the rules .
Mmmwwwhahaha !
4. Bill Sieniewicz - RZA 's Bobby Digital in Stereo
Fellow member of the Wu Tang Clan , GZA , hired Deny Cowan for his album cover on Liquid Swords , but Sieniewicz 's cover is the clear winner .
Not to downplay Cowan though , whose work on D.C. 's The Question is quite good .
5. Dave McKean - Stabbing Westward 's Darkest Days
Extremely creepy , and a perfect set - up for the concept album that led to the band 's commercial failure and subsequent drop from Columbia records .
Yes , a hard rain 's gonna fall , Stabbing Westward , and that umbrella is n't going to help .
6. Alex Ross - Anthrax 's Music of Mass Destruction
So . #$(*ING . Metal .
Ross also did the album art for the band 's album We've Come For You , unfortunately it is n't so much metal as it is homo - erotic in a creepy Star Trek kind of way .
7. Craig Thompson - Menomena 's Friend and Foe
An homage , or perhaps just a connection only I see , Thompson 's cover reminds me of Gary Patner 's ( Jimbo ) work on The Red Hot Chili Pepper 's debut .
8. Greg Capullo - Korn 's Follow the Leader
Stop .
This is n't about the music on the album , it 's about the art on the album , and Capullo 's image , while McFarlane as it is , sums up the doomed anger of the early 1990's that plagued the airwaves .
9. John Byrne - Joe Satriani's Surfing with the Alien
Come on , just look how cool that is !
Plus , apparently , Satriani just went ahead and lifted the image of Silver Surfer and Galactus ( hand featured on the back ) without permission in true Rock N Roll fashion .
Also , there 's a song about Ice 9 from Vonnegut 's Cat 's Cradle on the album , and the title track is like , one of the hardest songs on Guitar Hero .
Nerd cred +10 .
10 . Dave Gibbons - Kula Shaker's K
A strange cover for a strange band .
Can you name all the historical faces ?
11 . Dan Clowes -
Thee Headcoasts 's Heavens to Murgatroyd , Even !
It 's Thee Headcoats ( Already ) !
Weird .
Wonderful .
I would n't mind if more band used ridiculously long album titles as long as Dan Clowes did the covers .
12 . Paul Pope - Heavy Trash Self Titled
The cover art itself is n't that amazing , but once you open the album , you 'll find that the face is simple a poster on the wall of the recording studio behind great renditions of musicians Jon Spencer and Matt Verta - Ray .
13 . Richie Bucher - Green Day's Dookie
Bucher was n't an artist so much as musician , but Billy Armstrong enjoyed the comic - like work he did for other East Bay bands and commissioned him for the band 's debut album .
So , like Goo , maybe this one does n't count either .
14 . Mike Allred - Ingredient 's Bears Driving Trains
A friend tipped me off to this delightful oddity .
A band from Eugene , OR somehow has connections to the Madman creator , and got him to draw this cover that appears to be band members on flying guitars racing a train driven by bears . . .
15 . Stanley Mouse and Alton Kelley - Grateful Dead's From The Mars Hotel
Okay , this one definitely does n't count .
I only include this because of its obvious influence on the teaser image for The Umbrella Academy 's Hotel Oblivion .
Possible connection ?
Probably not plot - wise , as I do n't see writer Gerard Way being much of a Deadhead .
But if Way and Gabriel Bá can somehow work in references to " Scarlet Begonias " in the upcoming series , I 'll be impressed .
Please post your links to other great albums covers by comic creators !

A group of engineers working on a novel manufacturing technique at NASA 's Langley Research Center in Hampton , Va. , have come up with a new twist on the popular old saying about dreaming and doing : " If you can slice it , we can build it . "
That 's because layers mean everything to the environmentally - friendly construction process called Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication , or EBF3 , and its operation sounds like something straight out of science fiction .
" You start with a drawing of the part you want to build , you push a button , and out comes the part , " said Karen Taminger , the technology lead for the Virginia - based research project that is part of NASA 's Fundamental Aeronautics Program .
She admits that , on the surface , EBF3 reminds many people of a Star Trek replicator in which , for example , Captain Picard announces out loud , " Tea , Earl Grey , hot . "
Then there is a brief hum , a flash of light and the stimulating drink appears from a nook in the wall .
In reality , EBF3 works in a vacuum chamber , where an electron beam is focused on a constantly feeding source of metal , which is melted and then applied as called for by a drawing -- one layer at a time -- on top of a rotating surface until the part is complete .
While the options for using EBF3 are more limited than what science fiction allows , the potential for the process is no less out of this world , with promising relevance in aviation , spaceflight -- even the medical community , Taminger said .
advertisement
Commercial applications for EBF3 are already known and its potential already tested , Taminger said , noting it 's possible that , within a few years , some aircraft will be flying with large structural parts made by this process .
To make EBF3 work there are two key requirements :
A detailed three - dimensional drawing of the object to be created must be available , and the material the object is to be made from must be compatible for use with an electron beam .
First , the drawing is needed to break up the object into layers , with each cross-section used to guide the electron beam and source of metal in reproducing the object , building it up layer by layer .
" If you take a slice through a typical truss , you can see a couple of dots in each cross-section that move as you go from layer to layer , " Taminger said .
" When complete , you see those moving dots actually allowed you to build a diagonal brace into the truss . "
Second , the material must be compatible with the electron beam so that it can be heated by the stream of energy and briefly turned into liquid form , making aluminum an ideal material to be used , along with other metals .
advertisement
In fact , the EBF3 can handle two different sources of metal -- also called feed stock -- at the same time , either by mixing them together into a unique alloy or embedding one material inside another .
The potential use for the latter could include embedding a strand of fiber optic glass inside an aluminum part , enabling the placement of sensors in areas that were impossible before , Taminger said .
While the EBF3 equipment tested on the ground is fairly large and heavy , a smaller version was created and successfully test flown on a NASA jet that is used to provide researchers with brief periods of weightlessness .
The next step is to fly a demonstration of the hardware on the International Space Station , Taminger said .
Future lunar base crews could use EBF3 to manufacture spare parts as needed , rather than rely on a supply of parts launched from Earth .
Astronauts might be able to mine feed stock from the lunar soil , or even recycle used landing craft stages by melting them .
But the immediate and greatest potential for the process is in the aviation industry where major structural segments of an airliner , or casings for a jet engine , could be manufactured for about $ 1,000 per pound less than conventional means , Taminger said .
Environmental savings also are made possible by deploying EBF3 , she added .
Normally an aircraft builder might start with a 6,000 - pound block of titanium and machine it down to a 300 - pound part , leaving 5,700 pounds of material that needs to be recycled and using several thousand gallons of cutting fluid used in the process ..
" With EBF3 you can build up the same part using only 350 pounds of titanium and machine away just 50 pounds to get the part into its final configuration , " Taminger said .
" And the EBF3 process uses much less electricity to create the same part . "
While initial parts for the aviation industry will be simple shapes , replacing parts already designed , future parts designed from scratch with the EBF3 process in mind could lead to improvements in jet engine efficiency , fuel burn rate and component lifetime .
" There 's a lot of power in being able to build up your part layer by layer because you can get internal cavities and complexities that are not possible with machining from a solid block of material , " Taminger said .

" All - you - can - drink " promotions could be banned and compulsory identity checks introduced under government proposals to crack down on alcohol abuse .
If the plans for England and Wales are approved , bars will also not be able to hold speed - drinking competitions .
Retailers or publicans in breach of the code could be fined or jailed .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said there was a " duty to act " .
The Tories said they would give councils more powers to tackle " problem " bars and clubs .
It is estimated that alcohol abuse kills 40,000 people in England and Wales every year , with the annual cost of drink - related crime and disorder in the UK as a whole put at between £ 8bn and £ 13 bn .
' Irresponsible '
If the government 's proposals receive parliamentary approval , they will form a new mandatory code for retailers .
The key points of the parties ' proposals are : LABOUR Bar staff and retailers required to demand proof of age of anyone who looks under 18
Ban " irresponsible " promotions such as all - you - can - drink offers and speed - drinking contests and ensure free tap water available Pubs having to make small measures of beers , wines and spirits available CONSERVATIVES
Giving councils the power to charge levy on premises causing problems late at night , including off - licences open after 10.30 pm and pubs open after midnight Duty increase on problem drinks , such as some very strong beers or alcopops Permanently shutting down pubs which repeatedly break the rules
The Liberal Democrats have already outlined policies to curb excessive drinking , including stopping " irresponsible " promotions by setting a minimum price for alcohol
The party also advocates a " one - strike - and - you ' re - out " policy , where shops would be fined and lose their licence the first time they are caught selling alcohol to children .
' Magic bullet '
Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4 's
Today programme he had not ruled out the possibility of using pricing measures to make alcohol less easily available , but such a move was not " a magic bullet " .
" We do n't want to ensure that people ... on good incomes can just carry on as normal , but responsible drinkers on low incomes are hit . "
But Mr Johnson said a minority of outlets ran irresponsible promotions : " These practices have a real impact on society , not to mention the lives of those who just want to enjoy a good night out . "
CASE STUDY Barbara Vowles , manager of Chambers , Darlington
We have a normal pub and a nightclub .
We did have a 69 p drink promotion on Thursday nights but we have put it up to £ 1 for some bottles of beer , vodka and mixer .
I did it to make a stand , to highlight the issue .
Other places in Darlington were doing it and we had to fight for customers .
I have been in the pub trade for 32 years and it is getting harder .
We are competing with the supermarkets - most of us buy our alcohol from the supermarkets so we are still making money despite the cheap prices .
Pubs are closing down all the time - the recession and the smoking ban have not helped .
I would be in favour of a minimum price for alcohol as it would create a level playing field and people would then come into a pub for the atmosphere or music , not just because it sold the cheapest booze .

For the Conservatives , shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said he was " concerned " about the strength of many drinks on the market and that there would be a higher duty placed on these .
This , Mr Grayling said , would encourage manufacturers to change , although some " niche products " , such as some specialist ciders made by small breweries , would not be affected .
" The problem with minimum pricing is that it affects people who are in no way involved in anti-social behaviour , " he said .
" It puts up the price of a bottle of sherry , a bottle of wine , so responsible drinkers will end up paying more . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " Booze Britain is ruining lives and costing the country billions , but Labour has not only failed to tackle alcohol misuse , it has allowed an epidemic of drink - fuelled crime and illness to take hold .
" Now the government is ignoring its own expensive advice and experts , who say the best way to reduce alcohol misuse is to stop booze being sold at pocket money prices . "
In Scotland , the government is pushing for a minimum price for alcohol to tackle drink - related problems .
Laws requiring young people to prove their age were introduced in the country last year .
' Just tinkering '
The British Beer and Pub Association said it had been asking for legislation to crack down on irresponsible promotions in both pubs and supermarkets .
But spokesman Mark Hastings told the BBC : " What with 70 % of all alcohol sold through supermarkets and widespread concern about their promotional prices , the measures announced by the Home Office seem lopsided and unbalanced . "
The British Medical Association welcomed tougher rules on promotions as did the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) .
Commander Simon O'Brien , from Acpo , said a mandatory code for premises could " help people moderate their alcohol intake " , but he added : " The reality is that enforcement is only one avenue to bring about change in attitudes and behaviour . "
Don Shenker , from campaign group Alcohol Concern , told the BBC the proposals would not prevent people being able to " pre-load " with alcohol from supermarkets , and would not stop pubs and clubs selling a pint of lager for under £ 1 .
" It is just tinkering with the price issue rather than decisive action , " he said .
" We need a minimum price per unit of alcohol which will affect pubs , clubs , off - licences and supermarkets . "
Earlier this month , a Commons health select committee report estimated that a minimum price of 50 p per unit of alcohol would prevent 3,000 deaths a year .

Scott Brown to back Democrats ' jobs bill
By Ben Pershing
Newly elected Sen. Scott Brown ( R - Mass . ) will vote to advance Democrats ' $ 15 billion jobs bill Monday evening , breaking with his party and giving Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) one of the two votes he needs to move the measure forward .
Democrats have sought to pressure Brown into backing the measure , pointing out that he captured the late Sen.
Edward Kennedy 's ( D ) seat by promising to be an independent voice .
With Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - N.J. ) absent following his cancer diagnosis , Democrats need at least two Republican votes to reach the 60 necessary to move to final passage later this week , and so far no other GOP senator has announced plans to support the measure .
" I came to Washington to be an independent voice , to put politics aside , and to do everything in my power to help create jobs for Massachusetts families , " Brown said in a statement issued by his office .
" This Senate jobs bill is not perfect .
I wish the tax cuts were deeper and broader , but I will vote for it because it contains measures that will help put people back to work .
" I was disappointed with the continuation of politics - as - usual in the drafting of this bill , as it was crafted behind closed doors , without transparency and accountability .
I hope for improvements in that process going forward .
All of us , Republicans and Democrats , have to work together to get our economy back on track .
I hope my vote today is a strong step toward restoring bipartisanship in Washington . "
Pew Research has a new study out about Teens and Sexting .
Pew ’s focus groups revealed that teens were either romantically involved and sexting ; sharing sexting messages with people outside of the relationship ; sexting in hopes of having a relationship .
The little bastards are horny and stupid , which is the clinical definition of being a teenager .
Of course , before you get your pitchforks out and head for the nearest cell phone showroom , there ’s a lot more to this story than the mere fact that nekkid is the new wink , and sending nekkid photos of oneself is a bona fide act of flirtation .
First of all , sexting teenagers may be committing themselves to prosecution under child porn rules , and furthermore , they are all going to grow up at some point , and if they start sending nekkid pictures of themselves when they are 30 , 40 , or , shudder , beyond 50 then we all have to fear for the existence of civilization .
According to Pew :
Four percent of cell - owning teens ages 12 - 17 say they have sent sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude images of themselves to someone else via text messaging
15 percent of cell - owning teens ages 12 - 17 say they have received sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude images of someone they know via text messaging on their cell phone .
Older teens are much more likely to send and receive these images ; eight percent of 17 - year - olds with cell phones have sent a sexually provocative image by text and 30 percent have received a nude or nearly nude image on their phone .
The teens who pay their own phone bills are more likely to send “ sexts ” : 17 percent of teens who pay for all of the costs associated with their cell phones send sexually suggestive images via text ; just three percent of teens who do not pay for , or only pay for a portion of the cost of the cell phone send these images .
So , the little bastards have pretty much figured out that the most rebellious activity at hand is the weilding of a cell phone .
They can sext , and they can sext and drive at the same time , and then , they can share all of this in a manner that guarantees that at some point in the future , as they get ready for that slot of the Supreme Court , someone will pull up an old picture of them at 16 , pulling up their shirt , or dropping their pants .
They will crash our cars , ruin our legislative bodies , and crap on nekkidness for the rest of us .
Little bastards !

Bob Patefield , an English amateur photographer , video - recorded an outrageous Terrorism
Act stop - and - search in Accrington town centre last December , where he was stopped by a police community support officer ( a kind of junior copper ) who told him he was under suspicion of terrorism for taking pictures of the Christmas celebration — Santa Claus , a pipe band , and so on .
Patefield asked if the officer had any " reasonable , articulable suspicion " to justify him giving his details .
She replied : " I believe your behaviour was quite suspicious in the manner in which you were taking photographs in the town centre … I 'm suspicious in why you were taking those pictures .
" I'm an officer of the law , and I 'm requiring you , because I believe your behaviour to be of a suspicious nature , and of possibly antisocial [ nature ] …
I can take your details just to ascertain that everything is OK . "
Patefield and his friend maintained that they did not want to disclose their details .
They were stopped a third and final time when returning to their car .
This time the officer was accompanied by an acting sergeant .
" Under law , fine , we can ask for your details – we 've got no powers , " he said .
" However , due to the fact that we believe you were involved in antisocial behaviour , ie taking photographs … then we do have a power under [ the Police Reform Act ] to ask for your name and address , and for you to provide it .
If you do n't , then you may be arrested . "

With Thursday ’s announcement that Rep. Lincoln Diaz - Balart ( R - FL ) will not seek re-election in his Miami - area district , the number of Republicans not running for re-election to the House now amounts to more than 10 percent of the House Republican caucus , compared to less than five percent for Democrats .
Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post notes that the total number of House Republicans set to retire or seek other office is now 18 , or slightly more than 10 percent of the 178 seats the GOP holds in the House .
ADVERTISEMENT
By comparison , Roll Call ’s list of departing lawmakers shows that only 12 House Democrats are retiring , or slightly less than five percent of the Democrats ’ 255 seats .
The numbers are a little more even in the Senate , where five Republicans — Kit Bond ( R - MO ) , Sam Brownback ( R- KS ) , Jim Bunning ( R - KY ) , Judd Gregg ( R- NH ) and George Voinovich ( R - OH ) — are retiring or seeking other office .
Four Democrats — Roland Burris ( D - IL ) , Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) , and Ted Kaufman ( D - DE ) — are also leaving the Senate .
Brian Beutler at TalkingPointsMemo reports that most of the 18 House seats vacated by Republicans this year are in solid GOP territory , but Diaz - Balart ’s heavily Latino district in the Miami area may be competitive in the fall .
While George W. Bush comfortably won the district in 2000 and 2004 — by 58 and 57 percent , respectively — the 2008 races saw the district lean more to the center : John McCain won with a 51 - 49 percent margin over Barack Obama .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Miami Herald describes Diaz - Balart as “ a passionate defender and architect of legislation to strengthen the US embargo against Cuba . ”
The paper also notes reports that Diaz - Balart ’s brother , Mario Diaz - Balart , is considering running for the vacated seat .
Despite the higher retirement numbers for Republicans than for Democrats , much of the media ’s attention has focused on Democrats , with numerous commentators arguing that the numbers spell trouble for the Democratic Party in 2010 .
In December , the Washington Post ran a story stating that strategists fear Democratic retirements “ represent the leading edge of a wave of departures that could leave the Democrats vulnerable to significant losses in the 2010 midterm elections . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Reporting on four Democratic retirement announcements in 24 hours in January , Politico declared that “ the grim outlook for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections just got a little worse . ”
Aside from Diaz - Balart , this week marked the departure of two other lawmakers from the House .
Democrat Diane Watson of California and Republican Vern Ehlers of Michigan both announced plans to retire .
GRAND RAPIDS -- Jena Lewis believes getting a Michigan driver 's license that identifies who you are should not be a political issue .
Lewis , who went through a sex change more than five years ago , carries a driver 's license that identifies her as a female .
But Gary Glenn , leader of a Midland - based anti-gay group , believes Lewis ' license should still bear an " M " instead of an " F . "
The issue could become a political hot potato in this year 's campaign to replace Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land , who is leaving office because of term limits .
The Secretary of State sets the policy that decides when and if a person can change the gender designation on his or her driver 's license .
The issue surfaced recently when Paul Scott , a Republican candidate for Secretary of State , announced that one of his top priorities will be to " ensure transgender individuals will not be allowed to change the sex on their driver 's license in any circumstance . "
That drew objections from the transgender community , which asked why Scott would raise an issue that has been settled since 2005 .
" Harm will only come from changing this rule , and this rule is causing no harm at this time , " said Lewis .
Lewis argued people whose driver 's licenses do not reflect their gender are in danger of being mistreated .
In some cases , their treatment needs have been ignored by paramedics or they have been abused by police officers , she said .
Scott , a state representative from Grand Blanc , said he did not intend to provoke controversy .
His pledge to deny gender change requests " may have been inartful , " he said .
" I just wanted people to know what my position on the issue is , " he said .
" If I am elected , I will follow Michigan and federal law . "
Other candidates , who will be nominated at their party 's state conventions , are less reluctant to embrace the issue .
Democrat Jocelyn Benson said she supports the current system of responding to requests that are properly documented .
" I 'm not going to stick my nose into anyone 's private decision , " she said .
" Whern there is proper documentation to reflect a fact , then our records should support what the documentation says . "
Likewise , Republican Anne Norlander , of Battle Creek , said she would assign gender on the basis of whatever court orders and medical records the applicant presents .
Requests for gender changes are rare , said Kelly Chesney , Land 's spokeswoman .
She said the department does not keep records of how many requests are processed .
Nonetheless , Glenn said the issue is important to his Midland - based American Family Association .
He said his group will ask Secretary of State candidates how they will handle requests to change gender designation on a driver 's license .
" I think there are all kinds of implications to the privacy rights of women and children if biological males are given access to health clubs , showers , locker rooms and changing areas , " Glenn said .
But the " core issue , " said Glenn , " is whether the citizens of the state of Michigan can trust their government to tell the truth and not engage in delusion or mental or emotional disorders but to tell the simple truth .
" We may sympathize with a tiny minority 's emotional and mental struggles , but that does not absolve the government of its responsibility to tell the truth and not falsify government records . "
Lewis said the " man in the women 's bathroom " argument is a myth .
Most transgender people do not want to call attention to themselves , especially in public restrooms , she said .
" Historically , trans - people tend to have one of the lowest rates of being sexual predators , " she said .
" If a trans - man or a trans - woman were sitting next to you on the bus , chances are you would not realize it unless he or she announced it to you .
Yet every so often we have hysteria raised about trans - people . "
The issue of gender identification on driver 's licenses last surfaced in 2005 , when the American Civil Liberties Union and Transgender Michigan successfully lobbied Land 's office to honor requests to change the gender markers on licenses and state ID cards .
That policy lasted only 22 days before Land changed the rules so that gender identification could be changed only for people who present a court order or a doctor 's statement that shows a gender transition was complete .
THE CURRENT POLICY
" To change a gender on a driver license , the individual must provide an original doctor 's statement or court order .
The doctor 's statement or court order must certify that the applicant has completed the medical treatments necessary to change their gender . "
Lewis said she had the name and gender changed on her driver 's license during that 22 - day period .
She presented a letter from a therapist indicating she was in the process of a gender reassignment .
She said she now has the same designation on her birth certificate and passport .
Lewis said it 's unlikely a future Secretary of State would reverse the change made on her license .
" My birth certificate has been changed , " she said .
" He would have no way of getting me to have it changed back . "
Most people who go through a gender change do n't call attention to the fact , she said .
" Stealth is the goal , " said Lewis , who is pursuing a social work degree at Grand Valley State University
" Trans - people go to church , have families and raise children , " said Lewis , noting she is a council member at her mainline Protestant congregation .
" Trans - people are not out to do anything but live , and more often than not , live quietly and under the radar of the rest of the world . "

Sudeep Reddy summarizes a report from the Dallas Fed on " Labor Market Globalization in the Recession and Beyond " :
' Virtual ' Immigration Continued Rising During Recession , by Sudeep Reddy , Real Time Economics :
The global economic downturn spurred declines in physical immigration — the movement of people across borders — in 2008 and 2009 .
But a new Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas report says “ virtual ” immigration — moving the work rather than the workers — continued to grow .
“ Most likely , the difference stems from the jobs the two types of immigrants typically do , ” authors Michael Cox , Richard Alm and Justyna Dymerska write in the Dallas Fed ’s Economic Letter .
“ Physical immigrants work in construction and other highly cyclical industries .
Virtual immigrants are more likely to work in the services economy .
It has traditionally been less sensitive than goods to cyclical fluctuations , largely because services are n’t subject to the kind of inventory bulges that make goods production unstable . ”
Still , virtual immigration increased at a slower pace during the downturn .
...
For instance , India ’s exports in software and IT services are forecast to continue expanding .
But the projected growth rate of 17 % for 2009 is less than half the pace of the prior four years .

PayPal said a ban on personal transactions to and from India will continue for “ at least a few months ” while the online payment service tries to resolve a problem with local regulators .
The ban , which began Saturday and caught PayPal users in the country by surprise , relates to whether personal payments constitute “ remittances , ” or money sent home by people working abroad , the company said in a blog post Tuesday .
“ We temporarily suspended these services to respond to enquiries from the Indian regulators , specifically questions on whether personal payments constitute remittances into India , ” PayPal said .
The company is working with regulators and bank processing companies to resolve the problem as soon as possible , it said .
But “ personal payments to and from India will be suspended for at least a few months until we fully resolve the questions from the Indian regulators . ”
“ We realize that this is causing considerable inconvenience to our customers and I want to reassure you that this is a top priority for the leadership at PayPal , ” the company said .
PayPal notified users on Saturday that personal payments to and from India had been suspended , as well as transfers to local banks .
Customers can still make commercial payments to India , but merchants can’t withdraw funds in rupees to local banks , the company said .
On Tuesday it said customers should be able to withdraw funds to a local bank within a few days .
But for now it can do nothing to facilitate personal transactions .
The problems may have been triggered by a marketing push that promotes PayPal as a way to send money abroad , a source familiar with the matter said .
The campaign — which reads “ As low as $ 1.50 to send $ 300 to countries like India ” — may have caught the attention of Indian regulators , the source said .
Some Indians use PayPal to receive payments for services in the country such as software development .
The suspension of payments appeared to catch many by surprise and has generated more than 150 pages of comments in an online discussion thread .
Some expressed frustration that PayPal had apparently suspended payments without warning , and said they learned only from buyers that payments from overseas had been returned .
PayPal processed more than $ 4 billion of payments in the Asia Pacific region in 2008 , a PayPal spokesman said .
Its largest market in that region was Australia .
The company processed $ 60 billion in payments worldwide in 2008 .

A ringing call for a new militant Civil Rights movement “ 2.0 ” centered on the fight for jobs was recently made by leaders of the United Steelworkers , Leo W. Gerard and Fred Redmond .
“ It ’s time to stand up and be heard , ” they said .
“ It ’s time to mobilize online and in the streets .
Together , let ’s tweet , facebook and text .
Let ’s rally , vote and , where necessary , sit-in . ”
The 50th anniversary of the “ Greensboro Four , ” when Black college students ignited a movement challenging racial segregation and injustice in the South , served as shining example for the labor leaders .
“ The involvement of young people in that movement – along with religious , labor and other community leaders – cannot be underestimated , ” they noted .
“ They forced America to change for the better , to change for them . ”
Five decades later , “ it ’s time for America ’s youth to lead another revolution , one that forces the nation to solve the critical civil rights challenge of this time . ”
This challenge is jobs .
The labor leaders pointed to the unique problems facing young people .
Of the more than 46 million uninsured Americans , 13.2 million are young adults – the fastest growing segment of citizens without health benefits .
One - third of Latinos and one - fifth of blacks are uninsured compared to 13 percent of whites .
The official unemployment rate nationwide is nearly 10 percent and 20 million workers ages 16 to 24 were jobless in 2009 .
That ’s more than 50 percent of all people in that age group , union leaders note .
And unemployment rates for Blacks and Latinos are twice as high .
“ It ’s time for a revolution , ” they said .
Leaders of the civil rights movement knew good jobs provided a pathway to a better life and they knew that justice was n’t going to happen without coordinated , sustained and organized action , noted Gerard and Redmond .
Gerard and Redmond said young people today must have the same opportunities as prior generations , laying stress on the manufacturing industry , the “ great equalizer ” for America .
“ We ’re talking about new , high tech , clean , efficient and world - class manufacturing .
The making of wind turbines and solar panels to power the clean energy industry ; hybrid and electric cars , components for iPhones , laptop computers and other electronics ; materials for energy - efficient office buildings , homes and roads .
Parts needed for high - speed rail , modern schools , updated water lines , sewer systems and other infrastructure that ’s costing us money and precious time in the fight against global warming . ”
Gerard and Redmond note every manufacturing job supports five more jobs , compared to just one job supported by a service sector position .
Such jobs pay an average 10 to 50 percent more than service sector jobs .
Creating 2.5 million new manufacturing jobs would mean at least $ 100 billion for the American economy over the next decade .
Most union workers earn more than nonunion workers and more importantly they share a voice on the job when it comes to health care , stronger safety and health protections and retirement security .
If Wall Street shareholders are entitled to a share of profits , then the hard working employees who help businesses thrive should also get their fair share too , they charge .
The Steelworker leaders are calling on young people to lead the way .
“ Imagine the opportunities .
Think about the difference in your lives , in your communities .
America needs you in this fight , and you need to be in this fight , ” they said .
“ Let ’s begin a revolution . ”

Assassination without borders
CIA and mercenaries plotted murder of German citizen
By Peter Schwarz
7 January 2010
Four years ago in Hamburg , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and mercenary firm Blackwater planned and prepared the assassination of the German - Syrian businessman Mamoun Darkazanli .
This is reported by the American magazine Vanity Fair in its January issue .
The report has unleashed considerable turmoil in German political circles .
It reveals that the policy of targeted killing , the liquidation of alleged terrorists by the US , does not stop at the borders of Afghanistan , Pakistan or Yemen .
It is also practiced on the territory of Washington ’s NATO allies .
The information about the plans to murder Darkazanli can be found in a lengthy article about Erik Prince , the boss and founder of Blackwater , now called XE .
Prince founded the company in the mid-1990s with the help of an inheritance worth billions .
This former member of the elite US Navy Seals offered to provide specialised training for US military units at the company ’s premises in North Carolina .
Blackwater ’s big moment came with the declaration of the “ war on terror ” by President George W. Bush .
The company evolved into a private army , which could be deployed wherever it was too hot for the military or intelligence forces .
Between 2001 and 2009 , it collected more than $ 1.5 billion from the US government .
In 2008 alone , the firm ’s revenues amounted to $ 600 million .
In addition to training troops , Blackwater provides personal security in the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan , and also carries out the provisioning of US forces in inaccessible areas .
Mercenaries employed by the company have repeatedly caused headlines because of their brutality and trigger - happy approach .
On March 31 , 2004 , four Blackwater employees were killed and their bodies later hung from a bridge by an angry crowd in Fallujah ; on September 16 , 2007 , at an intersection in Baghdad , a group of Blackwater bodyguards shot wildly and killed 17 civilians .
Above all , Blackwater plays a key role in the targeted killings of alleged terrorists .
The private company hunts down opponents of the US government in countries where the military and intelligence agencies have no access ; they participate in air strikes with pilotless drones and organise death squads .
The firm works closely with the CIA .
The links between the two are very fluid .
Prince himself has played a dual role for six years .
Officially , he is CEO of Blackwater ; unofficially , he is an agent and one of the most important assets of the CIA .
Leading intelligence personnel , such as J. Cofer Black , the former head of the CIA ’s Counter Terrorism Center , Enrique Prado , the center ’s former chief of operations , and Rob Richer , formerly the second - in - command of the agency ’s clandestine service , have transferred from the CIA to Blackwater .
Blackwater often performs tasks with which official US agencies do not want to be publicly associated for foreign policy or legal reasons .
“ We were building a unilateral unattributable capability .
If it went bad , we were n’t expecting the chief of station , the ambassador , or anyone to bail us out , ” Prince told Vanity Fair .
The Blackwater boss agreed to speak with Vanity Fair because he feels betrayed by the Obama administration .
Last summer , the US media reported on the collaboration between the CIA and Blackwater , and about their murderous programme .
Prince , who believes a Democratic congressman passed the information to the press , is angry .
The author of the Vanity Fair article , Adam Ciralski , knows something about the CIA , having previously worked for the agency as a lawyer .
In addition to Prince ’s comments , his article also uses other insider information .
According to Ciralski , the assassination plot against Mamoun Darkazanli was developed under a CIA programme aimed at the assassination of leading Al Qaeda members .
To this end , the CIA had set up a team of agents whose job description reads : “ Find , fix and finish . ”
The responsibility for this programme was then gradually handed over to Blackwater .
Hamburg businessman Darkazanli , a German citizen of Syrian origin , has been under surveillance by the CIA since 1993 .
His phone number was allegedly found on a terror suspect arrested in Africa .
In subsequent years , it was also said to have turned up among European jihadists .
In addition , Darkazanli was alleged to have arranged the sale of a ship to Osama bin Laden ’s terrorist group and to have possessed power of attorney over an account of the Al Qaeda finance chief .
He was also said to have been in contact with the student group in Hamburg that organised the attacks of September 2001 .
In the summer of 2002 , the Chicago Tribune reported that the CIA had tried to recruit Darkazanli as an agent in Hamburg in 1999 .
At that time , the preparations for the 9/11 attacks were already underway .
Two days after the 2001 attacks , officials from Germany ’s Federal Criminal Police Office searched Darkazanli ’s apartment in Hamburg .
Three weeks later , federal prosecutors opened an investigation against him on suspicion of being involved in terrorism .
But this never led to any charges , and the investigation was halted in the summer of 2006 when federal prosecutors could find no specific ties between his business relationships with Al Qaeda leaders and their terrorist objectives .
A Spanish attempt to have Darkazanli extradited failed in the summer of 2005 because Germany ’s Supreme Court declared the law invalid that would have allowed the extradition of German citizens to other EU countries .
Darkazanli , who had spent months in custody pending extradition , was then allowed to go free .
It was under these circumstances that the CIA and Blackwater prepared Darkazanli ’s assassination .
According to Vanity Fair , “ they followed Darkazanli for weeks and worked through the logistics of how and where they would take him down . ”
Neither the German authorities nor the CIA bureau in Germany were allegedly informed about the planned action .
It is unlikely the US intelligence agency regarded the German - Syrian as a serious threat , given the intense surveillance he faced from German and American authorities .
One reason for the assassination plot could be that Darkazanli was actually recruited by the CIA in 1999 and knew things that it wanted to cover up .
In the end , he survived because the green light never came from above due to a “ lack of political will , ” according to an anonymous CIA source cited by the magazine .
Darkazanli was apparently not the only target on the CIA - Blackwater death squad list .
Vanity Fair names another potential victim as the Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan , who was alleged to have passed technical know - how about building a nuclear bomb to Iran , Libya and North Korea .
In Germany , the revelations about the assassination plot against Darkazanli have been met with outrage .
The Hamburg state prosecutor is considering whether to launch an investigation into conspiracy to commit a crime .
The domestic policy spokesman of the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) parliamentary group , Dieter Wiefelspütz , said , “ If confirmed , it was nothing more than a murder conspiracy , ” and has demanded an investigation .
The Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) domestic policy expert Wolfgang Bosbach described the accusations as “ breathtaking ” and said that investigating them was “ highly explosive . ”
However , experience teaches that neither the SPD nor the CDU will seriously challenge the US authorities .
Nevertheless , the murder plot against Darkazanli poses a warning .
It shows that the policy of targeted killing knows no borders .
In Afghanistan and Pakistan , the US and its allies now routinely kill their opponents with targeted attacks .
In Pakistan alone , 700 people have been killed by unmanned US drones in the past year , according to official sources .
Just five major al - Qaida and Taliban leaders were killed as a result .
For every “ terrorist ” killed , 140 innocent civilians die .
Even if one ignores the large number of civilians killed , it raises the question of who is a “ terrorist ” and who decides that .
If the decision lies at the discretion of intelligence agents and mercenaries , it opens the door to political caprice .
The Israeli government , a pioneer in the field of targeted killing , has systematically liquidated its political opponents in the ranks of the Palestinian national movement on the basis of charges of “ terrorism . ”
Israel , the United States , and increasingly the European governments justify the policy of targeted killing with reference to the “ war on terror . ”
In war , their argument runs , it is permitted to kill the enemy , and therefore the liquidation of “ terrorists ” is justified .
But this argument is entirely specious .
Wars are fought between states , or in the case of a civil war , between armed organisations , but not against abstract concepts such as “ terrorism . ”
If one accepts this argument , all a government needs to do is brand its opponents as “ terrorists ” in order to murder them , in violation of international law .
In this respect , the murder plot against Darkazanli is a new and sinister phenomenon .
If a hit squad comprising CIA agents and Blackwater mercenaries can plot the murder of a German citizen in Hamburg , a man twice set free by the German courts , then it is only a matter of time before similar attacks take place in Paris , London and Tokyo — or in Washington , New York and San Francisco .

SHANGHAI -- China , which for more than a year has been pushing its banks to pump out cash to offset the global downturn , abruptly reversed course Tuesday , in the clearest sign yet that Beijing has turned its attention to controlling the repercussions of that credit explosion .
The People 's Bank of China said it will raise the percentage of deposits that banks must keep in reserve and can't lend , a shift intended to stave off inflation and the asset bubbles that can accompany it .

Yesterday , I wrote a piece on how the GOP needs terrorists in order for the Republicans to terrorize Americans , because otherwise they have no platform other than basically eliminating taxes for the wealthy and corporations .
And one of the most pernicious results is that the Republicans endanger America by forcing the issues into a frame of almost solely airline safety .
The stark reality is that people who want to blow up Americans can use commonly available farm chemicals and fertilizer or the blind sheik trying to blow up a World Trade Center building in the early '90s with a car bomb .
While the Republicans are scaring us to death about preventing a plane being blown up , which is almost impossible in the long term , our entire nation is subject to attack from within without any screenings , scanners , or body searches .
It would n't take -- as we wrote several years back -- a lot of work for a terrorist to float a nuclear warhead up the Hudson in a cargo container and set it off with a cellphone .
While the GOP forces the political debate -- through FOX and general Democratic wimpiness -- to focus on preventing planes being blown up , there 's very little effective effort to keep our downtowns , malls , and legislative centers from being blown away .
The GOP enables terrorism , because the entire party runs on one grade of gas : opportunism .
Integrally related to the GOP tacit alliance with terrorists in terrorizing America is the fact that one of the most dangerous threats comes from the right - wing heirs to Timothy McVeigh , the militia movement , the Turner Diaries , etc , being stoked on by FOX and politicians such as Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin .
In a series of year - long gun attacks on Americans by Americans who believe Glenn Beck and his right - wing media colleagues that white males are victims and guns are their defense against " Socialist Tyranny , " the U.S. is confronting a possible " lone wolf " terrorist attack , and one might consider many of these shooting terrorist attacks by those who have heard the siren song of " patriotic " armed rebellion implied by Beck and his right - wingmedia cohorts .
The right - wing media , and particularly FOX and Limbaugh , have developed an encapsulated pathology that justifies attacks on the government because in their delusional worldview , the federal government is illegitimate .
While the Republicans endanger America with their political posturing on potential airplane terrorist acts -- and their hero George W. Bush was warned of 9/11 type hijackings and did absolutely nothing to prevent that infamous day -- those of us who do n't want terrorist attacks see a landscape where either fundamentalist - deluded Muslims or FOX - deluded white males present a clear and present danger to terrorist attacks on the ground , ones that can be carried out with much more ease than trying to board a plane with an explosive device .
So not only do the Republicans endanger America by trying to score political points and forgetting how vulnerable we are to foreign " cell " attacks on the ground , but also the GOP and its media shills foment domestic terrorism that is an equal threat to our lives .
Some would call Dick Cheney and his " crew " traitors .
A 49 - year - old Toronto woman was charged with assault and mischief Saturday morning for allegedly trying to push a mother and her child onto the subway tracks at Bay station .
The incident occurred at around 11:40 a.m. on Friday as a 33 - year - old mother and her six - month - old child walked along the platform , police said .
Officers allege that a female suspect then pushed the mother and her child , who was in a baby stroller , toward the tracks .
The mother managed to keep her balance , and neither she nor her child fell to the track level .
TTC spokesman Brad Ross said Friday that no train was coming into the station .
He also expressed relief that the mother and her child were not injured .
Anne Carruthers of Toronto faces an assault charge plus two counts of mischief for endangering life .
An American soldier who had been serving time in a U.S. military prison for desertion — and who was granted an early release on Saturday — said he stands by his decision to oppose the war in Iraq and wants to return to Canada .
" If I had to do it again I would , because I 'm not killing innocent people , " Cliff Cornell told CBC News on the phone from Fayetteville , N.C. " I still stand behind my decision 100 per cent .
" I am going to spend a few months with my family and then try to head back to Canada .
I have friends up there and a whole community for me to come back to , " he said .
Cornell , who held the rank of specialist , pleaded guilty to desertion last April and was sentenced to one year behind bars at a prison at the U.S. Marine Corps base at Camp Lejeune , N.C .
" Prison was rough , " he said .
At the time of his sentencing , Cornell said he fled to Canada in January 2005 — a month before his 3rd Infantry Division unit was scheduled to deploy to Iraq — because he feared for his life and could n't stomach the thought of killing anyone .
Cornell , 28 , spent four years in British Columbia before the Canadian government denied him asylum as a war objector .
On Saturday , his Canadian supporters said they believed that a letter writing campaign on Cornell 's behalf helped shorten his time behind bars .
" Canadians successfully campaigned for the U.S. military to reduce Cliff 's sentence , " Michelle Ribidoux of the War Resisters Support Campaign said in a media release on Saturday .
The statement said the letter writing campaign began last May and helped win " a slight but important reduction for Cliff . "

One fundamental step to unlocking the full transformational potential of smart mobile technology is to significantly improve the usability of multi-function devices .
As additional features have been added into mobile phones , there ’s been a natural tendency for each new feature to detract from the overall ease of use of the device :
It ’s harder for users to locate the exact function that they wish to use at any given time ;
It ’s harder for users to understand the full set of functions that are available for them to use .
This has led to feelings of frustration and disenchantment .
Devices are full of powerful functionality that is under-used and under- appreciated .
Recognising this problem , companies throughout the mobile industry are exploring approaches to improving the usability of multi-function devices .
One common idea is to try to arrange all the functionality into a clear logical hierarchy .
But as the number of available functions grows and grows , the result is something that is harder and harder to use , no matter how thoughtfully the functions are arranged .
A second common idea is to allow users to select the applications that they personally use the most often , and to put shortcuts to these applications onto the homescreen ( start screen ) of the phone .
That ’s a step forwards , but there are drawbacks with this as well :
The functionality that users want to access is more fine - grained than simply picking an application .
Instead , a user will often have a specific task in mind , such as “ phone Mum ” or “ email Susie ” or “ check what movies are showing this evening ” ;
The functionality that users want to access the most often varies depending on the context the user is in – for example , the time of day , or the user ’s location ;
The UI to creating these shortcuts can be time - consuming or intimidating .
In this context , I ’ve recently been looking at some technology developed by the startup company Intuitive User Interfaces .
The founders of Intuitive previously held key roles with the company ART ( Advanced Recognition Technologies ) which was subsequently acquired by Nuance Communications .
Intuitive highlight the following vision :
Imagine a phone that knows what you need , when you need it , one touch away .
Briefly , the technology works as follows :
An underlying engine observes which tasks the user performs frequently , and in which circumstances ;
These tasks are made available to the user via a simple top - level one - touch selection screen ;
The set of tasks in this screen vary depending on user context .
Intuitive will be showing their system , running on an Android phone , at the Mobile World Congress at Barcelona next week .
Ports to other platforms are in the works .
Of course , software that tries to anticipate a user ’s actions has sometimes proved annoying rather than helpful .
Microsoft ’s “ paperclip ” Office Assistant became particularly notorious :
It was included in versions of Microsoft Office from 1997 to 2003 – with the intention of providing advice to users when it deduced that they were trying to carry out a particular task ;
It was widely criticised for being intrusive and unhelpful ;
It was excluded from later versions ;
Smithsonian magazine in 2007 called this paperclip agent “ one of the worst software design blunders in the annals of computing “ .
It ’s down to the quality of the underlying engine whether the context - dependent suggestions provided to the user are seen as helpful or annoying .
Intuitive describe the engine in their product as “ using sophisticated machine learning algorithms ” in order to create “ a statistically driven model ” .
Users ’ reactions to suggestions also depend on the UI of the suggestion system .
Personally , I ’m sufficiently interested in this technology to have joined Intuitive ’s Advisory Board .
If anyone would like to explore this technology further , in meetings at Barcelona , please get in touch !

Ian Crosby offers up some interesting questions :
Paul Krugman maintains that Austrian business cycle theory is “ as worthy of serious study as the phlogiston theory of fire . ”
Milton Friedman claimed , less colorfully but no less categorically : “ The Hayek - Mises explanation of the business cycle is contradicted by the evidence .
It is , I believe , false . ”
Am I right to interpret this concurrence of opinion by two Nobelists from opposite ends of the political spectrum as a strong evidence that the Austrian critique is misguided ?
Are latter - day Austrians the economic equivalent of creation scientists and climate - change deniers ?
Or are there mainstream economists who take them seriously ?
And if they do , what does it say about macro as science that there should be basic disagreements about a fundamental object of study in the discipline ?
After talking to a few working economists , he concludes :
The real lack of consensus in macro , it seems , is not how to respond to a downturn in the business cycle , but what causes the business cycle in the first place .
And if mainstream macroeconomists agree that the Austrian explanation of this phenomenon is demonstrably lacking , it is not because they have a well - supported alternative or viable research program of their own .
Today ’s Austrians may be a small and dubious minority .
But they have hardly opposed themselves to the edifice of a successful science .
Does that conclusion seem right to you guys ?
And why is Austrianism appealing , anyway ?
Krugman argues that Austrianism appeals to people because it offers easy , clear - cut rules about cause and effect , and because it appeals to individuals ’ moral sense . *
But I think part of the reason people are attracted to the Austrian school is that more mainstream economists do n’t seem as interested in gaining public ( i.e. , nonacademic ) acceptance of their ideas as the Austrians are .
Whether or not they ’re “ serious , ” the Austrians are definitely serious about promoting their theories .
The Austrians have the Mises Institute , dedicated to spreading their ideas .
They have the legions of Ron Paul supporters , most of whom lean towards Austrianism and are eager to tell you about it .
And various Austrians and Austrian - leaning folks are responsible for clever things like the Keynes vs. Hayek rap video and Peter Schiff ’s series of YouTube videos .
Russ Roberts , a professor at George Mason University who is behind the rap video , has written about the peculiarity of GMU ’s “ Austrian - flavored ” economics department :
We do n’t just speak to the academy .
We blog .
We write novels .
We write letters to the editor .
Op - ed columns .
We write books for a general audience .
This is n’t an aberration .
It is n’t just tolerated .
It ’s honored .
The point is that while it ’s easy to find someone ready to convert you to Austrianism , you just do n’t see “ mainstream ” economists out there trying to explain the basics of their theories to the masses .
The closest you get to a public evangelist for Keynesian economics , for example , is Krugman , who generally focuses his New York Times column on the political and policy implications of economics — not the underlying theory .
And yet when he has tried to explain the counterintuitive parts of Keynesianism , Krugman ’s actually been fairly effective .
Witness this Slate article from 1998 , in which Krugman talks about a microeconomy in order to explain his theories about the larger economy .
More of that , please !

I do n’t want this column to be seen as bashing the US .
However , there is much to validly criticize about the current model in the US and much to dissent from , also .
There is little that comes from above that I agree with here in my accidental country of birth — I did n’t agree with it when Bush was president — and I still oppose the policies with all my might now that there is a new Emperor .
During the Nuremberg trials , the chief prosecutor for the US , Supreme Court Justice , Robert H. Jackson , made the distinction between the actions of the Third Reich and the German people .
While “ just following orders ” could not be used as a defense , merely living in a country that was committing atrocities could not be turned against a “ regular ” German citizen in a court of law .
Now , while I agree with the legality of that stance , I do not agree with the morality of this position .
How can one just turn a blind eye and ones back to atrocities that their country is committing ?
Here in the US , we have a term for people who just “ go along to get along ; ” We call them “ Good Germans . ”
I read a story from a citizen of Germany during the rise of the Third Reich and he said that the changes to his nation were incrementally small , but before he realized it , Germans were gassing dissidents , Jews , gypsies , Christians and other “ enemies of the state . ”
We see the same thing occurring here in the US — the assaults on our freedoms had been incremental , especially during the Cold War , but since September 11th , the outright , full - frontal assault here has escalated dramatically .
The First Amendment to the US Constitution is unambiguous :
“ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . ”
However , the USA PATRIOT ACT and the Bill of Rights cannot co-exist in the legal system here .
It ’s just not possible and many laws have been passed limiting our freedom of expression .
US court rulings have consistently stated positions on what are called “ Free Speech Zones ” ( sometimes cages where US citizens are forced — mostly far away from what we are protesting ) , that the state cannot put limits on what US citizens say , but can limit the “ time and place . ”
Believing that every inch of this planet should be open to the basic human right of expression , I refuse to be herded into these cages like an animal .
Perhaps one of the noisiest cities in the world , NYC , now has laws that prohibit the use of bullhorns to express our message .
How can we be heard above the propaganda of the Ruling Class ?
While exerting my First Amendment rights here in the US , I have been chased and roughed up by cops , tear - gassed , shot at with rubber bullets and targeted by what is called a Long Range Acoustical Device .
I have been arrested over a dozen times for PEACEFULLY protesting .
Since 9 - 11 , dissent has been steadily and more violently oppressed by the state , but we must courageously protest , unless we be counted among the “ Good Germans ” that were complicit with our government by our apathy and / or silence .
Torture , wars of aggression , environmental degradation and economic oppression are the business of the US Empire — and we imperial subjects are the ones that have to strongly resist the crimes .
The world lost a leading voice for peace , justice and truth this past week when Howard Zinn passed away at aged 87 .
Howard was a wonderful historian , but also profoundly supported grass - roots movements to improve conditions in the poor and working classes .
He will be deeply missed , but we must be inspired by his work and dedicate our efforts to his memory .

EVAL - AD5933
This user guide describes the EVAL - AD5933EBZ evaluation board , and the application software developed to interface with the device .
The AD5933 is a high precision impedance converter system that combines an on - board frequency generator with a 12 - bit , 1 MSPS analog - to - digital converter ( ADC ) .
The frequency generator allows an external complex impedance to be excited with a known frequency .
The on - board ADC samples the response signal from the impedance , and an on - board DSP engine at each excitation frequency processes the DFT .
The AD5933 also contains an internal temperature sensor with 13 - bit resolution .
The part operates from a 2.7 V to 5.5 V supply .
Other on - board components include a ADR423 3.0 V reference to act as a stable supply voltage for the separate analog and digital sections of the device and a ADP3303 ultrahigh precision regulator to act as a supply to the on - board universal serial bus controller that interfaces to the AD5933 .
The user has the option to power the entire circuitry from the USB port of a computer .
The evaluation board also has a high performance trimmed 16 MHz surface - mount crystal to act as a system clock to the AD5933 , if required .
Interfacing to the AD5933 is through a USB microcontroller that generates the I2C signals necessary to communicate with the AD5933 .
Interfacing to the USB microcontroller is done through a Visual Basic® graphic user interface located on and run from the PC .
Complete specifications for the AD5933 are available in the AD5933 data sheet available from Analog Devices , Inc. , and should be consulted in conjunction with this user guide when using the evaluation board .

This Is Entertaining :
Susan Collins is on MSNBC right now trying to justify her earlier criticisms of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab 's interrogation after new information has emerged suggesting that putting him through the Court system has actually revealed quite good intelligence .
Now she 's upset that the right intelligence officials were n't consulted .
She 's truly an embarrassment .
And D - Day at FDL -- Susan Collins Struggles To Reconcile Her Fearmongering With New Information On Abdulmutallab :
Andrea Mitchell just hosted Sen. Susan Collins , who has taken the lead on Republican attacks against the Justice Department for reading Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab his Miranda rights and providing him with a lawyer .
And Mitchell was not her usual self – she was actually willing to challenge Collins ’ false claims , and provide the context that Abdulmutallab is now cooperating after members of his family were brought in to earn trust . [...]
It ’s fun to see the Republicans run aground on their talking points today .
They do n’t even have them straight .
Later in the show , Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) said that the Administration did the right thing by asking the family to help get Abdulmutallab to talk , and claimed that this proved he was right all along , and they should have done more than 50 minutes of interrogation initially .
I have no idea what that means .
Should the US have immediately teleported over Abdulmutallab ’s entire family moments after the Christmas bombing attempt ?
Maybe they ’ll realize that life is n’t 24 .
But I doubt it .
And more from The Wonk Room -- Facts Get In The Way Of Conservatives ’ Abdulmuttalab Scare Story .
Andrea Mitchell looked like she almost remembered how to be a reporter again today with this interview of Collins .
And Collins is supposed to be a moderate .
If this is what you call moderate , what 's an extremist ?

Jack White and Slash may both be indisputable modern rock guitar heroes , but a possible collaboration between the two was recently nixed by White , according to a MusicRadar interview with Slash .
( Via NME . )
" I wanted to get Jack White to sing on something , but he did n't want to sing , " said Slash .
" He said , ' I 'll play drums , I 'll play guitar , but I do n't wanna sing . '
He was one guy that I wanted to work with .
Pretty much everyone else that I went after I managed to get . "
So now we know Jack White does not just say yes to every offer he gets .
NME reports that Flea , Dave Grohl , and Alice Cooper are all set to guest on the Slash LP , which is due out next year .
In other White news , the singer / guitarist / label magnate is apparently fed up with Weezer 's stranglehold on WTF music news , so he 's releasing a 7 " of [ " A Glorious Dawn " ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc
" " A Glorious Dawn " " ) on his own Third Man Records November 9 .
" A Glorious Dawn " is a recent YouTube hit mixed by composer John Boswell featuring spaced - out eggheads Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking talking about the great beyond beneath a layer of AutoTune .
The oddball track starts with this Sagan gem : " If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch you must first invent the universe . "
So deep , so true !
Third Man is pressing an extra special 150 - run limited edition " Cosmos Colored Vinyl " version of the record , featuring the etching from the Voyager Golden Record on one side .
The Voyager Golden Record was originally sent into space in 1977 , in an attempt to communicate with extraterrestrial life .
The potentially intergalactic record featured greetings in different languages , sounds of wind and rain , and songs including " Johnny B. Goode " , and Third Man favorite " Dark Was the Night " by Blind Willie Johnson .
The contents of the Golden Record were chosen by a committee headed by Sagan .
No word if aliens have received the disc at press time .

Imagine you could look back over the history of mankind and explain all its economic nuances .
Imagine if , better still , you could accurately forecast a range of future economic factors from gross domestic product growth and inflation to interest rates .
And imagine if there was already a way to do this but it had largely been overlooked or misunderstood by the world 's economists , central bankers and politicians .

A major diplomatic and political scandal is erupting that could have significant import for French - American relations .
It involves new research into the mysterious outbreak of " mass insanity " in a village in southern France that affected some 500 people and resulted in five deaths .
According to reliable US sources , the US State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research has been given a confidential inquiry from the office of Erard Corbin de Mangoux , head of the French intelligence agency DSGE ( Directorate General for External Security ) .
According to the report the inquiry regards a recently - published account of U.S. government complicity in a mysterious 1951 incident of mass insanity in France in the village of Pont - Saint - Esprit in southern France .
The strange outbreak severely affected nearly five hundred people , causing the deaths of at least five , two by suicide .
For nearly 60 years the Pont - St. - Esprit incident has been attributed either to ergot poisoning , meaning that villagers consumed bread infected with a psychedelic mold or to organic mercury poisoning .
Scientists with the highly respected British Medical Journal were quickly drawn in September 1951 to what it dubbed the " outbreak of poisoning . "
After initial thoughts that the cause was bread infection , they concluded that mold could not explain the event or the afflictions that struck hundreds of people in the village .
Scientists dispatched to the scene from the Sandoz Chemical company in nearby Basle , Switzerland also stated that the mold was the cause , but many other experts disagreed with them .
Over time the mystery of the outbreak only deepened and no answers were found to be satisfactory .
A 2008 book about the history of bread published in France by Professor Steven Kaplan emphasizes that the " mystery remains unsolved " and at the time , still continued to perplex scientists .
New revelations A book just released in the United States , detailing exhaustive interviews with now - retired US intelligence personnel who had direct knowledge of the 1951 French events , charges that the until - now unexplained " mass insanity " in the remote village were , rather , a top - secret CIA experiment conducted under the code - name Operation Span .
Operation Span was a part of Project MK / NAOMI , itself an adjunct project to the more notorious Project MK / ULTRA , as in " ultra - top secret . "
The book , A Terrible Mistake : The Murder of Frank Olson and the CIA 's Secret Cold War Experiments , by investigative journalist H.P. Albarelli Jr. documents that the Pont - St. - Esprit outbreak in 1951 was the result of a covert LSD aerosol experiment directed by the US Army 's top- secret Special Operations Division at Fort Detrick , Maryland .
Albarelli notes that the scientists who produced the bogus cover - up explanations of contaminated bread and or mercury poisoning to deflect from the real source of the events worked for the Sandoz Pharmaceutical Company , which was then secretly supplying both the US Army and CIA with LSD for research .
A French newspaper at the time of the bizarre events wrote , " It is neither Shakespeare nor Edgar Poe .
It is , alas , the sad reality all around Pont - St. - Esprit and its environs , where terrifying scenes of hallucinations are taking place .
They are scenes straight out of the Middle Ages , scenes of horror and pathos , full of sinister shadows . "
The US Time magazine , whose publisher , Henry Luce was closely tied to CIA propaganda activities in the 1950's wrote , " Among the stricken , delirium rose : patients thrashed wildly on their beds , screaming that red flowers were blossoming from their bodies , that their heads had turned to molten lead .
Pont - Saint - Esprit 's hospital reported four attempts at suicide . "
As Albarelli notes , a Department of Justice website on the dangers of LSD states that in the early 1950s , " the Sandoz Chemical Company went as far as promoting LSD as a potential secret chemical warfare weapon to the US Government .
Their main selling point in this was that a small amount in a main water supply or sprayed in the air could disorient and turn psychotic an entire company of soldiers leaving them harmless and unable to fight . "
He claims that the CIA entertained a number of proposals from American scientists concerning placing a large amount of LSD into the reservoir of a medium - to - large city , but , according to former agency officials , " the experiment was never approved due to the unexpected number of deaths during the operation in France . "
Indeed , Albarelli has discovered once secret FBI documents that reveal that the Fort Detrick 's Special Operations Division , a year prior to the Pont St. Esprit experiment , had targeted New York City 's subway system for a similar experiment .
States an August 1950 bureau memo , " [ The ] BW [ biological warfare ] experiments to be conducted by representatives of the Department of the Army in the New York Subway System in September , 1950 , have been indefinitely postponed . "
The memo goes on to cite FBI concerns about " poisoning of food plants " and the " poisoning of the water supply " of large cities in the U.S.
In an interview with this author , Albarelli described how he developed the shocking details of the CIA secret drug programs : " My first tip - off was a 1954 CIA document that detailed an encounter between an official of the Sandoz chemical company ( the producers of LSD ) and a CIA official in which ' the secret of Pont St. Esprit ' was referenced .
The Sandoz official went on to say , ' It was not the ergot at all . ' "
Albarelli says he then obtained through the Freedom of Information Act a partially redacted 1955 CIA report entitled , A CIA Study of LSD - 25 .
" That seemingly comprehensive report contained detailed information on the manufacture , supply , and use of LSD and LSD - type products worldwide .
However , nearly its entire section on France and Pont St. Esprit were blacked out . "
Albarelli requested an un-redacted copy but CIA officials refused to provide one .
He continued , " Then I came across a letter written by a Federal Bureau of Narcotics agent who was working secretly for the CIA ; this was George Hunter White , who ran the CIA 's New York City safe house in 1951 - 1954 .
White 's letter referenced the Pont St. Esprit experiment .
At that point , 5 years into my investigation , I began interviewing former Army biochemists who became very evasive and refused to talk about their work in France .
Finally two former intelligence employees confirmed the experiment took place under the auspices of the Army 's Special Operations Division and with CIA funding . "
Lastly , Albarelli explained , " I was given an undated White House document that was part of a larger file that had been sent to members of the Rockefeller Commission formed in 1975 to investigate CIA abuses .
The document contained the names of a number of French nationals who had been secretly employed by the CIA and made direct reference to the ' Pont St. Esprit incident , ' linking the former OSS head of secret research projects and the chief of Fort Detrick 's Special Operations Division , " Said Albarelli .
" This , along with one other document , comprised the smoking gun . "
In its quest to research LSD as an offensive weapon , Albarelli claims , the Army drugged over 5,700 unwitting American servicemen between the years 1953 and 1965 , and , with the CIA , experimented widely with LSD and other drugs through secret contracts with over 325 colleges , universities and research institutions in the U.S. , Canada and Europe , involving about 2,500 additional subjects , many of them hospital patients and college students .
In 2005 , Scott Shane , a reporter with the Baltimore Sun newspaper , wrote , " The Army has no records on MKNAOMI or on the Special Operations Division . "
Asked formally for such records , the Army replied they " could find none . "
In 1973 the CIA destroyed all of its records on MKNAOMI and its work with Fort Detrick 's Special Operations Division .
When Shane asked a former top ranking Special Operations officer to speak about the division 's projects in general , Andrew M. Cowan , Jr. said , " I just do n't give interviews on that subject .
It should still be classified - if nothing else , to keep information the division developed out of the hands of some nut . "
Other CIA drug projects
In 1959 , American writer , Ken Kesey , while a student at Stanford University volunteered to take part in the CIA - financed Project MK / ULTRA at the Menlo Park Veterans Hospital .
The project studied the effects of psychoactive drugs , particularly LSD , psilocybin , mescaline , cocaine , AMT , and DMT on people .
Kesey wrote detailed accounts of his experiences with these drugs during the Project MK / ULTRA study .
Kesey 's role as a medical guinea pig reportedly inspired him to write One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest in 1962 .
From his days as a psychology graduate student , Harvard 's infamous LSD guru , Dr. Timothy Leary , whose motto to the 1968 " Flower Power " generation was " Turn On , Tune In , Drop Out ! , " was associated with the CIA 's Cord Meyer .
Leary devised a special personality test , The Leary , used by the CIA to test potential employees and worked with Frank Barron , a CIA employee and former psychology classmate of Leary's , at the Berkeley Institute for Personality Assessment and Research , and later with Barron 's Psychedelic Drug Research Center at Harvard .
These are but two of the more known and detailed instances linking the CIA with LSD projects after the alleged French experiments .
According to an official with the DGSE , who declined to be identified , " If the details of this book 's revelations prove to be true , it will be very upsetting for the people of Pont - St. - Esprit , as well as all French citizens .
That agencies of the United States government would deliberately target innocent foreign citizens for such an experiment is a violation of a number of international laws and treaties . "

Using laboratory mice that had been bred to have brain changes similar to Alzheimer 's disease , scientists were able to reduce two characteristic features of the disease by modifying the mice 's immune systems with a special peptide ( MOG45D ) related to the myelin sheath that insulates nerve cells and nerve fibers .
As a result , anti-inflammatory cells were recruited from the blood into the brain , dampening the local inflammatory response .
An article published online by the Journal of Neurochemistry describes the immune intervention , its cellular and molecular mechanisms of action , and the effects on disease pathology .
The study was conducted by scientists at the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot , Israel .
Michal Schwartz , Ph.D. , the article 's senior author , and Maya Koronyo - Hamaoui , Ph.D. , first author , are available to provide additional details .
Schwartz is visiting professor at the Center of Neuroimmunology and Neurogenesis in the Department of Neurosurgery at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center and professor of neuroimmunology at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot , Israel .
Koronyo - Hamaoui is assistant professor and principal investigator in the Neuroimmunology Laboratory in the Department of Neurosurgery at Cedars - Sinai .
The most frequent cause of senile dementia , Alzheimer 's disease is associated with the overproduction of beta- amyloid peptides - molecules that accumulate as sticky deposits in the brain .
These " extra- cellular " plaques ( accumulating on the exterior of neurons ) damage the cells and interrupt cell - to - cell signaling .
Abnormal protein tangles ( neurofibrillary tangles ) inside neurons also lead to cell dysfunction and death .
Researchers seek to defeat the disease in several ways : by preventing plaque formation ; treating existing plaque deposits ; and repairing or replacing injured neurons .
In this study , scientists modified the cellular and molecular immune environment in the brains of laboratory mice bred to model Alzheimer 's disease with an altered myelin - derived peptide .
This recruited anti-inflammatory cells into the brain , which diminished the effects of local inflammatory cells and boosted the action of an enzyme that degrades plaque and is associated with glial scar formation .

Most people assume Glenn Beck is a conservative , the reality is politically he is a lot closer to Nancy Pelosi .
In the videos below you will see him call for a massive new socialist VAT tax to " pay off the nation 's debt , " the same massive tax Nancy Pelosi called for a week earlier , you will see him say we need the banker bailout ( which 95 % + of Americans rightfully opposed at the time ) , smear constitutionalists , and attack Ron Paul supporters .
Glenn Beck cons his audience into thinking he is conservative through bashing both parties and copying the rhetoric of Ron Paul and other Patriots , but at key times he stabs them in the back when it 's a genuinely important issue , such as the banker bailout , Ron Paul 's presidential run , and now the wonderful patriot Debra Medina 's meteoric rise in the Texas Governors race .
Supporters of Glenn Beck must take heed , did you really love the policies of George Bush ?
Do you really want another Neocon ruling over you ?
Or do you want to return to the constitution and limited government ?
Watch the videos below and ask yourself :
Does this man really speak for me ?
- Chris , InformationLiberation
Glenn Beck is a Neo -Con , Not a Libertarian
Watch in Amazement as Glenn Beck Whores for Nancy Pelosi's VAT Tax
The VAT Tax is one of the most oppressive taxation schemes on the planet , keep in mind when they say they want to raise trillions with this tax that money is coming out of YOUR POCKETS .
Also keep in mind the debt is owed to foreign bankers and " paying off the debt " will do nothing to help America .
Must have been a Dare

The Coopers beer legend as we know it today , began in 1977 with Maxwell Cooper when he began to provide home brewers with packaged unfermented wort .
Before this time , Coopers beer was only available already brewed by the brewery .
Though originally just available to home brewers in Adelaide Australia , in 1984 they decided to concentrate this wort turning it to a concentrated malt that could safely travel well .
Since John C.G. Cooper had been working with malt concentrates for his brewery as early as the 1920s , the information was already available and Maxwell working with this knowledge perfected the concentrates .
The Coopers Beer Kit as we know it today was born .
Each beer is created to the same standards and high quality specifications that you would expect from a product carrying the Coopers name .
Every one of the pre-hopped kits are designed , brewed , taste - tested , tested and tested again to make sure that you the home brewer gets the results that both you and Coopers can be proud of .
Lets move the date up a bit and in 1997 a very exciting addition occurred -- a new malt concentrate was added to the product line that did n't have the unique beer flavors that Cooper 's was known for but one where the home brewer could use and create their own unique beer to their own special twist to it .
This allows home beer brewers to mix and mingle different ingredients together and allows them to experiment and push their beer brewing limits .
to the max .
Between the Light , Amber , Dark and Wheat malt concentrate in a syrup form , and a Light DME lets you , the home beer brewer to add the malt , hops , yeast and water to your specifications .
So although many people think that with Coopers Beer you can only create beers that are in the Cooper line you can also add your own special touches .
In 2000 Coopers upped the ante so to say with their BrewMaster Selection Series .
This series included Pilsner , Wheat Beer , Nut Brown Ale and India Pale Ale , which allowed Coopers to add styles that expanded their beer kit line - up beyond those of actual beers made in the brewery .
What makes these kits truly exciting and unique is that home brewers can use a beer kit that comes with yeast specifically designed for the style of beer being produced .
The Pilsner Beer Kit comes with a unique to it , lager yeast that produces a truly awesome lager beer while still being fermented at average room temperatures ( 65 -70 ' F ) .
The Wheat Beer Kit includes a wheat beer yeast that creates the lighter refreshing summer style wheat beers like those of Northern Germany .
Both the Nut Brown Ale and the IPA ( the IPA is super special and a favorite ) use a traditional British yeast that produces a clean , crisp British style ale .
Today the Coopers Brewery is still owned and operated by fourth and fifth generation descendants of Thomas .
Dr. Tim Cooper .
So as you can see , with Coopers you have a long line of brewers creating kits for home brewers that are created to Coopers exacting standards and then Coopers also give the home brewer the option to experiment and grow their own beer making skills .
With Coopers you have the choice !
Since Activision 's rise to gaming publisher domination and their commitment to rehashing money makers over and over again the gaming world has had a new face of evil to point at as the problem with everything ever : Bobby Kotick .
To be fair the man does n't really help himself when he spouts out that games should n't be developed for fun or that Activision is just in it for the money .
All this being said , you have to wonder if Kotick sits up in a big chair , petting his white cat while he kills his minions for not being able to destroy 007 or if he 's actually just a guy running a company .
Kotick spoke at the DICE gaming convention this past Thursday in a fluffy fleece and tried to settle the score by explaining his actions , talking about the decisions he 's made as Activision 's CEO and discussing the mistakes he 's made .
He opened with a non-James Bond related movie metaphor , " I do n't know how this happened , but all my life I was the rebel flying the Millennium Falcon or the X - Wing fighter and suddenly I wake up and I 'm on board the Death Star . "
Star Wars humor !
Crap , he 's got me hooked so there 's more after the jump along with video of the full speech .
Bobby Kotick , Warm and Fuzzy , Defends Notorious No-Fun Statements [ Kotaku ]
Kotick went on to explain that the evil comments he makes are usually to investors who are looking for those evil comments because they sound like things a money - making company would do .
" Sometimes that commitment to excellence , well , you can come across as being like a dick , " he said after commenting that Activision was committed to excellence .
" And when I say things like ' taking the fun out of making video games , ' it was a line that has been often - quoted lately , but it was a line I used for investors .
It was mainly because I wanted to somehow come across in a humorous way that we were responsible , in the way we made our games in that it was n't some wild west , lack of process exercise and that we really did give some thought to the capital being used to provide a return of investment to shareholders . "
Kotick also discussed Activision 's past purchases and mistakes , saying , almost apologetically , that buying Guitar Hero was a good move , but that they should have acquired Harmonix to make the games .
He also said that if he had met with Will Wright , Activsion would have picked up Maxis as well .
Perhaps most impressively he admits that being the CEO has insulated him from the passion of game developers , and it's one of the things he regrets .
Not sure if I believe him , but at least he 's trying .
Here 's the full speech for you to watch .
The Beatles , Oasis , Pink Floyd , Michael Jackson and U2 may be one step closer to paradise .
But Bob Dylan is still " Knockin ' on Heaven 's Door . "

Located in Baku , Azerbaijan , these futuristic architecture consists of three iconic urban building including Hotel Full Moon , Full Moon Bay , and Hotel Crescent .
Facing the Caspian Sea , the buildings are named Hotel Full Moon – a disc with rounded edges and a hole in one of the top corners – and Hotel Crescent , a curving arch similar to a crescent moon – and will mark out an area appropriately named Full Moon Bay .
Designed to appear drastically different from different viewing angles – from one angle Death Star and from the other Gherkin – Hotel Full Moon will be a 150 meter - high , 35 story luxury hotel with 382 large rooms .

SEVERAL young topless women barged into a Ukrainian polling station , rowdily protesting before a candidate cast his ballot .
The women , members of a small feminist group called Femen known for staging eye - catching protests , were hustled out of the Kiev polling station by security guards before Viktor Yanukovich showed up to vote .
" Enough raping our democracy ! '' shouted the protesters , who held signs with slogans such as " Help ! Rape !'' and wore nothing except for jeans and strips of green electrical tape over their nipples .
The women told reporters they were protesting " the end of democracy ' ' in Ukraine and not specifically against Yanukovich or in favour of his rival , Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko .
The two candidates fought a bitter election campaign and many Ukrainians say they are with frustrated with the choice , amid deep disillusionment with the country 's protracted political stalemate and economic crisis .
Femen , whose members are mostly university students , drew international attention last summer by holding a protest against Ukraine 's sex tourism trade where activists picketed in central Kiev wearing only their underwear .
Exit polls indicate that the pro-Moscow Mr Yanukovych has narrowly won the election .
I have obtained , and am posting here , the first English - language copy of a massive new report by a Rwandan investigative commission into the assassination of President Juvénal Habyarimana , the country ’s long - time dictator , whose plane was shot down by a pair of surface - to - air missiles and crashed in the backyard of his own palace on the night of April 6 , 1994 .
As I have reported in my 1995 New Yorker article “ After the Genocide ” and in my book “ We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families : Stories from Rwanda , ” Hutu Power extremists used Habyarimana ’s assassination as the pretext for going ahead with their plans for a genocide of the Tutsi minority — a program of massacres in which close to a million Tutsis were murdered in the next hundred days .
I have not yet had time to absorb the new report and its multiple annexes in their entirety , but I have read around in it enough to offer some initial thoughts about this extraordinary historical and political document .
And the report makes for compelling reading , despite its dry and cumbersome title : “ Report of the Investigation into the Causes and Circumstances of and Responsibility for the Attack of 06/04/1994 Against The Falcon 50 Rwandan Presidental Aeroplane Registration Number 9XR - NN . ”
As I wrote in The New Yorker :
Habyarimana ’s assassins have never been positively identified , but at the moment the bulk of circumstantial evidence collected by international investigators points to a job sponsored by members of the Hutu Power entourage .
Immediately after the Presidential plane was shot down , the Rwandan Army sealed off the area around Kigali Airport , from which the surface - to - air missiles that hit the plane had been fired , thus preventing an investigation by the U.N. and adding to speculation that top Rwandan officers had something to hide … .
[ But ] regardless of who killed Habyarimana , the fact remains that the organizers of the massacres were primed to exploit his death instantaneously .
In other words , the assassination was a coup d’etat .
At the time of his death , Habyarimana was on the brink of implementing the Arusha Accords , a power - sharing peace agreement with the Rwandan Patriotic Front , a rebel army led by Paul Kagame ( who is now Rwanda ’s president ) .
But the Hutu Power genocidaires wanted to consolidate their power through their campaign of extermination .
Habyarimana , then , appeared to have been killed as a traitor to the Hutu Power cause ; but his death was blamed on Kagame and the R.P.F. and turned into fuel for the Hutu Power cause .
The new Rwandan report — known , after its lead author , Jean Mutsinzi , as the Mutsinzi Report — lays out this story in remarkably convincing detail .
It draws on a number of previous international investigations and on a remarkable collection of more than five hundred interviews that its own investigators conducted with former officers of the Hutu Power regime and other eyewitnesses , who describe the events before , during , and after the assassination with convincing consistency .
The broad findings are not surprising .
What makes the Mutsinzi Report most remarkable is the thoroughness and seriousness of the underlying investigation , which covers not only the events leading up to the downing of the plane .
It traces the history of earlier investigations into Habyarimana ’s assassination and the genocide , and draws on these findings ( which have never before been collected and cross- referenced ) to build its own .
The Mutsinzi commission brought in independent British ballistics experts to establish the trajectory and origins of the missiles that struck the plane ; and , in passages of the report that read like pure farce , they traced the mystery of the black box from the cockpit , which kept disappearing and reappearing and ultimately vanished .
Obviously , the report serves President Kagame and his government ’s interests .
So why has it taken them so long to produce it ?
For more than a decade , critics held up the post - genocide government ’s seeming reluctance to examine Habyarimana ’s death as evidence that Kagame had something to hide .
That impression was encouraged further when the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha , Tanzania , a satellite of the court at the Hague , opened an investigation into allegations of R.P.F. culpability in the shooting down of the plane , and Kagame ’s government fought hard and successfully to shut down this investigation .
Then , in 2007 , Jean - Louis Bruguière , a French anti-terrorism judge who had made his name capturing Carlos the Jackal , indicted nine of Kagame ’s closest associates for terrorism for bringing down Habyarimana ’s plane .
Rwanda promptly broke off all diplomatic relationships with France .
Instead of merely denouncing Bruguière ’s case as a pack of lies , Kagame established the investigative committee that produced the Mutsinzi report .
( Among the report ’s surprises are damning passages drawn from investigations of the same international tribunal that the Rwandans had stonewalled . )
France ’s sponsorship of Rwanda ’s genocidal regime is a steady subtext throughout the attached documents .
Indeed , Habyarimana ’s plane was a gift of the French , it had a French flight crew who died with him , and the French military was in joint control with the Hutu Power forces of the area where the missiles were fired and the plane crashed .
An earlier Rwandan government investigative report that documented France ’s role in the genocide was harsh and damaging , and its findings contributed to the work of the Mutsinzi commission .
And yet this new report has brought about a rapprochement between Kigali and Paris .
Over the past two years , Bruguière ’s case fell apart as his “ eyewitnesses ” recanted , until even the French press treated it as a joke .
Throughout that time Rwanda maintained a hostile public tone toward France ; last fall Rwanda even joined the British Commonwealth .
In private , however , Kagame maintained a constant dialogue with France , and established communications with President Nikolas Sarkozy — and two months ago , on the day after Rwanda ’s admission to the Commonwealth , France and Rwanda reestablished normal diplomatic relations .
Before that happened , of course , the Rwandans had shared the about - to - be- released Mutsinzi report with the French .
The normalization of relations amounts to France ’s acceptance of the report ’s conclusions — and in the past few days the French press has been covering the substance of the report in uncharacteristic tones of admiration and respect .
The struggle of President Kagame ’s regime to establish security , order , and a modicum of justice in Rwanda and to create conditions for economic and political development has always been in large part a struggle for legitimacy in the eyes of an international community that failed — or worse , betrayed — Rwanda during the genocide .
In this context , the report on Habyarimana ’s plane is the latest in a yearlong string of diplomatic and political moves that show the new Rwandan government achieving a level of sophistication , skill , and effectiveness in commanding international respect that has rarely , if ever , been seen before in Africa .
A year ago , Rwanda was being blamed for all the woes of the war next door in the Democratic Republic of Congo — and now those woes have come to be seen overwhelmingly as the result of the continued presence of fugitive Hutu genocidaires in Congo .
Leaders of these Hutu Power armies in exile , who had operated with impunity from European capitals , are being rounded up .
And this week , on the day that the report first leaked in the French press , France ’s foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , was in Kigali to announce the establishment of a special court in France to prosecute refugees suspected of genocide .
Today ’s issue of Rwanda ’s official newspaper , New Times , announces that Sarkozy will visit next month .
More than 140,000 UK companies were dragged into financial difficulties in the last quarter , according to research that also warned firms are collapsing faster than in previous recessions .
Insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor reported that the number of companies experiencing significant or critical financial problems rose 6 % in the last three months of 2009 , compared with the previous quarter .
It also said that firms are finding it harder to struggle along once they hit problems .
" A new trend is emerging , which indicates that a higher number of business failures are occurring at an earlier stage of deterioration than in previous recessions , " it said .
Begbies Traynor believes the government 's attempts to support British business were having some effect , but predicted a spike in failures later this year when this help is terminated .
" Experience of the last four recessions tells us that unemployment levels and corporate and personal insolvencies have lagged behind technical recession by one to two years .
With tax and interest rates certain to rise , as well as increasing pressure on consumer spending , there is every reason to suggest that the insolvency peaks of this recession remain some way off , " warned Ric Traynor , executive chairman .
" While business finance is expected to become more readily available during the first half of 2010 , we anticipate a rise in the levels of financial distress during the second half of 2010 , as temporary financial support measures are unwound . "
On an optimistic note , the number of companies facing serious or critical problems was 14 % lower than a year ago .
Begbies Traynor said this was partly because creditors are now taking a more lenient approach than they did in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers , when there was a " near panic " dash to call in debts .
Another factor helping the sector is the time - to - pay scheme offered by HM Revenue & Customs , which lets cash - strapped firms defer tax payments .
Almost 250,000 companies have taken up this offer , deferring over £ 4.3 bn of tax payments , according to the latest official data .
Begbies Traynor fears some businesses are storing up problems , and will collapse when the need to repay debt catches up with them later in the year .
" HMRC remains one of the principal creditors in many insolvencies and we fear that when the current time - to - pay scheme , which provided a lifeline to many businesses , is finished there will be a significant rise in company failures – most probably from the third quarter of 2010 onwards , " it predicted .
Scottish businesses are suffering particularly badly from the downturn , with 41 % more companies facing critical problems than a year ago .
To be classed as a company with critical problems , a firm would need to be facing county court judgments of at least £ 5,000 , or a petition to wind the company up .
Significant problems would include either a court action , or a set of accounts classed as ' average ' , ' poor ' , ' very poor ' , ' insolvent ' or ' out of date ' .
Begbies Traynor classed 4,040 companies in the critical camp , and 137,487 facing significant problems .
The services sector saw a 22 % rise in companies facing significant problems , compared with the previous quarter .
Construction firms performed better , with a 2 % decline .
Research released yesterday warned that Britain faces a decade of " painful readjustment " from the recession , and will see weak economic growth once the government 's efforts to stimulate the economy end .
Ernst & Young 's Item Club predicted the UK economy would grow by just 1 % this year , before recovering to 2.5 % in 2011 .
The American middle class is dying off in huge numbers .
It has been going on for more than a decade , but we are facing a catastrophe of biblical proportions .
I have a plan to stop it and to save those left .
Hyperbole ?
You decide .
When someone speaks for the middle class , most often they continue to use a post - World War II snapshot .
Average salary .
Average house .
Average everything .
Most Americans believe they are a member .
Because of the enormous changes in concentration of wealth , they are wrong .
More Americans than they realize are actually poor by prime time standards .
More are joining them every day .
But this piece is not about the poor .
Lcurve.com took the most recent census figures ( it has gotten worse since then ) and plotted it on a football field ( sports metaphors are the best way to communicate complicated issues in terms that sound good , but seldom do more than confuse things further ) .
If median income were used , the stack of money earned at the fifty yard line would equal a stack of $ 100 bills , 1.6 inches high ( median household income ranging from $ 61,000 in Maryland to $ 31,000 in West Virginia – 1.6 inches is about the size of your big toe , OK , a boy ’s big toe ) .
At the five yard line , the stack of $ 100 bills is 4 ″ high .
At the one foot line , the stack of $ 100 bills is 40 inches tall , or 3 - feet , 4 inches .
At the one inch line , the stack is over 30 miles high .
The middle class now lives somewhere between the five and the ten yard line .
At one time , and in my lifetime , they owned half the field .
There are many advocates for the poor – I am among them , but they can do without me for the day .
Admittedly , the working poor are suffering something terrible and are too busy working three jobs to advocate for themselves and only have Joe Biden .
The rich ?
They hire hire lobbyists .
Today , I ’m focusing on the middle class .
The faux alter ego of the rich … and the poor .
The people who are portrayed on television commercials during prime time .
Beautiful , healthy , making - it- in - America kind of people who bought in to the American work ethic , performed to it , and subsequently have more to lose and yet further to fall .
They are the poster children for the American dream .
These are the people who look as if they made it – good education , ambition , hard work and a couple of good decisions landed them with a good job and on a career path .
They had the audacity of hope ten years ago .
They bought into the ownership society .
They believed .
They purchased more home than they needed because they knew it would grow in value along with their wages .
They had good credit and used it .
They consumed and charged some of it on their single - digit - rate credit cards .
They pay huge amounts of income , property and sales taxes .
Buy or lease the new cars .
Send their kids to private schools in new uniforms .
And go out to dinner .
Where are they today ?
They are holding on by their nails ( no longer professionally manicured ) .
They are being squeezed to death .
Those who did n’t get laid off are working longer hours , many for less pay .
The raises and the bonuses , known as the big hits , did n’t happen as hoped and planned , unless they are on Wall Street .
The AMT ( Alternative Minimum Tax ) has hit them hard .
Very hard , an annual battering .
Their property taxes skyrocketed because they bought their houses before the prices fell , but after the reassessments .
Some have extended families who are out of work or under -employed .
They have had to help out .
Their health insurance has gone up , along with their co-pays and their need for care .
Their equity lines have been cut , and not - so - coincidentally , so too have their credit card limits .
For the first time in modern history , consumers are paying against their credit card debt before paying their mortgage payments – a feeble attempt at false liquidity at the risk of the most basic of human needs – housing .
One by one , they were either a day late paying their credit card bill , or a dollar short on guessing their new lower credit limits .
The late charge , or over - limit fee hit their Equifax report and their 3 % Chase card with the $ 30,000 balance , and $ 35,000 credit limit overnight turned into a 33 % card with a $ 30,000 limit .
Their monthly payments went up by a thousand dollars and with it all their “ disposable income . ”
Suddenly , all the other cards matched the 33 % rate .
They cut back immediately , but it was n’t enough .
They cashed out their retirement .
Got rid of their extra car .
Postponed their health needs .
Then the collectors started calling .
They never knew they were living on the edge .
The precipice was looming .
I ’m not making this up .
Our middle class – those making $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 a year are suffocating – their financial livelihood is being squeezed out of them , and with it their contribution to consumerism .
Almost all of the air is going to the bank ( a euphemism for “ the company store ” ) .
They have exhausted their savings , have no equity , no credit , less than zero leftover money , and are losing it .
Sure , many have been able to hold on to that one nice car and that wonderful home with the for - sale sign in the front yard .
But their “ comfortable ” life is only in the living room .
Disposable income provides economic freedom – it is gone .
I realize that creating sympathy for those on the five yard line is almost impossible .
These are the people that we all need to take us out of the recession .
They are the customers of those who are still working .
They are , or were , the employers of the working poor .
These are the people who pay the taxes that keep our government working .
Ironically , they are the only class who are still vaguely in touch with those on the one foot line , who otherwise , would ( pick one or more : have no friends at all ; no one to betray , or no one to aspire to them ) .
So , what ’s my plan ?
My proposal ?
A middle class bail out that wo n’t cost the taxpayer a dime .
Premise : those who are already 30 to 90 days behind on their credit cards and owing the exorbitant interest rates are unlikely to make it .
Fortunately for the banks , all of these accounts are insured … by AIG .
Yes , the company that is 80 + % owned by the US government .
The insurance that banks have on these accounts returns 70 - 80 % of the balance to them , which is why they add on all the late payments and hidden charges in order to jack up the balance prior to handing the debt to AIG .
The banks get it all back and the government ends up picking up the tab .
I propose that we offer a deal to save those middle class patrons who can still be saved .
A deal that wo n’t cost the taxpayers a penny .
In return for cutting up their credit cards , getting no new ones , paying on time and not declaring bankruptcy , we ( using the rates being charged to banks ) would let them pay off their debt at near zero interest rate ( the near zero will pay for the servicing ) .
If they renege , the deal goes back to the bank to collect and they do n’t get another chance .
For someone who has $ 100,000 in credit card debt , this will save them $ 25 - $ 30,000 a year – about the same deal they had before this “ greatest economic crisis since the great depression ” began .
Enough money to pay off their debt in a few years instead of never .
To get their mortgage caught up and keep them in their home .
Enough for them to get back soon to consuming , paying taxes and saving us all .
What about all that interest that ’s being written off , is that a cost to someone ?
Only on paper .
The government now lends money to banks for virtually nothing ( it is why the banks have so much to gamble on Wall Street ) .
The banks are charging exorbitant rates for credit cards , but their earnings are only on paper , as much of it will never be collected .
They justify these rates and charges because of the risk of default , but this is n’t new money or new risk .
The only thing that changed was the economy .
Why should we bail out the banks , give them free money for their bad decisions and not bail out the people , who – should they survive – pay for the bank bailout ?
The banks do not deserve the spread and bankruptcy is bad for everyone ( except the banks ) .
This solution is not another big government bailout ( even the servicing can be privatized ) .
It is simply extending , for a limited time , the rate we charge banks to a group who had the audacity of belief in the American dream and wants to pay their debt .
They bear the costs , are responsible for their decisions , and will give us all a chance to get out of this mess .
One more note – this is fairly progressive .
Credit card debt is relative .
Credit card jubilee ( at least in concept ) could be just the thing to get us out of this mess .

Mr Kerr ( left ) has dedicated much of his life to the martial art A Scottish pensioner has become one of only seven living people to hold judo 's highest rank .
Martial arts expert George Kerr , 72 , was named a " 10th Dan " black belt at a ceremony held by the International Judo Federation in Paris .
He is one of only five non-Japanese recipients of the award , which honours his contribution to the sport .
Mr Kerr , who runs a judo club for 200 youngsters in Edinburgh , said he was " humbled " by the award .
Fewer than 20 people have ever received the honour , which recognises Mr Kerr 's contribution to the sport as a competitor , coach , referee and administrator .
I think judo can contribute to fitness and health and it would be a great thing for kids to take up
George Kerr
He received it in front of 14,000 people at the Grand Slam event in Paris on Saturday .
Speaking from the French capital , Mr Kerr told BBC Scotland : " I feel humbled and proud to be the first Scotsman to receive this award .
" I was slightly embarrassed because most of the people that get this award are in their 80s while I am only 72 - and just a young 72 at that .
" I felt there were a lot of people who deserved it more than I do , but I suppose when you get this type of award it is like getting made a lordship of your sport .
It kind of takes the breath away from you . "
Mr Kerr , who was an inaugural member of the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame in 2002 and has written several books on judo and its techniques , insisted he had no plans to slow down as he grew older .
He added : " Do n't be silly .
If you give up , if you retire , you die .
I will never retire .
I just do n't work as hard as I used to work but retiring is not on my horizon .
" I think the sport gives you many things in your life .
It teaches you discipline and honesty , many things that can contribute to young kids ' lives .
" It keeps them off the computer , and the biggest killer in our country at the moment is not cancer it is obesity and obesity in children unfortunately , so I think judo can contribute to fitness and health and it would be a great thing for kids to take up . "
Gold medals
Mr Kerr was also honoured by the Japanese government last month for his contribution to promoting understanding and friendship between Japan and the UK .
He won the gold medal in the 1957 European Championships in Rotterdam and a string of other awards , and is currently president of the British Judo Association .
Mr Kerr , from Edinburgh , began practising judo when he was eight and as a young man won a scholarship to study the sport in Japan for four years .
He later coached legendary Austrian judo champion Peter Seisenbacher , who won gold medals at the Olympic Games in 1984 and 1988 .
Charles Palmer , from London , was made Britain 's first 10th Dan by the International Judo Association Federation in 1997 .
Mr Palmer died four years later at the age of 71 .

It ’s just been brought to my attention that , while they were Harvard undergraduates , Jeff Zucker ’ 86 called the cops on Conan O’Brien ’ 85 .
( I never saw previous reports about this . )
According to articles in both the Harvard Crimson and Yale Daily News , Zucker , then president of the university ’s Harvard Crimson daily newspaper , dispatched the police to the Harvard Lampoon office after O’Brien , who was president of the campus humor magazine , organized a prank on his college rival — stealing an entire print run of the Crimson before it could be distributed .
“ He only forgave me when I gave him The Tonight Show , ” Zucker told a Yale gathering back in 2005 .
The Harvard Crimson described the incident this way in a 2004 article about Conan landing The Tonight Show courtesy of Zucker : “ O’ Brien cut his teeth in comedy as president of The Harvard Lampoon , a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so - called humor magazine .
In fact , O’Brien first met Zucker , his current boss , one day when O’Brien and the Lampoon editors stole all the copies of that morning ’s Crimson .
Zucker , then Crimson President , called the police and met O’Brien face to face while he was being arrested . ”
In 2001 , Conan told The New Yorker this about the incident : “ College pranks are supposed to be clever , but our rivalry with the Crimson had degenerated into us stealing something , Jeff calling the police , and the police making us haul it back , ” said O’Brien .
( Other Lampoon pranks on Zucker included “ a fake phone - sex ad with Zucker ’s dorm - room phone number .
Zucker did not find any of this particularly hilarious . ” )
So what ’s to glean from this Harvard history lesson ?
Yes , Jeff Zucker was a thin - skinned prick who did n’t understand comedy or know how to handle creatives even back then .
Power : Why the Right Fails at Individualism
Over their dead hands .
Do n’t tread on them .
They see themselves as freedom - fighters ; advocates for the individual against the power of a distant , corrupt government .
The impulse which prompts in them skepticism over the value of giving government power over their daily lives is a healthy one .
Unfortunately , for them it carries with it a giant , gaping blind spot : corporations .
A wholly - formed individualist would shudder at the idea of ceding our institutions to whoever can wrangle up enough wealth and power to dominate them .
He would scoff at the idea that we should gut democratic provisions that prevent such concentrations of private power from ruling over us from afar , passing down feudal edicts from behind gated privilege .
He would favor legal measures that make individuals the decision - makers in their lives rather than governments OR corporations and robber - barons .
The ranks of the right do not contain many of these wholly - formed individualists .
But it is bursting with half - baked ones .
Ones who viciously hate the idea of another man having power over them , but only so long as that man is foreign or a government official .
If he comes in a business suit with shiny shoes , the previously rugged individualist pretends not to notice him and signs away control of his life without protest .
This is Atlas ’ true Shrug – the shrug of indifference as control over the individual is given away for free to Madison Ave , Wall St. , K Street , Wal - Mart , Monsanto , Tyson , Dow and Exxon - Mobil .
The right constantly reminds us that our government is corrupt because politicians take money from private power in exchange for favors , and while they bravely stand against the government for taking the cash , they never cease to defend the rights of the private powers that pay the bribes .
They do not recognize their true enemy : concentrated power .
Yes , we really should prevent our government from becoming too powerful .
But we should do the same for ALL institutions .
Our local police should n’t have too much power over us .
Our military should n’t have too much power over us .
Goldman
Sachs should n’t have too much power over us .
Microsoft and Google should n’t have too much power over us .
Someone who does n’t recognize their own enemy is extremely valuable to that enemy .
So these half - baked individualists have been employed to huge success by the most powerful organizations in the world : corporations .
Today they have “ tea - parties ” in which they participate in an absurd game of charades in which it ’s an affront to their freedom for government to implement a safety net , but not for Monsanto to become lord and master over their farmland .
They draw a meaningless line between public and private power , benefiting no one but the wealthy elite .
It seems to me that someone truly interested in maximizing the power of individuals over their own lives would generally accept the idea of using the democratic process to limit others ’ power over them .
But this is not the case with Republicans and Libertarians today , because they see the democratic process ITSELF as too powerful , while transnational corporations escape their eye .
They insist that they love freedom .
But to them , freedom is a symbol , not anything real .
It ’s a pin that they wear , a sticker that goes on the back of the Tahoe , but little more .
It ’s a song to sing , a flag to wave , a self - image .
An uninsured woman with breast cancer is “ free ” only so long as she is not saved by tax - funded medical care .
A mother whose child died from Ecoli contamination is “ free ” only so long as the company who killed her child is not hindered by safety regulations .
Our children are only “ free ” so long as companies are allowed to advertise junk to them .
As such , the freedom they advocate is that enjoyed by rats in a dark sewer .

The Israel Lobby
Inside Britain's Israel Lobby
Haaretz
cnxps.cmd.push(function ( ) { cnxps ( { playerId : '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b ' }) .render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6 ' ) ; } ) ;
The writer is a PhD researcher at the Hebrew University .
Ever since the publication of John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt ' sthere has been much talk of the " lobby . "
In England mainstream and respectable Channel 4 aired an entire program entitledwhich claimed the " lobby " " owns " the Conservative Party .
Amidst all the talk of an Israel lobby in the West , people have ignored the growth of a lobby located in the Holy Land itself , the European lobby in Israel .
The European Parliament adopted the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights ( EIDHR ) in 1994 .
This was part of the European Union 's broader belief that " democracy and human rights are universal values that should be vigorously promoted around the world . "
The initiative was supposed to promote democratization through the promotion of " fair and free " elections and mainstreaming " democratic values " through " accountability , transparency and equality .
"
In 2007 , a subtle change in the name of the EIDHR was made .
The word " initiative " was changed to " instrument . "
This seemingly banal change may be a result of semantic arguments among EU staffers but it puts in words the increasingly meddlesome way the EU has chosen to work within Israel .
The EU may have realized during the second intifada that its concerns were not being listened to .
Perhaps they heeded the increasingly alarmist statements of Israelis themselves , such as formereditor David Landau who in 2007 told US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice that the US needed to " rape " Israel into a settlement with the Palestinians .
Regardless of the exact cause , in 2002 the European Union began lavishly funding non-governmental organizations in Israel .
It claimed that it was doing this because of " the vital contribution made by NGOs to the promotion and protection of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and the rule of law .
" Between 2002 and 2008 , a total of $ 14 million was granted to various Israeli NGOs through the EIDHR .
My investigation of the NGOs that received funding revealed that the lion 's share of the money benefited two groups : Palestinians and Israeli Arabs .
$ 5.5 million was directed specifically to causes for Palestinians such as the Association for Civil Rights in Israel 's project " Building a Better Future : Empowering the Palestinian Residents of East Jerusalem to access their planning and house [ sic ] rights " which received $ 135,000 .
A further $ 7 m . went specifically to programs that benefit only Israeli Arabs such as the al - Awna fund 's " Master Plan for the Unrecognized Beduin Villages : Securing minority rights for housing and social services " which received $ 263,000 .
Even when the EIDHR funded programs for women it did so only for programs for Beduin or Israeli Arab women , except for a token $ 100,000 it gave to an organization called Isha le Isha ( Woman to Woman ) which helps fight women trafficking .
There was not one cent directed specifically towards any of the numerous and diverse Jewish communities in Israel : Ethiopians , Russians , Yemenites , Persians or Jews from the Caucasus .
The only mention of Jewish citizens as potential recipients was in a grant to the Mossawa Center , the advocacy center for Arab citizens in Israel .
It received $ 402,000 for a project that " aims to combat racism and transform inter-communal relations between target groups who include the Jewish majority , Arab minority and ethnic groups including the Russian , Ethiopian , Mizrahi and Reform Jewish communities .
" Around $ 73,000 was directed towards former IDF soldiers .
It was n't to help them with trauma or reward them for a " shared citizenship . "
It was to get them to " break the silence " about what they witnessed while in the army , to provide testimony that might lead to a process whereby European courts might put the soldiers or their officers on trial for war crimes .
Of course that is not what Breaking the Silence stated for the public .
They described their project as " personal encounters with former Israeli combat soldiers .
" THE EIDHR's " instrument " to affect Israeli policy is merely the tip of the iceberg .
In its November 2009 report " Trojan Horse : The impact of European government funding for Israeli NGOs " NGO Monitor illustrated that individual European embassies in Israel and other EU projects give lavishly to Israeli NGOs , sometimes even making up the majority of their budgets .
In fact " foreign - funded local NGOs are responsible for a significant portion of the petitions brought before the Israeli High Court of Justice , " says the report .
The EU , realizing it could not get Israel to change its laws through diplomatic means , has resorted to creating an internal lobby within Israel to get Israel to bend to the will of Europe .
Israel 's human rights organizations would counter that it is not important where their money comes from , their cause is just .
It is also true that some Israeli human rights organizations view everything through the lens of the conflict , meaning they apply only for projects involving Palestinians or " Palestinian citizens of Israel " and do n't have an interest in the rights of the Jewish population of the country .
Shatil , which claims to help Ethiopian Jews , applied for $ 1 m. for Beduin and $ 1 m .
" to educate and raise awareness among the Arab residents of Israel 's five Jewish / Arab mixed cities " and nothing for the Ethiopians .
The question is whether the EU funding of these organizations constitutes the creation of a shadow lobby .
The EIDHR does n't directly sue Israel on behalf of the freedom of movement of Palestinians .
Instead it funds local NGOs that do .
Furthermore the EIDHR sends $ 8.4 m .
in funding directly to NGOs in the Palestinian territories on top of the money it gives to Israeli NGOs whose projects only benefit Palestinians .
In every other country in the world , the EIDHR directs its funding towards large - scale projects supporting " democracy " and " civil society . "
In Egypt it gave $ 10 m . ( 2003 - 2008 ) , none of which went specifically towards projects for the minority Coptic Christians .
It is time for those , especially in Europe , who speak about a " Jewish / Israel " lobby to recognize that for eight years Europe hasdirected a concerted effort towards establishing a European lobby inIsrael that discriminates against its Jewish population and supportssome radical NGOs .

One year ago , when ex-USC quarterback and underclassman Mark Sanchez declared for the NFL draft , coach Pete Carroll took objection publicly .
Let ’s just say it was n’t exactly a vote of confidence .
Here ’s the video of his comments back then .
One year later , with Carroll headed to the Seahawks and the Sanchize winning playoff games for the Jets , Sanchez got a little post - game interview payback by jokingly mocking his old coach .
I know Sanchez was joking , but you ca n’t help but think that he had something to prove to his ex-coach this season .
No Wives For 24 Million Chinese Men
As many as 24 million eligible bachelors in China may never be able to marry because of a lack of women in the country .
New stats from the State - backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences show there has been no let up in China ’s 20 - year - old gender imbalance .
Authorities say the normal male - female ratio is between 103- 107 males for every 100 females .
But the latest figures show that in 2005 , there were 119 boys for every 100 girls in China .
The study said that in some areas the ratio was as high as 130 - 100 .
The study pointed to sex -specific abortions as a major factor in the skewed population of 1.3 billion , where a cultural preference for male children persists .
While noting that there were complex factors involved , the study said that “ sex - specific abortions remained extremely commonplace , especially in rural areas ” .
The study said a key factor leading to the imbalance was the nation ’s family - planning policy , which restricts the number of children citizens may have .
They also cited an insufficient social security system which led parents to prefer male offspring because of their greater earning potential .
Researchers said the figures suggested there would be problems for men with lower incomes in finding spouses , as well as a burgeoning age gap between partners .
Wang Yuesheng , one of the researchers involved , said men in poorer parts of the country would either be forced to remain single forever or to accept marriage late in life .
“ The chance of getting married will be rare if a man is more than 40 years old in the countryside .
They will be more dependent on social security as they age and have fewer household resources to rely on , ” Wang said .
Abductions and trafficking of women are said to be “ rampant ” in areas with excess numbers of men , while illegal marriages and forced prostitution were also major problems in those areas .
The study urged the Chinese government to relax the so - called “ one- child ” policy and study the possibility of encouraging “ cross- country marriages ” .
China first implemented its population control policy in 1979 , generally limiting families to one child , with some exceptions for rural farmers , ethnic minorities and other groups .
It has said the policy has averted 400 million births .
Researchers said the gender imbalance problem first cropped up in the late 1980s when the use of ultrasound technology became more prevalent , allowing women to easily determine the sex of their foetuses .

The This Day Tonight program on the 25th January , had a piece on this subject which I feel inclined to comment upon as follows .
It would appear that the population problem is really matter of having an available area for expansion whilst keeping the needed space to support that population within the confines of a finite fixed area without destroying the environment for all other life forms .
We have evolved to a degree where we are now the first life form that has the option of controlling our reproduction or breeding our selves to extinction .
Mr Rudd has formed the opinion that we will be better off with a bigger population .
This is based on the impossible belief that we can have everlasting growth ; which would need everlasting growth of population .
Since there is only a finite space available , adoption of a policy of everlasting growth will inevitably lead to our extinction as a species !
It is not now necessary for human beings to breed flat out to obtain the survival of the species so we should now be working out what we do want from life and how we can balance our breeding to obtain this state , in balance with the rest of the environment , such that we can have a long term future for ourselves and the rest of the life forms !
When I say long term I mean thousands of years not fifty years , one gets the impression that our world leaders feel that they only have responsibility for looking after the events happening within their life span whereas I would hope that , such a magnificent life form as we have evolved into would be able , by application of this powerful brain , ensure that life goes on as long as our planet will support it .
Frankly , I do n’t think that the world is yet ready to address the problem of over population , they have too many religious and personal freedoms hang - ups and not enough responsibility commitments .
It will need a realization that there is a fast approaching apocalypse to jolt the masses into a state of action and this may well be too late !
Peter Kropotkin ( 1842-1921 ) was perhaps the best known exponent of anarchist communism .
In Modern Science and Anarchism , he sets forth an anarchist conception of society as a dynamic equilibrium , constantly changing , except when forced into a particular path or pattern by authoritarian institutions , which such patterns will eventually be superseded as society bursts asunder the artificial constraints of coercive institutions .
The following passages are taken from the revised 1912 edition of Modern Science and Anarchism .
An Anarchist Conception of Society
[ A ] variety of considerations , historical , ethnological , and economical , have brought the Anarchists to conceive a society very different from what is considered as its ideal by the authoritarian political parties .
The Anarchists conceive a society in which all the mutual relations of its members are regulated , not by laws , not by authorities , whether self - imposed or elected , but by mutual agreements between the members of that society and by a sum of social customs and habits — not petrified by law , routine , or superstition , but continually developing and continually readjusted , in accordance with the ever - growing requirements of a free life , stimulated by the progress of science , invention , and the steady growth of higher ideals .
No ruling authorities , then .
No government of man by man ; no crystallization and immobility , but a continual evolution — such as we see in Nature .
Free play for the individual , for the full development of his individual gifts — for his individualization .
In other words , no actions are imposed upon the individual by a fear of punishment ; none is required from him by society , but those which receive his free acceptance .
In a society of equals this would be quite sufficient for preventing those unsociable actions that might be harmful to other individuals and to society itself , and for favouring the steady moral growth of that society …
Of course , up till now no society has existed which would have realized these principles in full , although the striving towards a partial realization of such principles has always been at work in mankind .
We may say , therefore , that Anarchism is a certain ideal of society , and that this ideal is different from the ideal of society which has hitherto been advocated by most philosophers , scientists , and leaders of political parties , who pretended to rule mankind and to govern men .
But it would not be fair to describe such a conception as a Utopia , because the word “ Utopia ” in our current language conveys the idea of something that can not be realized .
Taken in its usual current sense , therefore , the word “ Utopia ” ought to be limited to those conceptions only which are based on merely theoretical reasonings as to what is desirable from the writer ’s point of view , but not on what is already developing in human agglomerations .
Such were , for instance , the Utopias of the Catholic Empire of the Popes , the Napoleonic Empire , the Messianism of Mickiewicz , and so on .
But it cannot be applied to a conception of society which is based , as Anarchism is , on an analysis of tendencies of an evolution that is already going on in society , and on inductions therefrom as to the future — those tendencies which have been … for thousands of years the mainspring for the growth of sociable habits and customs , known in science under the name of Customary Law , and which affirm themselves more and more definitely in modern society .
With regard to what is very often said as to the necessary slowness of every new step that is made by evolution , let us remember that not further than at the end of the eighteenth century — at the very time when the United States had started in life — a society of a somewhat larger size without a monarch was considered a foolish Utopia .
But the North and the South American Republics , the Swiss Republic and France have proved since , as we know , that the “ Utopians ” were not the Republicans but the admirers of monarchy .
It was the latter , who , guided by their desires only , did not take into account the tendencies of societies developing far from the yoke of monarchist traditions ; the latter , who , and not the Republicans , attributed too much importance and stability to the monarchist institutions — without noticing that they were not an outcome of human nature , but an outcome of temporary historical conditions .
When we look into the origin of the Anarchist conception of society , we see that it has had a double origin : the criticism , on the one side , of the hierarchical organizations and the authoritarian conceptions of society ; and on the other side , the analysis of the tendencies that are seen in the progressive movements of mankind , both in the past , and still more so at the present time .
From the remotest , Stone - Age antiquity men must have realized the evils that resulted from letting some of them acquire personal authority — even if they were the most intelligent , the bravest , or the wisest .
Consequently , they developed , in the primitive clan , the village community , the medieval guild ( neighbours ’ guilds , arts and crafts ’ guilds , traders ’ , hunters ’ , and so on ) , and finally in the free medieval city such institutions as enabled them to resist the encroachments upon their life and fortunes both of those strangers who conquered them , and those clansmen of their own who endeavoured to establish their personal authority .
The same popular tendency was self - evident in the religious movements of the masses in Europe during the earlier portions of the Reform movement and its Hussite and Anabaptist forerunners .
At a much later period , namely , in 1793 , the same current of thought and of action found its expression in the strikingly independent , freely federated activity of the “ Sections ” of Paris and all great cities and many small “ Communes ” during the French Revolution .
And later still , the Labour combinations which developed in England and France , notwithstanding Draconian laws , as soon as the factory system began to grow up , were an outcome of the same popular resistance to the growing power of the few — the capitalists in this case .
These were the main popular Anarchist currents which we know of in history , and it is self - evident that these movements could not but find their expression in literature .
So they did , beginning with Lao- tse in China , and some of the earliest Greek philosophers ( Aristippus and the Cynics ; Zeno and some of the Stoics ) .
However , being born in the masses , and not in any centres of learning , these popular movements , both when they were revolutionary and when they were deeply constructive , found little sympathy among the learned men — far less than the authoritarian hierarchical tendencies …
If the revolt against the State , so long as it was advocated , before 1848 and later on till the Paris Commune , by middle - class writers , took the character of a revolt of the individual against society and its hypocrisy — now , when a similar revolt began to take place among the working men , it took a deeper character .
It became a research of those forms of society which might get rid of the oppression and exploitation of men by other men which is now going on with the aid of the State .
In the International Working Men ’s Association its founders saw the embryo of that society which would be called into existence by a social revolution — a society where the functions now belonging to Government would be substituted by free agreements growing out of the direct relations between free groups of producers and consumers .
In these surroundings the ideal of the Anarchist ceased to be individual : it became social .
In proportion as the workers of Europe and America began to know each other directly , without the intermediary of Governments , they grew more and more convinced of their own forces and of their capacity for rebuilding society on new bases .
They saw that if the people resumed possession of the land and of all that is required for producing all sorts of necessaries of life , and if the associations of men and women who would work on the land , in the factories , in the mines , and so on , became themselves the managers of production , they would be able , in such conditions , to produce with the greatest ease all that is necessary for the life of society , so as to guarantee well - being for all , and also some leisure for all .
The recent progress in science and technics rendered this point more and more evident .
Besides , in a vast international organization of producers and consumers , the exchange of produce could be organized with the same ease — once it would not be done for the enrichment of the few .
At the same time , the ever - growing thinking portion of the workers saw that the State , with its traditions , its hierarchy , and its narrow nationalism , would always stand in the way of the development of such an organization ; and the experiments made in different countries with the view of partially alleviating the social evils within the present middle - class State proved more and more the fallacy of such tactics .
The wider the sphere of those experiments , the more evident it was that the machinery of the State could not be utilized as an instrument of emancipation .
The State is an institution which was developed for the very purpose of establishing monopolies in favour of the slave and serf owners , the landed proprietors , canonic and laic , the merchant guilds and the moneylenders , the kings , the military commanders , the “ noble - men , ” and finally , in the nineteenth century , the industrial capitalists , whom the State supplied with “ hands ” driven away from the land .
Consequently the State would be , to say the least , a useless institution , once these monopolies ceased to exist .
Life would be simplified , once the mechanism created for the exploitation of the poor by the rich would have been done away with .
The idea of independent Communes for the territorial organization , and of federations of Trade Unions for the organization of men in accordance with their different functions , gave a concrete conception of society regenerated by a social revolution .
There remained only to add to these two modes of organization a third , which we saw rapidly developing during the last fifty years , since a little liberty was conquered in this direction : the thousands upon thousands of free combines and societies growing up everywhere for the satisfaction of all possible and imaginable needs , economic , sanitary , and educational ; for mutual protection , for the propaganda of ideas , for art , for amusement , and so on .
All of them covering each other , and all of them always ready to meet the new needs by new organizations and adjustments .
More than that .
It begins to be understood now that if human societies go on developing on these lines , coercion and punishment must necessarily fall into decay .
The greatest obstacle to the maintenance of a certain moral level in our present societies lies in the absence of social equality .
Without real equality , the sense of justice can never be universally developed , because Justice implies the recognition of Equality ; while in a society in which the principles of justice would not be contradicted at every step by the existing inequalities of rights and possibilities of development , they would be bound to spread and to enter into the habits of the people .
In such a case the individual would be free , in the sense that his freedom would not be limited any more by fear : by the fear of a social or a mystical punishment , or by obedience , either to other men reputed to be his superiors , or to mystical and metaphysical entities — which leads in both cases to intellectual servility ( one of the greatest curses of mankind ) and to the lowering of the moral level of men .
In free surroundings based upon Equality , man might with full confidence let himself be guided by his own reason ( which , of course , by necessity , would bear the stamp of his social surroundings ) .
And he might also attain the full development of his individuality ; while the “ individualism ” considered now by middle - class intellectuals as the means for the development of the better - gifted individuals , is , as every one may himself see , the chief obstacle to this development .
Not only because , with a low productivity , which is kept at a low level by Capitalism and the State , the immense majority of gifted men have neither the leisure nor the chance to develop their higher gifts ; but also because those who have that leisure are recognized and rewarded by the present society on the condition of never going “ too far ” in their criticisms of that society , and especially — never going over to acts that may lead to its destruction , or even to a serious reform .
Those only are allowed to attain a certain “ development of their individualities ” who are not dangerous in this respect — those who are merely “ interesting , ” but not dangerous to the Philistine .
The Anarchists , we have said , build their previsions of the future upon those data which are supplied by the observation of life at the present time .
Thus , when we examine into the tendencies that have prevailed in the life of civilized countries since the end of the eighteenth century , we certainly do not fail to see how strong the centralizing and authoritarian tendency was during that time , both among the middle classes and those working men who have been educated in the ideas of the middle classes and now strive to enter the ranks of their present rulers and exploiters .
But at the same time it is a fact that the anti-centralist and anti-militarist ideas , as well as the ideas of a free understanding , grow stronger and stronger nowadays both among the working men and the better educated and more or less intellectually free portions of the middle classes — especially in Western Europe .
I have shown , indeed , elsewhere ( in The Conquest of Bread and in Mutual Aid ) how strong at the present time is the tendency to constitute freely , outside the State and the Churches , thousands upon thousands of free organizations for all sorts of needs : economic ( agreements between the railway companies , the Labour Syndicates , trusts of employers , agricultural co-operation , co-operation for export , etc. ) , political , intellectual , artistic , educational and so on .
What formerly belonged without a shadow of doubt to the functions of the State , or the Church , enters now into the domain of free organization .
This tendency develops with a striking rapidity under our very eyes .
It was sufficient that a breath of emancipation should have slightly limited the powers of Church and State in their never - satisfied tendency towards further extension — and voluntary organizations have already germinated by the thousand .
And we may be sure that every new limitation that may be imposed upon State and Church — the two inveterate enemies of freedom — will still further widen the sphere of action of the free organizations .
Future progress lies in this direction , and Anarchism works precisely that way .
Passing now to the economic views of Anarchists , three different conceptions must be distinguished .
So long as Socialism was understood in its wide , generic , and true sense — as an effort to abolish the exploitation of Labour by Capital — the Anarchists were marching hand - in - hand with the Socialists of that time .
But they were compelled to separate from them when the Socialists began to say that there is no possibility of abolishing capitalist exploitation within the lifetime of our generation : that during that phase of economic evolution which we are now living through we have only to mitigate the exploitation , and to impose upon the capitalists certain legal limitations .
Contrary to this tendency of the present - day Socialists , we maintain that already now , without waiting for the coming of new phases and forms of the capitalist exploitation of Labour , we must work for its abolition .
We must , already now , tend to transfer all that is needed for production — the soil , the mines , the factories , the means of communication , and the means of existence , too — from the hands of the individual capitalist into those of the communities of producers and consumers .
As for the political organization — i.e. , the forms of the commonwealth in the midst of which an economic revolution could be accomplished — we entirely differ from all the sections of State Socialists in that we do not see in the system of State Capitalism , which is now preached under the name of Collectivism , a solution of the social question .
We see in the organization of the posts and telegraphs , in the State railways , and the like — which are represented as illustrations of a society without capitalists — nothing but a new , perhaps improved , but still undesirable form of the Wage System .
We even think that such a solution of the social problem would so much run against the present libertarian tendencies of civilized mankind that it simply would be unrealizable .
We maintain that the State organization , having been the force to which the minorities resorted for establishing and organizing their power over the masses , cannot be the force which will serve to destroy these privileges .
The lessons of history tell us that a new form of economic life always calls forth a new form of political organization ; and a Socialist society ( whether Communist or Collectivist ) cannot be an exception to this rule .
Just as the Churches cannot be utilized for freeing man from his old superstitions , and just as the feeling of human solidarity will have to find other channels for its expression besides the Churches , so also the economic and political liberation of man will have to create new forms for its expression in life , instead of those established by the State .
Consequently , the chief aim of Anarchism is to awaken those constructive powers of the labouring masses of the people which at all great moments of history came forward to accomplish the necessary changes , and which , aided by the now accumulated knowledge , will accomplish the change that is called forth by all the best men of our own time .
This is also why the Anarchists refuse to accept the functions of legislators or servants of the State .
We know that the social revolution will not be accomplished by means of laws .
Laws can only follow the accomplished facts ; and even if they honestly do follow them — which usually is not the case — a law remains a dead letter so long as there are not on the spot the living forces required for making of the tendencies expressed in the law an accomplished fact .
On the other hand , since the times of the International Working Men ’s Association , the Anarchists have always advised taking an active part in those workers ’ organizations which carry on the direct struggle of Labour against Capital and its protector — the State .
Such a struggle , they say , better than any other indirect means , permits the worker to obtain some temporary improvements in the present conditions of work , while it opens his eyes to the evil that is done by Capitalism and the State that supports it , and wakes up his thoughts concerning the possibility of organizing consumption , production , and exchange without the intervention of the capitalist and the State .
The opinions of the Anarchists concerning the form which the remuneration of labour may take in a society freed from the yoke of Capital and State still remain divided .
To begin with , all are agreed in repudiating the new form of the Wage System which would be established if the State became the owner of all the land , the mines , the factories , the railways , and so on , and the great organizer and manager of agriculture and all the industries .
If these powers were added to those which the State already possesses ( taxes , defence of the territory , subsidized religions , etc. ) , we should create a new tyranny , even more terrible than the old one .
The greater number of Anarchists accept the Communist solution .
They see that the only form of Communism that would be acceptable in a civilized society is one which would exist without the continual interference of Government , i.e. , the Anarchist form .
And they realize also that an Anarchist society of a large size would be impossible , unless it would begin by guaranteeing to all its members a certain minimum of well - being produced in common .
Communism and Anarchy thus complete each other .
Peter Kropotkin , 1912
Why does it have to be “ the rat race ? ”
Why ca n’t it be the fun race instead ?
Idea being :
What if , instead of seeking to impress the most people , accumulate the biggest pile , or score the most guilt - driven brownie points etcetera , one ’s life goal was to simply have as much fun as possible ( over the full spread of a life well lived ) ?
When you think about it , a lot of people ’s supposedly sober and respectable goals are downright idiotic trivial .
Beyond a certain threshold of comfort , does making lots of money really have any more merit than , say , trying to accumulate the greatest number of Facebook friends ?
( And do n’t even get Jack started on how pathetic it is for people to live out their entire lives in thrall to the judgments and opinions of others they do n’t even like ! )
Admittedly , to make life a pursuit of pleasure ( i.e. “ fun ” ) could be considered a selfish thing .
And in that respect , Jack is glad that many think differently .
He observes with gratitude that plenty of others are willing — eager , even — to prostrate themselves at great personal cost before the feet of their fellow men .
In pure economic terms , light - hearted selfishness is all too rare a commodity .
Pious sacrifice is in no short supply .
Does living to have fun mean wasting one ’s life then ?
Not necessarily .
And even if it did , what of it ?
In matters of ultimate meaning , Jack is inspired by the great Diogenes of Sinope :
When asked how he wished to be buried , [ Diogenes ] left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could feast on his body .
When asked if he minded this , he said , “ Not at all , as long as you provide me with a stick to chase the creatures away ! ”
When asked how he could use the stick since he would lack awareness , he replied “ If I lack awareness , then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead ? ”
One might object that living for fun means destroying one ’s body with drugs , drink and the like .
But if such temptations do not strike you as fun , then why indulge in them ?
Some people ’s idea of fun might be solving complex mathematical equations , translating philosophical texts from the original Greek , or tracking the mating habits of Himalayan blue sheep .
The point is to find and embrace what floats your own boat , not someone else ’s boat .
But to pursue fun as a sole objective is not rational , still others might object .
Well why the hell not ?
In fact , what could be more rational in the face of ultimate futility ?
Consider this cheery bit from Bertrand Russell :
“ … All the labors of the ages , all the devotion , all the inspiration , all the noonday brightness of human genius , are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system , and the whole temple of Man ’s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins … ”
Oh , how deeply depressing — for the poor silly sod who shoulders the heavy burden of purpose that is .
It is all rather amusing to Jack .
And speaking of “ rationality ” as juxtaposed with “ fun ” — can a sufficiently motivated individual not apply rational means to even the happy task of having a damn good time ?
A maximally lived life is one that embraces a diverse mix of pursuits ( i.e. not all steak , not all chocolate cake ) .
Figuring out the right mix requires discipline , concentration , creativity and forethought .
We are used to casting aspersions on those who make fun their life goal because such individuals are typically loosely disciplined at best and bad at life management on the whole .
But the chips need not fall this way .
The sufficiently enlightened individual can recognize that sacrifice and planning are required over the course of a well balanced life — even in pursuit of fun .
From the vantage point of respectable society , Jack intuits a knee - jerk aversion to this idea .
Why might this be ?
To hazard a guess , because society wants something from you .
Society wants your allegiance … your obeisance … your submissive acceptance of the established ways .
The great herds of sheep do not like the contrarian - minded fellow who dares wander off on his own .
They squint in suspicion and suspect him a wolf .
Self - righteousness and unhappiness , insecurity and suspicion — these things go hand in hand .
You mean to say I can chuck all that societally imposed bullshit and just … live life the way I want to ?
Well , Jack would argue , it depends on what you genuinely believe .
If you firmly believe the answer is no , then you are correct — the answer is no .
Self - imposed limitation equals self - fulfilling prophecy .
It ’s practically axiomatic .
But if you believe the answer is yes — that yes , you can be free — then once again the truth becomes what you make it .
No one and nothing beyond or outside ourselves has the power to dictate who and what we live for … unless we hand that power over , by accident or on purpose .

This Week at War : Are the Ayatollahs Using COIN ?
Is the Green Revolution an insurgency ?
Feb. 11 was the 31st anniversary of Iran ’s Islamic Revolution .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad marked the occasion by declaring to hundreds of thousands gathered at Tehran ’s Azadi Square that Iran was a " nuclear state . "
Meanwhile , a heavy presence of security forces in Tehran appeared to have successfully suppressed counterdemonstrations by regime opponents .
In an essay for Small Wars Journal , Dan Cox , an associate professor at the U.S. Army ’s Command and General Staff College , wonders whether Iran ’s rulers are battling an embryonic insurgency .
And if so , is the regime successfully implementing Western - designed counterinsurgency ( COIN ) theory to snuff out the opposition ?
Cox refers back to the French military commander David Galula , one of the original COIN gurus , and others to analyze the Iranian government ’s actions against the protesters .
In response to well - developed insurgencies , Galula and other Western COIN theorists have recommended a gentle hand — counterinsurgents should limit the use of force , protect the population , and stress economic development in order to isolate the insurgents .
However , Cox points out the lesser - known advice Galula and other COIN theorists have for embryonic insurgencies .
The COIN gurus recommend early recognition of the problem and a harsh decisive response .
Cox concludes that the Iranian government , taking advantage of its authoritarian position , is employing the recommendations of these Western theorists and to good effect .
First , the regime appears to have developed good intelligence on the opposition .
The opposition movement appears broad , but scattered , disorganized , and probably lacking many internal security measures .
The security services have likely had an easy time penetrating the movement ’s leadership network and monitoring its electronic communications .
Second ,
Cox ’s research of the Western COIN theorists suggests the importance of early coercive countermeasures against the opposition .
According to the New York Times , the security services have arrested more than a thousand people over the past two months , including scores of journalists , a variety of activists , relatives of opposition leaders , and others .
Since June , eleven regime opponents have been sentenced to death , two have been hanged , and five more are on trial for their lives .
Finally , Galula and other Western COIN theorists stress the importance of controlling the media and information .
Modern technology would presumably favor the insurgent ’s efforts to distribute anti-government propaganda and expose the regime ’s coercive countermeasures to scrutiny .
In Iran , the government has corralled or expelled Western journalists and arrested domestic journalists not sympathetic to the regime .
The government also seems to have effectively strangled the new media ; Internet bandwidth available to the protesters seems minimal , and the government has shut down Google ’s Gmail service and other social networking services .
Cox concludes that the Iranian government , in accordance with Western COIN theorists , has rapidly and efficiently responded to the embryonic insurgency .
It has penetrated the protest movement , arrested the movement ’s organizers and propagandists , and achieved dominance over information and communications .
Naturally , there are more chapters to this story .
But thus far , the Iranian government is showing how to stop an insurgency before it gets started .
A Green Beret ’s advice :
Think COIN , but do n’t do COIN
After more than eight years of war in Afghanistan and nearly seven in Iraq , the conventional wisdom is that the United States will face more troublesome insurgencies .
Even as the U.S. military ’s involvement in Iraq winds down and as it tries to tame the Taliban in Afghanistan , new insurgency troubles have emerged in Yemen , Somalia , Pakistan , and elsewhere .
Thus , counterinsurgency will remain the focus of the U.S. military for the foreseeable future .
According to Lt. Col. Brian Petit , commander of the U.S. Army ’s 2nd Battalion , 1st Special Forces Group , that conventional wisdom is not quite right .
Writing in the journal Special Warfare , Petit , whose battalion served in the Sulu Archipelago in the southern Philippines , argues that the U.S. military should " think COIN " but actually stop doing COIN itself .
Petit reminds his readers that counterinsurgency is the proper job for the indigenous security forces , and not for an outsider third party to a conflict , such as the U.S. Army .
Petit ’s advice to the U.S. military ?
" Think COIN , but practice FID [ foreign internal defense ] . "
Similar to successful ongoing U.S. foreign internal defense missions in Colombia and Africa ’s Sahel region , the U.S. assistance effort in the Philippines strictly employs the " indirect approach . "
U.S. soldiers train , advise , and support the local army and police .
They remain out of sight and do not participate in direct combat .
Even medical assistance visits to remote Philippine villages push Filipino medics and nurses to the foreground with Americans remaining behind the scenes .
Petit writes that these visits are planned in consultation with former insurgents who are now reintegrated into society .
If the indirect FID method is so obviously superior to the campaigns that pushed more than 100,000 U.S. soldiers into Iraq and Afghanistan , why has n’t the FID approach been used in those two places ?
Although at one time broken and corrupt , the Philippines and Colombia at least had a government and army ; in Afghanistan and Iraq , U.S. forces had to start from zero .
Perhaps as important is how impatient U.S. policymakers frequently are for results , especially for projects they have made into top priorities .
But this does n’t work for COIN , as Petit explains :
Tactically , the indirect approach requires clear - eyed recognition that U.S. capacity will be applied through — and not around — the host nation .
This paradigm seems simple , but it runs counter to U.S. military " can-doism " and requires a long - term view and immense operational patience .
The indirect approach does not satisfy appetites for quick , measurable results .
By building capacity with host nation security forces and simultaneously applying population - focused , civil - military programs , the indirect approach rarely produces singularly spectacular results in tactical engagements .
Measures of effectiveness are often best assessed over time and anecdotally .
President Barack Obama and Gen. Stanley McChrystal are counting on quick , measurable results in Afghanistan , with a withdrawal slated to begin in 17 months .
That is not the way Petit and his soldiers made progress in the Philippines .
A Verb for Nirvana
by Thanissaro Bhikkhu
“ Back in the days of the Buddha , nirvana ( nibbana ) had a verb of its own : nibbuti .
It meant to “ go out , ” like a flame .
Because fire was thought to be in a state of entrapment as it burned — both clinging to and trapped by the fuel on which it fed — its going out was seen as an unbinding .
To go out was to be unbound .
Sometimes another verb was used — parinibbuti — with the “ pari - ” meaning total or all - around , to indicate that the person unbound , unlike fire unbound , would never again be trapped .
Now that nirvana has become an English word , it should have its own English verb to convey the sense of “ being unbound ” as well .
At present , we say that a person “ reaches ” nirvana or “ enters ” nirvana , implying that nibbana is a place where you can go .
But nirvana is most emphatically not a place .
It ’s realized only when the mind stops defining itself in terms of place : of here , or there , or between the two .
This may seem like a word - chopper ’s problem — what can a verb or two do to your practice ? — but the idea of nirvana as a place has created severe misunderstandings in the past , and it could easily create misunderstandings now .
There was a time when some philosophers in India reasoned that if nirvana is one place and samsara another , then entering into nirvana leaves you stuck : you ’ve limited your range of movement , for you ca n’t get back to samsara .
Thus to solve this problem they invented what they thought was a new kind of nirvana : an unestablished nirvana , in which one could be in both places — nirvana and samsara — at once .
Neither Samsara nor Nirvana is a Place
However , these philosophers misunderstood two important points about the Buddha ’s teachings .
The first was that neither samsara nor nirvana is a place .
Samsara is a process of creating places , even whole worlds , ( this is called becoming ) and then wandering through them ( this is called birth ) .
Nirvana is the end of this process .
You may be able to be in two places at once — or even develop a sense of self so infinite that you can occupy all places at once — but you ca n’t feed a process and experience its end at the same time .
You ’re either feeding samsara or you ’re not .
If you feel the need to course freely through both samsara and nirvana , you ’re simply engaging in more samsara-ing and keeping yourself trapped .
The second point is that nirvana , from the very beginning , was realized through unestablished consciousness — one that does n’t come or go or stay in place .
There ’s no way that anything unestablished can get stuck anywhere at all , for it ’s not only non-localized but also undefined .
The idea of a religious ideal as lying beyond space and definition is not exclusive to the Buddha ’s teachings , but issues of locality and definition , in the Buddha ’s eyes , had a specific psychological meaning .
This is why the non-locality of nirvana is important to understand .
The Non-Locality of Nirvana
Just as all phenomena are rooted in desire , consciousness localizes itself through passion .
Passion is what creates the “ there ” on which consciousness can land or get established , whether the “ there ” is a form , feeling , perception , thought - construct , or a type of consciousness itself .
Once consciousness gets established on any of these aggregates , it becomes attached and then proliferates , feeding on everything around it and creating all sorts of havoc .
Wherever there ’s attachment , that ’s where you get defined as a being .
You create an identity there , and in so doing you ’re limited there .
Even if the “ there ” is an infinite sense of awareness grounding , surrounding , or permeating everything else , it ’s still limited , for “ grounding ” and so forth are aspects of place .
Wherever there ’s place , no matter how subtle , passion lies latent , looking for more food to feed on .
If , however , the passion can be removed , there ’s no more “ there ” there .
One sutta illustrates this with a simile : the sun shining through the eastern wall of a house and landing on the western wall .
If the western wall , the ground beneath it , and the waters beneath the ground were all removed , the sunlight would n’t land .
In the same way , if passion for form , etc. , could be removed , consciousness would have no “ where ” to land , and so would become unestablished .
This does n’t mean that consciousness would be annihilated , simply that — like the sunlight — it would now have no locality .
With no locality , it would no longer be defined .
This is why the consciousness of nirvana is said to be “ without surface ” ( anidassanam ) , for it does n’t land .
Because the consciousness - aggregate covers only consciousness that is near or far , past , present , or future — i.e. , in connection with space and time — consciousness without surface is not included in the aggregates .
It ’s not eternal because eternity is a function of time .
And because non-local also means undefined , the Buddha insisted that an awakened person — unlike ordinary people — ca n’t be located or defined in any relation to the aggregates in this life ; after death , he / she ca n’t be described as existing , not existing , neither , or both , because descriptions can apply only to definable things .
The Essential Step to Nirvana
The essential step toward this non-localized , undefined realization is to cut back on the proliferations of consciousness .
This first involves contemplating the drawbacks of keeping consciousness trapped in the process of feeding .
This contemplation gives urgency to the next steps : bringing the mind to oneness in concentration , gradually refining that oneness , and then dropping it to zero .
The drawbacks of feeding are most graphically described in SN XII.63 , A Son ’s Flesh .
The process of gradually refining oneness is probably best described in MN 121 , The Lesser Discourse on Emptiness , while the drop to zero is best described in the Buddha ’s famous instructions to Bahiya :
“ ‘ In reference to the seen , there will be only the seen .
In reference to the heard , only the heard .
In reference to the sensed , only the sensed .
In reference to the cognized , only the cognized . ’
That is how you should train yourself .
When for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen , only the heard in reference to the heard , only the sensed in reference to the sensed , only the cognized in reference to the cognized , then , Bahiya , there is no you in connection with that .
When there is no you in connection with that , there is no you there .
When there is no you there , you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two .
This , just this , is the end of stress . ”
With no here or there or between the two , you obviously ca n’t use the verb “ enter ” or “ reach ” to describe this realization , even metaphorically .
Maybe we should make the word nirvana into a verb itself : “ When there is no you in connection with that , you nirvana . ”
That way we can indicate that unbinding is an action unlike any other , and we can head off any mistaken notion about getting “ stuck ” in total freedom . ”

3,200 - word blog entry about a fund group in Australia which has all the appearances of being , he wrote , " qualitatively different and more serious than any previous fund collapse in Australia " .
He was featured on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald ( other SMH stories on this subject are here and here ) , and his blog was read around the world , partly because it continued his investigation into Paradigm , a fund - management firm owned by Joe Biden 's son and brother -- a company which , he wrote , " keep being associated with cases like this " .
( The Australian fund 's chief consultant was the former CEO of Paradigm Global . )
On Saturday , January 2 , John Hempton put up a monster 3,200 - word blog entry about a fund group in Australia which has all the appearances of being , he wrote , “ qualitatively different and more serious than any previous fund collapse in Australia ” .
He was featured on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald ( other SMH stories on this subject are here and here ) , and his blog was read around the world , partly because it continued his investigation into Paradigm , a fund - management firm owned by Joe Biden ’s son and brother — a company which , he wrote , “ keep being associated with cases like this ” .
( The Australian fund ’s chief consultant was the former CEO of Paradigm Global . )
On Sunday , January 3 , Hempton ’s blog — his entire blog , not just the one blog entry — disappeared .
Anybody trying to go there now * just gets this message :
Hempton himself , meanwhile , is faced with this :
The timing is odd , to say the least , and Hempton suspects that someone complained about his blog , rather than this just being a question of a random false positive in a robot algorithm .
Annoyingly , Blogger — which is owned by Google — gives no way of reaching a human being who could see at a glance that the blog is not spam , and turn it back on .
What ’s more , Blogger ’s robots must be particularly stupid , because Hempton ’s blogs have lots of incoming links from reputable locations like Reuters.com , FT.com , and WSJ.com .
It ’s hard to see what “ characteristics of a spam blog ” Hempton ’s site could possibly have .
This is n’t the first time that Blogger / Google has shut down a prominent financial blogger .
In April 2008 , the company shut down Yves Smith ’s Naked Capitalism for ostensibly the exact same reason , and she says that she only got back up and running relatively quickly because she had a personal connection to Google ’s vice president of global communications .
It seems like a no - brainer to me that Blogger should not be following a policy of automatically shutting down blogs without a human making that decision when those blogs are getting large numbers of pageviews and incoming links .
If Google ’s robots think that a popular blog is spam , then that blog should be brought to the attention of a Google employee who can make that determination .
There ’s no massive rush , in the case of blogs which have been in existence for months or years , to shut down a blog so quickly that a human ca n’t get involved .
So what ’s up here , Google ?
Why do you shut down high - quality popular blogs so easily , and make it so hard to reinstate them ?
* Update : It ’s back up .
Yay !
Update 2 : Google ’s Rick Klau , who saw my blog entry and reinstated John ’s blog , explains further , and responds to a proposal from John that Google could simply ask suspected spam - bloggers to pass a Captcha test :
The Tea Party anti-big government , anti-tax , anti-some - other - stuff folks are sinking their ideological roots into the Golden State rather quickly -- and deeply .
Hmm , and there 's a midterm election for every House seat , a third of the Senate and dozens of governors ' chairs this coming November .
A new Field Poll out this afternoon finds that 28 % of the state 's voters identify with that protest movement while nearly two - thirds already know about them .
California support for these protesters is concentrated among Republicans and conservatives , whose energy , money , online muscle and motivation played significant roles in some recent elections , fed , according to other polls , by growing concerns about federal spending and record deficits .
The Ticket described some internal Tea Party convention turmoil here this morning .
Meanwhile , the same new Field Poll asked about the long - simmering controversy over Barack Obama 's birth and whether he is a real American - born citizen and , therefore , constitutionally allowed to be president .
Courts have tossed the challenges but that has n't stopped the arguments , as you 'll no doubt soon see in the Comments below .
Obama 's mother was an American , if you count Kansas as America .
Which legally should end the issue wherever the birth took place , Kenya or not .
However , Hawaii following state privacy guidelines has released only copies of a Certificate of Live Birth , not the real thing .
And Obama has not waived his privacy rights , allowing the actual certificate to be released .
So why has n't he , the so - called " birthers " ask .
And suspicions remain that although the president 's announced birth year is 1961 , maybe who knows it could be he was born there before Hawaii became a state in 1959 .
On the other hand , John McCain was born on a U.S. naval base in the Panama Canal Zone and it never was a state .
But both his parents were Americans and Obama 's father was a Kenyan .
And on and on .
So , the Field Poll inquired and found that while two - thirds of Californians ( 67 % ) are satisfied that Obama was U.S. - born , fully one - third of the nation 's most populous state are not .
In fact , 11 % are certain that he 's a Constitution - violating foreigner and 22 % are not sure .
A spokesman for California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who as an Austrian native is ineligible to be president , said he would have no comment .
Now , about the nationality of Flat Stanley .

The saltmarsh sparrow has ' wild ' mating habits
A bird living on the coast of the US is the world 's most promiscuous bird , say scientists .
The saltmarsh sparrow , a bird that lives in the marshes of Connecticut , was found to have extreme levels of multiple mating .
The researchers found that 95 % of females mated with more than one male during each nesting period .
This unusual behaviour could be a survival mechanism due to coastal flooding , researchers say .
The researchers , who are based in the US , publish their results in the journal The Auk .
Sexy sparrows Using DNA analyses and studying the birds mating behaviour in the marsh habitat , the scientists revealed the highly promiscuous activities of the bird .
We think that it is the most promiscuous bird species studied to date
Professor Chris Elphick
University of Connecticut " We found that nearly every clutch of eggs was the product of more than one father , and that within broods it was extremely common for any two siblings to have different fathers , " says Professor Chris Elphick from the University of Connecticut .
Professor Elphick undertook his research along with Professor Christopher Hill from Coastal Carolina University in South Carolina , US and Carina Gjerdrum of the Canadian Wildlife Service .
The scientists found that at least 95 % of females mate with more than one male for a single clutch of eggs .
A clutch is defined as a set of eggs laid together in the nest at one time .
One in three nests had a different father for every chick , and the average brood of chicks had more than 2.5 fathers .
" The chance that any two chicks in the same nest have the same father is only 23 % , " says Professor Elphick .
" We were not surprised to find some level of promiscuity , " he says .
" But we were quite stunned at just how extreme the rate was . "
' Eggs in one basket '
The saltmarsh sparrow ( Ammodramus caudacutus ) is a small , stocky bird that lives along the US Atlantic coast .
Some of their behaviour is unusual for songbirds ; males and females do not bond together to form pairs , and the males play no role in caring for chicks .
The sparrows nest amongst the saltmarshes , and are vulnerable to frequent high tides , which can cause a high level of nest loss .
Very high tides occur every four weeks - the same length of time it takes for the sparrow to raise a family .
Who 's your father ?
Professor Elphick suggests that the mating patterns are are a response to this risky environment .
" If they lose their young to flooding , they have to re-nest almost immediately if the new set of young is to survive , " he says .
This means that female birds do not have time to look for and invest in the best male partner .
The lack of time increases the likelihood of choosing a poor quality mate .
To overcome this , it seems that females mate with several males .
" The females do n't want to put all their eggs in one basket so to speak , " says Professor Elphick .
Love contenders
" We think that it is the most promiscuous bird species studied to date , although there are a couple of other possible contenders , " says Professor Elphick .
The greater vasa parrot ( Coracopsis vasa ) of Madagascar , and the superb fairywren ( Malurus cyaneus ) of Australia have comparable rates of promiscuity .
" Both of these species also have multiple paternity in most nests , but it is unclear whether they have so many fathers per nest . "
The differences between studies that have been carried out into each of the bird species mean it is impossible to make a direct comparison .
But their extreme promiscuity is not the most interesting thing about these birds , says Professor Elphick .
" What is most interesting about these three species is that all have totally different social systems , " he explains .
" Unrelated species have all converged on high levels of promiscuity through very different sets of behaviours . "
" It 's the multidimensional complexity of all those species - the many ways in which they differ from one another that makes the natural world so amazing . "

Only three weeks ago , The New York Post reported that “ the blue wall had fallen . ”
On February 1 , the NY Daily News reported , “ A nervous NYPD cop delivered damning testimony against a fellow officer Monday , telling jurors how the officer shoved a retractable baton into a suspect ’s backside . ”
“ Officer Kevin Maloney ’s turn on the witness stand marked the most dramatic moment of the trial and the biggest blow to the defense , ” the Daily News added .
ADVERTISEMENT
WABC ’s Tim Fleischer agreed , “ Cop testifying against cops .
It was a rare scene in court and by far the most damaging to at least one of the three officers on trial . ”
“ It was pressed on Michael Mineo ’s left buttock , ” The Post reported that Maloney testified .
“ I saw it move from left to right . . .
Yes , there was pressure being applied .
It went from left to right , into Michael Mineo ’s butt crack . ”
He also reported hearing Mineo shout , " Why did you stick a walkie - talkie up my ass ? " after which he heard Kern say that the perp was an " EDP " -- an emotionally disturbed person .
However , over the next three weeks , as a Google news search reveals , Maloney ’s name all but disappeared from the daily reports on the case .
It appears that jurors may have also forgotten .
ADVERTISEMENT
Monday morning , the Associated Press reports , “ A New York City police officer accused of a sodomy attack on a drug suspect in a subway station was acquitted Monday along with two other officers who had been accused of covering it up . ”
“ Officer Richard Kern had faced as many as 25 years in prison if convicted of aggravated sexual abuse , ” the AP story adds .
“ Officers Andrew Morales and Alex Cruz could have faced up to four years in prison on charges of hindering prosecution . ”
Last week , the Daily News reported , “ While defense lawyers angrily lashed out at prosecutors and alleged victim Michael Mineo , prosecutors focused on a police witness who came forward to testify against fellow cops . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ He ’s got no axe to grind , ” prosecutor Charles Guria said of Officer Kevin Maloney , who testified that he saw Officer Richard Kern shove a police baton into Mineo ’s underwear after an Oct. 15 , 2008 , arrest in the Prospect Park subway station .
“ He does n’t know either one of them from Adam , and he came forward and risked his career and his standing in the police department , ” Guria said .
“ Why would he do that if he ’s not sure of what he saw ? ” Guria also said that Kern , on the other hand , had plenty of reasons to lie when he took the stand to deny the charges of aggravated sexual assault that could send him to prison for 25 years .
A Times blog last week also made brief mention of Maloney .
ADVERTISEMENT
A Times story the day before characterized the showdown as , “ Jurors will have to sift through the sometimes conflicting testimony of four police officers : Mr. Jugraj ; Mr. Kern and Mr. Morales , who took the stand in their own defense ; and Kevin Maloney , a transit officer , who testified that he saw Officer Kern jab his baton between Mr. Mineo ’s buttocks . ”
Now that the officers have been cleared , Maloney may have difficulties at work .
But then again , even if the officers were n’t cleared , history shows that police officers like Maloney that break the so - called blue wall end up marked forever , as other police officers refuse to work with them and promotion opportunities vanish .
At press time , the Associated Press ’s comprehensive story on the acquittal never mentions Maloney once .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ A transit system police officer who witnessed the struggle testified for the prosecution , ” the AP story states .
Little of the prosecution ’s case is mentioned in the AP report , as compared to the successful defense .
The defense also challenged Mineo ’s credibility .
He had told jurors that he ran from the officers partly because he was n’t carrying identification .
Defense attorney John Patten produced a photograph of Kern , in uniform , looking at what appears to be an ID card that Mineo had handed to him .
“ Defense doctors testified that Mineo could have had a pre-existing medical condition to explain the abscess , and that the officer ’s alleged actions would have made his injuries more severe .
In many ways the case hinged on the believability of Mineo , a self - professed member of the Crips gang who has been arrested several times and admits to smoking pot regularly .
The New York Post reports “ PBA President Pat Lynch , who supported the officers , hugged the trio afterwards . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ This case goes to show how New York City police officers are falsely accused . …
This is case where someone had dollar signs in their eyes and they thought they could do it on the backs of police officers , ” Lynch said .
The Post also neglects to mention Maloney .
Mineo is quoted as saying in reaction , “ My reaction ?
You want to commit a murder ?
Come join the NYPD . ”

Formula 1 technical chiefs have officially agreed to ban double diffusers from the start of next year , AUTOSPORT can reveal .
A move to cut aerodynamic downforce was discussed with the FIA in Thursday 's meeting of F1 think - tank the Technical Working Group , where agreement was necessary if the changes were to be implemented in future regulations .
Sources have confirmed to AUTOSPORT that a vote approved the tweaks to aerodynamics - with a tidying up of the controversial diffuser rules effectively outlawing double diffusers from the start of next season .
It is understood that the teams approved a requirement that the diffuser surface must be continuous on its inboard section from the start of 2011 .
This prevents the use of the controversial ' slots ' that were key to making the double diffuser work .
The matter still needs to get approval from the Formula 1 Commission and the FIA 's World Sport Council before being put in the 2011 technical regulations , but this is believed to be a formality if the TWG has already voted in favour .
Double diffusers caused huge controversy at the start of 2009 when the design concept used by Brawn GP , Williams and Toyota was protested by rival outfits .
The complaints to stewards fell on deaf ears , however - meaning the matter eventually went to the FIA International Court of Appeal .
The ICA ruled that the diffusers were wholly legal - which forced a number of teams on the grid to revamp their cars to make the most of the advantage provided by double diffusers .
A move to outlaw them now has come about because teams have made such progress in increasing downforce that this season cars are expected to be producing more than at the end of 2008 - when teams were asked to reduce downforce with a dramatic change to the regulations .
Sources have told AUTOSPORT that the aerodynamic changes for 2011 will increase lap times by around two seconds .
Although the diffuser ban goes some way to arresting some of the progress made by teams since the end of 2008 , there remain calls for a more thorough rethink .
Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner , whose team had to integrate a double diffuser onto its car in the middle of last season , believes that changes should go beyond simple rule tweaks .
" I think the most important thing is to set clear objectives - as to what do the governing body and the promoters want F1 to be , " he told AUTOSPORT last weekend .
" What do they want the F1 cars to be able to do ?
" Then rather than cherry picking at bits and pieces , we can look at the package as a whole to encourage more overtaking , and to enable the cars to follow more closely .
" I think looking at components in isolation is often quite dangerous , so I think it is important that the overall objective is clearly defined and then worked on by the various technical groups . "
The TWG also approved a regulation tweak to impose a maximum height for the chassis , for safety reasons .

Haiti ’s ongoing struggle to recover
Published Feb 12 , 2010 8:08 PM
As the people of Haiti continue heroic efforts to recover from the Jan. 12 devastating earthquake that has claimed at least 200,000 lives , they are facing a new challenge — an occupation of 13,000 U.S. troops and advanced weaponry .
This new occupation was sanctioned by the United Nations on Jan. 22 without any say from the Haitians themselves .
The main goal of these troops is not to assist in any kind of humanitarian aid for the Haitian people but rather to extend U.S. imperialism ’s economic influence in the Caribbean and parts of Latin America .
While the Haitian people need food , doctors , clean water , housing and the technology to rebuild their infrastructure in the capital of Port - au - Prince and throughout the island nation , once again the U.S. has contributed nothing but arrogance and terror to a people who first won their independence in 1804 from the French colonizers who enslaved them .
The fact that President Barack Obama appointed former U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush to oversee the U.S. presence in Haiti exposes the hypocrisy of the U.S. government ’s concern for the Haitian people .
Under the Clinton administration , U.S. Marines illegally removed from office the democratically elected president of Haiti , Jean - Bertrand Aristide , in 1994 .
Under the Bush regime , President Aristide was kidnapped from Haiti in 2004 .
Now exiled in South Africa , President Aristide has made a strong public appeal to be allowed to return to Haiti to help his people in the aftermath of the earthquake .
On Feb. 5 , an estimated 300 people confronted Clinton in Port - au - Prince to complain that the U.S. had not carried out its promises to bring immediate aid to the Haitian people .
The previous day , the French - based Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) stated that a photographer from Le Nouvelliste , the oldest and largest mainstream Haitian daily , had a camera physically taken from him by six U.S. Marines .
The reporter , Homère Cardichon , was taking photos of a protest by Haitians at the U.S. ambassador ’s home in the capital .
“ Six Marines come up and surrounded me , ” Cardichon told RSF .
“ Then they took my camera in my opened work bag and left with it .
An hour later , one of them came back and photographed me .
Then he returned my camera to me .
I saw that the soldiers had erased some of the photos . ”
The RSF denounced the Marines ’ actions as “ a flagrant act of censorship , ” stating that “ news and information is vital for reconstruction in Haiti and for the efforts of its citizens to start rebuilding their lives . ”
( RSF , Feb . 4 )
There is another reason why the U.S. sent thousands of Marines to Haiti : to contain any efforts being made on the part of the Haitians to reconstruct and rebuild their lives in the aftermath of the earthquake crisis .
This was confirmed in a Feb. 5 letter sent by Mary Ellen McNish , general secretary of the American Friends Service Committee .
The letter reads in part : “ I ’m glad to report that AFSC ’s assessment team has returned safely from Haiti , where they spent time in Port - au - Prince viewing firsthand the immense devastation of the capital city .
They report that the formal structures that keep a country running were very hard hit , especially because many government ministers and mid-level civil servants died in the quake .
Many institutions that were the pillars of the community , such as churches , medical facilities and schools , were badly damaged or were destroyed .
“ According to Jorge Lafitte , AFSC Regional Director of Latin America , the situation in Haiti is not like other disasters to which AFSC has recently responded .
The destruction of the capital city and the collapse of the Haitian middle class , who sustain the country , make this a very different crisis .
“ However , some of the poorest areas in the city were not as greatly affected because buildings there are not large permanent structures and were not as lethal if they fell .
People in these areas have slowly returned to informal systems of survival and our team noted that there seemed to be little violence and looting .
“ A variety of makeshift solutions has developed from formal camps of 80 - 100,000 people to smaller groups of 700 - 1,000 banding together where they can .
Some residents are camping in front of their destroyed homes .
In talking with them , our team found that people hope they will reconstruct their houses and it is safer to stay close by .
“ Geri Sicola , Associate General Secretary for International Programs , was able to visit one of the three centers where AFSC is providing emergency assistance to people living in a makeshift shelter on the grounds of a school .
On that day more than 600 people were provided a meal .
Our partner , Swiss Interchurch Aid , is using a private home ’s kitchen to produce the food — an example of the practical and generous gestures being made by so many Haitians in this crisis .
The meals include rice , beans , vegetables , and the ingredients are purchased locally or in the Dominican Republic , bolstering local economies . ” ( http://tinyurl.com/yfbmaht)
On Feb. 6 , the BBC reported that the G7 group — the seven richest capitalist countries , including the U.S. , Britain , France , Germany , Italy , Canada and Japan — announced that they were writing off Haiti ’s debt of more than $ 1 billion .
Not only should Haiti ’s debt be cancelled by these countries and the imperialist banks , but reparations in the billions of dollars should be paid to the Haitian people for the theft of their resources and labor over the centuries .

my 2 cents about the gaming world and … whatever comes to my mind …
OK , the plan is out .
Basically , it splits the difference between the House and Senate bills , with a set of measures that can be passed through reconciliation .
Igor Volsky has a nice table doing the comparison .
Since the House bill is better than the Senate bill , and the Senate bill is much better than nothing , this should be a go .
What I hear is that at this point the House is a bigger problem than the Senate .
Pelosi — and Obama — have to drive home the following points : 1 . This is the last chance to do HCR for years to come , and America desperately needs this 2 .
For their own sake , Democrats have to run on a record of having achieved something .
I ’m not in a position to do nose - counts , but I ’m guardedly optimistic .

Warming exceeds grimmest climate models
Since the 1997 international accord to fight global warming , climate change has worsened and accelerated — beyond some of the grimmest of warnings made back then .
As the world has talked for a dozen years about what to do next , new ship passages opened through the once frozen summer sea ice of the Arctic .
In Greenland and Antarctica , ice sheets have lost trillions of tons of ice .
Mountain glaciers in Europe , South America , Asia and Africa are shrinking faster than before .

And it ’s not just the frozen parts of the world that have felt the heat in the dozen years leading up to next month ’s climate summit in Copenhagen :
_ The world ’s oceans have risen by about an inch and a half .
_ Droughts and wildfires have turned more severe worldwide , from the U.S. West to Australia to the Sahel desert of North Africa .
_Species now in trouble because of changing climate include , not just the lumbering polar bear which has become a symbol of global warming , but also fragile butterflies , colorful frogs and entire stands of North American pine forests .
_ Temperatures over the past 12 years are 0.4 of a degree warmer than the dozen years leading up to 1997 .

Even the gloomiest climate models back in the 1990s did n’t forecast results quite this bad so fast .
“ The latest science is telling us we are in more trouble than we thought , ” Janos Pasztor , climate adviser to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon .
And here ’s why : Since an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas pollution was signed in Kyoto , Japan , in December 1997 , the level of carbon dioxide in the air has increased 6.5 percent .
Officials from across the world will convene in Copenhagen next month to seek a follow - up pact , one that President Barack Obama says “ has immediate operational effect … an important step forward in the effort to rally the world around a solution . ”

The last effort did n’t quite get the anticipated results .
From 1997 to 2008 , world carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels have increased 31 percent ; U.S. emissions of this greenhouse gas rose 3.7 percent .
Emissions from China , now the biggest producer of this pollution , have more than doubled in that time period .
When the U.S. Senate balked at the accord and President George W. Bush withdrew from it , that meant that the top three carbon polluters — the U.S. , China and India — were not part of the pact ’s emission reductions .
Developing countries were not covered by the Kyoto Protocol and that is a major issue in Copenhagen .

And the effects of greenhouse gases are more powerful and happening sooner than predicted , scientists said .
“ Back in 1997 , the impacts ( of climate change ) were underestimated ; the rate of change has been faster , ” said Virginia Burkett , chief scientist for global change research at the U.S. Geological Survey .
That last part alarms former Vice President Al Gore , who helped broker a last - minute deal in Kyoto .

“ By far the most serious differences that we ’ve had is an acceleration of the crisis itself , ” Gore said in an interview this month with The Associated Press .
In 1997 , global warming was an issue for climate scientists , environmentalists and policy wonks .
Now biologists , lawyers , economists , engineers , insurance analysts , risk managers , disaster professionals , commodity traders , nutritionists , ethicists and even psychologists are working on global warming .
“ We ’ve come from a time in 1997 where this was some abstract problem working its way around scientific circles to now when the problem is in everyone ’s face , ” said Andrew Weaver , a University of Victoria climate scientist .
The changes in the last 12 years that have the scientists most alarmed are happening in the Arctic with melting summer sea ice and around the world with the loss of key land - based ice masses .
It ’s all happening far faster than predicted .

Back in 1997 “ nobody in their wildest expectations , ” would have forecast the dramatic sudden loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic that started about five years ago , Weaver said .
From 1993 to 1997 , sea ice would shrink on average in the summer to about 2.7 million square miles .
The average for the last five years is less than 2 million square miles .
What ’s been lost is the size of Alaska .
Antarctica had a slight increase in sea ice , mostly because of the cooling effect of the ozone hole , according to the British Antarctic Survey .
At the same time , large chunks of ice shelves — adding up to the size of Delaware — came off the Antarctic peninsula .
While melting Arctic ocean ice does n’t raise sea levels , the melting of giant land - based ice sheets and glaciers that drain into the seas do .
Those are shrinking dramatically at both poles .
Measurements show that since 2000 , Greenland has lost more than 1.5 trillion tons of ice , while Antarctica has lost about 1 trillion tons since 2002 , according to two scientific studies published this fall .
In multiple reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports , scientists did n’t anticipate ice sheet loss in Antarctica , Weaver said .
And the rate of those losses is accelerating , so that Greenland ’s ice sheets are melting twice as fast now as they were just seven years ago , increasing sea level rise .

Worldwide glaciers are shrinking three times faster than in the 1970s and the average glacier has lost 25 feet of ice since 1997 , said Michael Zemp , a researcher at World Glacier Monitoring Service at the University of Zurich .
“ Glaciers are a good climate indicator , ” Zemp said .
“ What we see is an accelerated loss of ice . ”
Also , permafrost — the frozen northern ground that oil pipelines are built upon and which traps the potent greenhouse gas methane — is thawing at an alarming rate , Burkett said .
Another new post -1997 impact of global warming has scientists very concerned .
The oceans are getting more acidic because more of the carbon dioxide in the air is being absorbed into the water .
That causes acidification , an issue that did n’t even merit a name until the past few years .
More acidic water harms coral , oysters and plankton and ultimately threatens the ocean food chain , biologists say .

In 1997 , “ there was no interest in plants and animals ” and how they are hampered by climate change , said Stanford University biologist Terry Root .
Now scientists are talking about which species can be saved from extinction and which are goners .
The polar bear became the first species put on the federal list of threatened species and the small rabbit - like American pika may be joining it .
More than 37 million acres of Canadian and U.S. pine forests have been damaged by beetles that do n’t die in warmer winters .
And in the U.S. West , the average number of acres burned per fire has more than doubled .
The Colorado River reservoirs , major water suppliers for the U.S.
West , were nearly full in 1999 , but by 2007 half the water was gone after the region endured the worst multiyear drought in 100 years of record - keeping .
Insurance losses and blackouts have soared and experts say global warming is partly to blame .
The number of major U.S. weather - related blackouts from 2004 - 2008 were more than seven times higher than from 1993 - 1997 , said Evan Mills , a staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab .

“ The message on the science is that we know a lot more than we did in 1997 and it ’s all negative , ” said Eileen Claussen , president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change .
“ Things are much worse than the models predicted . ”
As is typically the case before the nominations are announced , few of this year ’s presumed Oscar contenders have caught fire at the box office .
But one demographic that can usually be counted on to view things early on is the pirates who upload and download illicit copies from file - sharing sites .
Esteemed L.A. Times Oscarologist Tom O’Neil reports today that DVD screeners for all of the 2009 awards hopefuls ( save for Avatar ) are currently in the hands of the Academy ’s general membership — so why have so few leaked online ?
By this time last year , all but six of the screeners for movies that later earned Oscar nods were being freely traded on BitTorrent sites , according to a January study by Waxy.org .
This year , though , so many of the films expected to be nominated remain un-pirated , including ( as far as we can tell ) : Up in the Air , Last Station , It ’s Complicated , Nine , A Single Man , A Serious Man , Bright Star , Crazy Heart , The Lovely Bones , Julie & Julia , Fantastic Mr. Fox , Me and Orson Welles , The Princess and the Frog , The Informant ! , and Sherlock Holmes ( plus countless other ones expected to be snubbed , like The Road , Amelia , That Evening Sun , Creation , Capitalism : A Love Story , and The Men Who Stare at Goats ) .
So what ’s the problem ?
Did studios spring for better copy - protection this year ?
Were they more selective with whom they mailed screeners to ?
Or do pirates just really want Precious to win ?
Oscar voting begins !

So ….hello again from a long time away .
This post is actually being written by Geoff ’s wife .
As the title proclaimed , this is a weird year .
A weird six months if we really want to drill it down .
I figure if this continues one year in I will move from fresh hops to drinking bleach as per the direction of the giant orange baby .
When asked if I could write offensive things , Geoff just said , “ You can be as offensive as you want . ”
So , there .
Giant orange baby .
Also , for the love of all things good , do not drink bleach .
But , I digress .
This is my love song to fresh hop season , but as Jimmy Buffett says , from a different point of view .
I am now sitting on my porch drinking fresh hop beer from a can .
That ’s right , from a can .
Now some commenter wanting to sound all smart might write “ Jeanne , fresh hop beers have been being canned for years now ” .
Well commenter , I do n’t care .
This is my post , and my feelings , and we are going to talk about the fresh hop beer in cans that we had tonight ( while watching FOOTBALL ????
That had FANS IN THE STANDS ????? ) .
Mind blown .
We tried Matchless ’s C.S.A. Farm Harvest fresh hop , Breakside ’s Fresh Hop 2020 and the Fresh - Hopped Oktoberfest from Level Beer .
Shout out to Full Throttle Bottles ( Go Sox ! ) in Georgetown for having the Breakside & Level on your shelves and Thriftway West Seattle for having the Matchless .
This is n’t to say that each place did n’t have more options , that is just where we purchased these .
So , if you are still reading after all this …here are our ( my ) very concise thoughts …
Matchless : Thumbs up for using all Washington ingredients .
Really interesting bouquet .
More malt character than most fresh hop beers .
Breakside : Mild aroma hinting at the inclusion of fresh hops .
Fresh hop flavor more pronounced overall .
Very solid .
Level : Pretty fantastic and perfect for late summer / fall .
Not a huge fresh hop flavor / aroma , but enough to know it ’s there .
Smooth malt profile with a moderate bitterness to finish .
It ’s challenging to get the fresh hops to come through in a style other than pale ale / IPA , but this is really nice .
Would I get these again ?
Yes on the Breakside .
Though it might not have achieved the dankness I seek in a fresh hop , you could still pick up the green fresh hop character , and I did quite enjoy it .
Would definitely have the Level again .
I personally would n’t get the Matchless again , but that is just one person ’s opinion .
So , let us know your thoughts on the fresh hop beers coming out and what you suggest and how you are consuming your beer .
Hopefully with a mask on except for when you are actually imbibing .
Stay safe and stay healthy .
Every four years the White House issues a “ nuclear posture review . ”
That may sound like an anachronism .
It is n’t .
In a world where the United States and Russia still have more than 20,000 nuclear weapons  and Iran , North Korea and others have seemingly unquenchable nuclear appetites  what the United States says about its arsenal matters enormously .
President Obama ’s review was due to Congress in December .
That has been delayed , in part because of administration infighting .
The president needs to get this right .
It is his chance to finally jettison cold war doctrine and bolster America ’s credibility as it presses to rein in Iran , North Korea and other proliferators .
Mr. Obama has already committed rhetorically to the vision of a world without nuclear weapons .
But we are concerned that some of his advisers , especially at the Pentagon , are resisting his bold ambitions .
He needs to stick with the ideas he articulated in his campaign and in speeches last year in Prague and at the United Nations .
These are some of the important questions the posture review must address :
THEIR PURPOSE : Current doctrine gives nuclear weapons a “ critical role ” in defending the United States and its allies .
And it suggests they could be used against foes wielding chemical , biological or even conventional forces  not just nuclear arms .
Mr. Obama ’s aides have proposed changing that to say that the “ primary ” purpose of nuclear weapons is to deter a nuclear attack against the United States or its allies .
This still invites questions about whether Washington values  and might use  nuclear forces against non-nuclear targets .
THE push for full body scanners at Australian airports gained momentum yesterday during a visit by the deputy head of the US Department of Homeland Security , Jane Holl Lute .
She discussed the scanners with the federal Transport Minister , Anthony Albanese , during a one - hour briefing at Sydney Airport .

One of the biggest , most high - profile deals of the commercial real - estate boom is in danger of imminent default , say people familiar with the matter , signaling the beginning of what is expected to be a wave of commercial - property failures .

A new Chinese government survey of the country 's environmental problems has shown water pollution levels in 2007 were more than twice the government 's official estimate , largely because agricultural waste was ignored .
The data , presented by Vice Environment Protection Minister Zhang Lijun , revives persistent questions about the quality of Chinese official statistics and the effectiveness of a government push for cleaner growth after decades of unbridled expansion .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
The first national census on pollution sources found that discharge of " chemical oxygen demand " ( COD ) -- a measure of water pollution -- in wastewater was 30.3 million metric tons , Zhang said .
The government had said in an official paper published two years ago that 2007 was the first year it managed to reduce water pollution , with COD falling 3 percent to 13.8 million metric tons .
The census has been years in the making , in part because it was extremely comprehensive , but possibly also because the contents include painful revelations like this one .
Zhang played down the difference between the totals .
He said it was explained by the survey 's expanded scope , the inclusion of agricultural sources of wastewater -- which contributed some 13.2 million metric tons -- and different calculation methods .

Waking the dead
Scientists at the University of Copenhagen have become the first to reconstruct the nuclear genome of an extinct human being .
It is the first time an ancient genome has been reconstructed in detail .
The innovative technique can be applied to museum materials and ancient remains found in nature and can help reconstructing human phenotypic traits of extinct cultures from where only limited remains have been recovered .
It also allows for finding those contemporary populations most closely related to extinct cultures revealing ancient human expansions and migrations .
Finally , the discovery improves our understanding of heredity and the disease risk passed down from our ancestors .
The spectacular results of the research are being published in the upcoming issue of Nature .
Professor Eske Willerslev and his PhD student Morten Rasmussen , from Centre of Excellence in GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum , University of Copenhagen , Denmark , led the international team of scientists responsible for the findings .
Sequencing the genome
Professor Willerslev , 38 , and his team grabbed international attention last year when they reconstructed the complete mitochondrial genomes of a woolly mammoth and an ancient human .
However , the current discovery is the first time scientists have been able to reconstruct the 80 % of the nuclear genome that is possible to retrieve from fossil remains .
From the genomic sequences , the team has managed to construct a picture of a male individual who lived in Greenland 4,000 years ago and belonged to the first culture to settle in the New World Arctic .
The discovery was made by analysing a tuft of hair that belonged to a man from the Saqqaq culture from north - western Greenland 4,000 years ago .
The scientists have named the ancient human " Inuk " , which means " man " or " human " in Greenlandic .
Although Inuk is more closely related to contemporary north - eastern Siberian tribes than to modern Inuits of the present day New World Arctic , the scientists wants to acknowledge that the discovery was made in Greenland .
Professor Willerslev discovered the existence of the hair tuft by coincidence after several unsuccessful attempts to find early human remains in Greenland
" I was speaking with the Director of the Natural History Museum in Denmark , Dr. Morten Meldgaard , when we started discussing the early peopling of the Arctic , " Willerslev recalls .
" Meldgaard who had participated in several excavations in Greenland told me about a large tuft of hair , which was found during an excavation in north - western Greenland in the 1980's and now stored at the National Museum in Denmark .
" After the Greenland National Museum and Archives granted permission , we analysed the hair for DNA using various techniques and found it to be from a human male .
For several months , we were uncertain as to whether our efforts would be fruitful .
However , through the hard work of a large international team , we finally managed to sequence the first complete genome of an extinct human . " , Willerslev says .
Willerslev adds : " It was crucial that a private person , Fredrik Paulsen , chairman of the medical company Ferring , became interested in the project and provided the necessary funding to run some pilot tests , and that The Lundbeck Foundation of Denmark , quickly followed up providing substantial economic support to complete the project " .
" It shows how crucial private funding is to basic science these days .
Without these private donors it would have taken us a lot longer to sequence the first ancient human genome " .
Blueprint of the ancient man
The reconstruction serves as blueprint that scientists can use to give a description of how the pre-historic Greenlander , Inuk , looked - including his tendency to baldness , dry earwax , brown eyes , dark skin , the blood type A+ , shovel - shaped front teeth , and that he was genetically adapted to cold temperatures , and to what extend he was predisposed to certain illnesses .
This is important as besides four small pieces of bone and hair , no human remains have been found of the first people that settled the New World Arctic .
Willerslev 's team can also reveal that Inuk 's ancestors crossed into the New World from north - eastern Siberia between 4,400 and 6,400 years ago in a migration wave that was independent of those of Native Americans and Inuit ancestors .
Thus , Inuk and his people left no dependence behind among contemporary indigenous people of the New World .
" Previous efforts to reconstruct the mammoth nuclear genome resulted in a sequence filled with gaps and errors due to DNA damage because the technology was in its infancy .
The genome of Inuk is comparable in quality to that of a modern human " , Willerslev tells and continues :
" Our findings can be of significant help to archaeologists and others as they seek to determine what happened to people from extinct cultures .
Doing so requires organic material - bones or hair kept as museum pieces or found at archaeological sites .
Previously , the DNA needed to have been frozen or buried in a layer of permafrost .
But with the new methods developed here at the Centre , that is not a premise anymore " .
Much of the hands - on work analysing and joining the DNA sequences and the chemical analyses of what little was left of the damaged genetic material together to form a complete profile of Inuk was done by Morten Rasmussen .
The work was carried out in close collaboration with other scientists at the University of Copenhagen and in China , where they have far more sequencing machines than in Denmark .
" Not so long ago , reconstructing an entire modern human genome took years , " Rasmussen says .
But the new methods and the abundance of sequencing machines allow us to do it in just a few months - and that includes the time - consuming task of analysing the results .
The interesting thing about compiling a human genome is that we can look at the genes to see traits like why Scandinavians are blonde , why some are predisposed to certain illnesses and why others more easily become addicted to alcohol or tobacco .
But the genome we 've reconstructed is no Frankenstein 's Monster ; it 's more like we 've got the blueprints for a house , but we do n't know how to build it . "
The results of the team 's research will be published in the leading British scientific journal Nature .

LATE one night in a Ginza bar , a veteran executive at Nissan recounted to your correspondent the early days of exporting to America , when his firm 's cars were known abroad as Datsuns .
Before being shipped , all export models went through additional inspections because the cost of fixing warranty claims so far from the factory and its supply chain would wipe out any profit made on them .
On the rare occasions they did break , the parts had to be shipped in from Japan .
One day , the story goes , a plane carrying a crate of such parts lost an engine over the Midwest and had to jettison its cargo to save weight .
On the ground below , a farmer noticed the debris falling from the sky .
“ Ah , ” he mumbled to himself , “ it 's raining Datsun cogs . ”

The point the Nissan man was making with this shaggy - dog story was that the quality of Japanese cars sold abroad was well above average while they were being shipped from factories in Japan and extra precautions taken to save on warranty claims .
At the time , this strategy made perfect sense .
Japanese carmakers saved a ton of money from not having to finance expensive inventories around the world .
Meanwhile , Honda , Toyota and Nissan ( the Datsun name was dropped in 1982 ) gained reputations , deservedly so , for quality and reliability .
Until Toyota 's recent fiasco , those brand values remained largely intact , despite Japanese carmakers relocating much of their capacity to factories overseas .
The modern view is that carmakers everywhere have learned the secrets of Japanese manufacturing and now build products of comparable quality .
That is debatable .
Price for price , Japanese manufacturers still manage to make their products more reliable than average .
At least , they did until recently .
But , in what might now be viewed as a straw in the wind , Toyota ( or , rather , its luxury Lexus brand ) was dethroned from the top spot in last year 's J.D. Power report on vehicle dependability .
J.D. Power and Associates , a market - research firm based in Westlake Village , California , issues this report on the American car market every year .
Lexus had topped it for the previous 14 .
In 2009 , though , Buick and Jaguar came joint top .
Toyota still did well overall .
Its vehicles earned nine awards for reliability in specific market segments .
No other marque , save Ford 's Lincoln division , which took two , won more than one such award .
But the balloon of invincibility had been punctured .
The person who began the process of inflating that balloon was , ironically , an American .
From 1950 onwards W. Edwards Deming , an expert on quality control , taught a generation of Japanese managers how to improve their products .
The lesson they took back to their factories was the overriding importance of statistical quality control ( SQC ) .
In industrial countries elsewhere , even in Deming 's own America , manufacturers were still relying on inspection and rejection of faulty parts — a horrendously wasteful process .
One of the main tools for SQC that Deming introduced to his Japanese disciples was the control chart , invented by Walter Shewhart at Bell Labs , the research arm of America 's former telephone monopoly , Bell System , in the 1920s .
Shewhart was among the first to recognise that data collected from observations of manufacturing processes rarely follow a simple Gaussian distribution ( bell curve ) in the way that natural phenomena like human height do .
Instead , each manufacturing process exhibits its own pattern of variation .
Some display a controlled variation inherent to the process itself .
Others display uncontrolled variation caused by something external to the process .
The distinction between the two patterns goes to the philosophical heart of probability theory .
Deming and his colleagues at Western Electric , the manufacturing arm of Bell System , coined the terms “ common cause ” for the former and “ special cause ” for the latter .
For quality purposes , any common cause of variations in manufacturing ( tool wear , say , or poor set - up ) can be predicted statistically from previous observations , and the process controlled accordingly .
Any special cause in variation is something that comes out of the blue from outside the process ( a power surge , perhaps , or an operator falling asleep ) and is beyond the scope of statistical forecasting .
The purpose of a control chart is to identify instances when variations in manufacturing are causing the specifications of a product to move above or below a mean value by more than a critical amount — say , three standard deviations .
The standard deviation is a measure of the spread of a statistical curve such as a bell curve around its mean .
The idea , then , is to define acceptable tolerances above and below this mean value , and design the manufacturing process to draw in the tails of the curve so that those tolerances are met a given fraction of the time .
If the tolerance limits are three standard deviations from the mean , and the curve is a true Gaussian distribution , then 99.7 % of production will within the zone of tolerance .
If that falls , it suggests something had gone wrong .
This way , any unpredictable special - cause effects can be spotted and corrected before doing too much harm .
Many refinements have been made to statistical control and the theory of quality assurance since Deming 's days — with acronyms like TQM , CMMI , MSA , QFD , FMEA and APQP , each with its own loyal band of adherents and eras of fashion .
One of the more successful has been the Six Sigma strategy for identifying and removing the causes of defects , pioneered by Motorola in the 1980s .
( Sigma is the Greek letter that mathematicians use to represent the standard deviation in equations . )
Today , Six Sigma is used by two - thirds of the firms in Fortune 's “ 500 ” list .
Processes that operate with Six Sigma quality ( in principle , within six standard deviations of a mean value ) over a short sampling period produce defect levels over the long term of less than 3.4 per million — providing , of course , a lot of other management practices are also in place .
When achieved , this translates into a production yield of 99.99966 % .
Six Sigma is said to have saved Motorola more than $ 17 billion over the years .
So , how did Toyota — a manufacturer that has made some of the most significant contributions to the science of quality assurance — manage to screw up so badly ?
It is not just the move offshore .
Though the firm has 52 overseas plants in 27 countries , the quality practices honed at its headquarters in Aichi prefecture can be packaged and transplanted to Mexico or Kentucky just as readily as to a Komatsu press shop .
Nor was it Toyota 's obsession with overtaking General Motors at any cost to become the world 's largest carmaker .
There is no evidence to suggest that increasing volume on modern production lines will lead inevitably to some loss of quality .
Instead , two recent trends , both software related , hint at the reason behind Toyota 's unexpected decline .
One is the shortening of product - development cycles generally in the car industry .
These are down from a typical four or five years to little more than 15 months , thanks to computer - aided design and manufacturing , and the virtual simulation of the resulting products .
To save money and time , Toyota has even dispensed on occasion with building test “ mules ” and other engineering prototypes .
The other trend is the wholesale replacement of mechanical components with electronic controls .
It started with ignition systems , then spread to air - conditioning , cruise - control , engine - management , throttle linkages , transmissions , and now the steering and braking systems .
Drive - by - wire is not cheap , but it reduces the number of components needed to do the job .
It also allows them to do extra things as well as to compensate for wear and changes in driving style and road conditions .
But software is not hardware , and software “ engineers ” , despite their appropriation of the name , are a different breed from the sort that bash metal .
Programming digital controllers is not one of Toyota 's core competences .
Even with the most diligent of testing , bugs will always find their way into software .
Right now , it seems Toyota is learning that lesson the hard way .

Moritz Bleibtreu and Martina Gedeck as Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof in the 2009 film , The Baader Meinhof Complex .
Jeffrey ’s posts and videos of the walkabout at the NATO nuclear weapon storage site in Belgium reminded me of a story with a much sharper edge that I retold in Better Safe than Sorry .
ACW readers can file this one , along with last week ’s account of the U.S. Navy ’s encounter with the Foxtrot - class B - 59 during the Cuban missile crisis , in the folder labeled “ how - did-we-manage -( so- far ) -to-avoid-an-epically - bad - headline ? ”
Politics were stretched to the breaking point in the late sixties and 1970s , when the culture wars took root in the United States , the Cultural Revolution crippled China , and disaffected middle class youth in West Germany gave terrorism a new face .
They were called the Baader - Meinhof Gang .
In January 1977 , gang members stormed a nuclear weapon storage facility in Giessen , West Germany .
They planned to penetrate the base ’s storage vaults by creating a diversion , blowing up a fuel tank outside the base perimeter .
But they misread the fuel tank gauge , believing the tank to be almost full , when it was almost empty .
Their shaped charge penetrated the tank above the fuel line , with no resulting special effects .
Gang members then managed to penetrate the base perimeter , but after an exchange of gunfire , they were stopped short of the nuclear weapons storage area .
The base commander , then an Army Captain , told me this story .
He later went on to become the Director of ACDA and helped jump start efforts to lock down dangerous weapons and materials in the former Soviet Union – Bill Burns .

It 's an established tenet of game development these days that you can add " RPG elements " to a game to bring extra depth and stickiness .
In fact , you could call it a cliche . " RPG elements " are a big part of what separated and elevatedfrom its predecessors in 1997 .
On the other hand , cinematic presentation is what attracted a huge number of gamers tothat same year -- gamers who would never have dreamed of playing an RPG otherwise .
But when you startRPG elements from a game that people think of as an RPG , what doesget you ?
That 's the question thatraises , and is likely to be why it 's one of the most polarizing games of 2010 when it 's released in the Western market .
There 's a perfect storm of circumstances .
The last game in the series , , was beloved by critics and fans but , for better or worse , is an evolutionary dead end -- it was made by a different team than , one unlikely to be reassembled .
Of course , this is the first current - generation entry into the series , and it 's arriving more than a little late .
And , perhaps most importantly , this is the first console generation where the PC RPG ideals of the West have really been allowed to flower -- role playing , freedom and nonlinearity have finally been brought to consoles . , even more so than its predecessors , does n't hold truck with any of that stuff .
The designers , instead , have applied control to every aspect of the experience .
Recently , I appeared on 1UP 's RPG podcast , Active Time Babble , to discuss just what an " RPG " is .
The consensus we arrived at is that the question does n't really matter , because all of the things it can , could , should , or will be are represented by different games .
Butca n't sidestep that question as easily as we did .
Several years ago , I had dinner with a group of developers -- guys with a PC background .
The subject ofcame up .
A developer said , truly bewildered , " I just do n't get those games . "
His bafflement puzzled me .
A longtime fan of the series , and a lifelong console gamer , I did n't think the appeal was that hard to understand .
The games are engrossing -- they have interesting and complicated stories and characters , are incredibly gorgeous , and have addictive gameplay systems .
Others , however , see a lack of freedom , style over substance , and , probably most critically , can locate no " role playing " in what 'san RPG , and back away confused and frustrated .
Square Enix releasedin Japan on December 17 , 2009 .
I 've played the game for a little over 10 hours so far -- at most a quarter of its critical - path game content -- and aside from simply taking my own pleasure in the experience , I 've been thinking a lot about what the developers are attempting .
The release has n't been met with universal adulation .
While Famitsu gave the game three 10/10s and a 9/10 ( for a total score of 39 / 40 , or one point from the top , and one point lower than ) , user reviews on Amazon.
co.jp -- quickly becoming the most popular way to know what real Japanese gamers think about a title -- are more split .
The game , as of this writing , has 1,392 user reviews and an aggregate score of three out of five stars .
The spread is almost even -- 353 are five star reviews , 259 are one star reviews , and four , three , and two number 283 , 229 , and 268 respectively .
The series has always been more highly variable than others , I 'd argue .
Long before Infinity Ward and Treyarch traded off development duties betweentitles , Square was forced to take the same approach . ( SNES , 1991 ) introduced the Active Time Battle realtime / turn - based hybrid battle system -- and shifted the series ' focus to character - based melodrama , just as importantly .
But ( SNES , 1992 ) toned down the story and focused on the meaty gameplay of the class - switching Job System . ( PlayStation , 1999 ) featured the bizarre Junction system and unparalleled concentration on time - shifting melodrama .
But ( PlayStation , 2000 ) was a fanboy - baiting throwback to older days .
I 've been a fan of the series for years , but I 've skipped out on entire entries ; I count some as my favorite games of all time while actively disliking others .
Other fans feel the exact opposite way about the games I hate and venerate .
This time , however , who thinks they care is going to have their eyes onbecause of the circumstances of its release .
So what did the developers put together this time ?
The design ofis already gaining notoriety on the net -- something it deserves .
Kotaku posted a story that got some attention shortly after the game was released .
Entitled " Just How Straight Are FFXIII 's First Five ~Six Hours ? " , it was a report on a Japanese blog which put together a map of the first few hours of the game , showing that it was more or less a literal , straight path to walk down .
The internet may not actually be a series of tubes , butmight as well be .
What is ?
Let 's really think about this .
When people talk about the series they generally talk about characters -- say , Cloud and Sephiroth ( ) .
They talk about story events -- say , going on the summoner 's journey with Yuna to expunge Sin from Spira ( ) .
They talk about the battle and character growth systems -- Gambits ( ) , the Sphere Grid ( ) , and Materia (. )
And they talk about the beautiful visuals -- memorable locations like Midgar ( ) , the summoned monsters ( all the games since ) , and of course the state - of - the - art cutscenes .
After having playedfor over 10 hours , I think the developers sat down and made some very deliberate decisions about what the series is , and what it is not , and is not going to be -- and honed in directly on their , and the series ' , strengths .
The result is a highly linear , paced , and controlled experience that is very enjoyable but is another step forward from the series ' top - down , 2D heritage , and also finally and fully jettisons the " role playing " implied by the acronym RPG .
Unsurprisingly , then , hews to the strengths of the series I identified above .
The characters look great , are well - defined , and empathetic .
Each seems to slot into both a story function while being carefully designed to appeal to a specific segment of the audience .
For example , cynical , older players can identify with quippy Sazh , while younger , more naive players will probably latch onto Vanille , who narrates the game 's story with gentle foreboding .
The game plays them as foils .
Of particular note , I think , is the relationship between Snow and Lightning via the vector of Sera , who 's the former 's fiance and the latter 's sister .
This creates obvious and understandable tension and adds humanity to a fantastical story of a theocratic techno-utopia and missions ( and curses ) handed down by strange gods .
While it 's a little hard to understand some of the concepts in astory at first blush , the way the characters react sells it -- this is where many games stumble .
The story is paced a lot more deliberately than pretty much every RPG I 've played , sharing more with action games -- a gate - and - trigger system , with tripwires for events and set enemy placement .
This time around , story is delivered in - line as you explore , both through spoken asides ( which do n't interrupt your exploration ) and through lots of short cutscenes .
In fact , the dungeon / boss / cutscene paradigm has been shattered into bits ; regular battles are tougher , more engaging , and less frequent -- though there are still bosses -- and cutscenes come much more frequently but are typically much shorter than in the past , spreading out the three core concepts behind thegameplay more evenly .
This is a nuance worth stopping and exploring : it seems designed to address gamer complaints about cutscene length , but still deliver the level of storyis known for .
It 's a subtle change but a shrewd one .
The battle system has also very much been pushed into a new shape -- to address the " just push X " criticisms the series has fielded for years , I think , and the result is very engaging .
If you ever stop and think about it , you inevitably realize , while playing an RPG , that the gameplay is repetitive and you 're just following a ruleset .
To stop you from having time to think about that , the developers have ratcheted the combat speed way up .
Things fall into a kind of call - and - response ; rather than formulate a strategy for each encounter , you 've got an overarching strategy you 're always pursuing ( force the enemies into a " break " status , where they become more vulnerable to attacks ) while dealing with what 's happening from moment to moment .
Character growth and class systems feed into this -- you shift your entire party build on the fly by pushing the L1 button , a " Paradigm Shift " which changes the entire party 's classes at once -- the Job System on speed .
Managing growth outside of battle , of course , is slow , and is saved for when you have time to breathe .
And of course , visuals play a huge role .
I think in some ways , enjoying the art direction foris pretty much requisite to being a fan of the series ( I 'd be interested to hear if others agree . )
The environments are both more gorgeous and wantonly unrealistic than they have ever been .
That 's all great -- it 's worth pointing out , but the series ' strengths being represented is exactly what we expect from sequels .
The more interesting question , when it comes tois , what does n't it do , and why not ?
There areof things the game does n't do -- and while these are rather deliberately chosen , weighing how important they are to the core experience is what counts in an analysis .
Most notably , does not have towns .
These have long been an accepted reality of the RPG .
Every prior game in the series has had them .
As of 10 hours , I have not seen one .
The game is a series of dungeons interlinked by transitional cutscenes -- for example , your party will reach the end of a dungeon , discover an aircraft , steal it , and then crash it and continue on foot .
The only respite is the story .
Save points handle shopping and equipment upgrades .
My question is : do I miss them ?
As a JRPG veteran , the answer is a surprising , I think .
It 's a move I anticipated after playing the streamlinedon the PSP , though I did expect a hub ( and I think it 's forthcoming . )
Towns have been a huge weakness of the genre ; while they helped with pacing , they were also deadly dull to explore , particularly as games scaled up .
Creating the assets for a town believable in the context of a current generation cast of characters is not a small undertaking .
I 'm sure that had a lot to do with the fact they 're not here .
But just as importantly , I 'm thinking towns were jettisoned because they get in the way of the designers ' control of the narrative and pace of the game : and their removal is a symbolic lifting of the curtain .
is surprisingly open about its control of the player 's experience .
This goes pretty much against the grain of conventional wisdom : player agency is reduced in favor of enhancing the game 's story .
At some point there was a very large decision made by the team .
It is this : finely controlling player progression -- given a consistent walking speed , linear dungeons , and average battle length -- will provide a more cinematic and seamlessly story - driven game , and a more accessible one .
With dungeons lengthened , towns removed , and cutscenes scattered throughout the game rather than clumped up , suddenly you 've got a smooth and consistent experience -- have I mentioned how polished this game is yet ?
But what has been traded is agency , and that 's a faux pas in many current schools of thought for game design ( though , notably , theseries is big on controlling the player , so it 's hardly a one - sided argument . )
The game also slowly and deliberately introduces new gameplay mechanics over its first several hours .
The limiting factor in most RPGs , when it comes to gameplay , is the leveling system : you have highly basic versions of the sorts of abilities you 'll have access to by the end of the game .
In , you can't even earn experience points for the first two or three hours , because the leveling system has yet to be introduced .
While thatawful , I know that I liked playing a game that gradually introduced new gameplay concepts over its first several hours for several reasons .
The dreaded infodump tutorial was completely avoided .
Instead , I retained the information that I learned gradually , and I felt like I was learning something new fairly often -- and I think learning is a strong motivator to keep playing games , even if the info is only useful within the context of the game itself .
The thing is , you neversomething new in the game .
You 're handed it at the point the developers think you 're ready .
It 's pretty transparent .
Would it be better if there was something -- maybe a point system -- covering that up ?
All designers decide when content is appropriate for players .
Sometimes the games just bludgeon you to death ( if you stumble on a dungeon that you 're not ready for ) .
Sometimes content is locked behind broken bridges that coincidentally get repaired by the king when you 've run out of quests in the town you 're visiting .
And sometimes , in , a text box will pop up when you cross an invisible line and tell you : it 's time for something new .
But when the developers yank members in and out of your party based on the story 's needs -- logical in a cinematic context , frustrating from a gameplay one -- this designer control may be too fine .
This is n't a new move for JRPGs ( characters leave and join all the time in other games ) butfound ways to play with my patience .
The gamer must , in the end , get with the program : give up that agency .
The reward is enjoying the experience .
The level of control the developers exert over the player is transparent to anyone who 's paying attention .
The question is whether this fine level of control is at odds with the game 's core mission , or its enjoyability .
For some -- maybe many , possibly most -- the answer is " yes " .
I 'm pretty sure that a big reason the developers structured the game this way is because the team is well aware that gamers who have n't touched the series in a long time will be back for this installment , and that new gamers who had n't considered it before will be sucked in by the hype .
does n't assume genre literacy .
But for fans , it can be surprising -- and not always pleasant .
It 's worth noting , again , that these impressions are birthed from just 10 hours of play .
Everyinevitably reaches what I call " the breaking point " -- the juncture at which the game goes nonlinear and allows you to take it how you like it .
Exactly when this happens varies wildly depending on which game in the series you 're talking about .
When it happens incould go a long way toward mitigating the control thing .
On the other hand , developers all know most gamers do n't finish the games they buy .
Will 's early design be a fatal turnoff , or a slick romp ?
There 's a gamble the developers continuously make with this series , and which backs away from something I think is becoming fairly well accepted in Western design : shy away from artifice .is a tower of artifice .
It 's a monument to polish , and maybe a bit to hubris .
On the other hand , each game released , in any series , defines its own genre as much as the genre defines .
Ifis judged to not be RPG , it can be , instead , an SCS -- strolling , combat , and story .
My experience so far with it compels me to start all over again with the U.S. version in March ; it also gives me respect for a team that has an eye toward addressing common complaints with the genre , the game 's predecessors , and expanding its audience .
The story is less chunky .
The gameplay is better integrated and balanced further toward speed and interaction .
The years of development delays were n't just the kinks of working out new technologies ; there 's a tremendous level of polish ( near - flawless partner AI , for one notable example ) on display .
But gearing an RPG toward simplicity and speed to some extent spits in the face of a genre more known for slow - paced complexity , and that is wherewill find its test .
" My daughter should be exposed to the religions of both my wife and myself and appreciate them for what they are , " he said .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
Our ever - expanding waistlines may have outgrown the doctor ’s needle , researchers say , in what could be another casualty of the obesity epidemic .
A medical assistant injects a vaccine in a file photo .

In a new study , the researchers report that using a standard 1 - inch needle to immunize obese adolescents against hepatitis B virus produced a much weaker effect than using a longer needle .
“ As obesity rises in the US , we need to be aware that the standard of care may have to change to protect obese youth , ” study co-author Dr. Amy Middleman of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston told Reuters Health .
Over three years her team vaccinated 22 young women and two young men in the shoulder , randomly assigning them to be injected with either a 1 - inch or a 1.5 - inch needle .
Once injected , vaccines trigger production of small molecules called antibodies , which kick - start our immune system if we are ever attacked by the virus again .
The two groups turned out to have different antibody counts depending on the needle used .
In those injected with the short one , the number was almost halved .
Although everyone in the study had enough antibodies to be considered protected against hepatitis B , a lower count generally means a less robust response .
“ It gives us more evidence of the importance of choosing the right needle length , ” said Middleman , “ because we just do n’t know what the impact could be in other vaccines . ”
The results are no surprise , said Dr. Gregory Poland , who studies vaccines at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota .
For years , doctors have known that vaccines tend not to work as well in heavy people .
Whether the obese have weaker immune systems , or fat keeps shorter needles from reaching muscles , where the vaccines can affect immune cells , was unclear .
The introduction of the hepatitis B vaccine in the 1980s offered some clues .
Soon after doctors began using the vaccine , they realized that it was failing to protect some female nurses .
At the time , the shot was given in the buttock , Poland told Reuters Health , and was thwarted by the padding there .
Instead of entering the muscle as it was supposed to , the vaccine apparently was broken down in the fat tissue , where it had little chance to affect immune cells .
So doctors began giving the shot in the less - padded shoulder .
With the obesity epidemic now adding extra insulation to the shoulder , “ our needles are going to have to be longer , ” Poland said .
And those long needles are n’t as unpleasant as they sound .
In fact , Poland said , “ they turn out to be less painful and have fewer side effects . ”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends longer needles in obese patients , but it is unclear how many doctors follow these guidelines , or even know about them .
Women are more affected by needle length than men , because their fat distribution is different .
But even obese women should n’t be overly concerned until more research has been done , Middleman cautioned .
“ Should you go back and get all your immunizations repeated ? ” she said , “ No , I do n’t think so . ”

A Beer for Stronger Bones ?
This Study 's Not For You Health experts remain skeptical of a link between the drink and stronger bones .
Feb. 8 , 2010  --
For beer drinkers , a new study that suggests beer is a significant source of a mineral key to maintaining bone density may sound too good to be true .
That may well be , say health experts who overwhelmingly agree the the connection may be more wishful thinking than solid science .
But that may not stop many brew lovers from viewing the new research as an excuse to order another round .
The study of 100 commercial beers in the February issue of the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture by Charles Bamforth and Troy Casey of the University of California Davis examined the silicon content that results from different ingredients and brewing processes .
" Silicon impacts bone mineral density in humans , and supplementing silicon in the diets of osteoporitic women increased bone mineral density , " the authors wrote .
Thus , they surmise , silicon - rich beer may also help to strengthen bones .
Although a press release issued with the study prominently mentioned the link between silicon and bone health , the study itself did not look at bone mineral density or analyze any patient data , according to several researchers contacted by MedPage Today and ABC News .
Also , bananas and some grains have high levels of silicon , but for many , beer appears to be the richest source .
The authors wrote that they explored the silicon content in beer because the popular beverage has been identified as one of the richest potential sources of dietary silicon in the Western diet .
The average intake is 20 to 50 mg / day .
The beers sampled contained an average of 29.4 mg / L of silicon .
Beers made from a barley - based grist , as opposed to wheat - based beers , and brews containing more hops had the highest silicon levels .
The beer type with the overall highest silicon level was India Pale Ale , with an average of 41.2 mg / L.
Other ales came in second with 32.8 mg/L .
Nonalcoholic beers , light lagers , and wheat beers had the least silicon .
In the study , the authors concluded that " beer is a substantial source of silicon in the diet " and that " beers containing high levels of malted barley and hops are richest in silicon , " but they did not attempt to establish a link between beer drinking and bone health .
Experts contacted for comment on the study also cautioned the public against establishing any such connection .
" To conclude any bone health benefits from this study would require a great leap , " said Dr. Tim Byers , deputy director of the University of Colorado Cancer Center in Aurora .
Drink to Your Health ?
Not So Fast
Still , it is not the first piece of research to link beer consumption with positive health effects .
Last March , a separate study out of Tufts University in Boston suggested that among older men , those who enjoyed one or two glasses of beer a day , seemed to have stronger bones than their non-drinking counterparts -- although heavy drinking seemed to lead to weaker bones .
In December , a team of German researchers suggested that an ingredient in beer may help men ward off prostate cancer .
Previously , a 2004 cross-sectional study in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research found a significant association between greater dietary silicon intake , including that from beer , and higher bone mineral density in the hip in men and premenopausal women .
The researchers concluded : " These findings suggest that higher dietary silicon intake in men and younger women may have salutary effects on skeletal health , especially cortical bone health , that have not been previously recognized . "
Another study by the same group published last year in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that moderate consumption of alcohol , including beer , wine , and liquor , was associated with higher bone mineral density in men and postmenopausal women .
But balance these studies against the weight of research suggesting that too much alcohol consumption can lead to a host of negative health effects – including liver disease and some types of cancer – and it is easy to see why the findings of these studies are so counterintuitive .
In fact , Dr. Walter Willett , chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard University School of Public Health in Boston , said not only that " There is presently no evidence that drinking any form of alcoholic beverage leads to stronger bones , " but he also said that research by he and his colleagues " has shown that alcohol consumption increases risk of fracture , probably by increasing the risk of falls . "
And Dr. Stephen Richardson , an endocrinologist at New York University 's Langone Medical Center , noted that " alcohol consumption is a risk factor for osteoporosis .
" I would not tell people to drink more beer . "
Beer No Bone Saver , Experts Say
So considering the increased fracture risk and the various other problems associated with drinking too much alcohol , experts agree that guzzling beer is not strategy for improving bone health .
" In the absence of bone density values or preferably fracture incidence , it would be premature to tout beer as a preventative or treatment , " Richardson said .
Dr. David Katz , director and co-founder of the Yale Prevention Research Center in New Haven , Conn. , agreed .
" This is not a reason to drink beer , " he said .
" This is simply a bit of good news for those who do drink beer already -- yours truly among them . "
So how did this God gene flourish ?
Wade ’s counterintuitive answer repurposes an old social - scientific analysis of religion as a saga of biological survival .
Rituals take time ; sacrifices take money or its equivalent .
Individuals willing to lavish time and money on a particular group signal their commitment to it , and a high level of commitment makes each coreligionist less loath to ignore short - term self - interest and to act for the benefit of the whole .
What are gods for ?
They ’re the enforcers .
Supernatural beings scare away cheaters and freeloaders and cow everyone into loyal , unselfish , dutiful and , when appropriate , warlike behavior .

Wade walks us briskly through the history of religion to show how our innate piety has adapted to our changing needs .
Hunter - gatherers were egalitarian and , shamans aside , had direct access to the divine .
But when humans began to farm and to settle in cities and states , religion became hierarchical .
Priests emerged , turning unwritten rules and chummy gods into opaque instruments of surveillance and power .
Church bureaucracies created crucial social institutions but also suppressed the more ecstatic aspects of worship , especially music , dance and trance .
Wade advances the delightfully explosive thesis that the periodic rise of exuberant mystery cults represent human nature rebelling against the institutionalization of worship : “ A propensity to follow the ecstatic behaviors of dance and trance was built into people ’s minds and provided consistently fertile ground for revolts against established religion , ” he writes .
There ’s a safari - hatted charm to Wade ’s descriptions of what he calls , a little jarringly , “ primitive ” religion , filled with details of the rites of tribes cut off from the modern world but still available for anthropological observation .
But his ­sketches of Judaism , Christianity and Islam rush by quickly and confusingly and offer only superficial accounts of the spread of those faiths , which was in each case a dicier process than Wade makes it sound .
( What if Constantine had held out against the Roman Empire ’s Christian factions , instead of converting ? )
Judaism ’s strict moral codes , he argues , held together the rival states of Israel and Judah in Biblical times and provided comfort to Jews in exile , but failed to accommodate the more diverse Jews of the first - century Hellenic world .
Early Christians adapted Judaism ’s attractive but exclusivist mores to a society that had outgrown tribalism , succeeding “ so well that they captured an empire and defined a civilization . ”
Wade embraces a radically revisionist approach to Islam , which holds that it evolved out of a Syriac branch of Christianity whose members believed that Jesus was human and rejected the Trinity .
This sternly monotheistic remnant was Arabized when a new dynasty needed to differentiate itself from a previous one .
If the revisionist version of Islam is correct , Wade writes , it “ furnishes a case study of how a religion can be adapted with great success to a state ’s purposes . ”
Wade would probably deny that being adaptive makes any religion better in a non-evolutionary sense than any other .
His scientist ’s neutrality slips toward the end of the book , however , when he starts making the case for Religion with a capital R. Like Robert Wright in “ The Evolution of God , ” Wade wants to defend religion from so - called “ new atheists ” like Richard Dawkins , Daniel Dennett and Christopher Hitchens , who see it as a malignant illusion .
In chapters on religion and trade , religion and warfare , religion and nation , and the “ ecology ” of religion — the way in which religion regulates fertility and population size —
Wade argues that our religious disposition can enhance social and national unity , manage scarce resources , even solve the tricky problem of how to get young men to die for the greater good when that ’s called for .
But Wade also knows that the faith - based preference for the group has engendered genocide , mass suicide and maladaptive cargo cults .
Perhaps that is why he declines to draw one inference that proceeds from his arguments : that individual religions can be compared and ranked and , well , approved or disapproved of , since a religion can be good only insofar as it ’s useful .
In any case , Wade says , religion is not going away , because it ’s imprinted on the human genome .
The first part of this claim is hard to argue with .
The second part is probably true , too , but raises the question of how .
Wade ’s vision of religion as a socializing force is persuasive , but he does not do enough to distinguish socially efficacious religious beliefs from , say , socially efficacious political ideologies .
There are biologically or at least neurologically grounded accounts of religion , like Boyer ’s , that more successfully capture the weird particularity of religious experience while also revealing its tentacles in many other facets of mental and emotional life .
Ask yourself :
Why are our gods always equipped with recognizably human minds , even when they ’re animals ?
How do sacred stories differ , if they do , from fairy tales , or from novels ?
What are holiness , impurity and ritual , exactly , and are they religious in essence , or categories implicated in everything we think and do ?
A majority of Americans continue to oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally .
Just over half ( 53 % ) oppose same - sex marriage , while 39 % support it .
The issue cuts along demographic , political and religious lines .
Older Americans are far less supportive than young people ( a 58 % - majority of those ages 18 - 29 support gay marriage ) .
Blacks are less supportive than are whites and Hispanics .
Women are more supportive than men .
Those with college education are more supportive than those without .
Southerners and Midwesterners are more likely to oppose same - sex marriage than are those in the East and West .
But religion and politics provide the starkest differences .
While 72 % of liberal Democrats support same - sex marriage , an equally overwhelming 81 % of conservative Republicans oppose it .
And while a majority of those who never or seldom attend religious services are pro gay marriage ( 54 % ) , less than a quarter of those that attend regularly ( 22 % ) support it .

Focus on the Family 's 30 - second Super Bowl spot has n't been released but is known to feature 2007 Heisman Trophy - winning University of Florida QB Tim Tebow expressing thanks that his mother chose not to abort him -- a private family decision that you 'd like to think would n't be anybody else 's business , not to mention irrelevant to the agonizing decision other women face .
CBS can't understand why anyone 's upset that the network has broken the long - standing ban on Super Bowl advocacy ads for this .
-- from Credo Action 's campaign to persuade CBS to reject
Focus on the Family 's pro-choice Super Bowl commercial
CBS : Do n't air anti-abortion Super Bowl ad
The broadcast networks that air the Super Bowl have historically rejected advocacy ads .
Yet CBS , which is airing the Super Bowl this year , has accepted an anti-choice ad by the ultra - conservative group Focus on the Family .
Focus on the Family 's " celebrate life " ( read : anti-choice ) ad features Heisman Trophy - winning college football star Tim Tebow .
And CBS approved this anti-choice ad , even though the network has repeatedly rejected advocacy ads in past years including a 2004 MoveOn.org ad that went after then - President Bush 's fiscal irresponsibility and an ad the same year from the United Church of Christ showing them welcoming a gay couple who had been turned away from another church .
Sign the petition to CBS insisting they follow their no-advocacy policy and reject the Focus on the Family ad before the Super Bowl on February 7 .
More recently , on Friday CBS rejected an ad from a gay dating site showing two men discovering a mutual attraction when their hands brush in the potato chip bowl .
The actors then pantomime a comical make - out session .
But CBS says the ad " is not within the Network 's broadcast standards for Super Bowl Sunday . "
So to recap : CBS would n't allow a group to criticize Bush , would n't let a religious group promote its own tolerance of LGBT families and considers a light - hearted dating ad out of bounds .
But CBS is perfectly happy to allow Focus on the Family to promote its conservative social agenda .
We must call CBS out on its hypocrisy and demand that it also reject the Focus on the Family ad .
The Super Bowl is America 's annual most - watched television event ; more than 98 million Americans tuned in last year .
And as anyone who 's ever been to a Super Bowl party knows , the ads can be even more closely watched than the game , which is why CBS must not unfairly allow anti-choice commercials while rejecting those for other causes .
Sign the petition today urging CBS to follow its own anti-advocacy policy , reverse the decision , and deny Focus on the Family 's anti-choice ad .
(1) It takes literally no thought to discriminate against people or ideas that are outside the box of orthodoxy .
When you discriminate reflexively against groups or classes of people other than your own , or against ideas that are different from your own , just because you do n't have to think about it does n't make it not discrimination .
After all , that 's the level on which most discrimination and bigotry occurs .
People do n't stop to think , " If I prefer not to offer this person a job , or allow him / her to rent an apartment , or patronize my business establishment , or date my daughter , because of the person 's skin color or religion or sexual orientation or political beliefs , that would be bigoted , but dang it all , I 'm going to do it anyways . "
Well , maybe sometimes they do , but by and large that 's now the way discrimination and bigotry are accomplished .
If your words or actions are discriminatory or bigoted , it does n't matter whether you planned it that way ; it does n't matter whether you thought about it for weeks or did n't give it a moment 's thought -- it 's still discriminatory or bigoted .
This seems so blindingly obvious that I 'm almost embarrassed to have to point it out , but an awful lot of people either have forgotten it or never knew it .
When , for example , you discriminate on the basis of , say , race , your action really and truly does n't have to be accompanied by a sworn affidavit saying , " I sure as s --t hates me them effin ' N - words , " to qualify as discrimination .
(2) There 's hardly any price to pay for causing offense to non-orthodox people or ideas , while causing offense to orthodox people or ideas can bring you worlds of unwanted attention and even economic distress .
And the defenders of orthodoxy work very hard to make sure that this is as true as they can make it .
When the people in charge of accepting or rejecting TV advertising , for example , reject content that will offend only people they see as " dirty fucking hippie " types while accepting content that will offend people who are known to organize dangerously loud and disruptive countermeasures or to actually jeopardize their revenue streams by pressuring customers or advertisers or the like , it 's understandable but not OK , ethically or ( one hopes ) legally .
Today 's defenders of discrimination and bigotry have become sophisticated enough to claim that they 're just protecting everyone 's First Amendment rights .
But of course usually that 's exactly what they 're not doing .
They 're " protecting the rights " of people and ideas they either agree with or are afraid of , while cavalierly dismissing protections for people and ideas they do n't agree with or fear .
The whole point of the First Amendment is to protect unpopular or non-mainstream ideas .
Orthodox ideas do n't often need protection .

Poor CBS .
The Super Bowl , now just a week away , is supposed to be nothing but a cash - generating bonanza .
As the commercial rates go up and up , even in a crappy economy there seems to be no difficulty selling all that time .
But when there 's so much money on the table , you can be sure there are going to be problems .
As you 've surely heard , CBS has gotten its balls caught in a bad squeeze over the issue of advertising acceptance and what is or is n't " within the Network 's broadcast standards for Super Bowl Sunday , " by breaking its own -- and every other network's -- long - standing rule against advocacy advertising on the Super Bowl .
What really alarms me here is that we now seem to have enshrined a double standard for " acceptability " at both the corporate and the judicial level :
What 's " acceptable " in advertising or other decisions involving competing claims for respect is
In case after case , such decisions , whether made by corporations or courts , seem based on the premise that there 's one segment of the American public whose rights , not to mention feelings and beliefs , can be trampled on with utter impunity , with hardly even a second though , while there 's another segment of the American public whose delicate sensibilities must always be protected .
It seems to underlie court decisions as to whose privacy must be protected when it comes to making public personal information about issue - campaign donors .
( The privacy rights of crusading bigots get a whole lot of respect , while the efforts of people to secure equal treatment under the law are sneered at . )
Or again , the Supreme Court 's ( predictably 5 - 4 ) decision struck down Judge Vaughn Walker 's plan to experiment , as permitted by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , with limited video coverage of the trial of the constitutionality of Prop 8 seems to have come down to the need to protect the privacy of God-fearing American bigots who would be taking the stand to defend continued legal institutionalization of their bigotry .
Apparently they 're willing to testify , but they 're afraid of beingdoing so , and once again the delicate sensibilities of safely - in - the - box bigots trumps all other public interests .
Whether its private citizens like the CBS censors or legal hoodlums like the Supreme Court majority , there seem to me to be two processes at work , and they 're both hateful and unacceptable .
As I said , both of these thought processes seem to me repugnant to any concept of fairness and / or decency , and as far as I can see , neither has any foundation or even measure of acceptability in law .
They need to be stopped .

I cant actually remember this story exactly but just take it at what it says in the bible ( dont have enough time to look at it either - gotta go to sleep )
But what i do know is ;
1 - To the atheist , yes we believe this story , you will too when youre standing before the Almighty Lord and Savior Yahweh .
Every knee will bow and EVERY tongue confess .
2 - Look up on google the ' real life jonah ' , I read a story of a man who was trapped in a whale !
He was badly burnt and permanently blinded from the acid in its stomach but he survived .

This graph shows the office vacancy rate starting 1991 .
Reis is reporting the vacancy rate rose to 17.0 % in Q4 , from 16.6 % in Q3 and from 14.5 % in Q4 2008 .
The peak following the previous recession was 16.9 % .
From Reuters :
At 17 pct , US office vacancy rate hits 15 - year high
During the fourth quarter the national office vacancy rate climbed 0.40 percentage point from the third quarter to 17 percent , the highest level since 1994 .
...
During the fourth quarter , asking rent fell 1.1 percent ... effective rent , dropped 1.9 percent ...
For the year , effective rent fell 8.9 percent , the largest one - year decline since Reis began tracking it in 1980 .
" Never before have landlords been under so much pressure to offer concessions to attract and retain tenants , " Calanog said .
" Asking rents have fallen at a lower rate , but this just implies further room to fall down the road if conditions do not improve soon . "
The vacancy rate is n't a record , but there was a record decline in effective rents .
Add that to the records announced earlier this week ...
Not to brag or anything , but I probably pay less for my dried herbs & spices than you do .
I can fill my spice cabinet for about $ 10 .
I ’m so excited about this post . . .
I ’ve been working on it for weeks and the necessary research included grocery shopping , an impromptu Twitter survey and a * spreadsheet * , and I am a bitch easily excited by things that can only be figured out on a spreadsheet .
So here goes : Aleta ’s Guide to Buying Dried Herbs & Spices on the Cheap .
And right up front , I promise the pictures get better as you read along .
When you buy spices & dried herbs at the right places , they go from “ pretty expensive and at times cost - prohibitive ” to “ practically free . ”
Buying cheap spicery brings with it several very important benefits .
Here ’s a convenient bullet - pointed list of those benefits .
The sudden affordability of grabbing something you have n’t tried ; if you do n’t like it , eh . . . it was 43 cents to learn that .
The ability to replace your seasonings as frequently as you ’re supposed to — 6 months for dried herbs , 1 year for ground spices .
I replace all mine every three months ( mostly because I only buy 3 months ’ worth at a time ) for about $ 4 .
And yes , the improvement in taste from fresh spices to the dusty shit in the back of your cabinet is immediately discernible .
Hey , suddenly organic food is cheaper than conventional , how about that .
Obtaining affordable spicery is every bit as simple as locating an organic / health food store or co-op in your area — my personal H&S - supplier is Worcester ’s own ARTichoke Food Co-Operative .
ARTichoke is a really great part of Worcester ’s community , and just being in the store makes me contentedly smile to myself the entire time .
As a frame of reference , I ’m a complete bitch at all other times , so that really means something .
Also , they were so very accommodating with my request to take photos , and that ’s pretty cool of them .
So if you live in the Metrowest area , please give ARTichoke your business , and consider becoming a member .
Now pretend you ’re me : at your local co-op grinning like an idiot , you wander to the back to see if they have what I affectionately call “ the world ’s biggest spice rack . ”
. . . and chances are , they do .
Yes , regardless of size , they ’re all “ World ’s Biggest ” as far as I ’m concerned .
You ’ll see a nice variety of spices in bulk , many or all of them organic , still a total steal compared to the grocery store ( we ’ll get to hard numbers in just a minute ) .
The only concern you should have here is how frequently the containers are rotated , and if you ’re too shy to ask , figure that the more traffic the store gets , the fresher their spices will be .
Most of the prices are between $ 10 and $ 20 a pound .
This sounds like an awful lot to pay for spices , but you are buying fractions of an ounce , so it ’s a pretty good deal .
For example , that ’s three months ’ worth of oregano ( for me ) for about 29 cents .
So I loaded up on the stuff I use the most for about $ 3.15 .
I never throw any away , because I never have to — I buy just the amount I think I ’ll use , and then I throw in something I ’ve never tried just for fun ( this time it was chicory ) , and I rotate every 3 months .
So let ’s say you are just moving out of your dorm and setting up your first apartment and you want to fill your spice rack .
How much does that cost , and how much can you save by buying the same amounts at the co-op ?
WELL I AM GLAD YOU ASKED , I HAPPEN TO HAVE A SPREADSHEET HANDY .
These are prices at my local Stop & Shop compared to prices at ARTichoke Food Co-op .
( Please note that you do not * need * to buy a full jar ’s worth , so your price can easily be under $ 4 for the top ten there ) .
So for a more established cook like myself , where I already have a bunch of herbs & spices in stock and only really need to replace them one at a time every now and again , the cost savings is n’t quite what it would be for our hypothetical college student ( I figure it ’s about $ 70 a year for me instead of about $ 26 up front for a new homesteader ) .
But my biggest advantage is being able to afford to replace my H&S extremely frequently .
And also , my spices are organic , thrusting my taste in agriculture into the realm of the most gastronomically elite .
Incidentally , ethnic markets are another great place to buy H&S .
My local ethnic store of choice is an Indian market , so while they have a wide array of spices , they really do n’t have any dried herbs at all .
But if the co-op is out of something , or I think I ’m gonna need A LOT of it ( like , 5 times as much as comes in the typical bottle at the grocery store ) , or if you do n’t have a co-op or organic bulk store near you , this is another option .
Even though , pound for pound , the Indian bulk prices are even WAY lower than the co-op prices , this approach does n’t look like it ’s saving you all that much money .
The reason is you ca n’t buy less than a pouch of any of these , and 7 oz is A LOT ( notice how the average oz in the grocery store is about 1.5 oz ) .
Strange , though , how even buying 7 times as much of something is still cheaper .
Here comes another spreadsheet .
Fun fact :
If you compared the amount you would have to buy at the grocery store to the amount you get at the Indian store , you will save ( literally , I calculated it and everything ) $ 135.31 for the top 10 and $ 483.22 for all 20 .
I ’m not even kidding .
So that ’s my big secret !
I have a littler one , and it ’s how to fill the glass bottles ( the ones you obviously saved from the grocery store herbs and spices ) with the co-op feed without using a funnel .
I actually figured this out just the other night as I was taking pictures for this post , so I ’m feeling awfully clever at the moment .
But it ’s so simple , it does n’t even require words :
And that ’s it !
Throw some scotch tape on there , write the name of the spices with a Sharpie ( I still ca n’t tell cayenne from paprika without a risky sniff test ) , and you are fully - equipped to throw in cavalier handfuls of seasoning into your next spaghetti sauce .
Congratulations , you are finally free of the economic oppression placed upon you by your local grocery store !
I already asked Twitter , but if you are n’t on Twitter or feel like stating it again for perpetuity , what are your top ten most - used herbs and spices ?
And , if I can manage it , look for a bonus post tomorrow on something you can do with all your fancy new ( suddenly inexpensive ) herbs and spices .
Cheers , dear readers !
Forget it , maybe another time .
India 401 for 3 ( Tendulkar 200 * , Karthik 79 , Dhoni 68 * ) beat South Africa 248 ( de Villiers 114 , Sreesanth 3 - 49 , Pathan 2- 37 ) by 153 runs
Scorecard and ball - by - ball details
How they were out
Hawkeye
MS Dhoni is happy as Sachin Tendulkar reaches 200 in the last over Associated Press
It took nearly 40 years of waiting and it was well worth it .
Sachin Tendulkar chose one of the better bowling attacks doing the rounds , to eclipse the record for the highest score , before bringing up the first double - hundred in ODI history .
The spectators at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium became the envy of cricket fans as they witnessed one of the country 's favourite sporting heroes play a breathtaking innings which not only set up a 153 - run annihilation but also the series victory .
He may have been run -out cheaply in the previous match , but nothing could deny him today - be it bowlers , fielders , mix - ups or cramps .
Dinesh Karthik , Yusuf Pathan and MS Dhoni stood by and admired as the master unfurled all the shots in his repertoire .
At 36 , Tendulkar has n't shown signs of ageing , and his sparkling touch in both forms of the game has ruled out all possibilities of him checking out anytime soon .
Fatigue , cramps and paucity of time have stood in the way of batsmen going that extra mile to get to the 200 - mark .
Tendulkar did cramp up after crossing 150 , but he did n't opt for a runner .
His experience of 20 years at the international level came into play in this historic innings , staying at the crease from the first ball to the last , never once losing focus .
There were no chances offered , no dropped catches , making his innings absolutely flawless .
A swirl of emotions must have run through his mind as he approached one record after another but he ensured he was never lost in the moment .
His running between the wickets remained just as swift as it had been at the start of the innings .
The humidity in Gwalior was bound to test him but he stood above it all and played like he owned the game , toying with the bowling with a mix of nonchalance and brute power .
In the 46th over , with a flick for two past short fine - leg , Tendulkar broke the record for the highest ODI score , going past the 194 made by Zimbabwe 's Charles Coventry and Pakistan 's Saeed Anwar , and to say that he acknowledged his feat modestly would be an understatement .
His muted celebration on going past 194 , true to style , made his innings all the more endearing .
He did n't raise his bat , merely shook hands with Mark Boucher and simply carried on batting amid the din .
Coming from a man who is not known to showing too much emotion with the bat in hand , it was n't surprising .
He reserved his celebrations for the magic figure of 200 , which he reached in the final over with a squirt off Charl Langeveldt past backward point .
He raised his bat , took off his helmet and looked up at the skies and it was only fitting that one - day cricket 's highest run-getter reached the landmark .
Tendulkar 's innings featured strokes of the highest quality , but his true genius was exemplified by one particular shot which rendered even the best bowler in the world helpless .
In the first over of the batting Powerplay - taken in the 35th over - Dale Steyn fired it in the block - hole for three deliveries outside off to keep him quiet .
Tendulkar , feeling the need to improvise , walked right across his stumps and nonchalantly flicked him across the line , hopping in his crease on one leg to bisect the gap at midwicket .
A helpless Steyn watched the ball speed away and merely shrugged his shoulders .
There was no use searching for excuses or venting frustrations at the temerity of that shot .
It was just that kind of afternoon for the bowlers .
It was n't all just about the cheekiness of his shots .
His timing and placement were the hallmarks at the start of his innings .
On a road of a pitch which offered no margin of error for the bowlers , he squeezed out full deliveries past the covers and off his pads .
With no seam movement on offer , Jacques Kallis took the slips off and placed them in catching positions within the 15 - yard circle , hoping to induce a mistake .
But Tendulkar outplayed all of them , making room to manoeuver it past a number of green shirts .
There were a minimum of two runs on offer each time the ball was placed wide of them and the quick outfield did the rest .
Once he got his eye in , the short boundaries and the flat pitch were too inviting .
Virender Sehwag 's dismissal for 11 , caught at third man , was just an aberration as Karthik , Pathan and Dhoni traded cricket bats for golf clubs .
Driving and lofting through the line had never been this easy .
Tendulkar could have driven them inside out in his sleep .
The two century stands , with Karthik and then with Dhoni , may well get lost in the scorecard but they were vital building blocks .
Karthik rotated the strike well in their stand of 194 , struck three clean sixes and helped himself to his career - best performance .
That partnership sent out ominous signs to the South Africans that they were in for something massive .
Add Dhoni 's bludgeoning hits and scoops and you had a score in excess of 400 .
Tendulkar reached his fifty off 37 balls and his century off 90 .
Ironically , he struck his first six - over long - on - when on 111 .
Pathan bashed it around at the other end , clubbing full tosses and short deliveries in his 23 - ball 36 , as India amassed 63 runs in the batting Powerplay .
The South African seamers made the mistake of trying to bowl too fast and as a result , sent down too many full tosses and full deliveries .
The unplayable yorkers remained elusive and Tendulkar , who was seeing it like a beach ball , picked the gaps , made room and improvised .
He reached his 150 by making room to Parnell and chipping him over midwicket with a simple bat twirl at the point of contact .
The heartbreak of Hyderabad , when his scintillating 175 all but won India the match against Australia last year , must have lingered in his mind as he approached that score again .
A towering six over long - on later , he not only eclipsed Kapil Dev 's 175 but also looked set to wipe out his own record .
He started clutching his thighs , indicating that cramps had set in , but even that could not stop him today .
He equalled his highest score of 186 by pulling a lollipop of a full toss off Kallis and broke his own and India 's record with a single to square leg .
Fortunately , he did n't have to do much running and played the spectator 's role for a change as Dhoni bulldozed his way to a 35 - ball 68 , muscling four sixes .
The Dhoni bottom - hand is the strongest in the business these days and the exhausted spectators had enough energy left in their vocal chords to cheer him on as well .
The record of 200 , however , was yet to be attained and the crowd were desperate for Tendulkar to get the strike .
Dhoni tore into Steyn for 17 off the 49th over and retained the strike for the 50th .
After hammering the first ball of the 50th for six , he shoveled a full toss to deep midwicket where Hashim Amla made a brilliant save .
Tendulkar settled for a single and the crowd were on their feet as they watched him make history .
It was all the more fitting for another reason because it was on this very day , back in 1988 , that he and Vinod Kambli added a mammoth 664 - then a world record - in a school match .
There was to be no repeat of the 434 - chase at the Wanderers , when South Africa took guard , perhaps mentally and physically shaken after the assault , and with a partisan crowd to contend with .
AB de Villiers ' attacking ton got completely lost in the chase as South Africa merely went through the motions .
It was all a question of how quickly India could wrap it up .
Herschelle Gibbs , Hashim Amla , Roelof van der Merwe and Jacques Kallis all got out cheaply within the first 15 overs .
de Villiers motored along at more than a run-a - ball , and collected 13 fours and two sixes .
South Africa had to rely on the services of nine men to muster 200 - for India one man sufficed .
Tendulkar 's knock drew parallels with Brendon McCullum 's frenetic 158 in the IPL opener in Bangalore two years ago .
The match was all about individual brilliance but not a contest .
While such games are good in small doses , for one - day cricket to survive on the whole , it needs more contests between bat and ball .
The furore over whether John Terry should have remained the England football captain was , and continues to be , ridiculous .
The really ridiculous bit , though , is not Mr Terry 's unsuitability for the job – but the job itself .
With the exception of the ability to tell heads from tails and , in the rare event of ever winning one , the ability to hold a trophy aloft and kiss it without dropping it , it is hard to know what purpose a football captain actually fulfils , whether the game is in the local park or at Wembley .
In football and rugby , as distinct from cricket , the real boss is the coach , while the captaincy is just an afterthought .
Plenty of players have earned their places in plenty of football teams for possessing traits which are sometimes confused with captaincy skills – like being tireless , being hard as nails , or even being crafty .
Few if any have made it to the team for being charismatic , leading a blameless home life or for being a jolly good sport .
Mr Terry was none of these , yet even the sainted Bobby Moore had his brushes with the law and his nights on the tiles – as Jimmy Greaves 's autobiography attests .
Captaincy , in short , is a much overrated virtue , and it is especially overrated in this country .
Even if captaincy is n't still an English public school conspiracy to ensure that the right sort of chap is always in charge , it has become a greedy love rat 's opportunity to mop up even more money from even more endorsements .
Either way , it is a waste of time and adds nothing to the game .
Let all the captains depart .
Football teams do not need them .
Police and bank staff are trying to discover how much money was taken
Police are hunting for a group of men who pulled a cash machine out of the wall of a bank in Devon .
A stolen red forklift truck was used to take the machine out of the branch of the NatWest in Bridge Street , Hatherleigh , at about 0315 GMT .
The cash machine was extensively damaged and a hole measuring about 8 ft by 6ft ( 2.4 m by 1.8 m ) was left in the front of the building .
The amount stolen could be up to a six - figure sum , the bank said .
Staff from the bank were called to the branch to assess the damage and verify the amount taken .
Three men wearing reflective clothing , and who may also have been wearing hard hats , were seen leaving the scene in an unknown vehicle .
The Manitou forklift truck was stolen in the Bideford area between Thursday evening and Friday morning , police said .
They have appealed for anyone who may have seen it in the areas of Bideford or Okehampton before the robbery .
White House Prepares for Possibility of 2 Supreme Court Vacancies SCOTUS watchers believe justices Stevens , Ginsburg could decide to step aside .
WASHINGTON , Feb. 4 , 2010  -- Lawyers for President Obama have been working behind the scenes to prepare for the possibility of one , and maybe two Supreme Court vacancies this spring .
Court watchers believe two of the more liberal members of the court , justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg , could decide to step aside for reasons of age and health .
That would give the president his second and third chance to shape his legacy on the Supreme Court .
Last week , when Obama took the nearly unprecedented step of criticizing the court 's opinion in a major campaign finance case during his State of the Union speech , some believed he was showcasing for the American people that presidential elections , and Supreme Court nominations count .
" With all due deference to separation of powers , " the president said , " last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections .
I do n't think American elections should be bankrolled by America 's most powerful interests , or worse , by foreign entities . "
Doug Kendall , of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center , said the president 's message was clear : " President Obama 's spirited reaction to Citizens United at the State of the Union indicates he fully understands the importance of the federal judiciary and the ability of the Supreme Court to stand in the way of his administration 's agenda . "
Kendall hopes Obama 's dressing down of the majority will translate into greater attention to the judicial nomination and confirmation process .
Although five of the six justices who attended the speech sat poker faced when Obama made his comments , Justice Samuel Alito , who voted with the majority , reacted by shaking his head in irritation .
If a justice from the conservative block like Alito were to would retire , there could be a seismic shift on the court , likely giving Obama the chance to reverse the court 's majority voting bloc .
But speculation has centered on the liberal end of the bench .
Vacancies Could Spark Political Fire
It is widely believed that Justice Stevens , 89 , sent a strong signal of his intention to retire when he confirmed for The Assoicated Press last fall that he had n't hired a full complement of clerks for next term .
The justice has been coy with the press , telling USA Today 's Joan Biskupic that he was surprised by the media frenzy regarding his potential retirement .
" That can't be news " he said , declining to reveal his plans .
" I 'm not exactly a kid . "
Justice Ginsburg , 76 , announced a year ago that she had undergone surgery for early stage pancreatic cancer .
Sources close to Ginsburg dismissed retirement speculation , pointing out that she has been a lively and active participant in oral arguments this term and has on several occasions expressed an interest in serving for more years to come .
In a September press release from the court , Ginsburg revealed that she had had a " comprehensive assessment of health " last summer and that she was in " completely normal health with the exception of a low red blood cell count caused by deficiency of iron . "
If one or both of the justices retire , the administration would have to calculate whether it could nominate candidates who could deliver votes as consistently liberal on major ideological issues as Stevens and Ginsburg do in an age of increasingly political confirmation wars .
" The most important thing that has changed , " said Stuart Taylor of the National Journal , " is the downward spiral of partisanship in judicial nominations .
It 's reached a point where either party is going to make a fight on almost anyone unless the candidate is displeasing to the base of the president 's party . "
The administration has worked from its early days at vetting and exploring potential candidates for the court .
Those efforts intensified when Justice David Souter announced his retirement in May 2009 .
At the time , President Obama said that he was looking for a candidate with the " quality of empathy , of understanding and identifying with people 's hopes and struggles , as an essential ingredient for arriving as just decisions and outcomes . "
Top Candidates for Supreme Court
Top candidates went through extensive vetting before Obama settled on Justice Sonia Sotomayor .
The short list then included Judge Diane Wood , Elena Kagan , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm .
Elena Kagan
Elena Kagan , 49 , currently serves as the president 's solicitor general .
She is known as one of the finest constitutional scholars in the country , dazzling both liberal and conservative friends with her intellectual prowess and her ability to find consensus among ideological opposites .
Judge Diane Wood
Judge Diane Wood , 59 , of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit , was nominated by President Clinton in 1995 .
She has a wide array of job experiences away from the bench , including positions in the U.S. government at the departments of State and Justice , and as a teacher at the University of Chicago .
While at the university , she played a key role in developing policies on sexual harassment and maternity leave .
Unlike Kagan , Wood has had to wrestle with hot - button issues such as abortion .
Potential confirmation hearings would be lively and controversial .
Janet Napolitano
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , 52 , enjoys a close relationship with the president and would be an " outside the judicial box " candidate , but may be roundly criticized for her comments after the arrest of Umar Farouk Abdulmuttalab , who attempted to bring down a Northwest Airlines flight with explosives .
Napolitano initially told ABC
News , " Once the incident occurred , the system worked . "
A day later , she had a slightly different message on NBC News : " Our system did not work in this instance , " she said .
President Obama later ordered an extensive review .
Other Possible Candidates
Others , such as Leah Ward Sears , former chief of the Georgia Supreme Court , are also on potential short lists , but those lists can shift .
" Short lists probably do n't change too much from vacancy to vacancy , but rankings within the short list probably fluctuate based on who 's being replaced , Kendall said .
he noted that , unlike the previous vacancy , the next one could be filled by a male .
Many believe that Obama could turn to Judge Merrick Garland , 58 , a graduate of Harvard Law School and former law clerk for Supreme Court Justice William Brennan , Jr. He currently sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for District of Columbia Circuit .
Another possibility is Cass Sunstein , 55 , a close confident of the president who currently heads the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs .
Why it matters who leads research universities
Amanda Goodall
The best US universities outperform their European counterparts .
This column says part of the gap is due to how universities choose leaders .
Outstanding scholars are more likely to be selected as presidents in the top US universities , a move that is associated with improved research performance .
It is well known that the top European research universities underperform compared to their American counterparts .
The evidence is summarised with policy recommendations by van der Ploeg and Veugelers ( 2008a , b ) .
The authors raise the need for improved governance , in particular that governments should give universities greater autonomy to manage their own affairs .
Leadership is an important part of governance , and again Europe lags .
US universities choose different types of leaders ; indeed , as I will argue , the achievement of America ’s top institutions today may be explained partially by the legacy of outstanding scholars who have led them .
Leading the top universities
The top research universities in the world are overwhelmingly located in the US ( Jacobs and van der Ploeg 2006 ; Goodall 2006 ) .
US institutions also house most Nobel Prize winners ( see Figure 1 ) .
A further difference between the US and Europe is that many of America ’s great universities are also led by their best researchers .
Figure 1 . Nobel Prizes awarded to individuals in institutions in France , Germany , UK , and US , 1900 –2007
Nobel Prizes awarded in chemistry , medicine , physics and economics ( since 1969 ) .
Rockefeller University 's ninth president , the UK biologist Paul Nurse , is a Nobel Prize winner , and he is not alone .
David Baltimore , who stood down as President of California Institute of Technology in 2006 , is also a Nobel laureate , as is J. Michael Bishop , Chancellor of University of California , San Francisco .
Indeed California , with a population of 36 million , is home to many great institutions that are led by some of the most distinguished scholars in the world .
John Hennessy , at Stanford , is a prominent computer scientist ; Robert Birgeneau , a Canadian who heads Berkeley , is a top physicist .
At UC San Diego , Chancellor Marye Anne
Fox is an eminent chemist , and at UC Irvine , the renowned atmospheric scientist Ralph Cicerone was chancellor until he left his position in 2005 to head the National Academy of Sciences .
Could it be that having a distinguished scholar as leader improves the performance of universities ?
Using the Shanghai Jiao
Tong global league table , Figure 2 shows the average lifetime citations ( normalised for discipline ) of each president by the position of their university in the ranking .
The 100 universities are grouped into quintiles ( the ‘ 1 - 20 ’ group refers to the top of the Shanghai Jiao Tong table , where 1 is Harvard ) .
As can be seen there is a clear monotonic decline – the higher the university is placed in the global ranking , the higher are the lifetime citations of its leader ( Goodall 2006 , 2009 b ) .
In other words , better universities appear to hire better scholars to lead them .
Figure 2 . Presidents who lead universities higher in a world university ranking have higher lifetime citations ( in quintiles )
Can the correlation be explained simply by assortative matching or reverse causality ?
For example , Harvard and Stanford become great and hence can attract and afford presidents who are outstanding scholars .
The longitudinal part of my research suggests otherwise ( Goodall 2009a , b ) .
I follow a panel of 55 UK research universities in three Research Assessment Exercises .
( The British government ’s Research Assessment Exercises use peer review to assess each university ’s research output and then allocates funding according to quality and quantity . )
Using regression equations and controlling for confounding variables such as size of institution , my results show that those universities led , a number of years earlier , by good scholars go on to perform better in the RAE .
Figure 3 presents the results in a simple cross-sectional bar diagram that correlates universities ’ later performance in the Research Assessment Exercises with vice chancellors ’ lifetime citations – normalised for discipline – some years earlier .
The focus here is on the leaders of those universities that made the greatest gains , and the smallest gains , in the Research Assessment Exercises between 1992 and 2001 .
The universities that improved the most were overwhelmingly led by better researchers .
Figure 3 . Universities that improved the most in the Research Assessment Exercises between 1992 -2001 were led by vice chancellors with higher lifetime citations
Why might top scholars improve the performance of research universities ?
Autonomy has been mentioned in the literature as being a necessary requirement for the success of universities ( Jacobs and van der Ploeg 2006 , Aghion et al 2007 , van der Ploeg and Veugelers 2008 ) .
This includes financial autonomy , the freedom to set market salaries , and to hire or fire staff .
Managerialism , which has become ubiquitous in the UK among other countries , works counter to the principle of autonomy .
Implicit in much government policy are the unproven assumptions that experts , such as academics and doctors , either cannot manage or are somehow inferior to professional managers .
My research suggests that this position is flawed .
In qualitative interviews with heads of UK and US universities ( see Figure 4 ) , the issue of autonomy was raised .
Many said that leaders must have the power to select their own top team members and to create their own decision - making bodies .
Once again , practices differ across the Atlantic .
In the US , these powers are common , and the UK is moving in a similar direction .
But in mainland Europe , rectors ’ actions are more likely to be controlled by faculty committees and overly democratic processes .
Why might top scholars improve university performance ?
Four reasons emerged from the interviews .
First , a president ( vice chancellor , rector , principal ) who is a distinguished scholar will have a better understanding of the core business of a university , that of research and teaching .
This is key to the idea ( promoted in Goodall 2009 ) of “ expert leadership ” , that in organisations where the core business relies on expert knowledge – for example , law and accounting firms , in R&D , management consultancies , and architecture practices – the leader must first be an outstanding expert in the relevant area of business .
This particularly challenges the ideas of managerialism that would appear to promote management skills above expert knowledge .
Arguably , top scholars , engineers or lawyers must also have management and leadership skills , and in my dataset of 400 , almost all the leaders had progressed through managerial hierarchies in their institutions prior to the top job .
A second explanation raised by interviewees , one that again relates to expert knowledge , is that a scholar - leader will likely demand higher academic standards .
Arguably , it is leaders who should set the standards in any organisation .
This message is articulated by a dean in one of my interviews , “ leaders are the final arbiters of quality .
Therefore it is right to expect the standard bearer to first bear the standard ” .
A number of UK vice chancellors said that it was easier to encourage others to submit articles to top journals for the Research Assessment Exercise if they had done so themselves .
Top scholars send out important signals to a number of audiences , according to interviewees .
They signal a university ’s priorities , act as a beacon when hiring other outstanding academics , and are attractive to students and donors .
Finally , it was suggested that scholars are more credible leaders .
A president who is a researcher will gain greater respect from academic colleagues and appear more legitimate .
Legitimacy extends a leader ’s power and influence .
Figure 4 .
Interviews with leaders in universities
Note : I did not interview Shirley Tilghman ; instead she was asked questions about my research by the Princetonian Newspaper .
How do economists fare as leaders ?
Finally , it is interesting to see how economists perform as university leaders .
Many years ago , humanists dominated as university heads .
Today they have largely been replaced by scientists and social scientists , among whom economists are a rising force .
One of the most successful , and arguably most influential , presidents of the 20th Century was the distinguished labour economist Clark Kerr , former Chancellor of Berkeley and the founding president of the University of California , who is often credited with its success .
Indeed , labour economists are the largest group within the discipline , possibly because empirical work is more helpful in these roles than theory .
Two retired economists recognised as having made an important contribution are William Bowen , former president of Princeton and the Mellon Foundation , and Henry Rosovsky , who was an influential dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard , although he stopped short of becoming a president .
Lawrence Summers was one of the most distinguished scholars at the head of the Top - 100 universities in the ranking mentioned above .
When I present this work in seminars , the former Harvard president is often mentioned – “ he was a top scholar who failed ” .
But my response to this question is that Summers spent many years in Washington DC prior to becoming Harvard ’s president , and unquestionably the world of politics is played differently to that of academe .
Summers may have been out of touch with the norms and values of the academy .
In my interviews at Harvard , many reported that Summers , despite being controversial and short - lived , had developed a powerful intellectual vision for the institution and been a good fundraiser , although it is fair to say he may not have been a good manager of people .
The longest tenured Ivy League president , Richard Levin at Yale , is also an economist .
At Bocconi University in Milan , one of Italy ’s top institutions , Guido Tabellini has become rector .
Tabellini is a highly cited economist , as is Kim Clark , former dean of Harvard Business School , now president of Brigham Young University .
George Bain , another labour economist , is credited with raising the research performance of Queens University in Belfast , and before that he was both dean of Warwick Business School and London Business School .
A number of business school deans are economists – Glenn Hubbard at Columbia , Rich Lyons at Berkeley ’s Haas , Laura Tyson formerly at London Business School , and David Begg at Imperial .
It has been difficult for business school deans to make the jump to university president .
But the tide may be turning , and if so , more economists , preferably top economists , will likely take the helm at universities .

It 's interesting that he 's released that trailer and the next day , he shows it on IMAX .

We get the criticism and then we get the rave reviews of what it really looks like in its own formula .

Oh I want to do it exactly the same .
That guy 's gonna come after me ... no , I had a take on Perseus that I said to Louie and he went with it and the studio kind of liked my take , and we 'll see if it works .
[ on the Terminator Franchise ]
Well , I reacquainted myself with the movies , obviously , before we started , but I would have been actually 15 or something when Terminator 2 came out .
So you remember the liquid man , of course , and that was revolutionary for this time , going through the helicopter and all that .
But I think what they do is they showcase how good a storyteller Jim is .
I did n't set out to be famous ; if I 'd wanted that , I would have gone on _Big Brother_ .

It 's not uncommon for blind gamers to feel invisible in addition to visually impaired .
For instance , when gamer Brandon Cole wrote THQ a letter suggesting changes to make its Smackdown series of WWE wrestling games more accessible to the blind , he received a form letter back thanking him for his appreciation of the game 's graphics .
It does n't help the visually impaired that some of EverQuest II 's characters are actually invisible .
But now , one visually impaired gamer has gone beyond simply requesting accessibility features and is demanding them by way of a lawsuit .
Last month , disabled gamer Alexander Stern filed suit against Sony , Sony Online Entertainment , and Sony Computer Entertainment America in the United States District Court for the Central District of California .
The suit alleges that Sony is violating the Americans with Disabilities
Act by failing to implement features to make its games accessible to visually impaired gamers .
The Americans with Disabilities
Act states that , " No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods , services , facilities , privileges , advantages , or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns , leases ( or leases to ) , or operates a place of public accommodation . "
According to the suit , Sony ignored repeated requests through postal mail and e-mail to come up with reasonable modifications to its games to make them more accessible .
The suit , which does n't mention SOE games by name but appears to focus on massively multiplayer online titles , requests the addition of visual cues to point gamers to their destinations for gamers with " disability impaired visual processing . "
The suit also specifies the ways in which other companies have made their games accessible .
For instance , Blizzard Entertainment 's World of Warcraft allows the use of third - party mods in its game , which has led to the creation of several programs to include accessibility aids in the game .
The suit also mentions Pin Interactive 's action adventure PC game Terraformers , saying high - contrast 3D graphics modes , an audio compass , and voice - over detailing items collected in the game all serve to make the game more accessible .
Beyond the denial of entertainment , the suit also contends that Sony 's actions have caused visually impaired gamers a financial loss .
Because Sony runs an official auction site where gamers can sell their in - game items for real money , the suit says Stern 's inability to participate in that marketplace is costing him money .
" Sony has constructed the products in a way that is inaccessible to plaintiff ; maintains the products in this inaccessible form ; and has failed to take any action whatsoever to correct these barriers even after being repeatedly notified of the discrimination that such barriers cause , " according to the suit .
Representatives with Sony and Sony Online Entertainment said they do n't comment on pending litigation .
PARIS ( AP ) 
The Interior Ministry says police detained nearly 400 people in France overnight — many of them linked to car - burnings that often accompany New Year 's revelry .
The ministry says 398 people were taken into police custody — nearly twice the figure of a year ago — but the final count on the number of torched vehicles is n't yet available .
Dozens of cars are burnt every night in France , but the number traditionally spikes during New Year 's festivities .
Such vandalism is generally attributed to marauding youths from tough neighborhoods in immigrant - heavy areas , and evokes the three - week wave of riots and other violence that shocked the country in late 2005 .

The human and economic toll of this month 's earthquake in Haiti has yet to be fully measured , but it is clear that the country faces an enormous rebuilding task .
Lawrence Vale , MIT 's Ford Professor of Urban Design and Planning , is an expert on the reconstruction of cities devastated by natural disasters or warfare ; a 2005 book he co-edited on the subject , The Resilient City , explores how and why modern societies choose to rebuild ruined metropolises .
MIT News asked Vale about Haiti 's long - term prospects for renewal .
In The Resilient City , you write that throughout history , devastated cities have almost always " risen again like the mythic phoenix " and " are among humankind 's most durable artifacts . "
What are the crucial first steps that could allow Haiti , and the Port - au - Prince area , to rebuild ?
Before 1800 , it was more common for cities to be destroyed and abandoned , leaving the world with " lost cities " later to be recovered only as touristic ruins .
In the last 200 years or so , however , it has been rare for governments to let their cities die , even after massive annihilation from war — think of Hiroshima or Warsaw in WW II .
Similarly , cities tend to be rebuilt in the same location even after massive natural disasters — half a million people may well have died in Tangshan , China from an earthquake in 1976 , yet that city regained its population numbers within a decade .
More generally , the combination of nation - states , insurance industries and global philanthropy have all made " caring - at - a - distance " much more prevalent .
Cities are no longer left on their own .
That said , the thing we loosely term " rebuilding " is at least a three - part challenge .
There is physical rebuilding , both in terms of the necessities of daily life such as basic shelter and in terms of more symbolic structures — civic institutions such as a destroyed cathedral or palace .
Then there is socio- economic rebuilding , an especially difficult challenge in a place like Haiti where poverty was so broad and deep even before this particular disaster struck .
Finally , there is the challenge of emotional rebuilding , the need to cope with great personal losses .
Each of these entails a form of resilience .
For Haitians , resilience may well be substantially undergirded by faith , and the restoration of the Cathedral and other houses of worship will surely be regarded as key symbolic milestones signaling recovery .
The leaders of most societies have also chosen to use disasters as opportunities to " build back better , " and I hope that it will become possible to enforce safer building practices in Haiti .
And yet you note that an exception to the universality of rebuilding is from the Caribbean , as well : When St. Pierre , Martinique , was buried by a volcano in 1902 , it was not reconstructed .
Are there any comparable cases of equally small , poor countries like Haiti rebuilding major cities ?
There is another , more recent , Caribbean example .
Between 1995 and 1997 , volcanic activity rendered Plymouth , the capital of Montserrat , completely uninhabitable , and forced construction of a new city on a less vulnerable part of the island .
So , that 's an example of rebuilding , even though it has entailed relocation .
But Port - au - Prince is several hundred times larger than Plymouth , so there are limits to the comparison .
Perhaps the near - continual rebuilding that occurs in Bangladesh after floods and storms is a better parallel , since this is a place that regularly endures large losses of life , and continues to rebuild at high densities .
If so , the comparison is not an auspicious one , since vulnerabilities are still increasing .
Rebuilding a devastated city often has a political dimension , and serves an expression of national identity — but Haiti has had political chaos for years , and weak governmental institutions .
How do you think Haiti 's past , and its lack of strong civic institutions , will affect the type of reconstruction that occurs in the future ?
It is hard to imagine a place with more factors working against it than Haiti , especially given that its political landscape has been literally destroyed .
A lot of the more storied recoveries from major disasters have been in places that were otherwise poised for significant economic growth when catastrophe struck — think of Chicago in 1871 or San Francisco in 1906 .
Other places have gained from an influx of aid from the non-devastated parts of the country , a luxury that Haitians do not have .
Disasters — even those we call " natural disasters " — always reflect poorly on governments , and often increase the power of social movements in support of alternative political leadership .
The politics of redevelopment in Haiti will reveal the priorities of the government ( and also the priorities of global aid organizations ) , and this can easily spark enhanced unrest among citizens , leading to further destabilization .
Ultimately , the physical rebuilding of Port - au - Prince and its environments may prove to be the least of Haiti 's problems .
At the same time , I can only hope that the remarkable emotional resilience of the Haitian people will once again prevail .
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times , Starr , who is now a teetotal and has quit his 60 - a - day cigarette habit , said that religion was one of the most important aspects in his life .

“ Community ” climate scientists ( e.g. Nature , Realclimate ) have been quick to accept the idea that CRU was prevented from releasing station data because of confidentiality agreements with originating meteorological services .
Something that Nature and Realclimate did n’t discuss or even seem to notice – and the blind spot is symptomatic – is that Jones delivered “ confidential ” data to his friends .
In a Climategate Letter in early 2005 , Jones told Mann that he had just sent “ loads of station data to Scott [ Rutherford ] ” , Mann ’s close associate .
I guess that it did n’t occur to Nature or to Gavin Schmidt that confidentiality agreements also apply to masters of the universe .
If the data is as confidential as Nature and Realclimate say , then the distribution of confidential data to associates and other third parties in breach of the confidentiality agreements may warrant just as much attention as Jones ’ effort to obstruct FOI requests .
CRU Statements
CRU publicly articulated their position on the supposed confidentiality agreements with national meteorological services ( NMSs ) in summer 2009 both in interviews with Nature and in a short statement on their website posted in response to numerous FOI requests for confidentiality agreements .
( These FOI requests constitute the vast majority of all FOI requests . )
On Aug 13 , 2009 , Olive Heffernan reported in Nature ( v. 460 , p. 787 ) :
Jones says he can’t fulfil the requests because of confidentiality agreements signed in the 1990s with some nations , including Spain , Germany , Bahrain and Norway , that restrict the data to academic use .
In some cases , says Jones , the agreements were made verbally , and in others the written records were mislaid during a move .
In an associated blog post , Heffernan added :
Why wo n’t Jones give McIntyre the data ?
Jones says that he tried to help when he first received data requests from McIntyre back in 2002 , but says that he soon became inundated with requests that he could not fulfill , or that he did not have the time to respond to .
He says that , in some cases , he simply could n’t hand over entire data sets because of long - standing confidentiality agreements with other nations that restrict their use .
( In passing , none of these statements should be taken at face value .
For example , Jones obviously did not become “ inundated with requests ” “ soon ” after my 2002 request . )
Jones also posted a webpage on the matter at almost the same time as the Nature article :
Since the early 1980s , some NMSs , other organizations and individual scientists have given or sold us ( see Hulme , 1994 , for a summary of European data collection efforts ) additional data for inclusion in the gridded datasets , often on the understanding that the data are only used for academic purposes with the full permission of the NMSs , organizations and scientists and the original station data are not passed onto third parties .
The “ Agreements ”
As most readers know by now , in response to multiple requests for the supposed confidentiality agreements with national meteorological services , CRU produced only four “ agreements ” ( UK Met Office , Spain , Norway , Bahrain ) .
Obviously , these agreements would not have encumbered the entire data set for very long , as waivers from Spain , Norway and the Met Office could presumably have been obtained in a day or so .
Faced with these few embarrassing scraps , CRU argued that there were many other agreements that they had unfortunately lost or never committed to writing .
Indeed , they did n’t even know for sure who they had made agreements with .
CRU :
Below we list the agreements that we still hold .
We know that there were others , but cannot locate them , possibly as we ’ve moved offices several times during the 1980s .
Some date back at least 20 years .
Additional agreements are unwritten and relate to partnerships we ’ve made with scientists around the world and visitors to the CRU over this period .
They stated that these agreements contained language that was representative of the period and of what was used in the “ lost ” agreements , noting in particular that the examples showed that they “ would not make the data available to third parties ” :
In some of the examples given , it can be clearly seen that our requests for data from NMSs have always stated that we would not make the data available to third parties .
We included such statements as standard from the 1980s , as that is what many NMSs requested .
The four agreements were placed online here .
The agreement with the Met Office ( respecting data from various colonies and ex-colonies ) is the clearest agreement .
It does indeed include language that the data would not be made available “ to third parties ” .
But it did more than that .
It said that the data would only be used by the Climatic Research Unit and only for the “ specific project ” of “ construction of a gridded baseline climatology for global land areas ” and would “ not be used unauthorized for any other project ” or “ passed on to third parties ” :
These data are to be used by the Climatic Research Unit for a specific research project sponsored by the NERC , namely the construction of a gridded baseline climatology for global land areas .
The project falls in the area of Global Environmental Change which makes this data request subject to the IACGEC Framework for Data Exchange to which the Met .
Office is a signatory .
The data will not be used unauthorised for any other project and will not be passed onto any third party .
The CRU “ agreements ” included a recent NERC form which clearly proscribed use of data for academic work outside of the original consented program :
UKMO data / software so obtained may be used solely for the purpose for which they were supplied .
They may not be used for any other projects unless specific prior permission has been obtained in writing from the UKMO by a NERC Data Centre .
Note that this applies even for other bona fide academic work .
The NERC form also stated that any “ infringement ” of confidentiality , whether intentional or merely negligent , would be taken very seriously – language that is a little ironic when one considers that CRU had left versions of the confidential station data on their FTP site for many years ( see CA , July 2009 , A Mole ? )
NERC recognises that some data holdings supplied by UKMO under the arrangements are commercially valuable : the recipients of data are under an obligation to respect the terms and conditions of data supply , and to have regard to the security of datasets entrusted to them .
Any infringement , whether by deliberate abuse or negligence , will be regarded extremely seriously by NERC , as endangering Council ’s own reputation and the integrity of the NERC supported scientific community .
The introduction of sanctions against individuals or Departments may be considered if breaches occur .
“ Loads of station data to Scott ”
For the sake of analysis , let ’s stipulate the position of CRU , Nature and Realclimate – that the station data was restricted by confidentiality agreements .
Despite such agreements , on Feb 2 , 2005 , Jones emailed Mann notifying him that he had just sent “ loads of station data to Scott [ Rutherford ] ” , Mann ’s associate .
This email has previously attracted attention for Jones ’ threat to delete the data rather than send it to “ MM ” and for Jones ’ disdainful attitude towards UEA officials who would dare argue that the Freedom of Information might apply even to Jones .
However , commentators have thus far not paid attention to the equally interesting information that Jones had just sent “ loads of station data ” to Mann ’s close associate , data that would be denied to Warwick Hughes a few weeks later , to Willis Eschenbach in 2006 , and to me , McKitrick , Pielke Jr , McCulloch and others in 2009 .
Jones wrote Mann as follows :
Mike ,
…
Just sent loads of station data to Scott .
Make sure he documents everything better this time !
And do n’t leave stuff lying around on ftp sites – you never know who is trawling them .
The two MMs have been after the CRU station data for years .
If they ever hear there is a Freedom of Information Act now in the UK , I think I ’ll delete the file rather than send to anyone .
Does your similar act in the US force you to respond to enquiries within 20 days ?
– our does !
The UK works on precedents , so the first request will test it .
We also have a data protection act , which I will hide behind .
Tom Wigley has sent me a worried email when he heard about it – thought people could ask him for his model code .
He has retired officially from UEA so he can hide behind that .
IPR should be relevant here , but I can see me getting into an argument with someone at UEA who ’ll say we must adhere to it !...
Phil
Another distribution of confidential station data to a third party occurred last summer when Jones delivered station data to a professor at Georgia Tech , who , unlike Mann , was not a close associate of Jones , and who had innocently asked for the data , implicitly accepting the quid pro quo that Jones would be granted a coauthorship on any subsequent article .
Olive Heffernan reported at Nature ( 2009 , 460 , 787 ) as follows :
Webster says his team was given the station data for a very specific request that will result in a joint publication with Jones .
At the time of his initial inquiry , Webster would have had no reason to presume that the CRU station data was encumbered by confidentiality agreements and nothing here is a criticism of Webster ’s behavior , which has been scrupulous at all times .
However , Jones knew of the confidentiality agreements and it was Jones ’ obligation to honor the supposed confidentiality agreements .
Nevertheless , Jones delivered the “ confidential ” data to Webster in the expectation of coauthorship – a coauthorship that would incrementally increase Jones ’ H - Index .
The Climategate Letters show that Jones ’ H - Index was important to him : Jones wanted to be an AGU Fellow and looked to Michael Mann to organize the nomination .
In one letter , Jones and Mann had an unsavory discussion in which Mann said that he would report a false higher value of Jones ’ H - Index in connection with Jones ’ nomination as AGU Fellow .
( Because Jones is a common surname , Jones advised Mann that an online algorithm for the H- index yielded an higher H - Index that was too high because it included articles by an unrelated biologist Phil Jones .
Mann advised Jones that he would use the inflated value in the nomination form anyway . )
In subsequent discussion at the Nature blog , Heffernan was unable to see any inconsistency between Jones ’ delivery of confidential data and any obligations to the NMSs to keep his data confidential .
Jones ’ desire for coauthorship may be understandable in academic terms , but it is totally irrelevant to his obligations under the NMS confidentiality agreements .
The interest of the NMSs would be in the confidentiality agreement , not Jones ’ H - Index .
An increase in Jones ’ H - Index is not a valid reason to breach the confidentiality agreements .
Even Nature should get this .
There was an even more remarkable breach of the confidentiality agreements 20 years ago .
The collection of station data by CRU was financed by a unit of the US Department of Energy ( the Oak Ridges Nuclear Lab ) – DOE financing continued for over 25 years .
Notwithstanding confidentiality agreements in effect in 1990 ( and CRU says that many agreements date from the 1980s ) , Jones delivered the data set to the Oak Ridges Nuclear Lab ( Carbon Dioxide Information Center ) , who placed the data set online .
This version is available to this day ( http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp020/ ) .
Conclusion
The language said to be standard in CRU confidentiality agreements stated that the data was to be used only by CRU and only for the construction of a gridded temperature index and not to be used for other purposes and not to be passed on to third parties .
Jones flouted these terms .
He passed confidential data to the Oak Ridges Nuclear Lab in the US , who had funded the collection of the data .
He passed confidential data to his close associates , Michael Mann and Scott Rutherford .
He passed confidential data on to a relative stranger in circumstances where he expected to increase his personal H - Index .
The reaction of the Community to these revelations is just as important .
Jones ’ violations of the confidentiality agreements did n’t bother Gavin Schmidt , who said that there was nothing - to - see :
CRU data accessibility .
From the date of the first FOI request to CRU ( in 2007 ) , it has been made abundantly clear that the main impediment to releasing the whole CRU archive is the small % of it that was given to CRU on
Similarly , Nature said that there was nothng - to - see - move - along :
But for much crucial information the reality is very different .
Researchers are barred from publicly releasing meteorological data from many countries owing to contractual restrictions .
The idea that masters of the universe should be constrained by confidentiality agreements does n’t seem to have occurred to them .
It should have .
Postscript
There ’s an interesting example of this attitude in one of the Climategate Letters that arose out of the very first post in the current FOI sequence .
On May 11 , 2009 , as mentioned in a CA post here , I had noticed that the UK Met Office webpage on CRUTEM stated :
To obtain the archive of raw land surface temperature observations used to create CRUTEM3 , you will need to contact Phil Jones at the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia .
No mention of restrictions due to confidential agreements .
On May 12 , 2009 , Peter Thorne of the UK Met Office wrote to Phil Jones ( see Climategate Letter ) :
Mr. Fraudit never goes away does he ?
How often has he been told that we do n’t have permission ?
Ho hum .
Oh , I heard that fraudit ’s Santer et al comment got rejected .
That ’ll brighten your day at least a teensy bit ?
The Team has such an elegant rhetorical style .
Thorne was correct that our IJC comment had been rejected , but , at that point , I had n’t commented on the status of our Santer comment .
On May 28 , 2009 ( CA here ) , I stated :
Ross and I submitted a comment on this topic to the International Journal of Climatology , which we ’ve also posted on arxiv.org .
I ’m not going to comment right now on the status of this submission .
It appears that Santer co-author Thorne was a reviewer of our submission , a reviewer who recommended rejection and who then raced to tittle - tattle about the rejection to his confidante , Phil Jones .
By Frosty Wooldridge
From 1964 to 2006 , the United States , via mass immigration , grew from 193 million to 300 million .
It added over 100 million people in a 40 year span .
Today , America stands at 309 million people in 2010 .
It adds 3.1 million people annually .
It races toward adding 100 million people by 2035 — a scant 25 years from now .
In many ways , the American public cannot fathom its own critical condition as to overpopulation .
Americans charged onto the North American continent with unlimited topsoil , trees , fresh water , resources and unimaginable spaces .
If truth be told , the Native Americans kept it perfectly intact for thousands of years of ecological balance and harmony .
They also kept their own numbers in equilibrium with nature .
Birds , ducks , geese , deer and buffalo numbered in the millions while clear skies and crystal clean streams offered unlimited food , shelter and clothing .
But starting in 1850 , Europeans fled from potato famines , wars and diseases to stampede into America by the millions .
They brought horses , farms , locomotives , chemicals , booze , diseases , factories and the Industrial Revolution with them .
They blasted , mined , poisoned and trashed the national landscape .
If you look along America ’s highways , lakes , streams and farms , you will see billions of pieces of trash and dumps covering the land .
Americans individually or collectively show no responsibility for picking up after themselves .
Over the last 150 years , Americans enjoyed no end to water , energy and resources .
A sense of cultural ‘ entitlement ’ runs through this society with the idea that all these resources available today will be there tomorrow .
A CULTURAL PARADIGM OF NO END TO PLENTY OF EVERYTHING
Four things operate in the American mind in the 21st century : 1 . Religion promotes “ Go forth multiply and take dominion over the land . ”
2 . Capitalism promotes unlimited growth , production and consumption — that demands ever increasing human population expansion .
3 . No limits to water , energy and resources .
4 . Technology will solve any problem .
Man !
Are we in for a rude awakening or what ?!
One look at one billion humans living in misery and squalor around the planet today renders a hint and harbinger as to America ’s future .
Jared Diamond ’s book , Collapse :
How societies choose to fail or succeed , offers a sobering reality check to those four aforementioned myths .
“ In his brilliantly written Collapse , Diamond examines in fascinating historic detail why past societies succeeded or failed .
He then connects these stories to troubling scenes from 21st century in Rwanda , Australia , China and Montana — and extracts practical lessons for a world that desperately needs to redefine progress . ”
James R. Karr
As it stands today , Australia may be the first “ First World ” country that exceeds its carrying capacity .
With 96 percent of that continent covered in desert sand , it lacks water and arable soil .
A new book , Overloading Australia , by Mark O’Connor and William Lines , points out the obvious facts that Australia cannot support its current 21 million population let alone its immigration - driven projections to add 20 million by mid century .
Additionally , it suffers accelerating carbon emissions and unsustainable ecological footprint dilemmas — that can only worsen with population growth .
Another book , The Collapse of Complex Societies , by Dr. Joseph Tainter , illustrates how highly multifaceted civilizations fail .
If not for the 70 percent importation of oil burned in the US daily , our civilization would fall within days .
Astoundingly , U.S. leaders push for population growth by pressing for more immigration already at over 2.4 million annually .
Ironically , those immigrants flee already overloaded civilizations that expand by 77 million annually .
Startlingly , no one possesses the ability to connect the dots at the national , local or personal levels .
Societal ethnocentrism !
In “ On American Sustainability — Anatomy of a societal collapse ” , by Chris Clugston , “ Most Americans believe that we are ‘ exceptional ’— both as a society and as a species .
We believe that America was ordained through divine providence to be the societal role model for the world .
We believe through our superior intellect , we can harness and even conquer nature in our continuous quest to improve the material living standards associated with our ever - increasing population … we now find ourselves in a predicament .
We are irreparably overextended — living hopelessly beyond our means ecologically and economically …we are about to discover that we are another unsustainable society subject to the inescapable consequences of our unsustainable resource behavior — societal collapse . ”
HOW DID WE GET TO THIS POINT AND AVOIDANCE OF REALITY ?
Dr. Jack Alpert , www.skil.org, wrote , “ Think better or perform genocide ” , “ When you lower a frog into a pot of boiling water , it feels the heat and jumps out .
When you lower a frog into a pot of cold water and then place the pot on the stove and heat it , the frog does not feel the heat , does not jump out , and boils to death .
“ It appears a frog gathers , processes and values , the available information well enough to save its life in the first case , but not in the second .
“ Is it possible that humans think like frogs ?
When immersed in our environment , we cannot appreciate our dangerous destination and cannot identify or change our behavior that would avoid it .
“ Consider that we are experiencing ever increasing social conflict and cannot see it .
We are experiencing ever diminishing wellbeing and cannot see it .
That our progeny will live an animalistic life near subsistence and we ca n’t see it . ”
The question I ask : will we awaken as a civilization before Mother Nature becomes the grim reaper of the 21st century on a scale far greater than ever experienced in history ?
It will be up to the thinkers and doers at this point in time .
You are one of them if you ’re reading this series .
If any of us , no matter what our race , creed or color might be , refuse to engage our U.S. Congress as we have not for 30 years as to the immigration equation — our children will find themselves living in a terribly degraded America where the American Dream will be described by the history books as a ‘ fleeting fantasy ’ from the era of 1950 to 2010 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Bill Gates , the world ’s richest man , said on Monday the U.S. economy could take years to recover from recession and predicted taxes will have to rise to bring the federal budget into balance .
Speaking on ABC ’s Good Morning America , Gates also warned against too much government intervention and urged President Barack Obama to focus policy on long - term issues such as education to combat the effects of the worst recession since the Great Depression .
“ When you have a financial crisis like that , it ’s years of digging out , ” said Gates , who co-founded Microsoft Corp and remains its chairman .
“ The budget ’s very , very out of balance .
And even as the economy comes back , without changes in tax and entitlement policies , it wo n’t get back into balance .
And at some point , financial markets will look at that and it will cause problems , ” he added .
“ Taxes are going to have to go up and entitlements are going to have to be moderated . ”
Gates spoke two days ahead of Obama ’s State of the Union speech , which is expected to focus extensively on economic issues including the need for job creation .
“ We ’re having a slow recovery and everybody ’s frustrated by the pace of the recovery .
But I do n’t think the government could change and magically make it speed up a lot , ” he said .
“ If you try to do too much , it can distort things .
The government ’s role is more of a long term role , investing in education . ”
Gates also said the United States needs its leaders to level with the American people about the long - term challenges the country faces and the sacrifices needed to overcome them .
“ We need leadership for these long - term trade - offs and I ’m hoping that wo n’t cut back a few key areas like aid to poor countries .
But there ’s going to be cutbacks , ” he said .
“ We ’re seeing this at the state level right now , and so far it ’s not being handled very responsibly . ”

a modest humanitarian who probably knows more about Afghanistan than any other American .
The book he co-authored , Three Cups Of Tea , has become required reading for our senior military commanders and Special Forces in Afghanistan .
Generals David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal , now America 's top commander in Afghanistan , have read it .
Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , not only read it but enlisted Mortenson as an unofficial advisor .
Three Cups Of Tea has sold over 3.5 million copies in 41 countries .
And now Greg Mortenson has a new bestseller that continues the saga , Stones Into Schools : Promoting Peace With Books , Not Bombs , In Afghanistan And Pakistan .
Both books tell Mortenson 's remarkable story : how , after a failed attempt to climb K2 , the second highest mountain in the world , he was befriended by villagers who helped him recuperate .
Watching children use sticks to scrawl their lessons in the dirt , he promised to help them build a school .
That first project has led to the construction of 131 schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan , trying to bring knowledge and possibility to more than 58,000 children , both boys and especially girls .
Along the way , Greg Mortenson has learned some invaluable lessons himself -- about patience and compassion and the customs and ways of people about whom the rest of us know too little .
When I heard he was in town , I asked him over to explain if he still believes it 's possible to promote peace and improve lives for people in a war - ravaged country .
I wanted to find out if the bombs are n't winning over books , if the bombs are n't turning his schools back into piles of stone and how war has n't shattered his faith and peace of mind .
Welcome to the JOURNAL .
By a variety of measures , U.S. military policies in the Afghanistan war are failing .
You probably have n’t heard much about this , in part because of the justified media focus on Haiti , but a confluence of very bad indicators point to failure even by the military ’s avowed yardsticks .
The civilian casualty rate in Afghanistan rose significantly in 2009 .
War - related violence is at its peak since 2001 .
The armed resistance to the Kabul government is spreading rapidly and can now “ sustain itself indefinitely ” according to the top military intelligence officer in the region .
Efforts to build the Afghan National Army are flailing , as are pro-government efforts to rebuild infrastructure .
In short , despite the happy talk from General Stanley McChrystal and Admiral James Stavridis , a great many signs indicate that the U.S. - led pro-government coalition is headed for failure .
Westmoreland
It feels like the whole country is holding its collective breath , either fascinated with the catastrophe in Haiti or waiting to see who wins in Massachusetts .
But both of these are a blip on the radar for the people dying and suffering in Afghanistan every day -- yesterday , today , tomorrow .
The Massachusetts results will come when they come ; meanwhile Derrick Crowe and Greg Mortenson each has something worth hearing about Afghanistan .
Greg wrote ---- Three Cups of Tea , the definitive on - the - ground look at life among the Pashtuns .
Last week he was on with Bill Moyers again and watching his segment can almost make up for all the misinformation spewed out by CNN and Fox daily .
If I could embed it , I would .
Meanwhile , you can watch it here at the PBS website .
Here 's part of Moyer 's introduction : Greg 's story is a success story in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Obama , on the other hand is failing , just as Bush did .
Derrick explains at ReThink Afghanistan .
When you put his most recent post together with Mortsenson 's interview , there is almost no way to avoid despair .
Blue America has two pages for donating to people who are fighting against occupation of Afghanistan , one for incumbents and one for challengers .
Interested in helping make sure Congress has members committed to peace instead of war ?

In November Jug Chaudhary , a 30 - year - old mother of four children , was beaten up by her family members and paraded naked around a village in Kailali .
They dragged her out from her home , beat her mercilessly and then forced her to eat human excreta .
Her mother - in - law 's brother had just passed away .
She had been accused of putting a spell on him that caused his death .
In November Jug Chaudhary , a 30 - year - old mother of four children , was beaten up by her family members and paraded naked around a village in Kailali .
They dragged her out from her home , beat her mercilessly and then forced her to eat human excreta .
Her mother - in - law 's brother had just passed away .
She had been accused of putting a spell on him that caused his death .
When Chaudhary 's husband , a labourer in India , returned the couple went to the police station but could not file a complaint .
" They said it was a personal matter , it should be solved in the community . "
Jug Chaudhary did not receive justice .
She is living in the same village , in the same Dalit community as those who accused and assaulted her .
Chaudhary made the journey to Kathmandu to talk at a public forum last week .
It is extremely difficult for her to talk about what she went through publicly .
She has to stop many times and her voice cracks when she describes how helpless she felt when she realised there was noone she could turn to .
She has now decided to leave her four children in the village and move to India to look for jobs .
But she has this to say : " I came all the way to Kathmandu to talk about this because I do not want other Nepali sisters to go through what I did . "
Five other women from Dalit and other minority communities in Lalitpur , Saptari , Siraha , Kailali , Sunsari and Makwanpur also speak at the forum .
Each was branded a witch and humiliated in front of their communities .
In each case the perpetrators have been let off the hook .
Noone has come to apologise to the women for treating them like animals .
They are awaiting justice , but living in fear of being targeted again .
" I can't sleep because I am afraid they are going to come back for me , " says Chaudhary .
These are not the only cases .
But we only hear of those cases where brave women actually talk to journalists and file cases with the police .
There are thousands of Nepali women who quietly bear the ordeal of being labelled a witch .
The victims mostly belong to largely illiterate , extremely poor Dalit communities , considered untouchables in Nepal .
Nepal 's legal system does not have provisions to punish those involved in witch - hunts .
If a complaint is filed and the guilty apprehended they are imprisoned for a short duration and slapped with a fine .
The Ministry of Women , Children and Social Welfare and Nepal 's Women 's Commission are only just recognising the legal vacuum and have drafted laws against the practice .
But we are still a long way from actually having a law that fully addresses this problem .
However , Nepal has been a party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women since 1991 .
This international convention has clear provisions against gender violence .
The state is obligated to amend domestic laws to conform to the spirit of the convention , follow the convention to the letter , or provide legal redress in cases where rights have been violated .
Nepal has also signed nearly two dozen conventions on human rights , all of which touch upon gender violence .
So to say we do n't have laws in place is a cop -out , pure and simple .
Witch - hunting is an extreme form of gender violence and the reason it is not taken seriously is because the victims are usually from marginalised communities .
Nepal 's gender movement has made amazing strides , but it has done little for this community of victims .
Activists in Kathmandu can push for laws against witch - hunting while those in the field can work to spread awareness against the medieval superstitions that target these women .
The Nepal Police , too , needs to include a chapter on how to address crimes related to superstition in their training manuals .
Three years ago in June , the interim parliament declared Nepal an ' untouchability - free nation ' .
Such empty proclamations mean little to women like Jug Chaudhary .
This year , Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal acknowledged the state 's failure to deliver on its promises , saying , " it is unfortunate that we have n't been able to implement this declaration in practice . "
1 . Arthur
According to this article it is necessary for activists to " push for laws against witch - hunting " and " spread awareness " of international conventions in order to prevent such incidents where a woman was " beaten up by her family members and paraded naked around a village in Kailali .
They dragged her out from her home , beat her mercilessly and then forced her to eat human excreta " .
This is very hard for a foreigner to understand .
It seems to be some sort of " NGO mindset " no different from other types of feudal backwardness .
To prevent such incidents it would make more sense to forget such " brave " articles promoting the NGOs and instead mobilize the YCL .
2. Sargam
If the word witch - hunt exists it is not a word invented by Nepalese .
It simply drags us way back to the middle age when so called developed countries like Italy invented the astounding Catholic Church witchcraft process tainted with obscurantism .
It is so sad that some official judiciary actions were not immediately set off so as to make it a telling example of new law and order .
It shows how much Nepal requires a political and social aggiornamento .
3. jange
This kind of opportunistic revenge taking is bound to happen in a situation where the Maoists have not only been given free reign to murder , loot and extort but are considered revolutionary by people who should know better .
It is not a coincidence that these types of events have increased since the Maoists started their murder , loot and extortion .
4. buzz
Arthur , Your opinion about mobilizing YCL is against law and democracy .
YCL does not have authority .
It is a job of police .
YCL is criminal wing of terrorist organization Maoists involved in extortion , kidnapping , murders , smuggling etc .
But your commie brain would not comprehend this .
5. Arthur
Above we see the various forms of feudal mindset at work that allow feudal practices like beating and humiliating witches to continue .
First a journalist calls for the usual donor funding seeking response that achieves nothing - legislation against what is already a crime and " consciousness raising " .
Then Sargam fatalistically says it is " so sad " and complains , in english , that " witch hunting " is a foreign concept .
Then jange repeats his usual mantra on " murder , loot and extortion " and imagines that such incidents have increased " since the Maoists " because now people actually notice them ( at least the article mentions that there are thousands of such cases and we only hear of a few , from which jange could guess that this was nothing remarkable in old Nepal ) .
Then buzz says organizing people to actually confront the witch - hunters and the police who protect them would be " against law and democracy " because that is a job for the authorities , ( who are the police themselves ) .
Nepal still has " 20 layers of apartheid " with even the Dalits at the bottom oppressing each other .
But the worst of these layers are the separation walls in people 's minds that prevent actually seeing both the reality that exists and the reality that it can and will be changed by people 's action .
6. buzz
Arthur ,
Your above comment proves you cannot comprehend beyond the failed philosophy of communism .
Even in China capitalism rules .
During Mao era , there was famine in China which killed millions because of failed policies .
There is apartheid in Nepal .
Maoists are not messiah to end it .
PERIOD .
Look at their track record .
They want one party communism , a dictatorial regime .
Their brutal attacks against dissenting voice is proof of that .
Recent forceful bandh is another example .
Arthur , why do not you tell me , whose job is to maintain law and order ?
One thing Nepal does not need is any foreign idiot barging in our internal affairs .
What do you know about apartheid ?
Your Anglo name definitely makes it really funny to hear about apartheid .
Peace in Nepal and my middle finger up yours Arthur
7. buzz
To add to my initial comment , if its ever get published ( since this site notoriously censors ) I want ask why the hell maoists do not bring any legislation in the parliament ?
Oh yes they are too busy keeping the parliament hostage making a mockery about democracy and rule of law .
8. jange
Mr. Arthur -
It is necessary to impress upon Nepalis that violence will not lead to political , social , or economic progress .
Hence the constant refrain to Maoists ' murder , loot and extortion .
The self styled " revolution " of the Maoists has been an unnecessary distraction that has pushed back the political , social , or economic progressof Nepal by at least a generation .
It is difficult enough to work in Nepal in the best of circumstances .
We really do not need a mafia organisation posing as pseudo revolutionaries murdering , looting , and extorting to make a difficult task even more difficult .
However , you are right about the mantra part .
I suggest that this does become a Mantra and every politician at the beginning , middle and end of his speech should say it - " political , social , or economic progress cannot be achieved by violence .
Violence is detrimental to political , social , or economic progress " .
In the witch hunting context the witch hunters ' methods and mode of thinking are no different to that of the Maoists - using violence to achieve their ends .
9. May
So , Arthur , you are always right and everyone else is wrong .
And you have the answer to everything with your totalitarian commie brain .
10 . ashuosh
The doctrine of development runs deep in certain circles , the nuts and bolts of the anti-politics machine .
11 . Sargam
As of now a goon starts searching in the writings of others his utter deficiency in the knowledge of societal events ; all of a sudden there is a tilt that occurs in his pea-brain to search in the past as to what made the fame of the historical rhetorics of Marxism and Maoism .
Here we find him desperately searching to impress us with his vain try to bring us into the field of feudalism .
Feudalism is dead and burried since the middle ages .
We want to explore the new horizon of interests of our time that could add to the knowledge of our mind so that if possible we could extend our helping hand to improve the present situation of Nepal .
Nothing but something concrete materializing , you got it ?
Otherwise his ' master 's voice ' will order him to be obliged to dispense with his services .
There is a saying that goes as follows ( in Nepali ) : " Kukkurko puchar barah barsa dhungroma rakhe pani tedroko tedrai . "
That means the dog's tail remains always curled even if you put it for twelve years in a bottle .
12 . Arthur
No May , only those who pretend that " political social and economic progress " can be achieved by donors paying people like jange to sing NGO platitudes as a mantra are wrong .
buzz can now proceed with his " legislation " and jange with his mantras but women will continue to be beaten as witches until the witchunters are forcibly repressed .
Study a little history and you will learn that feudalism was suppressed in the West by revolutionary violence and only then was political social and economic progress unleashed .
The democratic revolutions in Britain and France were much more violent than anything Nepal has seen and the American war against the slaveowners makes Prachanda look like a disciple of gandhi .
13 . jange
Thank you Mr. Arthur for your logical consistency .
So , you think importing NGO platitudes ( presumably from America / Britain / France ) and applying them in Nepal will not work but importing revolutionary violence from those very same places will work .
It looks like you have a deep knowledge of history .
Surely then , the intelligent thing to do would be to learn from that history so that Nepalis do n't have to repeat the same mistakes .
I am sure Nepalis would appreciate the lessons that you have learned from history and advice on how to do things better .
Or , do you think that the only way to achieve " political social and economic progress " is by violence ?
14 . Arthur
Yes jange , " the intelligent thing to do would be to learn from that history so that Nepalis do n't have to repeat the same mistakes " .
Nepal 's reactionaries were not intelligent enough to avoid repeating those mistakes once , so there was a People 's War .
They now have a chance to avoid repeating those mistakes a second time , by accepting civilian supremacy and carrying out the peace agreement to democratize the feudal army .
If instead you cling to it as a last hope against the people , social and economic progress will still be achieved in Nepal , and women will not be beaten as witches forever , but the changes that must come will come violently .
15 . rishav
Abuse and ill treatment of women is not anything new in Nepal .
The difference now being that a few women have finally been able to speak about it thats all .
There is no political reason why they have been able to come forward , may be the aide of womens groups and journalists have brought this issue to our attention .
I have recently seen a channel 4
Uk documentary of the ill treatment of young nepali widows , very upsetting to see what these women folk have to go through .
The current government policy of setting a side a few rupees for men to marry widows really tells you their mindset in dealing with the ill treatment of our women folk .
I would really hate to see the fate of our women folk to be used as a political issue for our parties to gain points over each other .
I feel that all parties need to sit down and realise what is happening and take the necessary steps forward .
16 . buzz
Arthur , Dictatorship cannot be a substitute .
Your mantra of communism will end all social evil is freaking hilarious .
Whom are you kidding ?
Your arguments do not have substance .
Show facts and logic instead of dead philosophy which has failed miserably .
How does your example of US , UK and France are applicable in Nepal ?
They do not have communism .
17 . Arthur
buzz , the article is about witch - hunting .
you have nothing to say about what should be done .
instead you string together phrases on your favorite topic at random and with no connection to anything anybody else has said .
no wonder you are called " buzz " .
18 . buzz
Arthur ,
How convenient , is n't it ?
You are dragging the subject of witch hunting to communists propaganda .
I went straight to the bottomline .
You do n't have any substance so you are going after my nick .
How matured ?
Get a life .
19 . Manfred
Sorry , witch - hunting is stone - age mentality , has nothing to do with political orientation but rather reflects the inability of society to deal with wrong - doing , which in the year 2010 can only be declared sick & barbaric !
20 . Manfred
Ehmm , my comment " is waiting moderation " ? -
Do you mean " censorship " ? -
This is really stone - age journalism !
21 . Satya Nepali
Jange , I 'm no fan of donors and NGOs , but absolutely enjoyed your comment no .
13 . .. Arthur , I 'm really beginning to doubt your ' foreign ' credentials ...
22 . Arthur
Re 21 , being foreign means that I do not speak any languages of Nepal and therefore cannot have a deep understanding , no matter how much I read about Nepal in english .
That is not a " credential " but a disability .
But some things are easy to see from outside .
In particular it is easy for a foreigner to see that the " democratic " , " non-violent " pose of so much of Kathmandu 's middle class goes together with a fatalistic toleration of medieval barbarity like witch - hunting , expressed by idle chatter about " legislation " and " consciousness raising " that only provides jobs for that class instead of actually supporting the necessary forcible suppression of witch - hunters .
The Maoists look " alien " to you because you are aliens to the modern world .
From a " foreign " perspective they look like fellow citizens of the 21st century who would forcibly suppress witchunting like any other modern , " foreign " person , instead of " democratically " tolerating it .
23 . buzz
Arthur ,
You are full of it .
You are hypocrite .
You are talking in a way that Nepalis have never been in any foreign land .
What do you say about prevailing racism in western Europe and USA .
What do you say about assassination of abortion doctor of Kansas by domestic terrorist ?
What do you say about FOX news channel in USA ?
What do you say about racial riots in Australia ?
Whom are you kidding ?

buzz , we are not discussing racism in other countries but witchunting in Nepal .
But certainly exactly the same tactics are used by defenders of racism in Western countries as you are using to defend witchunting in Nepal - they will point to some other problem , somewhere else , or else call for " additional legislation " instead of actual suppression .
But generally speaking they are less successful than in Nepal .
Racist crimes do often actually get punished instead of being treated as a " personal affair " .
As for Fox news it is correctly regarded as backward and reactionary in the USA , but it might be considered " extreme left " in Nepal .
For example it is difficult to imagine even Fox News proposing that the response to women being beaten and humiliated should be pass new laws or " spread awareness " .
25 . Neil J
Forget all this pro Maoist , anti Maoist , reactionary , revolutionary , nonsense and focus on the facts .
An innocent woman has been severely assaulted and forced to eat human excrement .
You do n't need new laws to combat witchcraft .
You need to enforce your existing laws .
Until you can maintain even basic law and order you country will be broken .
26 . buzz
Arthur , I am not defending withchunting in Nepal .
This should be dealt based on prevailing laws .
If the laws are not enough , introduce it through proper channels .
Make the system work .
Nobody should be above system .
Not even your God Maoists .
You arguments do not have any substance .
Your idea of maoists being messaih is a fallacy .
And Fox News is a No.1 News Channel .
USA elected Bush twice .
Racist crime do not always get punished as you said .
And I am not defending this writer either .
She is idiot .
27 . Arthur
The article explains clearly that the police refused to act : " They said it was a personal matter , it should be solved in the community . "
This means the police are protecting the witch - hunters .
There is no " proper channel " .
Force is required to establish a system .
The system required must intimidate the witch - hunters and their protectors so that they are afraid to behave this way again and the " witches " feel safe to live proudly in the village .
Both the police and the witch - hunters directly responsible should be captured , paraded through the village , forced to apologize to the " witches " and required to pay compensation , if necessary through forced labour .
This will be denounced as violence , looting and extortion .
It will work .

I agree with Neil J.. some of our commentators are missing the point and seems their arguements does not carry much substance and hey BUZZ you can't blindly say that the author of this article is " idiot " just like tat .
Have some decency and this statement of your 's make whole of your arguement meaningless and crap .
do u realize that ??
Arthur has reasonable arguement .
What will each one of us do if someone near and dear to us is branded " Witch " and " paraded naked " ?
Just simple , i might in a blind fury do what i am supposed to do ( u can imagine !!! ) .
However , that does n't solve the problem so STATE has to act meaningfully and severely punish those culprits ...

The first farmers to arrive in Britain outbred the native hunter - gatherer men and have left their mark in modern males ' Y chromosome
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Most men in Britain are descended from the first farmers to migrate across Europe from the Near East 10,000 years ago , scientists say .
Ancient farmers left their genetic mark on modern males by breeding more successfully than indigenous hunter - gatherer men as they made their way west , a study has found .
As a result , more than 60 % of British men , and nearly all of those in Ireland , can trace their Y chromosome back to the agricultural revolution , or more precisely the sexual success of the men behind it .
The farmers ' Y chromosome becomes more common in the west of England and reaches a national peak of 78 % in Cornwall , scientists found .
Men with surnames including Titchmarsh and Haythornthwaite are among the most likely to carry the farmers ' Y chromosome , known as R1b1b2 .
The Y chromosome is passed down the male line only , from father to son .
" These farmers expanded into territories with small and sparse hunter - gather populations and moved on as time passed .
The Y chromosome got caught up in that and it surfed the wave of expansion , " said Mark Jobling , a geneticist at Leicester University and an author of the study .
The rise of farming is one of the most important cultural transformations in the history of modern humans .
Increased food production allowed communities to settle rather than wander in search for food , a shift that heralded the huge expansion of the human population .
The first European farmers came from the " fertile crescent " that stretched from the eastern Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf , but experts have argued whether the westerly spread of agriculture was driven by the cultural transmission of ideas and technology , or by migrating farmers .
Researchers led by Jobling collected DNA samples from more than 2,500 men across Europe .
Around 80 % of the men had the R1b1b2 type of Y chromosome , making it the most common lineage on the continent .
A map showing the distribution of the chromosome across Britain reveals that it became increasingly common but less genetically diverse from the south east to the north west .
The analysis , published in the journal PLoS Biology , suggests the R1b1b2 Y chromosome entered the country with the earliest farmers in the south east and gradually spread west as they migrated .
Genetic tests on women showed that most are descendants of hunter - gatherer females .
" To us , this suggests a reproductive advantage for farming males over indigenous hunter - gatherer males during the switch from hunting and gathering to farming , " said Patricia Balaresque , a co-author of the study .
" Maybe back then , it was just sexier to be a farmer . "
How Met Office blocked questions on its own man 's role in ' hockey stick ' climate row
Ignored concerns : Professor Mitchell approved controversial report
The Meteorological Office is blocking public scrutiny of the central role played by its top climate scientist in a highly controversial report by the beleaguered United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
Professor John Mitchell , the Met Office ’s Director of Climate Science , shared responsibility for the most worrying headline in the 2007 Nobel Prize - winning IPCC report – that the Earth is now hotter than at any time in the past 1,300 years .
And he approved the inclusion in the report of the famous ‘ hockey stick ’ graph , showing centuries of level or declining temperatures until a steep 20th Century rise .
By the time the 2007 report was being written , the graph had been heavily criticised by climate sceptics who had shown it minimised the ‘ medieval warm period ’ around 1000 AD , when the Vikings established farming settlements in Greenland .
In fact , according to some scientists , the planet was then as warm , or even warmer , than it is today .
Early drafts of the report were fiercely contested by official IPCC reviewers , who cited other scientific papers stating that the 1,300 - year claim and the graph were inaccurate .
But the final version , approved by Prof Mitchell , the relevant chapter ’s review editor , swept aside these concerns .
Now , the Met Office is refusing to disclose Prof Mitchell ’s working papers and correspondence with his IPCC colleagues in response to requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act .
The block has been endorsed in writing by Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth – whose department has responsibility for the Met Office .
Documents obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveal that the Met Office ’s stonewalling was part of a co-ordinated , legally questionable strategy by climate change academics linked with the IPCC to block access to outsiders .
Last month , the Information Commissioner ruled that scientists from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia – the source of the leaked ‘ Warmergate ’ emails – acted unlawfully in refusing FOI requests to share their data .
Some of the FOI requests made to them came from the same person who has made requests to the Met Office .
He is David Holland , an electrical engineer familiar with advanced statistics who has written several papers questioning orthodox thinking on global warming .
The Met Office ’s first response to Mr Holland was a claim that Prof Mitchell ’s records had been ‘ deleted ’ from its computers .
Later , officials admitted they did exist after all , but could not be disclosed because they were ‘ personal ’ , and had nothing to do with the professor ’s Met Office job .
Finally , they conceded that this too was misleading because Prof Mitchell had been paid by the Met Office for his IPCC work and had received Government expenses to travel to IPCC meetings .
The Met Office had even boasted of his role in a Press release when the report first came out .
But disclosure , they added , was still rejected on the grounds it would ‘ inhibit the free and frank provision of advice or the free and frank provision of views ’ .
It would also ‘ prejudice Britain ’s relationship with an international organisation ’ and thus be contrary to UK interests .
In a written response justifying the refusal dated August 20 , 2008 , Mr Ainsworth – then MoD Minister of State – used exactly the same language .
Mr Holland also filed a request for the papers kept by Sir Brian Hoskins of Reading University , who was the review editor of a different chapter of the IPCC report .
When this too was refused , Mr Holland used the Data Protection Act to obtain a copy of an email from Sir Brian to the university ’s information officer .
The email , dated July 17 , 2008 – when Mr Holland was also trying to get material from the Met Office and the CRU – provides clear evidence of a co-ordinated effort to hide data .
Sir Brian wrote :
‘ I have made enquiries and found that both the Met Office / MOD and UEA are resisting the FOI requests made by Holland .
The latter are very relevant to us , as UK universities should speak with the same voice on this .
I gather that they are using academic freedom as their reason . ’
At the CRU , as the Warmergate emails reveal , its director , Dr Phil Jones ( who is currently suspended ) , wrote to an American colleague :
‘[ We are ] still getting FOI requests as well as Reading .
All our FOI officers have been in discussions and are now using the same exceptions – not to respond . ’
Last night Benny Peiser , director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation , said the affair further undermined the credibility of the IPCC and those associated with it .
He said :
‘ It ’s of critical importance that data such as this should be open .
More importantly , the questions being raised about the hockey stick mean that we may have to reassess the climate history of the past 2,000 years .
‘ The attempt to make the medieval warm period disappear is being seriously weakened , and the claim that now is the warmest time for 1,300 years is no longer based on reliable evidence . ’
Despite repeated requests , the MoD and Met Office failed to comment .
‘ Democratic Party must demonstrate it has the ability to govern ’
WASHINGTON — Deeply disillusioned last week by his party ’s insufficient response to the recession , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) said Thursday he views President Obama ’s State of the Union as a step in the right direction but urged him to “ be much bolder . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It would be helpful if he could take a page from Franklin Roosevelt , ” Kucinich told Raw Story in an exclusive interview .
“ FDR saw the need for broad structural changes in the economy and also the need for government to invest and put America back to work . ”
“ If we ca n’t fix our economic injustices and improve the standard of living for regular people , we could lose our country . ”
While Obama explicitly called for a new “ jobs bill ” in the speech , he did n’t put forth many details .
What kinds of reforms would Kucinich like to see ?
“ We need investments on a massive scale — in the areas of job creation , health care , education , housing .
That could change everything . ”
“ Is there still time ?
Yes , ” he added .
“ But we lost a year .
And now we need the president to truly rally the nation in a ringing , clarion call for economic reform .
The Democratic Party must demonstrate to the people that it has the ability to govern . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Wall Street can not be left to its own designs , ” he added .
“ We allowed that and the economy collapsed , in an orgy of deregulation and exotic financial instruments . ”
The congressman ’s support for financial regulatory reform has been echoed by many Democrats and met with skepticism from Republicans , who warn over - regulating will stifle innovation .
Kucinich , a widely respected progressive champion , said Obama “ underestimates his own ability to lift up the nation , and that ’s why I would advise him to look to do great things .
If he calls upon the nation to take bold measures , I think the nation would respond . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ He could still be the transformational leader that so many have seen him to be , ” he said .
The congressman from Ohio slammed Obama ’s economic team for having “ yet to demonstrate that they can help America regain economic momentum for Main Street ” and alleged many of their suggested policies “ run contrary the president ’s instincts . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
While he did n’t call for them to resign , he strongly hinted it should happen .
“ If they refuse to change direction and ca n’t see any other way out , then the president ’s going to have to consider making some changes . ”
Following recent revelations of secret deals with AIG , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has faced heavy criticism from Republicans and Democrats .
Proposes 1 m new jobs bill , hits spending freeze as ‘ drag on recovery ’
ADVERTISEMENT
As Raw Story reported Tuesday , Kucinich will soon introduce a program that he estimates will create one million jobs , and said he hopes it will be included in the president ’s bill .
It reduces the age at which retirees can receive Social Security benefits to 60 instead of 65 , which he alleges will create many more openings for younger and unemployed individuals .
Kucinich said Obama ’s focus must be on improving conditions for the working poor and middle class .
“ A rising tide lifts all boats , ” he said , “ and unfortunately at this point the rising tide of unemployment is swamping a lot of boats , and so we need to give the people some hope that they can stay afloat economically . ”
“ The president really does have an ability to bring people together , ” he said .
“ Whether or not those people are in the House of Senate is another matter , but the president ’s programs need to be much bolder . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Reflecting the concerns of many progressives , Kucinich ripped Obama ’s proposed spending freeze that begins next year , alleging “ it ’ll have a minimal impact on the deficit but could be a drag on recovery . ”
“ If we want to lift up the economy , social spending is the way to do it , ” he said .
“ Discretionary spending is being frozen for programs like the NIH , education , infrastructure building programs — that ’s where we can get a return on investment . ”
Numerous conservatives responded to the idea by claiming Obama made a huge concession to their ideology .
A spokesman for House Minority Leader Rep. John Boehner ( R - OH ) mocked it as “ going on a diet after winning a pie-eating contest , ” Politico reported .
Still opposes health care bill ‘ injustices ’
ADVERTISEMENT
Injecting renewed optimism on the health care front , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) affirmed today the House will work out a compromise to pass an amended Senate bill , which can then be signed into law by the president .
Kucinich said he ’s unlikely to vote for it even with the proposed changes , such as eliminating the excise tax on health benefits , which was one major concern of House progressives .
He called individual mandate to purchase insurance a “ fundamental flaw ” with the legislation as it “ leaves the insurance companies in charge . ”
He said party leaders “ need to go back to the drawing board . ”
Progressive economists and health policy experts such as Paul Krugman and Jonathan Cohn have argued the mandate is necessary to prevent a “ death spiral ” of rising costs , as it would bring young and healthy people into the system .
“ It furthers the injustices of the system by redistributing the wealth of the nation to the top — in this case to private insurance companies . ”
Kucinich responded .

People often complain about those seemingly smug married couples who constantly refer to themselves as " we . "
But a new study from the University of California , Berkeley , suggests that spouses who use " we-ness " language are better able to resolve conflicts than those who do n't .
UC Berkeley researchers analyzed conversations between 154 middle - aged and older couples about points of disagreement in their marriages and found that those who used pronouns such as " we , " " our " and " us " behaved more positively toward one another and showed less physiological stress .
In contrast , couples who emphasized their " separateness " by using pronouns such as " I , " " me " and " you " were found to be less satisfied in their marriages .
This was especially true for older couples .
Their use of separateness pronouns was most strongly linked to unhappy marriages , according to the study .
Moreover , the study found that older couples identified more as " we " than did their middle - aged counterparts , suggesting that facing obstacles and overcoming challenges together over the long haul , including raising families , may give couples a greater sense of shared identity .
" Individuality is a deeply ingrained value in American society , but , at least in the realm of marriage , being part of a ' we ' is well worth giving up a bit of ' me , ' " said UC Berkeley psychology professor Robert Levenson , a co-author of the study published last semester in the journal Psychology and Aging .
Previous studies have established that the use of " we-ness " or " separateness " language is a strong indicator of marital satisfaction in younger couples .
These latest findings , however , take this several steps further by showing how powerful this correlation is in more established couples , linking it to the emotions and physiological responses that occur when spouses either team up or become polarized in the face of disagreements , researchers said .
" The use of ' we ' language is a natural outgrowth of a sense of partnership , of being on the same team , and confidence in being able to face problems together , " said study co-author Benjamin Seider , a graduate student in psychology at UC Berkeley .
In addition to Seider and Levenson , co-authors of the study are Gilad Hirschberger and Kristin Nelson , who conducted their research while at UC Berkeley 's Institute of Personality and Social Research .
After four trials , five years of effort and untold amounts of money dedicated to putting John A. Gotti in prison , the federal government has given up .
On Wednesday evening , the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York , Preet Bharara , announced in a terse statement that the government had decided not to further pursue charges against him .
The move solidified Mr. Gotti ’s legendary record against the federal government , which has tried four times to have him convicted of charges including racketeering and murder conspiracy .
Each case ended in a mistrial .
“ In light of the circumstances , the government has decided not to proceed with the prosecution against John A. Gotti , ” Mr. Bharara said in the statement .
“ Today we submitted a proposed order of nolle prosequi to the court .
The order has been approved by the presiding United States district judge , and thus the prosecution of the case has ended . ”
The order — a Latin phrase meaning “ to be unwilling to pursue ” — ended a saga that began in 2004 , when Mr. Gotti was charged with securities fraud , extortion and loan sharking .
Among the charges he faced in the four trials were accusations that he plotted to kidnap the radio talk show host Curtis Sliwa , murdered at least two men and ran a vast drug trafficking ring .
Mr. Gotti employed an unusual defense , saying he had once been a gangster , even taking the reins of the Gambino crime family , but asserting that he had broken ties with the mob and was not guilty of the crimes he was accused of .
This semiconfession apparently persuaded some jurors each time .
After Mr. Gotti ’s final trial , which ended in early December , jurors said the government should end its pursuit of Mr. Gotti .
“ They should stop this now — it ’s ridiculous , ” one juror said .
Mr. Gotti can now claim a record of sorts that surpasses that of his father , John J. Gotti , who earned the nickname Teflon Don after avoiding conviction by the federal government three times .
On the government ’s fourth try , in 1992 , the senior Gotti was convicted of racketeering and murder and sent to prison .
He died in prison 10 years later .
CAMBRIDGE , Mass .
( AP ) — Robert Parker , the author of the popular " Spenser " novels about a hard - nosed Boston private investigator , has died .
He was 77 .
A spokeswoman for the Cambridge police department says an ambulance was sent to Parker 's home at about 11 a.m. Monday for reports of a sudden death .
The spokeswoman , Alexa Manocchio , says the death was of " natural causes " and is not considered suspicious .
A publicist for Parker 's publisher confirmed the death but had no further details .
Parker wrote more than 50 novels , including 37 featuring Spenser .
The character was the basis for the 1980s TV series " Spenser : For Hire , " starring Robert Urich .
Heavy Rain should n't have much going for it .
Developed by a man known for his failure to properly end his last big game and filled with what look like quick - time events , it 's endlessly dour and depressing ... while being exclusive to the PlayStation 3 .
We said before that there is a good chance Heavy Rain is going to fail .
That being said , our time with the game proved it to be a savvy , impressive , and often chilling experience .
If you 're a fan of story - driven single - player games , do yourself a favor and at least rent the game .
Get through the first few scenes , and give it an hour or two to allow it to grab you .
Yes , that 's a large investment on a game that is going to leave some cold .
For those who are drawn in , however , this is something of an achievement in the art of gaming .

The Story
This is a game that will be more enjoyable the less you know , so we 'll try to keep details of the story and the characters light in this review .
You 'll be asking yourself who the protagonist of the game is , and when the story actually began , and you could possibly change your mind about both questions multiple times throughout the game .
Heavy Rain is the story of four people who find themselves dealing with a dark time in their lives .
How they get through this period , and what they do to themselves and others , is up to the player .
The main characters are a father , a private investigator , an FBI agent , and a ... well , a woman .
How you figure out who that woman is and what she 's doing there is an amazing piece of stagecraft — a character says something off - handedly to himself in a seemingly unrelated scene and everything is made clear .
There are more than a few scenes like this , where tiny pieces of information are given out , and these point you towards the conclusion .
The dour atmosphere owes much to the ever - present rain , and in another clever touch the rain itself ties into the main storyline .
What happens to these four people and the characters around them ?
That 's up to you .
The game can end well , or it can turn into a tragedy .
During my first playthrough for this review — and I can't wait to play again — I tried my damnedest to keep everyone alive .
I failed .
The graphics are an uneven bag .
Some scenes look much better than others , although nothing looks bad .
It can feel somewhat jarring at times to move from environment to environment and see a jump forward or a fall back in detail and polish .
Inaction : the only thing scarier than your decisions
Everything in the game is controlled by context - sensitive movements and button - presses , but the way they are shown on screen and how they influence the action is where the genius of the control scheme shines through .
In some cases , you 'll have to hold down one button , and then another , and then another .
This can lead to your hands doing weird things on the DualShock 3 , and you 'll have to get rid of your notions of how the controller fits in your hand during some of these challenges .
This may sound weird , or even counter - intuitive , but these challenges are put in places where your character is being subjected to heavy emotional or physical stress .
You 're supposed to feel like you 're on the edge of failure and pushing your dexterity to the limit , because that matches what the game is putting its characters through .
I can't describe what I mean in detail because that would ruin a few plot and character moments .
What happens if you fail a challenge ?
Maybe you get punched , maybe the action of the screen alters , maybe nothing .
If you continue to fail , however , you 'll go down the list of adverse outcomes .
It 's very possible one of the characters will die .
When that happens , the game soldiers on , and the narrative continues without that character 's participation .
Being put in some of these positions while knowing that death is a real possibility gives the game an edge that I was n't used to , and that made some of the scenes uncomfortable to play .
You 'll also be forced to make very quick decisions , and what you do or do n't do may mean death for you or someone else .
This is n't a game where you get a binary choice between a " good " action or a " bad " action .
In many cases , even after the scene was over , I asked myself if I had done the right thing .
Do n't take too much time to weigh your options ; inaction may lead to something you 're even less comfortable with .
You 'll also need to be extremely observant .
Things that seemed like small details , actions that did n't seem to have any consequences , details that seemed too small to matter — they can all come back and bite you in the ass if you 're not paying attention .
Again , the consequences may be nothing , or they could be great .
The game does n't play by the rules you 're used to , and that 's refreshing .

From Cy Ryan at the Las Vegas Sun : Report : Casinos lost money for second time in history
The state Gaming Control Board today released its “ Gaming Abstract ” for fiscal year 2009 , which ended June 30 , showing a net loss of $ 6.7 billion among the 260 major casinos in Nevada .
Clubs along the Las Vegas Strip , which makes up 53 percent of the gambling revenue in Nevada , registered a $ 4.1 billion loss .
...
The only other time Nevada gaming companies reported a loss was in 2003 , of $ 33.5 million , said Frank Streshley , chief of tax and licensing for the board .
Total revenues were down from $ 25.0 billion in fiscal 2008 to $ 22.0 billion in fiscal 2009 .
Gambling was off 12.7 % , room revenue off 16.6 % ( hotels are getting crushed everywhere ) , but beverage sales were flat !
Rooms occupied ( number of nights ) declined from 42.8 million in 2008 ( occupancy rate of 86.8 % ) to 41.6 million in 2009 or 82.2 % occupancy rate .
The average daily rate ( ADR ) declined from $ 119.46 in 2008 to $ 102.46 in 2009 .
In addition to the $ 3 billion decrease in revenue , the casinos saw a $ 4.8 billion increase in Other G&A expenses - probably from write downs of bad investments .
Also casino payroll employment was off 12.3 % or almost 25,000 employees .

Construction is dead - and will be for some time because of all the excess capacity .
And gaming is struggling too .

I think we should make it a major goal to have a really nice " CLLARE Project Overview " document ready before the end of January .
This document will briefly explain what CLLARE and CSTART are , will outline the mission ( i.e. describe our lunar orbit rendezvous plan etc ) , will introduce all the core hardware components , will discuss our launch options and have as many accurate mass and cost estimates for everything as we can possibly manage .
This document will be an excellent help to us .
It will help us convince people that we are serious and competent , it will help to get people excited about the idea by showing them how simply and cheaply it can be done .
We can post links to this document to /r/ space and /r/ science with provocative headlines like " CLLARE : an open source US $ 50 m manned moon mission designed by CSTART , an open source space agency born on Reddit " – that is the sort of thing that should get heavily upmodded .
We can also ( probably before that ) give copies of this document to the experienced outsiders we are on good terms with ( Peter Madsen from Copenhagen Suborbitals , Gary Schneider from Open Luna ) and ask for their ideas to get really good , specific feedback .
Basically this will be a huge help to the project and will bring us to the point where we just need more experienced people in to refine the details .
Those of us who are n't engineers can then focus without distraction on finally getting all the legal corporate stuff taken care of .
I do n't have a lot of spare time this weekend to work on this , but I threw together a partially complete concept last night to get the ball rolling .
It 's a pdf file ( complete with links into our Wiki at appropriate points ) , you can grab it here ( aside : I wanted to upload it to the Wiki , but it said I could n't upload a .pdf , can we reconfigure the Wiki so this is possible ? ) .
There 's a lot more work to do , but this gives you a sense of the flavour of what I think we should aim for .
I 'd really like to see a lot of collaboration on this .
Obviously the core members from this forum who know the plan and the hardware best will need to be involved , but this is also the kind of thing we should try to recruit new members from Reddit for .
People with good graphics and CAD skills should be able to pitch in by helping to provide as many diagrams and concept figures as we think is useful .
People with good marketing / PR skills can make sure we word things as effectively as possible , and anybody at all can check the spelling or let us know when things are unclear to people who are meeting CLLARE for the first time .
We want to make sure this document is as good as possible and we should try to activate the community as much as we can to achieve this .
There are 18 votes on the 2nd phase of the motto competition already , that shows that there are interested people watching us , let 's try to get them involved !
I will submit a link to this post to /r/ tothemoon to help facilitate this .
With regards to actually working on it , there are a few things to make clear .
Firstly , this is absolutely something that we should be using our Mercurial repository for .
I have created a clone repository for myself to work on this in .
I am not sure whether or not the best approach would be for other people to clone my clone and merge all changes there , pushing from my clone to the main repository , or to have other people produce their own clones of the main repository and for us to try to keep them all in sync .
Whatever works , works , I suppose .
I do n't want anybody to feel like they can't contribute to this because they do n't know Mercurial so if you can't figure out how to do something or you just can't be bothered , instead of doing nothing just post your material in this forum or email it to me and I will make sure it gets in .
Secondly , the document is produced using LaTeX .
For the unfamiliar , LaTeX is a typesetting proram that is very popular in academia and in the publishing sector .
It takes a plain text file of marked up text ( sort of similar to a HTML file ) and turns it into a pdf ( or a few other formats ) in such a way that it looks really professional and clean .
It automatically takes care of all the presentation issues , builds tables of contents of reference lists , etc. and just lets you focus on your actual material .
It also has incredible support for formatting very complicated mathematical equations , chemical formulae , etc .
This is why LaTeX is the practically the only thing used to produce papers in the engineering , science and maths part of academia .
There is a bit of a learning curve if you are new to LaTeX , but there is heaps of documentation online , including a WikiBook .
I tried to make sure that my first version included examples of how to do most things that someone might want to do , so that they can just look at my code and generalise from it .
The code for my version is visible online here ( not line wrapped , sorry ) .
This one file , cllare_overview.tex is the only file that needs to be modified to produce a new version of the pdf , contributing to this document is basically a matter of contributing to this . tex file .
I do n't want anybody to feel like they can't contribute to this because they do n't know LaTeX so if you can't figure out how to do something or you just can't be bothered , instead of doing nothing just post your material in this forum or email it to me as plain old text and I will make sure it gets in .
That 's about it from me .
Please start throwing out ideas !
Be bold !
Write snippets of text , or entire tracts , produce diagrams , make CAD models , basically use whatever skills you have to help make this document shine .
If you have skills and want to contribute but you do n't know what to do , just let us know what you can do and somebody will point you in a useful direction .

Officials at the UN say between 100 and 150 people from its 9,000 - strong peacekeeping mission in Haiti are still missing after the earthquake .
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon listed 16 peacekeeping soldiers and police who are known to have died .
The UN said it urgently needed medical support and rescue teams with heavy lifting equipment .
The head of UN peacekeeping , Alain Le Roy , said UN police and troops in Haiti had secured the port and airport .
They were also patrolling and helping clear roads , he added .
Top officials missing
Among those missing are UN mission head Hedi Annabi of Tunisia and his chief deputy , Luis Carlos da Costa .
Hedi Annabi is a Tunisian diplomat
Edmond Mulet , Mr Annabi 's predecessor , is on his way to Port - au - Prince to take charge of the peacekeeping mission in an interim capacity .
Ten Brazilian peacekeepers , three from Jordan and a Haitian staff member are among those confirmed to have died .
China 's state media said eight Chinese were dead and 10 more missing .
The UN said earlier that at least 56 of its staff had been injured in the earthquake .
The Minustah mission has been in Haiti since 2004 , following the ousting of President Jean - Bertrand Aristide .
Its mandate is to maintain law and order in the impoverished and often violent state and to administer security during election periods .
Minustah , an acronym from the French Mission Nations Unies de Stabilisation en Haiti , has about 9,000 multinational peacekeepers .
Brazil is the biggest contributor and is in charge .
Brazilian anxiety
A UN logistical base near the airport is functioning and the UN expects to get an emergency response team on the ground shortly .
Brazil took charge of the Minustah operation in 2004 .
The BBC's Gary Duffy in Sao Paulo says that given Brazil 's central role the earthquake has caused a lot of concern and shock .
He says it has been a desperately worrying time for the families of the more than 1,200 Brazilian soldiers in the UN mission .
Some soldiers have managed to make contact to reassure relatives , but given the damage to infrastructure at Brazilian bases , communication is proving difficult , even for the government , our correspondent says .
Brazil 's leadership of the UN mission has been difficult , amid continuing gang violence .
Minustah has been criticised by business leaders for being too lenient and by rights groups for using excessive force .
A brief encounter with James Cameron , the biggest director on the planet , on the weekend " Avatar " comes out in theaters .
A chance to get advice from the master .

Exclusive Record label trade association the BPI wants sweeping changes to UK online copyright practice in 11th hour amendments to the Digital Britain bill .
The amendments would grant copyright holders injunctions against websites and service providers similar to the US DMCA act - but with no ' safe harbour ' provision to verify whether the claim is merited , according to documents seen by The Register .
The BPI amendments would introduce an entirely new Section 97B of the 1988 Copyright Design and Patent Act , and would be granted when an ISP had refused to take down infringing material .
The Secretary of State would have the ability to review and amend the provision " by allowing the injunctive relief available to the Court to evolve and to keep pace with technology " .
As it stands in draft form , the Digital Britain bill would compel rightsholders to identify and notify infringers , in a " graduated " response , ultimately ending in temporary suspension of Internet access .
The revised Section 97B , if passed , would dramatically switch the burden from rights holder to publisher .
The BPI believes it is analogous to defamation injunctions , where publication and distribution of an entire work can be halted because of an offending passage .
" Any concerns regarding Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights ( the right to a fair hearing ) are dealt with by the fact that the service provider would be a full and active party in the proceedings , " the BPI writes , somewhat hopefully .
In a statement , the BPI told us :
“ Clause 17 is an essential component of the Bill since it provides a mechanism to deal with the increasing threat of illegal downloading from non -P2P sources and other future threats .
In light of the ongoing debate on the current draft of Clause 17 , we thought it prudent to propose possible alternative approaches , including a straw - man s.97B .
However , Clause 17 remains our favoured approach to address forms of online infringement other than P2P filesharing . ”
The amendment game
With the Lords due to debate the Digital Britain Bill today , the ISP trade association ISPA and major labels are both lobbying hard , tabling dozens of amendments .
One by Conservative peer Lord Lucas would put search engines above the law , making them immune to any copyright claims at all .
According to Paid Content , Google would be free to store and distribute anything it wanted , selectively abolishing copyright .
Interestingly the BPI justifies the new Clause 17 on the basis that the current draft " does not command support of the main opposition parties . "
ISPA declined to provide a comment .

Iraq war was illegal , Dutch panel rules | World news | guardian.co.uk
Of course it was illegal .
There are only two conditions under which war may be launched according to the United Nations Charter , which most countries have signed .
One is self - defense .
Iraq did not attack the US in 2003 .
The other is if the UN Security Council authorizes a war , as with the Gulf War where collective security was invoked to push back the aggression on Kuwait .
The UNSC could also authorize intervention to stop genocide , e.g .
Craig Murray , then a UK ambassador to a Muslim - majority country who was copied with diplomatic positions from London , confirms that the initial position of the Blair government was that previous UNSC resolutions did not provide an automatic trigger for war .
The British inquiry into the Iraq War , which sheds loads of illumination on the Bushies ’ lies and crimes , is being studiously ignored by US mass media .
There was no UNSC authorization , and no issue of self - defense .
The most egregious violation of the post - World War II international order by a major Power we have yet seen .
I said all this in my first blog posting here at Informed Comment in April of 2002 .
You kind of hope it means Bush , Cheney , Rice , Hadley and the Neocons can never safely vacation in Europe again .

Amorous British backpackers ' to blame for spread of STDs Down Under '
Risky : British backpackers in Australia have triple the number of sexual partners they would have at home
British backpackers in Australia have triple the number of sexual partners they would have at home – and are potentially spreading sexually - transmitted diseases with their risky behaviour .
British and Australian researchers said that 'of those arriving single and having sex in Australia , 40.9 per cent reported inconsistent condom use and 24 per cent had unprotected sex with multiple partners . '
The findings were revealed in the October edition of the international monthly journal on sexual health , Sexually Transmitted Infections .
What ’s more , young Englishmen are among the worst overstayers in Australia , with many not returning home until after their visas have expired .
' They are often young Englishmen who have gone to a party and are a few days late because they 're having such a good time in Sydney , ' Immigration Minister Chris Evans told Parliament .
' Or they 've met a young lady and they 're having a good time . '
Researchers at the John Moores University in Liverpool and Australia 's National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre said British backpackers regularly used bars and nightclubs , with 60 per cent of young men and 30 per cent of women also using illicit drugs .
The researchers carried out a survey of more than 1,000 backpackers at hostels in Sydney and the tourist ' mecca ' of Cairns in northern Queensland and found that young British travellers often indulge in frisky behaviour even if they were not single when they arrived in Australia .
Of those who arrived with a partner of the opposite sex , said the researchers , over a third ended up having multiple partners in Australia .
The number increased to almost half among those who arrived in the country on their own .
‘ You 're coming out here looking to meet new people and have new lives and you leave the girlfriend at home and meet liberal women , ’ backpacker Liam Ryan , 27 , told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper .
As many as 700,000 Britons travel to Australia each year to soak up the sun and take part - time jobs under special work - visas to help fund their travels .
And while many do nothing more than enjoy the sights and weather on land and sea , there is a darker side to the adventures of young Britons .
' Backpackers are at high risk of sexually - transmitted infections and other negative sexual health outcomes , ' said the researchers .
They called for better efforts to warn backpackers of risky behaviour not only before they left the UK but also during their travels .
Young travellers have so much fun that they do n't want to leave , immigration officials admit .
Singling out British backpackers in particular , Immigration Minister Mr Evans said : ' Visa overstayers are people who come on a valid visa , who then become unlawful overstayers . ’
He said they usually went home within a week of their visas expiring .
The revelations about British overstayers have resulted in one writer to Sydney 's Daily Telegraph commenting : ' And we are worried about a few boat people .
Let 's can the planes from Europe ' .
Another writer said : ' Are you surprised ?
They do say Brits are under - sexed , so they 're getting it while they can !'
HTML clocks using JavaScript and CSS rotation
Warning :
This is n't going to work in any currently available version of Internet Explorer * or many older browsers .
The two clocks below are just HTML .
There are no Adobe Flash files or my beloved < canvas > going on , just regular < div > and < img > tags .
The way it works is by taking those images in an { overflow : hidden } < div > and rotating them , via JavaScript , using the proposed CSS transform property .
Background
In July last year , the excellent Jonathan Snook wrote an article about CSS rotation .
If you 're interested stuff like this and you have n't heard of Mr. Snook before , I suggest you read his stuff .
He explains in his article that the Webkit ( Google Chrome & Safari ) and Firefox 3.5 + browsers support the CSS transform property .
Since then , Opera has joined the party too .
He also notes that it is also possible to implement basic ( 0° / 90° / 180° / 270° ) rotations using Internet Explorer , but clearly this was n't going to cut it for what I wanted to do here .
The code to make the clocks work is really very simple .
To do the rotation , simply use the following CSS declarations :
transform : rotate ( 42deg ) ; // this wo n't work yet , but one day it may - moz - transform : rotate ( 42deg ) ; // mozilla specific - o- transform : rotate ( 42deg ) ; // opera specific - webkit - transform : rotate ( 42deg ) ; // webkit specific
In jQuery that could look like :
$ ( " #myElement " ) .css ( { ' transform ' : ' rotate ( 42deg ) ' , '- moz - transform ' : ' rotate ( 42deg ) ' , '- o - transform ' : ' rotate ( 42deg ) ' , '- webkit- transform ' : ' rotate ( 42deg ) ' } ) ;
How it works
I do n't really see the need to breakdown the code of the clocks themselves as JavaScript clocks have been around since , well , forever .
However , I will quickly explain how it works should you want to inspect the code further .
Originally , my code had one setInterval ( ) timer that simply performed the required rotation ( s ) each second .
Whilst it proved the concept was doable , it 's jerkiness lacked the final effect I was after .
To create a smoother animation , there are now two setInterval ( ) timers .
The first one runs once every second and updates the current time .
It decides if each element ( i.e. hours , minutes , seconds ) is rotated to the correct angle and , if not , calculates the number of small steps it needs to take to get there .
It pushes the value of these steps into an array .
For example , let 's say one of my images is currently rotated 12 ° but it should be turned to 18° .
This step pushes the numbers 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 and 18 into that element 's array .
These are the small , incremental animation steps which , when animated , will look nicer than an abrupt jump from 12° to 18° .
The second setInterval ( ) timer runs must faster and is responsible for actually rotating the images .
Each time it is run , it looks at each element and it if it 's array is not empty it : takes the first value from that array ( in our example , array [ 0 ] = 13 ) and rotates that image to 13° accordingly , and uses array. slice ( ) to remove the first item from the array ( in our example , the number 13 ) .
The next time this is run , array [ 0 ] now equals 14 , and the image is rotated again .
This process goes on until the array is empty .
Each second the array is repopulated again by the first timer and the animation process starts again .
A couple of things to note
There will be a tidal wave of rage .
Over the next two weeks the executives of the leading British and American banks will announce that some £ 50bn is to be taken from accumulated profit and handed over , not to shareholders or taxpayers , but to themselves .
It will be the most outrageous contempt of ­democratic authority in modern times .
The sums will be breathtaking , starting with Friday 's predicted payout of £ 18bn at the American bank , JP Morgan Chase .
This is almost exactly what it cost the US taxpayer to rescue the bank a year ago .
A similar sum is predicted at Goldman Sachs .
This is happening at the heart of the western economy that has just endured its worst crash for 30 years , almost entirely through the doings of these banks and executives .
Since I delight in anti-state gestures , I have some admiration for devil - may - care effrontery , but this money is way beyond any concept of reward - for - work .
A few thousand greedy souls benefited hugely over the past decade by gambling with shareholders ' and customers ' money .
When , as tends to happen , the winning streak ended , they had to be rescued by the taxpayer .
They were rescued by claiming that the casinos in which they were peddling their " investments " were " too big to fail " , despite Lehman Brothers being allowed to fail .
These same banks have now returned to the tables and are playing their old games .
In no sense is this money rightfully theirs .
They are stealing – from shareholders , customers , national treasuries and , since much of the money goes offshore , taxpayers .
Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown continue to be mesmerised by these people .
The two of them have bought hook , line and sinker some of the most tendentious arguments ever put into the public domain .
They agreed with " too big to fail " , and with the quite different line that bankrupt banks should not be nationalised , their deposits protected , and bad debts written off or down .
This is despite the admirable " narrow banking " ideas put forward by the economist John Kay for the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation , which were in part implemented in the nationalisation and restructuring of Northern Rock .
Brown and Darling were told that RBS and Lloyds were somehow " different " and restructuring would be " difficult " .
Darling , Brown and the Bank of England 's Mervyn King continued pouring money into these banks – supported by the opposition and the media – even when the money was clearly not being used as the cabinet had insisted , on lending to the private sector .
It was being used to underpin toxic loans , in effect to pay off gambling debts .
Ministers went on giving the money , even when told that most was flowing overseas , until almost a trillion pounds had vanished over the counter .
The banks ' refusal to boost high street lending was at least understandable , since the government was refusing to prop up high street demand and create conditions in which such lending was prudent .
What is odd is that Darling , having fathered the most costly policy in British history , failed to reverse it when it had palpably failed .
Bank lending to business remains at rock bottom .
That was merely the first snub by the bankers to the government .
The second was in response to Darling 's other warning that " bonuses have been a symptom of excessive behaviour of banks " and should stop .
Again he could not have been clearer .
He instructed his representatives at RBS , 84 % owned by the government , and at Lloyds to stop them .
Again Darling was defied , this time by the RBS board with threats to resign – reiterated yesterday to the Commons finance committee by the RBS chief executive , Stephen Hester .
He was like a football manager claiming that his strikers may have scored only own - goals , but should continue drawing bonuses because at least they were goals .
Hester insists that lavish bonuses for RBS gamblers are " in the best interests of the taxpayer " .
This is because , if their resumed winning streak continues , RBS executives might let the taxpayer in on a cut , after taking a predicted £ 2 bn - £ 4 bn next month on their own account .
The nearest Darling came to getting his hands on this cash is by taxing the bonuses , pound for pound , in advance .
He thought it might raise £ 500 m , but it may raise four times that .
The banks may have no money for the high street but they have lots for themselves , even if it doubles the company 's tax bill .
When Hester was asked by the committee how he might present this to the public , the best he could reply was : " I might go on holiday for a long time . "
The answer oozed a guilty conscience .
Corporate remuneration is desperately in need of the sort of attention paid to corporate governance .
It has moved from Galbraith 's " warm personal gesture " by bosses to themselves , to what amounts to a conspiracy by groups of individuals to steal from their firms .
Since 2000 , stock market valuation by the FTSE 100 has declined 25 % while relevant executive pay has risen 85 % , and bonuses by 350 % .
Banks are worst because they deal in the largest sums and the opportunity for " percentage skim " is most lucrative .
The history of capitalism is the history of regulation .
The 19th - century robber barons were curbed by labour and ­environment controls , free trade and competition laws .
All sensible people accepted capitalism needed policing .
But the internal structure of companies was left to personal ­relationships , aided by a rudimentary sense of fair play .
That sense has evaporated .
In his account of the collapse of Enron , Malcolm Gladwell ascribed it to the impact of the consultants McKinsey , and its " talent culture " .
High flyers , often greedy narcissists in pursuit of bonuses , were identified , promoted and given their head without control .
They moved restlessly round the corporation " thinking outside the box " .
What was good for these stars was assumed to be good for Enron .
Eventually so many were outside the box that the box collapsed .
" The needs of the customers and shareholders , " wrote Gladwell , " became secondary to the needs of the stars . "
The parallel with modern investment banking shrieks from the shelves of books already written on the credit crunch .
The ­difference is that , unlike Enron , the banks have not collapsed .
They have been rescued at the truly vast cost of £ 800bn of public money , and the ­culture of greed that occasioned that rescue remains intact .
No one is ­lifting a finger .

DUBAI , United Arab Emirates 
Thousands of enraged Christians clashed with the police in Egypt on Thursday in response to a drive - by shooting the night before that left six Christians dead and nine wounded .
The attackers , who are still at large , had opened fire on several groups of Christians gathered to celebrate Coptic Christmas in the southern Egyptian city of Nag Hammadi , the Interior Ministry said in a statement .
The killings seemed to be an act of revenge tied to accusations in November that a Christian man raped a Muslim girl , the statement said .
Clashes between Muslims and Christians have grown increasingly common in recent years , especially in Upper Egypt , where there is a large Christian population and a strong culture of vendetta killings .
Those killings typically spring from unexceptional disputes that spiral into full - blown conflicts that have to be settled by security forces .
There are no official statistics on the size of the Christian minority in Egypt , but the generally accepted figure is 10 percent of the population .
WASHINGTON —
The universe is one big dance party for black holes .
New observations from the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the Hubble Space Telescope found 33 merged galaxies in which pairs of supermassive black holes are “ waltzing ” around the galactic centers .
“ Our result shows that such waltzing black holes are much more common than we previously knew , ” said Julie Comerford of the University of California , Berkeley .
Comerford presented her results on January 4 at the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society .
Finding pairs of black holes moving in a certain way can help estimate how often galaxy mergers occur in the universe .
Observations have shown that nearly every galaxy has a supermassive black hole — a black hole with a mass of one million to one billion times that of the sun — at its center and that galaxies often collide and merge to create larger galaxies .
Astronomers have expected to find many mid-merge galaxies by focusing on the two supermassive black holes , which should be orbiting each other in the middle .
But so far , the dance floor has pretty much been empty .
“ We expect the universe to be littered with these waltzing black holes , ” Comerford said .
“ But until recently , only a few had ever been found . ”
Those missing black hole pairs posed problems for theories of how galaxies merge and grow .
Now , using two new observational techniques , Comerford and her colleagues have found 33 galaxies with dual supermassive black holes .
The first technique found 32 black hole pairs in the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey conducted on the Keck II Telescope on Hawaii ’s Mauna Kea , by determining whether each black hole is moving toward or away from Earth .
Black holes are visible only when they can accrete gas and other material from the surrounding environment .
Energy from the black hole heats the gas , lighting the gas up in visible wavelengths .
When the black hole is moving away from Earth , the light from the accreted gas appears to be at a longer wavelength , or redshifted .
When the black hole dances toward Earth , its light is blueshifted — meaning it has a shorter wavelength .
The team identified waltzing pairs by looking for instances when one black hole was blueshifted and the other redshifted .
“ It ’s kind of the disco ball that tells you where the party is , where the black holes are dancing , ” Comerford said .
The waltz is quick — both black holes are moving at velocities of about 200 kilometers per second .
But the black holes are keeping “ a chaste distance , ” Comerford said .
They are separated on average by about 3,000 to 8,000 light - years , or one - eighth to one - third the distance from the sun to the center of the Milky Way .
For the population of galaxies Comerford and her colleagues observed , which were mostly gas - poor galaxies 4 billion to 7 billion light years from Earth , galaxy mergers occur three times every billion years , Comerford said .
The final black hole duo was found serendipitously in a Hubble image of a galaxy called COSMOS J100043.15+020637.2 .
The galaxy sports a tidal tail of stars , gas and dust , a sure sign of a recent galaxy merger .
“ It ’s like a black eye , a sign that this galaxy has recently gone through a collision with another galaxy , ” Comerford said .
The galaxy also has two bright nuclei , each of which could be a supermassive black hole surrounded by glowing dust and gas .
Follow - up observations with the Keck II Telescope showed the telltale velocity shifts of dancing black holes .
But the black holes might not be two waltzers .
Instead , the data could point to one black hole that is fleeing the galaxy .
When two black holes merge together , they produce gravitational waves that carry momentum away from the resulting larger black hole .
Gravitational waves pointed mostly in one direction can “ kick ” the black hole in the opposite direction .
Black holes could wander through their host galaxies , or , if the kick is large enough , leave the galaxy behind .
Observations of the same galaxy by Francesca Civano of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Mass. , and colleagues suggest that the two bright sources are flying apart at a velocity of about 1,300 kilometers per second .
Civano also presented her results at the American Astronomical Society meeting on January 4 .
“ For a merger , that is a bit high , ” Civano said .
“ But this number is completely normal for a gravitational wave kick . ”
“ Whether this thing is a dual pair of waltzing black holes or an ejected black hole , this is definitely a merger , ” Comerford said .
“ It ’s just whether you ’re seeing it before the black holes merge [ with each other ] or after . ”

Both of those products run a version of Linux , which could be where the need for such a deal originates .
Microsoft has in the past claimed that the open - source ( and freely available ) Linux violates several hundred of its patents , and has actually forced settlements with companies including TomTom and Buffalo over those discrepancies –it ’s probable that Amazon is the latest in that line .
For its part , Microsoft ’s official statement is a masterpiece in avoiding specifics .
Said Horacio Gutierrez , Microsoft corporate VP :
“ Microsoft ’s patent portfolio is the largest and strongest in the software industry , and this agreement demonstrates our mutual respect for
intellectual property as well as our ability to reach pragmatic
solutions to IP issues regardless of whether proprietary or open source software is involved . ”
These kinds of agreements are mostly designed to prevent patent battles down the line , which would be unnecessarily costly for both sides .

The Earth may orbit around a single star , but most stars like oursun are binaries ?
two stars orbiting each other as a pair .
In fact there aremany three - star triple systems , even going up perhaps as high as seven - star ?
or septuplet ?
systems .
Although astronomers once thought these systems might not easilysupport planets , worlds with multiplesunsets might actually prove common .
And now , powerful telescopes are beginning to resolve thesesystems to reveal how they work .
The alien suns
Our sun is a so - called class G star , but it is oddly solitary whencompared to other stars in the same class .
" One - third are single , while two - thirds are multiples , " explained astronomer Charles Lada at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center forAstrophysics in Cambridge , Mass .
Still , while most systems with stars like oursun are multiple , most systems in the universe are not , Lada explained .
Class
G stars only make up roughly 7 percent of all stars we see .
When it comesto systems in general , " about 70 percent in our galaxy are single , whilethe rest are multiple , " he said .
The overwhelming majority of stars in our galaxy are class Mstars , ones roughly one - tenth to one - half our sun 's mass .
" If there are400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy , then about 325 billion of those areM stars , " Lada said .
" They have a very low binary or multiplefrequency ?
maybe only about 15 to 25 percent of such systems . "
For many years , scientists thought most stars were multiples .
" It 'sonly in the last 15 years or so that we 've been able to identify and studythese low - mass stars , which are very faint , " Lada said .
On theother hand , when it comes to massive stars , " say four to 10 times the massof our sun , they 're almost always in multiples , " Lada said .
Ofcourse , while most systems only have one star , since binary and multiplesystems do after all have more than one star , " you can say that roughly halfof all stars are in binary or multiple systems , " Lada clarified .
Howbinary stars are born
Thesereason high - mass stars are often in multiples while low - mass ones are not mightbe due to differences in how they form .
" Low - massstars tend to form in very dense , cold , dark clouds , " Lada said .
" They are born when gravity wins out , causing these ' cores ' to contractfurther , usually forming single systems .
On the other hand , massive cores tendto be turbulent , with gas within generally moving at higher velocities .
Thoseare very susceptible to fragmentation , and so can form multiple stars orbinaries . "
Curiously , the nearby Taurus - Auriga star - forming region " does have a very highfraction of binary stars , even for G stars , and maybe even extending to Mstars , " Lada said .
" Because of this , there 's the thought that maybemost stars form as multiples , but these systems are then broken apart .
" However , he noted that all calculations attempting to simulate this happeninghave not born fruit so far .
Wherethe suns set twice ( or more )
Althoughworlds with fantastic multiple sunsets might seem the province of sci- fi flickslike " Star Wars " and " Avatar , " alien worlds orbiting binarystar systems are science fact .
In fact , " Avatar " is set on analien moon around a fictional planet orbiting the real binary star systemAlpha Centauri .
Forinstance , scientists have detected a planet estimated at 1.76 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting theprimary star of the Gamma Cephei binarysystem roughly 45 light years away .
When the stars in binary systemsare close together , planets have been spotted in orbits that take them aroundboth ?
such is the case with PSR B1620 - 26 b , which orbits a pulsar and whitedwarf located roughly 12,400 light - years away and is the oldest known alienplanet at roughly 12.7 billion years old .
Manyunanswered questions remain about how planets are born and develop in binaryand multiple systems .
Now scientists are imaging the disks of gas and dustaround these systems that might eventually give rise to planets .
Scientistsin Japan captured the first direct images of a young binary system using the Subaru Telescope .
The system , SR24 , is located in the constellation Ophiuchus , 520 light years away .
Ina binary system , two stars orbit around a common center of mass .
The brighteror more massive star is referred to as the primary star and the fainter or lessmassive one is called the secondary star .
The circumprimary disk encircles theprimary , while the circumsecondary disk rings the secondary , and a thirdcircumbinary disk may surround both .
Theresearchers in Japan were first to capture high - resolution , near - infraredimages of both circumprimary and circumsecondary disks around a young stellarobject .
They also saw bridges extending from one disk to another , whichsupercomputer simulations suggest emerged from the collision of gas rotatingaround the stars .
A long spiral arm of gas and dust was also seen extending outfrom the circumprimary disk , likely to the circumbinary one , which might befeeding the circumprimary disk matter and fuel its growth .
" Insuch widely spaced binaries , you could have planets around the two , " Ladasaid .
Forests in northern areas are stunted , verging on the edge of survival .
It has been anticipated that climate change improves their growth conditions .
A study published in Forest Ecology and Management journal shows that due to their genetic characteristics trees are unable to properly benefit from the lengthening growing season .
Furthermore , the researchers were surprised to find that the mortality of established trees considerably promotes the adaptation of forests to the changing environment .
In cooperation with colleagues at the Universities of Oulu and Potsdam , Anna Kuparinen , Docent at the University of Helsinki's Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences , simulated forest growth from southern to northern Finland .
A meteorological dispersal model was applied to describe the spread of pollen and seeds in the atmosphere .
Above all , the results illustrate the slowness of the adaptation process .
Generally , trees stop growing before the frosts and this cessation of growth has been programmed in their genotype .
Therefore , trees are unable to effectively follow the increasing environmental growing season .
Instead , they cease growth as dictated by their genotype .
It is estimated that after hundred years from now northern forests will substantially lag behind the speed of growth that would be enabled by their environment .
Evolution is promoted by the mortality of established trees
The researchers assumed that demographic characteristics of the trees would have a notable impact on their adaptability .
Tree species differ for example so that birch matures at a considerably younger age than pine , and birch seeds spread more effectively than pine seeds .
However , the results showed that these differences had only minor impacts .
Instead , the mortality of established trees played a large role in the evolutionary adaptation .
The existing trees in northern forests will survive in a warmer climate better than before but , at the same time , they prevent genetically better adapted individuals from becoming more common .
In a dense stand , old trees cast a shadow and prevent new seedlings from establishing .
In this way , younger seedlings , which would be more suitable to warmer conditions , cannot easily progress beyond the sapling state .
A question closely related to environmental changes is , whether humans should help the populations to adapt ?
For forests , possible means of human aid include thinning and planting southern seeds to more northern locations .
Agent was contraband detection trainer ; ‘ no longer employed ’ at TSA
These days , joking about anything illegal while in an airport security line will likely land you in a holding cell , and might even result in criminal charges .
But this column from the Philadelphia Inquirer has some wondering whether that rule applies to TSA employees themselves .
Inquirer columnist Daniel Rubin reports that a 22 - year - old University of Michigan student fell victim to a particularly cruel “ joke ” at the hands of a TSA employee at Philadelphia International Airport on Jan .
5 .

As Rebecca Solomon passed through security on her way to boarding a Detroit - bound flight , a TSA agent pulled a small baggie filled with white powder out of her carry - on and asked , “ Where did you get it ? ”
A panicked Solomon suffered for 20 seconds before the guard cracked a smile and said , “ Just kidding . ”
Rubin describes the bizarre encounter like this :
A TSA worker was staring at her .
He motioned her toward him .
Then he pulled a small , clear plastic bag from her carry - on — the sort of baggie that a pair of earrings might come in .
Inside the bag was fine , white powder .
She remembers his words : “ Where did you get it ? ”
Two thoughts came to her in a jumble : A terrorist was using her to sneak bomb - detonating materials on the plane .
Or a drug dealer had made her an unwitting mule , planting coke or some other trouble in her bag while she was n’t looking .
Put yourself in her place and count out 20 seconds .
Her heart pounded .
She started to sweat .
She panicked at having to explain something she could n’t .
Now picture her expression as the TSA employee started to smile .
Just kidding , he said .
He waved the baggie .
It was his .
And so she collected her things , stunned , and the tears began to fall .
The Inquirer ‘s Linda Loyd reported later Thursday that the TSA says the employee in question in the incident is “ no longer employed by the agency . ”

The TSA reportedly is n’t disputing Solomon ’s version of events .
The employee ca n’t be named because of TSA privacy regulations , which also prevent the TSA from saying whether he quit or was fired .
But Solomon told the Inquirer that she was told he was a trainer who taught TSA employees how to detect contraband .
What is a ( D ) SLR ?
The Single Lens Reflex is so named because it has a mirror ( and a single lens ) .
But to really understand how the SLR got its name it ’s important to go back to the days before it existed .
Before the [ 35 mm ]
SLR became popular , there was the Rangefinder cameras ( that used an optical viewfinder and a rangefinder mechanism to determine when the lens was in focus ) and the Twin Lens Reflex camera ( that had two lenses , one to view the image on a screen by way of a mirror , and a second one to record the picture ) .
Of course , both models are long gone now .
Wait !
We still have the rangefinder with us , courtesy of the Leica M9 .
The Twin Lens Reflex ( TLR ) , on the other hand , is long gone .
See Colbie Caillat in her music video “ Kiss the Girl ” using a TLR :
As good as the rangefinder camera was , it had one glaring problem : parallax , meaning that because the viewfinder was separate from the lens , the viewfinder showed an image slightly off from what the camera was actually capturing through the lens .
This problem was compounded as you used longer telephoto lenses .
To remedy this problem , camera manufacturers came up with an ingenious idea of putting a mirror in the path of the light coming through the lens .
The mirror reflected the light up into the viewfinder compartment where it got reflected two more times inside a penta ( 5 - sided ) prism and came out through the viewfinder eyepiece the right side up and oriented correctly .
When you pressed the shutter release button to take the picture , the mirror flipped up , out of the way , and the light proceded to expose the film ( or image sensor in the case of a DSLR ) behind the mirror .
This was hailed as a great progress since now the photographer could see exactly what would be recorded on the film — no matter what lens was used !
Hence was born the Single Lens Reflex .
It was pretty simple to name the new camera because it was really a Twin Lens Reflex that got a prism added on top and which used the same one lens ( instead of separate lenses ) to both view and record the picture .
One lens only , so Single Lens Reflex ( SLR ) .
The SLR was , of course , designed to be more than just a camera with a mirror inside .
The mirror simply solved a problem , viz .
how to ensure that the photographer could see exactly what would be recorded on the film .
But more than that , the SLR was introduced to be of a higher caliber than the rangefinder camera .
It provided full exposure flexibility , was faster , more precise , better in many ways .
And because the photographer could see exactly as would be recorded on film , the number and variety of lenses grew to encompass almost anything you may want your SLR to capture on film , from microphotography all the way to astrophotography .
When it comes to choosing a DSLR , it does not matter much which brand you choose if all you intend to use it for is point - and - shoot photography and do not intend to add lenses .
If you do intend to buy more lenses , then it becomes very important to consider the availability of lenses ( as well as other accessories ) first ; once you commit to a “ system ” it becomes very expensive to switch and so photographers tend to stay with the same brand for a very long time .
Now fast forward to today , where it is now possible for the photographer to see exactly what the image sensor will capture without the use of a mirror .
The LCD screen ( and electronic viewfinder ) is now of high enough resolution to match the quality of the image viewed through the optical prism / mirror construct of a DSLR .
With the redundant mirror now removed , is the resulting camera still a DSLR ?
Let ’s see .
D? Yes , it ’s a digital camera .
SL ?
Yes , it ’s a single lens camera .
R ? No , there ’s no mirror anymore , and that ’s where certain people object to the use of the term “ mirrorless ” DSLR .
It ’s kind of an oxymoron .
So , how to call this new “ DSLR ” with no mirror ?
Many have jokingly ( and then seriously ) referred to them as “ EVIL ” — Electronic Viewfinder Interchangeable Lens — cameras .
That will never fly , in the marketing and any other sense of the way .
Also , an electronic viewfinder is a given , so we do n’t need to saddle the cameras with the “ EV ” .
“ IL ” is the best choice , but I think we still need to differentiate between digital and non digital , so the “ D ” is still important .
Another proposal from Imaging Resource is the “ SLD ” for “ Single Lens Direct - view ” .
Since Olympus and Panasonic are the first to come out with these cameras , they dubbed them “ Digital Interchangeable Lens ” system cameras .
Notice that they stopped short of using the acronym “ DIL ” — it does not sound as sophisticated as “ DSLR . ”
Perhaps , if we spelled out the letters , like “ D - I - L ” — which does not sound that bad after all !
Until a consensus is arrived at , we will refer to these cameras as DIL for now .
We expect that Nikon , Canon and other digital camera manufacturers will also introduce their own versions of the DIL , perhaps as early as this year or next year .
You can be sure that their marketing people are currently busy running focus groups and trying to figure out just what to call these cameras .
We need a name that everyone will readily adopt .
What do you think is a good name for the “ mirrorless DSLR ” , “ EVIL ” , “ Digital Interchangeable Lens ” camera ?

By a slim 5 - 4 margin the U. S. Supreme Court today blocked cameras from broadcasting the Prop 8 trial .
In an unsigned opinion Wednesday , the court criticized [ Judge ]
Walker for attempting to change the rules “ at the eleventh hour to treat this case differently than other trials . ”
While the court set no time limit in its ruling , any further proceedings at high court likely would come after the trial was over .
The four justices in dissent were Stephen Breyer , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Sonia Sotomayor and John Paul Stevens .
At this time it is still unclear if the trial proceedings will be posted on YouTube as that was not addressed in today ’s decision .
The American Foundation for Equal Rights which is leading the challenge against Proposition 8 released the following statement :
“ Proposition 8 attacks the core of what our nation stands for — that all of us are entitled to equal protection under the law and equal treatment from the government .
A trial on constitutional rights should be accessible to as many people as possible , ” said Chad Griffin , Board President of the American Foundation for Equal Rights .
“ Given the powerful evidence against Prop. 8 presented in court today , we are not surprised the initiative ’s defenders sought to keep this trial as private as possible . ”
Not surprisingly the ruling broke cleanly along idealogical lines and fear it does n’t bode well for when the case ultimately reaches the Supreme Court .

Sen .
Lindsey Graham is n't willing give Senate Republicans all of the blame for their record number of filibusters in the 110th Congress .
Graham implied that Majority Leader Harry Reid deserved some of the blame by allowing so many bills and refusing Republican amendments .
When asked about the GOP 's use of the filibuster , Graham said , " Harry Reid put more bills in -- into the hopper and filled up the tree , shedding out Republican amendments [ more ] than anybody I know of but we 're all in this together . "
The senior Senator from South Carolina quickly changed the subject to national security .
" I will meet the president more than halfway and help him close Guantanamo Bay , only if he creates a legal system to make us safe and keep this enemy off the battlefield in a transparent way living within our values , " Graham told Fox News ' Chris Wallace Sunday .
" So I think we need to stop all this fighting among ourselves and direct our fight toward our enemies , " concluded Graham .
Republicans used the filibuster 112 times in the 110th Congress .
The filibuster was used 54 times in the 109th Congress .
A rather clever programmer has managed to get the iPhone to run interactive apps created using Adobe 's Flash platform .
And because it works inside the Safari browser , it is n't subject to the dictatorial rules of Apple 's App Store .
The software is called Gordon , and it does n't actually allow Flash itself to work on the iPhone .
Instead , Gordon is a JavaScript runtime written by Tobias Schneider which allows the browser to play and display . swf files ( the Shockwave Flash file extension ) .
A runtime is a collection of software that allows the running of code inside it .
A helpful analogy is a software emulator for a games console which allows you to play the actual code of , say , Super Mario World on your PC .
Does this mean that the iPhone now supports Flash ?
Not really .
You can't just visit any site that has Flash , because the hack only works on sites that have installed it .
Developers would need to add this runtime to each instance of Flash on their sites ( although calling the runtime only requires a few lines of code ) .
And while the open source project is available to all , it still does n't solve one of Flash 's biggest problems .
These SWF files still hog the CPU .
One demo , a simple vector graphic of a tiger , throws my desktop browser up to around 100 percent CPU usage .
Still , the hack potentially opens the door to a new class of interactive , animated mobile websites .
While many web developers rely on Flash to accomplish things that can't easily be done in HTML , those Flash apps wo n't run on the iPhone .
And while the lack of Flash support has been one of the most persistent criticisms of the iPhone platform , Apple has done nothing to rectify the problem .
Adobe 's workaround , announced in October , has been to offer developers a way of converting Flash apps to iPhone apps , but that would n't support Flash within the web browser , and those apps are still subject to Apple 's approval before they 're available .
You can see it in action yourself by heading over to this Gordon demonstration page ( which works in both Mobile Safari , on your iPhone or any desktop browser ) .
On a new iPod Touch , the animations run just fine , and as the runtime is directly displaying the SWF files it should also work with video .
Could we ever see a browser in the App Store which would let us view any Flash content this way ?
It 's very doubtful , due to Apple 's ban on anything which can run interpretive code .
Also , when naming the project , Tobias does n't seem to have considered the search terms required to google it : Flash Gordon .
Or maybe that 's the joke ?

There ’s a new edition of Dante ’s “ Inferno ” that ’s recently begun appearing in bookstores .
Same words .
Different cover .
It ’s got a big picture of a muscular fellow in a spiky crown and an overline that says , “ The literary classic that inspired the epic video game . ”
It ’s true .
“ Inferno ” is now a video game , with a brawny , armor - clad Dante as its protagonist .
Like a fallen soul , it is facing some stern judgments , both from prospective players and Dante scholars who wonder why a classic work of Western literature needed updating at all .
But the game ’s creators say there ’s an audience for it .
Their research showed that most people had heard of “ Inferno ” but few knew what it was about .
This , they say , gave them license to make a few improvements .
“ If you ’re trying to make an action game , it ’s thin , ” Jonathan Knight , the game ’s executive producer , said of the original text .
“ It ’s Dante , who ’s kind of passive , and he ’s a poet and he ’s philosophical .
We had to take the bold step of saying , ‘ How do we make this guy an action hero ? ’ ”
Not a fan of the hot stuff ?
It might be worth getting used to .
A ton of new research says it ’s good for your stomach and may even ward off disease .

It is a long - standing myth that spicy food exacerbates ulcers and other stomach ailments .
But research shows hot chili peppers actually protect the stomach lining and may prevent the gastric damage associated with anti-inflammatory painkillers .
They are high in nutrients such as calcium plus vitamins A and C , and there ’s some evidence that hot chilies can reduce cardiovascular disease risk , help prevent diabetes and boost metabolism .
They may also have some ability to prevent cancer .
Just do n’t go overboard : A Mexican study found people who ate the equivalent of nine to 25 jalape ños per day had a slightly raised risk of stomach cancer .
( It should n’t be too tough for even hot - pepper lovers to stay under that limit ! )
Toronto gastroenterologist Dr. Khursheed Jeejeebhoy sees plenty of patients in his office who avoid hot chilies unnecessarily .
“ Whenever people have stomach problems , they ’ll say , ‘ I ’ll completely avoid spicy foods in order to heal my stomach . ’
There is no evidence they have to do that .
Spices in moderation are to be enjoyed , and there is no evidence that spicy food is bad for you , ” says Jeejeebhoy , who is an emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Toronto .
Should you turn up the heat ?
In fact , there is a lot of evidence that it ’s very good for you .
Recent research tells us that hot chili peppers are an up - and - coming health power .
A laboratory study in the United Kingdom , for instance , found that capsaicin , which is responsible for the burning sensation chilies provide , can kill lung and pancreatic cancer cells without harming the surrounding cells .
Researchers believe this may explain why people living in Mexico and India , who eat a spicy diet , tend to have lower rates of some cancers than those eating a bland Western diet .
Two Australian studies provide more good news :
One discovered that adding chilies to meals may protect against the buildup of cholesterol in the blood .
Another found that regularly eating hot chilies reduces insulin requirements , which may have implications in the prevention and treatment of diabetes .
So what about their effects on the stomach ?
Hot chilies actually decrease the output of gastric acid , says a Hungarian study .
They can also reduce the stomach bleeding associated with taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as Aspirin .
A further bonus : A study in Singapore found that eating chilies daily reduced the risk of peptic ulcers by 53 percent .
Hot , hot , hot
And that burning sensation you get from hot food ?
It ’s the capsaicin stimulating your nerve endings .
“ It ’s a bad feeling , ’ says Jeejeebhoy , ‘ but there ’s no evidence that it produces a cut or causes an ulceration or injury of any sort in the gastrointestinal tract . ”
The best remedy to the burning sensation is to build up a tolerance , he says .
Another huge fan of hot food is Dr. Susan Biali , a Vancouver general practitioner with a degree in dietetics .
“ Chilies add wonderful flavour and kick to foods , and have very few calories , ” says Biali , who until recently split her time between Vancouver and Los Cabos , Mexico .
She has been gradually adding more heat to her diet for years , and jokes that she can even out - chili her Mexican husband , who grew up on spicy food .
“ Chili is a guilt - free way to make food more flavourful , interesting and exciting . ”
Biali calls chilies a “ no - lose food ” because they boost metabolism , help burn fat and keep us feeling full longer .

A recent column generated a number of speculative and Monday - morning - quarterback comments about Kodak and the changeover to digital .
I 'd like to reset the record .
Mind you , I am not saying Kodak has successfully made the transition ; I think there is still a real possibility the company will go under .
But the assumptions that people have been making that it 's from lack of trying , lack of foresight , or an unwillingness to commit are n't supported by Kodak 's history .
Over the past quarter - century , Kodak has made 3.5 major attempts to grab a commanding position in the world of digital photography .
All of them have failed and those failures do reflect on Kodak ( certainly on their bottom line ! ) .
But it 's sure not because Kodak did n't see the world of change that they were facing .
For general background on that change , read my column , " The Shape of Things That Came . "
On to the specifics of Kodak :
In the early 1980s , Kodak started demonstrating computer - assisted photofinishing .
These were hybrid systems that involved film scanning , computer data massaging , and image writing back to traditional photographic paper .
They developed and successfully incorporated these technologies into successive generations of equipment .
Unfortunately , that all happened behind the scenes , so it did n't establish a market position for them .
Their first real effort to grab digital name and brand recognition was the introduction of Kodak Digital Media in the mid-1980s .
Unfortunately , they did n't know how to market against the real 500 - pound gorillas in that arena , 3M , Sony , and Teac , the companies with existing name recognition for magnetic storage media of all sorts .
Kodak was put in the unfamiliar position of being the small and new kid on the block .
Their marketing simply did n't know how to deal with it .
The second attempt , in the early 1990s , was PhotoCD .
The science was brilliant , the technology was good , and they understood the marketplace .
Not only could they provide superior image quality in a convenient , portable form , but the " jeans " won out over the " suits " and they released PhotoCD as an open standard .
Smart move !
Not - so - smart moves : the " standard " evolved over several years , and you had no assurance that later generations of Photo CD equipment would color manage early PhotoCD files correctly .
That was the lesser problem .
The bigger one was they screwed the economics .
Kodak promised the photofinishing labs that they could develop the film and produce PhotoCDs for substantially less than a dollar a frame , making the cost per roll competitive with what one - hour labs were charging back then .
That promise was never met — not even close .
It was so unfulfilled the Kodak later denied making such a claim , but I heard it with my own ears , said at a PhotoCD developers ' conference by a qualified Kodak executive to a group of highly skeptical lab owners .
Then there was the economic disaster that was the PhotoCD home player .
They sent me one to critique ( not to review ) and I told them exactly how and why it was going to bomb * .
By analogy : suppose you decided to manufacture an economy automobile and you decided it ought to be under $ 15,000 ?
Suppose the car you built to sell for under $ 15,000 could only go 40 mph ?
In order to meet their desired market price , Kodak so badly compromised the performance and features of the home players that they were genuinely tedious to use .
PhotoCD never took off in the general world , although it got huge institutional use ( which is why Kodak maintained it for as long as they did ) .
Third big effort : Quality digital cameras .
Remember that Kodak used to own that market !
They produced the absolute best professional digital cameras in the world , and people lined up to pay $ 15,000 – $ 30,000 for them .
Kodak was the Leica + Hasselblad of that world .
Then the perfect wave I referred to in my earlier column broke , and digital camera price / performance ratios started plummeting , far faster than most sane people would 've predicted .
Kodak pretty quickly realized they were in big trouble that way ; they could no longer maintain those kind of prices to support what were undeniably superior cameras .
So they tried their last big gamble : The DCS 14n .
It was supposed to be the best DSLR out there by far , at a price / performance ratio that would leave other manufacturers gasping .
Only two small problems : first they announced vaporproduct , to try to steal the thunder from Canon announcing their quality DSLR .
But , Canon could deliver , while Kodak 's camera was still months away .
Professional photographers are even worse about deferred gratification than consumers .
And the ultimate killer : Kodak made a fatal development blunder and outsourced the sensor for the camera , to get it cheaply and quickly enough to meet their price point .
Unfortunately , that sensor was n't anywhere close to Kodak 's usual quality .
It was a horrible mistake from a company whose reputation had been built on the superiority of their sensors .
When the DCS 14n finally reached the real world , it had only slightly better resolution than the Canon camera , despite having many more pixels , and the overall image quality was substantially worse .
That was the end of Kodak 's premier position in the professional camera market .
So , lots of attempts and lots of failures ( I have n't even included lesser initiatives , like the Premier system or Kodak 's thermal transfer printers ) .
Some of those failures should have been seen in advance ; some of them could only be seen with hindsight .
But the bottom line does n't really care why you failed , only that you did .
Make no mistake , though , these failures are not because Kodak has had a lack of will or long - term perspective on what photography is all about .
To the extent that the school of hard knocks serves as any kind of a teacher for large corporations ( and I do n't know that it does ) , do n't write Kodak off .
They 've had a hell of a lot of education beaten into their skulls over the past quarter - century .
* David Alan Jay , then the Editor of Photo Techniques , did the same , long before Ctein joined the staff of that magazine .

Featured Comment by MBS : " Thank you for this posting .
It is both interesting and good to hear .
" I think that in this , as with so many things , there is an element of evolutionary BVSR ( blind variation , selective retention ) .
And the BS part ( interestingly ) of that more or less insures that it is not possible to know for certain ahead of time what adaptations will still be breathing when the fat amoeba sings .
An organism can be mutating like mad and yet still not make it within its local environment ( of course , the greater population within photography is , in fact , finding adaptations that work , as one would expect in a robust and complex system ) .
As much as we as individuals ( and corporate entities , too ) like to pat ourselves on the back over how well we were able to ' see ' and meet the future , I think there is more randomness to the selection process than we are comfortable admitting .
Kodak certainly has some smart people working for them , but that may not be enough .
Still , the opera ain't over : the amoeba has yet to take the stage . "
Featured Comment by Eamon Hickey : " My sense of this is similar to Ctein 's and to those expressed by Josh in the comments .
" I was working for Nikon from 1991 through early 1999 , and from that perch it was my observation that no company in the photography industry was savvy to the coming of digital anywhere near as early as Kodak .
The efforts that Ctein outlines are ones I remember well ( I quite well remember the PhotoCD , which first clued me in to the digital wave that was then still far over the horizon . )
" I 'm sure that Kodak made many , many errors over that time , but , really , as Josh suggests , I think the basic problem for them was that this was too big a change happening too fast .
The need for their core product plummeted drastically in less than a decade .
Who could manage that crisis smoothly ?
" Same for Polaroid .
Great company ; highly profitable for decades .
Gone in less than a decade .
Sure , their management made many mistakes , but they had a huge bottom line problem : their product just was n't needed any more . "
Featured Comment by Ken Tanaka : " I have to disagree with the remark from ' MBS , ' ' Still , the opera ain't over : the amoeba has yet to take the stage . '
Yeah , it basically is .
If you 're going to use life / science metaphors here , Kodak 's energy source is evaporating ... specifically , its capital value .
While EK is riding a bit of the same wave currently moving through the equities markets it 's merely a floater .
It has sold enough stock to paper the planet and still has a total market cap of just over $ 1 billion .
But its stock has traded below $ 8 for the past year and at this writing closed at $ 4.67 .
Kodak 's latest significant desperate move was to suspend their dividends after the fall of 2008 .
This was something of a death knell for many investors , since EK spent most of the past century as a dividend - paying large - cap value stock .
" Kodak is now firmly categorized as a ' distressed ' stock in the investment world , very few members of which have any confidence that they can pull out of their descent into oblivion .
They 're only barely ( and mostly only internally ) considered to be any part of the new world of imaging by the capital markets .
Most of the investment interest in EK comes from vultures waiting for opportunities to feed on its parts .
" The ' smart people ' on Kodak 's payroll are utterly irrelevant in the wake of so many poor and delusional management decisions over the past 20 years .
Yes , Kodak is making some good products here and there .
But they 're breathing the air in their long - buried coffin .
" As ' bobdales ' so succinctly observed earlier , ' Dead man walking . '
Yup . "

An old acquaintance of mine called today ; I had n't heard from him in a while .
He was born a Democrat -- in the Bronx - - an old line machine Democrat .
His dad was a cog in the machine and wound up a judge .
Had this acquaintance not been born into a Democratic family he would certainly be a Republican now .
He 's rich and does n't like minorities , not even gays like himself !
So instead of being a Republican he 's a DLC devotee .
I 'm not certain what made him call me today .
Possibly to just tell me how much he admires Harold Ford 's politics , which he went on about at great length ; or to say how thrilled he was that Moon 's conservative son Mitch was elected mayor of New Orleans .
" He can be bought and that 's a good thing , " he assured me .
Or it could have been to tell me how much he dislikes " that crazy radical on MSNBC you probably like . "
( He meant Olbermann , who he claims is basically the same as Glenn Beck or Bill O'Reilly but on the left .
He was offended when I suggested he gets all his ideas by being brainwashed by getting drunk and watching Fox . ) I watched Keith 's show a few hours later .
He does n't sound remotely like Beck or O'Reilly ; he deals with facts , not fringy propaganda .
Interestingly , right after Keith 's comments tonight on Richard Shelby , Shelby sheepishly withdrew his holds on some of President Obama 's 70 nominees he 's been holding hostage to more funds for his state .
( Shelby is the second worst earmark abuser in the Senate , something I never heard any teabaggers crying about . )
Anyway , he 's that crazy radical on MSNBC explaining it tonight :
Labels : Keith Olbermann , Shelby
Nathan Halbach , who decided to speak out as he was terminally ill with brain cancer about how it felt to grow up knowing that his absentee father was a Roman Catholic priest , died at home in Missouri on Friday .
He was 22 .
Mr. Halbach said he knew there were other children like him who had been fathered and abandoned by priests , but it was such a taboo to talk about it that he wanted to give them a voice .
In an interview this summer at his home in O’Fallon , he said of his father : “ He and my mom had a relationship and they were in love at the time , and they had me out of that relationship , but I never received any of that love at an age I could remember it .
I have so few memories of him , I ’ve met him so few times , it ’s just not been what I had hoped for . ”
His father , the Rev. Henry Willenborg , was suspended from his position as a parish priest in Ashland , Wis. , after an article in The New York Times in October revealed his liaisons with women .
He was removed by Bishop Peter Christensen of the Diocese of Superior , who said he acted after reading that the priest had urged Mr. Halbach ’s mother to have an abortion , and that another woman who said she had a relationship with Father Willenborg said she was a minor at the time .
It looked like a mad moment of expansionism .
Eight years ago , as part of a costly push into the digital age , the BBC set up a group of niche radio stations in a blizzard of canapés , cocktails and optimism .
At the time critics said that the then director general , Greg Dyke , was leading an unaccountable exercise in empire - building funded by the taxpayers .
It did seem a bit of risk , even to those involved .
Back in 2002 , not many people had digital radios and televisions .
By chance or design , BBC 6 Music , devoted to playing and supporting new and live music , has found a loyal listenership prepared to battle alongside the broadcasting unions to save it from closure .
As rumours of the threat to 6 Music grew , a rescue campaign was set up on Facebook by Jon and Tracy Morter , fresh from their success in promoting the extraordinary sales surge that saw Rage Against the Machine anointed as the Christmas No 1 .
Yesterday the Morters had more than 66,000 music fans on side and their list keeps growing .
International stars such as David Bowie also began to speak out .
Through his press company , Bowie stated : " 6 Music keeps the spirit of broadcasters like John Peel alive and for new artists to lose this station would be a great shame . "
The expected announcement this week of radical cuts that will include the closure of 6 Music is a desperate measure taken in adversity by Mark Thompson , the man now in Dyke 's chair .
In the current economic climate , the BBC fears it is about to come under serious attack , particularly if a Conservative government is elected in the spring .
The BBC Trust has asked Thompson to review the corporation 's structure and his weak denial of a plan to axe 6 Music suggests the station will be one of the sacrificial lambs to prevent wider privatisation .
The corporation promises that this is not the start of a comprehensive retreat from digital terrain , but just a " very hard look at our current activities and stopping doing some things that are not core to the BBC 's mission " .
The planned cuts will allow £ 600 m a year of the BBC's £ 3.6 bn licence fee income to go towards " higher quality programming " .
For DJs and music fans , the problem is best summed up by two remarks yesterday on the microblogging site Twitter .
While one contributor emitted the cyber - wail " Nooooo .
They can't shut BBC 6 Music " , another responded : " whats all this about 6 music .
never heard of it . is the 6 bit a typo ? "
Unfortunately , even today , when most homes can receive digital channels and radio , 6 Music has fewer than 700,000 listeners .
On 11 March 2002 , the comedian and DJ Phill Jupitus put out the first show on a new station that had been codenamed " Network Y " .
It was the first such launch at the Beeb for 32 years .
With its live sessions and idiosyncratic shows , 6 Music has attracted little national attention , although there was brief uproar in 2007 when controller Lesley Douglas changed the schedules to appeal to more women , saying that men had an intellectual approach to music listening , while women were more emotional .
The ferocious reaction was an indication of just how passionate music fans can be .
James Murdoch , News Corporation 's chairman and chief executive in Europe and Asia , accused the BBC at the Edinburgh Television Festival of having made an unfair " land grab " on the media market .
But he may soon see the commercial sector – in the shape of Absolute Radio , the station formerly known as Virgin Radio – step up to buy 6 Music .
Absolute 's chief operating officer , Clive Dickens , said last week : " We would buy both the brand and the network , and we 'd run it more efficiently . "
For the music industry , the survival of a station like 6 is key .
" I sincerely hope it does n't fall down .
It plays a lot of very exciting new music , " Mike Smith , managing director of Columbia Records , said .
" 6 Music has been the first place that a lot of bands have played live sessions .
It is one of the few places where the DJs actually play their own music and as a result it has a strong personality . "
Smith 's attitude is echoed by several of the DJs involved .
Richard Bacon was one of the first to step out from the corporation line .
" Here 's my prediction : 6 Music will survive because of the scale but most importantly the passion of the backlash that 's coming , " he tweeted last week , while the breakfast show host , Shaun Keaveny , told listeners : " First of all , massive thanks to everyone who has shown their support , it 's literally choking us up .
Nobody could know the whole story , and we wo n't until something like 9 March .
We hope it is n't true , of course . "
Lauren Laverne , the arts presenter and former rock star , is another of the DJs who help define 6 Music 's flavour , along with Stuart Maconie , Steve Lamacq , Jarvis Cocker and Elbow 's Guy Garvey .
Laverne also shared her feelings on Twitter .
" Looks like I 'm joining that Facebook group then , " she wrote .
" Boo , boo and thrice boo .
That is all . "
Considering what offbeat propositions 6 Music and its sister digital station , BBC Radio 7 , originally seemed to be , it is surprising how on target they both proved , finding devoted listeners who say they cannot find the same content elsewhere .
Radio 7 , which also launched in 2002 and plays archive drama and comedy material as well as some new children 's programmes , is the more popular of the two stations , with 884,000 tuning in at the end of last year .
It will escape this round of cuts , but another digital station , BBC Asian Network , is in the firing line , along with two initiatives aimed at teenagers , Switch and Blast !
Similarly , half the pages on the BBC website are likely to go , with a quarter of staff being axed .
The corporation 's publishing arm is also in danger of being sold off and spending on American imports could be cut by a quarter .
Spending on sports rights is to be capped .
Each of these moves will provoke its own battles .
Thompson is sailing into rough water whatever he does next , but last week 's call from the National Audit Office for a " change of culture " at the BBC , coupled with news that the corporation 's £ 1 bn - plus refurbishment of Broadcasting House will be four years late and £ 110 m over budget , is not a great place to start the voyage .
Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 24/2/2010 ( 3871 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
It 's the lap dance that 's gone viral .
Everyone from Inside Edition to a variety of different news websites and blogs is tuning in to the lapdance between two teachers that was captured on a student 's cell phone at Churchill High School last week .
The video , taken last Wednesday during a well - attended pep rally for Grade 9 through 12 students , shows students giggling , gasping and screaming as a female teacher -- identified as Chrystie Fitchner -- receives a strip club - style lap dance from a male teacher .
It 's believed the male teacher was a substitute .
On Tuesday night at a Churchill High event , one parent groaned after learning that the video had gone national .
" They so , so crossed the line , " said the parent , whose daughter showed her the video last week .
" It embarassed me .
While we were first watchinrg it I said , ' They crossed the line . '
My daughter said , ' Wait , it gets better . ' "
To translate teenspeak , it got worse : Among other things , the minute - long clip , which looks like it was made on a cellphone , shows the male teacher bobbing his head near the female teacher 's genitals , and grinding his rear end against her crotch .
The teachers , who are said to be relatively new to Churchill 's staff , were sent home with pay after a parent complained about the video , said Winnipeg School Division trustee Mike Babinsky .
Babinsky first learned of the video from a television producer on Tuesday afternoon .
A WSD spokesperson said the division could not comment on personnel matters , but that it does " expect respectful and professional conduct from all of our staff at all times . "
While many students thought the stunt was " gross , " the hubbub over the video is overblown , one teen said .
" At first we did n't realize what was going on , " said a student who was standing close to the action at the pep rally .
" Once the kids started screaming , it was like , ' Oh my goodness . '
I just think the joke went too far .
I think they should be talking to them , but I do n't think they should be suspended .
I understand its a serious thing , but they did n't mean to hurt anyone . "
Some parents fear the teachers ' actions have hurt the school itself .
" Churchill has really , really good teachers , " said a parent , who said the small Riverview school has been a wonderful environment for her two children .
" It makes me feel sad , because now they 'll be drawn into that sort of garbage .
That this happened is stupidity , but it should n't reflect on the school . "
Babinsky said the behaviour was " totally inappropriate . "
" They look to me like younger staff who got way too into it , " he said .
" You ca n't just look the other way in situations like this .
" By the same token , if you were to turn on the TV , within the next hour you 'd find something similar to that on a music station .
Society is sending mixed messages . "

The Misa Digital Guitar , an open source , Linux - powered MIDI controller , brings shredding to the 21st century by dumping traditional guitar strings for buttons and a futuristic touch screen .

Before you wooden - guitar purists get all bent out of shape , the Misa 's creator wants to make this perfectly clear : the digital guitar is intended to complement the traditional guitar , not replace it .
Intended as a tool for making electronic music , the Misa is played by pressing the 144 note buttons with the left hand and tapping a touch screen control pad with the right .
As a MIDI controller , the Misa can play any instrument pack you happen to have on your computer .

The Misa 's creator , Michael , explains :
In electronic music , the timbre ( or colour ) of the sound can be morphed in an infinite number of ways .
For a guitar to accommodate this , the right hand needs more control than just plucking strings .
You need to be able to control elements of the sound , such as sustain , pitch , filter cutoffs , contour or any other synthesizer parameter , in a way that has no physical constraints .

Look Inside
New Introduction 2010
It 's been over 7 years since I finished Winter is Coming .
Some of my predictions were wrong , some were right .
However , the most important prediction was correct .
That prediction was to get out of the market at the end of 2008 because a debt crisis would ensue .
I want to address two things in this new introduction .
The first concerns some advice I 've given my friends since the credit crisis began , in the fall of 2008 .
The second looks at my predictions from 2003 .
The following is a closely reproduced note I sent a friend of mine .
He asked me a simple question , " what should we do now that the crisis is here ? "
The best advice I can give you is to anticipate what 's going - on in your industry .
Ask yourself some questions , like , are there threats to your job being outsourced or severe cutbacks to your company due to lack of business ?
Will your industry be hurt by Austerity ( government budget - cuts and layoffs ) ?
Do you have a pension at your company or government job ?
Is it under - funded ?
If it is , do n’t plan on getting 100 cents on the dollar .
It ’ll be more like 50 cents on the dollar .
Whether your pension is in the public or private sector , you can retrieve the information you need to determine if your pension is safe ( fully funded and insured ) .
Do n't be in denial , face the fact that we got screwed ( again ) by the elite and now you and I need a plan .
Stay out of , or , pay down debt as quickly as possible because deflation is debt 's enemy .
Money is worth more tomorrow than it is today , so people save more .
We grew up knowing the opposite of that which was inflation .
In an inflationary environment money is worth more today than tomorrow .
Your salary has a good chance of getting cut but your debt level will stay the same ( at the very least , you will not receive a raise ) .
Furthermore , the Federal Reserve 's devaluing of the US dollar will send the price of the products that we need to survive , like Oil , corn , and metals etal higher .
We are in deflationary times and it is n't going away , I do n't care how many $s the fed prints .
If you have a mortgage , refinance because rates are low .
If you can , purchase a 15 yr mortgage not a 30 yr .
If you think your house will grow in value over the next 15 years , like it did in the 80s , 90s and early 00s , it wo n't .
There are n’t enough people to buy the inventory .
You can see a picture of this in the housing study I did , back in 2003 , on my website , here : http://www.jamesgoulding.com/Downloads/Housing.xls
The demographics in the United States have changed although not as drastic as other countries .
The Millennial generation is very large ( b1982-2004 ? ) .
Therefore , our housing crisis can get better as the Millennial generation enter the market in the late teens ' to buy their first homes .
However , prices still must come down .
In the end of the book , The Fourth Turning , written in 1997 , Strauss and Howe wrote an entire section called " How to prepare " for the coming " Winter era " ( that they correctly predicted ) .
I highly recommend it .
[ That ends the note I sent to my friend with the advice on how to handle this Winter era . ]
Secondly , I 'd like to address the two predictions , from 2003 , that I got wrong .
The one I take the most heat for is that I predicted either the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) would trade 35,000 , or , in 2009 , the market would crash .
Therefore I advised that people should be out of the market at the end of 2008 no matter where the DJIA was trading because the stock market ’s value would be cut in half .
We now know that the crash came first and the DJIA topped out at 14 k , and then broke down to 7 k .
When that occurred , all the wealth in the US was cut by a substantial percentage .
We had an economic crash and the size of inheritance and household net worth was cut by a huge amount .
Now , in 2011 , the tax laws will change .
As a result , the surviving generations will soon be receiving less than projected .
The stock market will be stuck in a range for the next decade .
I missed DOW 35 k but correctly predicted the market being cut in half .
The second thing I missed was the beginning of the 4th Turning ( Winter ) .
I thought it began in September of 2001 because of , 9/11 .
I remember sitting across the table from Neil Howe , back in 2003 , when he asked me if I really thought we 'd entered Winter .
I told him I thought we had .
He said we had n't and 9/11 would turn out to be a spark that fizzled .
Now we know he was correct .
However , we both concur that the Lehman bankruptcy was the beginning of Winter .
The most important evidence is society 's response to the crisis .
They 've responded to the credit crisis by changing their collective behavior , from shopping , to saving money .
After 9/11 , nothing changed collectively that lasted for more than a few months and the country splintered into factions after the invasion of Iraq .
That is not the recipe for a 4th Turning ( Winter ) .
I intend on writing a book called Winter is Here .
However , I 'd like to write a sequel to Nano .
I can't decide .
We shall see .
Lastly , thank you for purchasing my book .
I sincerely appreciate it .
Take care ,

Abstract Winter is Coming
Winter is coming , tells the story of a crisis era called Winter .
This crisis is just a few short years away .
The work in this book is based on two generational theorists , William Strauss and Neil Howe .
The book also includes economist Harry S. Dent 's work .
You 'll want to read this book if you want to know , why and who is forcing the coming crisis .
How the crisis era cycles through American History arrive like clockwork , yet , they shock everyone when they come
Learn how reoccurring financial , war , generational , and political cycles contribute to our history and shape our future .
Learn :
how ' America 's Greatest Generation ' ripped you off
why ' boomers suck '
how approximately every 85 years , the generations line up in specific age location that set the stage for the Winter era
about America 's biggest threat , the Euro
Winter is Coming is short , concise and a great introduction to the brilliant work of Strauss and Howe .
Excerpts : Winter is Coming
Society experiences a catalyst that shocks everyone out of an individualized stupor .
Suddenly focus is shifted on a national level .
This focus shifts attention from internal , national problems to outer , world problems .
World problems that were once ignored by the people in this country come to the forefront .
It ’s as if a collective mind turns its attention to what is going on outside this country .
* * *
Vietnam was n’t anything like Iraq in 2003 .
Not even close .
Wars in a 4th Turning ( Winter ) are total .
S&H go on to write , " Crisis - era wars were all large , deadly , and decisive .
Home front resolve conformed to the visions of the elder leaders , and the outcome totally redefined the kingdom , nation or empire . "
* * *
What Gen - X knows is that things are about to get messy .
Revolutionary messy .
And , I am not talking about Boomers shaking their collective fists at their G.I. fathers .
I ’m talking about all - out massive societal chaos .
One question still stands :
When is this all going to happen ?
* * *
Idealist generations are terrible at making collective decisions .
That fact is going to make or break us when the crisis sparks .
The Idealists ’ history as collective thinkers when making decisions about our future while in complete control of the political landscape is terrible , the worst incidence being the Civil War .
The Civil War is an example of a Winter era gone bad .
* * *
The Boomer archetype is Idealist .
The Idealist generation alive during the Civil War was the Transcendental ( b.1792-1821 ) and they are personally responsible for the early arrival of the War .
Furthermore , they are responsible for the slaughter of the Gilded generation ( Nomad ) .
Of the seven - million Gilded men who reached combat age , ten percent died in the War .
That casualty rate is equal to eight times WWIIs .
Of the remaining Gilded men , five percent of them ended the war in “ disease - ridden ” POW camps .
* * *
Tom Brokaw labeled the G.I. generation ( b.1901 - 1924 ) the “ greatest generation ” in his book of the same title .
I beg to differ .
There are many things that this generation did that are great .
They were truly the perfect Hero generation .
They came together when the country needed them , both men and women .
But this chapter is not going to shine the light on their good deeds .
This chapter will shine the light on something this generation did that is affecting all of us , right now .
Furthermore , it ’s not the first time this generational archetype shifted federal entitlements .
The G.I. generation shifted billions and billions of government money away from every other generation alive when they were in political power .
They held the White House for thirty years with nine U.S. Presidents .
They held Congress 1953 — 1975 and barely gave up control in 1977 , as they held onto 47 % of the power .
They ran on the majority ticket twelve straight times 1944 - 1988 .
During these years , they made sure that their generation was taken care of .
Unfortunately , they did it at our expense .
The Cover of Winter is Coming
The cover is a collage of pictures .
The idea was simple .
Find pictures relating to reoccurring national crisis ’ .
Then , lay those pix over a background pic of something that speaks to the season of winter .
Since Winter is Coming deals with a reoccurring crisis cycle , in American history , I went to the Internet and plugged in the date I wanted along with the name of the crisis .
The pictures in this document are the individual pictures used in the collage for the cover .
First I show the original picture I used .
Meaning , the picture in its original form before cropping and digital enhancements .
Then , I show the final cropped enhanced pic used on the cover .
Picture 1 is the evening paper from October 29 , 1929 heralding the final crash of the stock market that had started on September 10 , 1929 .
Basically , October 29 , 1929 was the straw that broke the camels back .
It was the last of many mini-crashes that took place over a 10 - week period that began September 10 , 1929 .
If you look at the right side of the picture , under the word PANIC , you ’ll see a smaller headline that says “ Bankers Finally Bring Selling to Halt Three Minutes Before Close ” .
That ’s the headline I wanted .
Picture 2 , shows the first stage of making the headline into the final product for the cover .
Picture 3 shows the final product I used for the cover .
Picture 1 ( October 29 , 1929 )
Picture 2 ( Crop and Distort headline )
Picture 3 ( Negative with brightness adjusted )
This particular crisis era was a double whammy .
The era ran from 1929 - 1945 .
The second incident was , of course , the bombing of Pearl Harbor .
FDR ’s letter to Congress is shown below .
I thought the quote in the first paragraph was paramount .
Its so recognizable .
“ A date which will live in infamy ” .
Picture 4 ( FDR ’s Letter to Congress , December 8 , 1941 )
Picture 5 depicts the final product for the cover , which I cropped the first paragraph , then embossed that in dark grey .
Picture 5 ( FDR ’s Letter to Congress , December 8 , 1941 , Embossed )
The next picture is a very interesting document .
It ’s the secret document that was sent to FDR well ahead of the bombing .
In fact the document was dated February 1 , 1941 .
Basically , FDR and the rest of the morons in Washington knew this was going to happen .
They not only did nothing to stop it , they encouraged it , for numerous reasons that this paper wo n’t cover .
The document is evidence of a pattern that has occurred in every ‘ Winter ’ crisis era .
That is , the politicos always know of the destructive event that ’s going to take place .
The event is usually devastating in either of two ways , loss of life or financial ruin .
Picture 6 , below , was used because I wanted to convey the message that politicians , during these types of crisis cycles ( Winter ) , are at their peak of scuminess .
I wanted this picture so badly that I used the whole thing without any enhancements .
Picture 6 is on the upper left - hand side of the cover .
Picture 6 ( Secret document sent to FDR , February 1 , 1941 )
I used one last picture from the 1929 - 1945 crisis era .
The original is shown in picture 7 , below .
Picture 7 ( Headline , Monday December 8 , 1941 )
I simply cropped the headline , and then created a 3 - D shape in MS Word .
Then , I used the cropped pic as the background for the 3 - D shape .
Picture 8 shows the crop , and picture 9 shows the final product .
Picture 8 ( Cropped Headline December 8 , 1941 )
Picture 9 ( Cropped with 3 - D Headline December 8 , 1941 )
* * *
The winter crisis era of 1929 - 1945 was n’t the only crisis era we ’ve experienced in the US .
The winter crisis era is a cycle repeated over and over again .
The other pictures on the cover depict 2 other winter era cycles we ’ve experienced , since becoming a nation .
The American Revolution and the Civil War .
Picture 10 , is the original pic , used to represent the beginning of the Civil War winter era .
The picture is a document about the Dred Scott decision .
Scholars like to argue about exactly what was the spark that lit the candle that ignited the Civil War .
Some state that it was the Dred Scott decision .
I do n’t believe that it was .
However , I see it as a catalyst , like Strauss & Howe ( of the book Generations ) do .
Picture 10 ( Dred Scott Decision )
The picture went through several changes before I decided on the pic you see on the cover .
The phases of the Dred Scott pic are below .
Picture 14 was the one I used on the cover .
Picture 11 shows the date of the decision .
I decided against using the date pic because I thought the name carried more weight than the date .
Picture 11 ( Dred Scott Date Cropped )
Picture 12 ( Dred Scott Name , Yellowed )
Picture 13 ( Dred Scott Name Cropped )
Picture 14 ( Dred Scott Name Cropped and Embossed )
The spark that lit the candle that began the civil war is one of two things .
Either Lincoln being elected or Fort Sumter .
I chose Fort Sumter .
Fort Sumter was attacked April 18 , 1861 .
This incident was truly the stepping - off point for the beginning of the war , as far as fighting was concerned .
From this date forward the fighting escalated .
Pix 15 - 17 depict the evolution of what your see on the cover
Picture 15 ( Fort Sumter Original )
Picture 16 ( Fort Sumter Cropped )
Picture 17 ( Fort Sumter Cropped and Negative with Brightness Adjusted )
Picture 17 is placed in the middle of the cover .
* * *
The winter era prior to the Civil War was the Revolution .
The era took place 1773 - 1794 .
I considered a picture of Paul Revere , which you can see below .
I decided against it and I really do n’t know why .
The battle of Lexington / Concord is best described by www.kidport.com
“ On April 18 , 1775 , British General Thomas Gage sent 700 soldiers to destroy guns and ammunition the colonists had stored in the town of Concord , just outside of Boston .
They also planned to arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock , two of the key leaders of the patriot movement . ”
Picture 18 ( Paul Revere )
Picture 19 ( The Battle of Lexington Original )
Picture 20 ( ( The Battle of Lexington Embossed )
Picture 20 is the one you see on the cover of the book .
I simply embossed the original .
The picture is on the lower right hand side of the cover .
The last photo , used to depict a crisis era , is the Declaration of Independence , below .
Picture 21 ( The Declaration of Independence Original )
The date is a tad significant do n’t you think ?
Also , I used the original .
Although I did try to do several things to the photo , in the end , I decided on the original .
If the British did n’t believe we were for real from all the acts committed 1773 - 1775 , then this sent them a message that we were going to become free or kick their ass .
Lastly , the background photo , used for the cover , is shown in picture 22 .
If this pic does n’t depict winter I do n’t know what does .
It ’s a beautiful photo .
I found it on www.targetvision.com.
They have some great stuff there .
Picture 22 ( Background for Cover , Icicles )
The following pic was an idea that got thrown out .
I thought it was pretty cool though .
Picture 23 ( Ice with Title , Author )
The final process for putting the cover together was taking picture 22 and pasting all the other pics onto it .
I built it in MS Picture It ! 99 , because the program is great for making collages .
I laid the final pic over itself to give it the affect you see in the final product , which can be seen at the very beginning of this document .
Thanks for your interest in the creative process of making the cover of Winter is Coming .

From Chris Csikszentmihalyi , Director of the M.I.T. Center for Future Civic Media : an important note to techies who are concerned with the situation in Haiti .
In the response to the earthquake in Haiti , many organizations have created sites where people could find one another , or least information about their loved ones .
This excellent idea has been undermined by its success : within 24 hours , it became clear that there were too many places where people were putting information ; each site became a silo .
People within the IT community recognized the danger of too many unconnected sites , and Google became interested in helping .
Google is now running an embeddable application at : //haiticrisis.appspot.com /
We recognize that many newspapers have put precious resources into developing a people - finder system .
We nonetheless urge them to make their data available to the Google project , and standardize on the Google widget .
Doing so will greatly increase the number of successful reunions .
I am not affiliated with Google — indeed , this is a volunteer initiative by some of their engineers — but this is one case where their reach and capacity can help the most people .
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the reasoning behind this request .
Any questions about the widget or its functionality or features are best directed to Google .
Usually , when someone says their iPhone is a life saver , they are talking about the phone helping them find a good takeout spot or an emergency bathroom .
When Dan Woolley says it , he really means it .
He used a medical app saved on his phone to treat a leg injury after the Hotel Montana in Port - au - Prince collapsed around him .
Woolley , who is from Colorado Springs , is one of the Americans who survived the massive earthquake that hit Haiti last week , and he did it with an iPhone application .
Woolley is now recovering at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami , but it was his fast actions with the app that may have saved his life .
Woolley used the light from his iPhone to show him his injuries and diagnosed it properly as a broken foot .
Then , he used the instructions from the app to treat the excessive bleeding from cuts on his legs and the back of his head .
Woolley used his shirt to tie off the three - inch gash that was opened on his leg and a sock to bandage the back of his head .
He said he also looked up ways to stop from going into shock .
" I kind of had some time to do some self - diagnosis down there , " Woolley said .
" God was with me . "
Not bad for a film producer who was in Haiti filming a documentary on efforts to help the nation 's poverty - stricken children .
Woolley also used his camera to take pictures of the surrounding rubble to piece together a way out .
He eventually took refuge in an elevator shaft until rescue crews found him 65 hours after the earthquake .
" I took pictures all around me , then I would hold up the back of the camera to me and I could see what the picture was of a little , " he said .
" I was able to find an elevator in one of the pictures and that is where I decided to hobble to be in a more safe location . "
On Tuesday , Woolley told The Today Show he knew he was going to die and decided to write a journal on his notepad to his wife and young kids in the event someone found his corpse under the rubble .
" I was in a big accident .
Do n't be upset at God .
He always provides for his children even in hard times , " Woolley wrote in the dim light .
" I 'm still praying that God will get me out but he may not but He will always take care of ya . "
U.S. President Barack Obama ’s plan for a 30,000 - troop surge and a troop withdrawal timeline beginning in 18 months has caught criticism from both Democrat and Republican lawmakers .
But a small group of hawkish foreign policy experts  who have lobbied the White House since August to escalate U.S. involvement in Afghanistan  are christening Obama the new " War President . "
The response to Obama ’s Tuesday night speech at West Point has largely been less than enthusiastic , with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle finding plenty in the administration ’s Afghanistan plan that fails to live up to their expectations .
Republicans have hammered the White House on Obama ’s decision to begin a drawdown of U.S. forces in 18 months , while Democrats largely expressed ambivalence or dismay over the administration ’s willingness to commit 30,000 more soldiers to a war seen by many as unwinnable and costly at a time when the U.S. economy is barely in recovery from the global financial crisis .
The White House ’s rollout of the 30,000 troop surge did little to convince an already skeptical Congress , but foreign policy hawks who have accused the president of " dithering " in making a decision on Afghanistan are praising the administration ’s willingness to make the " tough " commitment to escalate the U.S. commitment in the war in Afghanistan .
Indeed , their approval of the White House ’s decision to commit 30,000 troops is the culmination of a campaign led by the newly formed Foreign Policy Initiative ( FPI ) .
FPI held its first event in March , titled " Afghanistan : Planning for Success , " and a second event in September  " Advancing and Defending Democracy "  which focused on counterinsurgency in combating the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
The newly formed group is headed up by the Weekly Standard ‘s editor Bill Kristol ; foreign policy adviser to the McCain presidential campaign Robert Kagan ; and former policy adviser in the George W. Bush administration Dan Senor .
Kagan and Kristol were also co-founders and directors of the Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) , a number of whose 1997 charter members , including the elder Cheney , former Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld , and their two top aides , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby and Paul Wolfowitz , respectively , played key roles in promoting the 2003 invasion of Iraq and Bush ’s other first - term policies when the hawks exercised their greatest influence .
The core leadership of FPI has waged their campaign in countless editorials and columns published in the Washington Post , the Wall Street Journal , and the Weekly Standard .
These articles have often been highly critical , at times suggesting that Obama ’s unwillingness to give Gen .
Stanley McChrystal the 20,000 to 40,000 troops requested in his September report to Defense Secretary Robert Gates amounted to " dithering " and projected U.S. weakness to the Taliban , al - Qaeda , and U.S. allies in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Senor described himself as " pleasantly surprised " and " quite encouraged by the president ’s decision " in a Republican National Committee sponsored conference call .
" It seems to me that Obama deserves even more credit for courage than Bush did , for he has risked much more .
By the time Bush decided to support the surge in Iraq in early 2007 , his presidency was over and discredited , brought down in large part by his own disastrous decision not to send the right number of troops in 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , or 2006 , " wrote Kagan in the Washington Post on Wednesday .
" Obama has had to make this decision with most of his presidency still ahead of him .
Bush had nothing to lose .
Obama could lose everything , " Kagan concluded .
The theme of heralding Obama as a stoic decision - maker in the face of an administration and Congress that seek to " manage American decline "  as Kagan wrote  was also echoed by Bill Kristol in the Washington Post on Wednesday .
" By mid-2010 , Obama will have more than doubled the number of American troops in Afghanistan since he became president ; he will have empowered his general , Stanley McChrystal , to fight the war pretty much as he thinks necessary to in order to win ; and he will have retroactively , as it were , acknowledged that he and his party were wrong about the Iraq surge in 2007  after all , the rationale for this surge is identical to Bush ’s , and the hope is for a similar success .
He will also have embraced the use of military force as a key instrument of national power , " wrote Kristol .
The heralding of Obama as " A War President "  which was the title of Kristol ’s article in the Washington Post  is a striking change of tone from some of the same pundits who were vociferously attacking the administration for every major policy initiative as recently as last week .
" Just what is Barack Obama as president making of our American destiny ?
The answer , increasingly obvious , is a hash .
It ’s worse than most of us expected .
His dithering on Afghanistan is deplorable , his appeasing of Iran disgraceful , his trying to heap new burdens on a struggling economy destructive .
Add to this his sending Khalid Sheikh Mohammed for a circus - like court trial , " wrote Kristol in the Nov. 23 edition of the Weekly Standard .
" The next three years are going to be long and difficult ones for our economy , our military , and our country , " he wrote .
The hawkish Wall Street Journal editorial board  which on Sept. 10 suggested that Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize because he sees the U.S. " as weaker than it was and the rest of the planet as stronger , " and on Sept. 18 described the administration ’s decision to scrap a missile defense agreement with Poland and the Czech Republic as following " Mr. Obama ’s trend of courting adversaries while smacking allies "  also exhibited a noticeable change in tone in praising the White House ’s decision to surge troop levels .
" We support Mr. Obama ’s decision , and this national effort , notwithstanding our concerns about the determination of the president and his party to see it through .
Now that he ’s committed , so is the country , and one of our abiding principles is that nations should never start ( much less escalate ) wars they do n’t intend to win , " said the Journal ‘s editorial board on Wednesday .
The board ’s qualified endorsement of the White House ’s war plan seems to reflect both the Republican concerns that Obama may use the 18 - month deadline as an excuse to withdraw from Afghanistan before the Taliban and al - Qaeda are defeated and foreign policy hawks  such as those at FPI  who are pleased with the administration ’s decision to commit more fully to the war in Afghanistan .
Hawks , such as Kagan and Kristol , may have to argue in 18 months for an extension of the withdrawal deadline but in similarly worded statements they both expressed confidence that this would not be a problem .
" If we and our Afghan allied partners are succeeding [ by July 2011 ] , the timing [ of the withdrawal ] may make sense .
If we are n’t it wo n’t .
It will not be any easier for Obama to embrace defeat in 18 months than it is today , " wrote Kagan in the Washington Post in response to concerns about the timeline for withdrawal .
" [ T ]he July 2011 date also buys Obama time .
It enables him to push off pressure to begin withdrawing , or to rethink the basic strategy , for 18 months .
We ’ve come pretty far from all the talk about off ramps at three or six - month intervals in 2010 that we were hearing just a little while ago , " Kristol wrote on the Weekly Standard ‘s blog on Tuesday .
For hawks like Kristol , Kagan , and Senor who have been calling for a surge in U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan since August , Obama ’s announcement on Tuesday night was a high - point in their campaign of op - eds , columns , and conferences , to push the Obama White House in the direction of an escalation in Afghanistan .
Kristol concluded his blog post on a confident note .
" In a way , Obama is now saying :
We ’re surging and fighting for the next 18 months ; see you in July 2011 .
That ’s about as good as we ’re going to get . "

This post walks through the steps for using Clojure to write an extremely simple web application .
The web application will use the Ring and Enlive libraries .
Firstly install Leiningen , this is a simple build tool for Clojure , follow the instructions on the web page and place the lein somewhere on your executable path .
Now use leiningen to create a new clojure project ; I always name my projects after vegetables so we will call this one sprout .
Execute this command at the command line :
% lein new sprout
This will create a directory called sprout .
Change into the newly created directory and issue the following commands :
sprout % lein deps sprout % lein test
The first command will download some dependent libraries and the second command will run a default unit test that should fail like this :
[ null ] Testing sprout.core - test [ null ] FAIL in ( replace - me ) ( core_test.clj : 6 ) [ null ] expected : false [ null ] actual : false [ null ]
Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions .
[ null ] 1 failures , 0 errors . [ null ]
-------------------- [ null ]
Total : [ null ]
Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions .
[ null ] 1 failures , 0 errors .
If this all goes successfully we have a project ready to work with .
Working with Clojure is made a lot easier if you have a working REPL to interact with , create a file called clj in the project directory containing a script like this :
#!/bin/bash LIBS=`printf " %s : " lib /*. jar | sed s/:$ //` if [ $ # - eq 0 ] ; then java - cp $ LIBS : src clojure .
main else java - cp $ LIBS : src clojure .main $ 1 -- $@ fi
Make sure this script is executable and check that it works from the command line like this :
sprout%./clj Clojure 1.1.0 user= > (+ 2 3 ) 5 user= > ^C sprout %
Now edit the project.clj file to add dependencies for the Ring and Enlive libraries , the file should look like this :
( defproject sprout " 1.0.0 - SNAPSHOT " : description " Simple program to play with ring and enlive " : dependencies [ [org.clojure / clojure " 1.1.0 " ] [ org.clojure/clojure-contrib " 1.1.0 " ] [ ring " 0.1.1 - SNAPSHOT " ] [ enlive " 1.0.0 - SNAPSHOT " ] ] )
Now use leiningen to download the dependencies :
sprout % lein deps
Now let us create a basic application that will serve some web pages , edit the file src/ sprout / core.clj to look like this :
( ns sprout.core ) ( defn router [ req ] ( condp = ( : uri req ) " / error " {:status 404 : headers { " Content - Type " " text / html " } : body ( str " Error " ) } " / info " {:status 200 : headers { " Content - Type " " text / html " } : body ( str " This is Ring on " ( : server - name req ) ) } {:status 200 : headers { " Content - Type " " text / html " } : body ( str " Welcome " ) } ) ) ( defn app [ req ] ( router req ) )
This contains two functions , the router function generates different pages dependent on the requested uri and the app function that forwards a request to the router .
We can test this code with a unit test , edit the file test / sprout / core_test.clj and make it look like this :
( ns sprout.core - test ( :use [ sprout.core ] : reload - all ) ( :use [ clojure.test ] ) ) ( deftest not - found - error ( let [ req {:uri " / error " } resp ( app req ) ] ( is ( = 404 ( : status resp ) ) ) ) ) ( deftest default - page ( let [ req {:uri " /index.html " } resp ( app req ) ] ( is ( = 200 ( : status resp ) ) ) ) ) ( deftest info - page ( let [ req {:uri " / info " : server - name " test " } resp ( app req ) ] ( testing " Info page shown " ( is ( = 200 ( : status resp ) ) ) ( is ( = " This is Ring on test " ( : body resp ) ) ) ) ) )
You can run this test with lein test at the command line .
So far this is pure functional Clojure with no real web pages in site , just a map being passed into a function and a different map being returned , the maps happen to be keyed with keys that look a bit like http requests and responses .
The Ring library wraps these functions with adapters that talk to real web containers we will use Jetty to demonstrate real web pages .
Create a new file in src/ sprout called run.clj and edit it to appear like this :
( ns sprout.run ( use [ ring.adapter.jetty ] ) ( use [ sprout.core ] ) ) ( run-jetty app {:port 8080} )
Now from the command line do this :
sprout%./clj src/sprout/run.clj
2010-02-27 14:08:03.602::INFO : Logging to STDERR via org.mortbay.log.StdErrLog
2010-02-27 14:08:03.604::INFO : jetty - 6.1.14 2010-02-27 14:08:03.727::INFO : Started SocketConnector@0.0.0.0 :8080
Using a browser visit the urls http://localhost:8080 , http://localhost:8080/info and http://localhost:8080/error .
All being well you should see a welcome page , an info page and a 404 error .
Ring provides a further level of wrapper functions that enable html processing pipelines to be built using simple functions written in Clojure .
The pages you have seen so far have n’t looked very impressive , they are not even valid HTML !
We could embed the HTML in the code or write a library to generate HTML in Clojure but instead we will use Enlive .
Enlive is a selector based templating library , this differs from templating languages such as JSP or ASP in that the raw html remains untouched , functions are written that use css selectors to replace and augment the existing html .
Create a file in the src / sprout directory called enlive.clj and edit it to appear like this :
( ns sprout.enlive ( :use [ net.cgrand.enlive -html ] ) ) ( deftemplate t1 " templates /t1.html " [ ] [ : h1 ] ( content " heading " ) ) ( defn enlive - template [ ] ( apply str ( t1 ) ) )
The deftemplate declaration creates a template called t1 , that takes no parameters and substitutes the content of any h1 tags with the word heading .
The function enlive - template just applies the template to generate HTML .
Now add a new mapping to the router defined in src/ sprout / core.clj to use this function , the file should now look like this :
( ns sprout.core ( :use sprout.enlive ) ) ( defn router [ req ] ( condp = ( : uri req ) " / error " {:status 404 : headers { " Content - Type " " text / html " } : body ( str " Error " ) } " / info " {:status 200 : headers { " Content - Type " " text / html " } : body ( str " This is Ring on " ( : server - name req ) ) } " / enlive " {:status 200 : headers { " Content - Type " " text / html " } : body ( enlive - template ) } {:status 200 : headers { " Content - Type " " text / html " } : body ( str " Welcome " ) } ) ) ( defn app [ req ] ( router req ) )
Running the run script again :
prout %./clj src/sprout/run.clj
2010-02-27 15:10:35.476::INFO : Logging to STDERR via org.mortbay.log.StdErrLog
2010-02-27 15:10:35.479::INFO : jetty - 6.1.14 2010-02-27 15:10:35.528::INFO : Started SocketConnector@0.0.0.0 :8080
Now go to http://localhost:8080/enlive and an HTML page should be visible .
This has been an extremely basic introduction to using Ring and Enlive with Clojure to serve up web pages .
I ’ll be expanding on this example at a later date to dive deeper into the functionality of Ring , Enlive and Clojure .
The Obama administration has decided that Barack Obama can break any law he signs if Obama decides that the law in not constitutional and that he can do this whenever he wants and that he does not even have to tell anyone what he is doing .
Seriously .
At least George W. Bush informed that American people that he intended to break the laws that he was signing by including a “ signing statement ” when he objected to something in a bill .
As bad and as unconstitutional as that was , now the Obama administration is taking things to a whole new level by saying that even if Barack Obama signs a bill into law , the Obama administration can still break any law in that bill if the Obama administration decides that it is an “ unconstitutional ” limit on Obama ’s power .
In essence this bring the United States even closer to a dictatorship .
If the president has the ultimate power to decide what is and what is not constitutional , and if the president also has the power to break any laws that he does not feel are constitutional , then the reality is that there are very few limits on his power .
The only limit is essentially how big of an imagination he has .
While Bush was in office , he challenged about 1,200 sections of bills , and Barack Obama continued this “ signing statement ” pattern during his first few months .
However , Obama has not issued a signing statement since last summer .
Last June , Obama issued a signing statement that claimed that he could openly disobey a new law requiring administration officials to push the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to adopt certain policies that Congress wanted .
That signing statement sparked a tremendous backlash on Capitol Hill .
Since then , the Obama administration has decided that instead of issuing signing statements , Obama will just ignore the provisions of any bill that the Obama administration believes are unconstitutional .
For example , the Obama administration has flatly disregarded a new law passed by Congress that forbids State Department officials from attending United Nations meetings led by nations deemed to be state sponsors of terrorism .
So now Obama gets to essentially have his cake and eat it too .
He can sign into law the various bills sent to him by Congress but can also ignore anything in them that he does not want to follow himself .
So can anything be done about this ?
The truth is that this type of thing could quickly escalate into a constitutional crisis .
But with the Democrats in charge of both Congress and the White House , the odds of Congress complaining to the Supreme Court about what Obama is doing are so low as to not even be worth mentioning .
So for right now at least , Barack Obama will get to continue to openly break many of the laws that he is signing and nothing will be done about it .
Welcome to the new Amerika .
A few scanning tips www.scantips.com
Say No to 72 dpi
We still frequently hear the very bad advice : " Computer video screens show images at 72 dpi , so scan all your images for the screen at 72 dpi " .
This is incredibly wrong ; it simply does n't work that way .
It has a very different meaning .
Regardless what you may have heard almost everywhere , there is no purpose or reason for 72 dpi images on computer video screens or web pages .
As a concept , 72 dpi is simply a false notion .
It is a myth .
It is NOT how video systems work , and it is detrimental to understanding how things really do work .
It is very easy to show proof of this here .
If you want to know why , you 're in the right place .
This section is written unusually , as an argument , because there are some people that are , let 's say , extremely certain that 72 dpi ( or 96 dpi ) is surely somehow quite important for images on the computer video screen .
They may have no clue how or why , they have just always heard it was important .
Sometimes they want to argue this anyway , so this is written for them , and I hope it may give them cause to simply look at what actually happens on their own screen before they email me .
Other people have also heard how 72 dpi was supposedly important , but they can't make it work , it does not produce the desired results ( which is in fact the correct answer about the validity of 72 dpi ) .
This is also written to be useful for them , but the diatribe may be a bit thick .
< grin >
When I say video , I simply mean video systems which operate the computer monitor .
I am not referring to movies or animation .
All the digital image basics fully apply to images from either scanners or from digital cameras .
Same thing , digital images .
The only difference is the method of creating the images .
Once created , it is all just pixels , and printing and video are still exactly the same ideas for all .
I would invite you to view :
412 x 324 pixels , 7 dpi , prints 58 x 46 inches
412 x 324 pixels , 72 dpi , prints 5.7 x 4.5 inches
412 x 324 pixels , 720 dpi , prints 0.57 x 0.45 inches
Frankly , I do n't see much difference on the screen .
< grin > ( and this is YOUR video system that we are using too ) .
I am not making this up , you can see what in fact actually happens , and it 's going to be real hard to dispute that .
But for anyone who still wants to argue that there is any significance of 72 dpi ( or 96 dpi ) on the screen , please begin by explaining why there is no evidence whatsoever of it on the screen .
If 72 dpi matters at all , then how can these three very different images appear identical ?
Please also explain how any 72 dpi notion might have been used to create these 412x324 pixel images from small 35 mm film ( film size is 36x24 mm , about 1.4 x 0.92 inches ) .
I 'm teasing .
I know it is not possible that anyone can explain how 72 dpi is important in any way to these ( or any ) screen images .
The notion of 72 dpi is flat wrong — video simply does n't work that way .
There is no concept of dpi on the video screen .
It should instead be very clear from the above example that images are obviously shown on any screen only according to their size in pixels .
In every case , you should just create the image size ( pixels ) that is the size that you want to see ( pixels ) .
So , forget about 72 dpi , it does not work that way .
72 dpi is a false notion , even worse than useless , because it is counter - productive , both to results and to understanding how it really works .
There is no concept of dpi in the video system .
There are only pixels .
Yes , these three 412x324 pixel images are all the same image , three identical copies of one image , created from a 35 mm negative scanned at 2820 dpi , and then resampled to 1/8 size , effectively 2820 / 8 = 352 dpi size now ( scanning 0.92 inches film width at 352 dpi would also give 324 image pixel height ) .
However that really does n't matter now , not on the video screen ( which simply shows pixels ) , but since they are in fact individually scaled to 7 , 72 , and 720 dpi now as stated , and this makes them be three very different images when they are printed on paper .
The 7 , 72 , and 720 dpi values here are very true , honest and legitimate in every respect .
To understand this better , you can save these images on your disk by clicking each image with the RIGHT or 2nd mouse button , and selecting Save Image As , and then examine the individual image properties of those disk files in your photo editor .
These three images will look exactly the same in your photo editor too , because it will show the same 412x324 pixel image size ( the size the image actually is ) .
But your examination of the image files will show that these images really do all in fact carry exactly the three different dpi values indicated here .
The three images are identical size on the video screen ( all are 412x324 pixels — dpi is ignored on the screen ) .
But the three image files are indeed all very different now when printed on paper , at least when you print them individually from a photo editor .
Dpi is for printing on paper ( where inches exist ) .
The three images are obviously the same size on the screen ( that size is 412x324 pixels ) , but three images are indeed scaled to 7 dpi , 72 dpi , and 720 dpi , and the image properties definitely will show printed size of 58 inches , 5.7 inches , and 0.57 inches on paper .
This dpi applies only to paper , or wherever inches might exist .
IMAGE DPI DOES NOT APPLY TO VIDEO SCREENS .
The three images will obviously print at those inch sizes on paper ( printed from your photo editor 's File - Print menu , but NOT from the web browser - more about printing from web browsers near the end ) .
I do n't know how to print the largest 58x46 inch image ( unless you own a billboard printing company ) , but you can just examine its properties .
Do NOT use the clipboard Copy function to inspect the images .
That never works to show this .
The video screen image does not retain any dpi information ( because video screens have no use for dpi info ) , so the clipboard Copy cannot retain the dpi information stored in the JPG file .
However then , if blank dpi information , Windows programs will always show you 96 dpi for any file ( or Adobe will always show 72 dpi ) - for any image that has not retained the file dpi info ( see Logical Inch discussed on next page ) .
The video screen did NOT save the dpi number because the screen has no use for dpi .
So , save the actual file as instructed above , and then open that actual file in your photo editor to see the actual dpi information in the file .
I am discussing the actual image file .
On second thought , maybe do try the clipboard copy on the image , knowing what to expect in regard to dpi , and knowing that it will only show a false dpi number from the operating system ( NOT about this image ) , just to see it and to understand and believe it .
Our printer drivers definitely do use dpi — dpi is all important to printers because printers print on paper , and paper is dimensioned in inches .
But video systems know no concept of dpi at all , nor any concept of inches either .
Video systems simply show the 412x324 pixels , pixel for pixel .
Any dpi value is always ignored on the screen , regardless what value it is .
Dpi is simply not defined in the video system .
I am not making up anything — you can clearly see what actually happens on your own video screen .
That is the Real World , and that is all there is to it , and what actually happens is all that matters , so if you understand this much — that any image will always be displayed on the video screen only according to its size in pixels — then you 've got it right .
But if 72 dpi is still of any interest , then read on .
It may be a bit much , more than you expect , but the details are here .
For the video screen , and therefore obviously for web pages too , simply scan images at whatever resolution necessary to get the image size desired ( pixels ) from the area size of the original being scanned .
This is very easily computed .
The size of the image in pixels is all that matters on any video screen .
For example , this image is from 35 mm film .
If an area the size of 35 mm film ( 36x24 mm , about 1.4x0.92 inches ) is scanned at 72 dpi , we get an image size of ( 1.4 inches x 72 dpi ) x ( 0.92 inches x 72 dpi ) , which is about 100x66 pixels , if from full frame .
The width of this one shown is cropped slightly smaller horizontally , to 84x66 pixels , but it is full height .
Any 72 dpi scan of 35 mm film is not likely very useful , this is too small for most purposes , only thumbnail size .
72 dpi is simply the wrong concept for the video screen .
It really does not matter what scanning resolution was used , just as long as it was the appropriate value to create the desired number of image pixels from the area you are scanning ( see details in the previous Video Resolution Basics section ) .
As just demonstrated , the video system does not even look at the image dpi number when displaying the image on the screen .
Screens only know about pixels .
Yet I get some comments like " No way that image is 7 dpi , it looks as good as the others " .
Yes , on the screen , that was pretty much my point too .
< grin >
The dpi is for scanning resolution , to determine the image size ( pixels ) created from the area scanned .
Thereafter , dpi is just a number added to the image file to instruct printers what size to print it .
For printing , you can definitely believe that these three images above are indeed actually scaled to 7 , 72 , and 720 dpi ( just look for yourself ) .
Yet all obviously appear the same 412x324 pixel size and have the same appearance on your screen , on my screen , on any screen , including on this web page in your browser , and in your photo editor program too .
And this is the point ; it shows that video systems simply do not use image dpi .
Never ever , no way , no how .
I do n't know how to make it more clear .
< grin >
Note that this argument is NOT about if the term should be called dpi or ppi .
I learned to say dpi , like historical usage always has .
If you want to call it ppi , that 's fine , same thing , and it is still exactly what I am discussing here .
More about that name here , but it is unrelated - the video system has no concept of either term .
The video system simply shows pixels directly , and has no concept of inches at all .
You can and should notice that the terms " dpi " or " ppi " simply do not appear in any user manual for any monitor or for any video board .
The really good reason is because the concept of dpi simply does not exist in the video system .
The numbers that you will see in the video specifications will be screen size numbers like 1920x1080 pixels .
The difference in video screens and printers is that paper is dimensioned in inches , and printers do use dpi , and these three images will all print on paper at very different sizes ( printed from a photo editor instead of printing this web page ) .
Dpi is for printing , and your printer definitely will honor printing resolution to print individual images , and will print these individually at the sizes shown above ( except your printer probably cannot handle the big one ) .
But screens only show pixels , and these three 412x324 pixel images are the same 412x324 pixel size on any screen .
All of the above is the obvious evidence which you can clearly see actually happens , if you simply look .
Any correct theory must actually describe what we can clearly see actually happens .
Nothing about 72 dpi can ever do that ( the major reason is because video does not work that way — the video system totally ignores any dpi number in image files , and shows the pixels directly ) .
The One True Way Video Actually Works
There is no concept of inches in any video system .
There are only pixels .
We buy a monitor size with its diagonal dimensioned in inches , but it only shows pixels .
This should be obvious , because regardless of the size of our monitor screen ( inches ) , our video settings can only specify a certain screen size measured in pixels .
The inches do not matter at all , because if we specify a 1920x1080 pixel screen size , then 1920x1080 pixels of video board memory will be used to build the screen image of that size .
This 1920x1080 pixel image size requires a video board with at least ( 1920x1080 x3 RGB ) = 6 MB of video memory to hold that image .
This is the purpose of that video board memory , to hold that 1920x1080 pixel screen image .
That same 1920x1080 pixel memory image is directly output to the monitor cable , regardless of what size monitor we attach .
We can connect any size of monitor ( inches ) , and a big monitor will show that 1920x1080 pixel screen image bigger , and a small monitor will show it smaller , but if we specified 1920x1080 pixels , then we are definitely going to see 1920x1080 pixels , regardless of monitor size ( be it cell phone screen size or huge HDTV wall screen size ) .
Our video system is only about those 1920x1080 pixels .
We can of course specify other screen dimensions in our computer software ( but should n't for best sharpness on a LCD monitor ) , but if we specify 1920x1080 pixels , then 1920x1080 pixels is what we get and see .
1920x1080 pixels is a popular choice , and I will refer to it generically here , to mean " whatever screen dimension setting that you have chosen " .
The video system does not even know nor care what size the monitor tube is .
We can attach any monitor we wish , 12 inch or 27 inch , and nothing changes in the video system .
The video system only knows about the 1920x1080 pixels , and we are going to see 1920x1080 pixels spread over the full screen of any monitor we attach to show it .
Any embedded 412x324 pixel image ( as above ) is just some part of those total 1920x1080 screen pixels .
The 412x324 pixel image will be shown at 412x324 pixels size , simply because that is its size .
That is how video works .
Inches are totally unknown , there are only pixels .
And if no inches exist , then clearly any notion of dpi is extremely suspect too .
This much is very obvious , just look at what you see .
In our world of digital images , dpi is for printing images on paper , or for scanning images from paper or film .
Dpi means " pixels per inch " and it implies inches on paper , or film , or someplace where inches exist .
Paper is dimensioned in inches , but video screens are dimensioned in pixels , and there is no concept of dpi in the video system .
Forgive my saying the same thing over and over , but some people are reluctant to imagine this immediately .
The three images above are each 412 x 324 pixels in size .
Digital images are dimensioned in pixels .
Those pixel dimension numbers are extremely important , because video systems pay very careful attention to the image size in pixels .
Images are dimensioned in pixels , and screens are dimensioned in pixels , and image pixels are directly displayed on the screen , one for one — one image pixel at one video board pixel location ( assuming we view 100 % image size ) .
That is simply how video images are shown .
Pixels are shown directly , without any concept of dpi at all .
So these three images above were each shown to be 412x324 pixels in size , on any screen , simply because the images are in fact 412x324 pixels in size , and because screens show pixels directly .
Complicated today :
We can zoom the web screen by using Windows text size zoom , and / or by zooming in the View menu of browsers .
Windows zoom affects only the size of text ( Control Panel - Display is one access point ) , and it does not affect image size in Windows .
Except today , browsers zoom the images as well as the text , to preserve original web page layout .
When browsers zoom the screen size , they compute as if the physical screen size actually got larger ( a new imaginary size called CSS pixels ) , and the browser window sees a portion of that .
Browsers differ , which makes reporting screen size messy .
If your screen size is set to show 1920x1080 pixels , then these images will appear at 412/1024 = 40 % width , and 324/768 = 42 % height ( of your full screen size , not just your browser window ) .
That may seem obvious , because it is simply how it works .
Update : Messy distraction , sorry , I should delete some parts now .
Things are changing in unpredictable ways .
Video has never been " dpi aware " , but since Windows Vista , Microsoft has been attempting to add optional " dpi aware " features anyway .
Any false report would be because , if in Windows 7 ( or Vista ) , you may have zoomed your browser 's text size to be different .
Then the browser scales the image size with text size , to keep the web page proportions right .
But now , we see that Windows 7 may scale your apparent screen size ( smaller for larger text ) - not on the actual desktop of course , but the " screen size " numbers seen by the browser window change in the same inverse percentage proportion , and you may see these numbers of that false " screen size " when the text size is larger .
If so , you can reset this size to default with Firefox menu : View - Zoom - Reset , and then reload the page .
Chrome has its menu at right end of toolbar .
Or with IE menu : View - Zoom - 100 % ( but IE might come out like 99 % and still be slightly off ) .
Your text will become tiny again though .
There are ifs and buts about this , it is more complicated and it's messy , and there is more below , so let 's just say you might or might not see this issue .
( There is a setting about this ( at Custom DPI , " Use Windows XP style DPI scaling " ) , but it seems flakey .
The issue is trying to apply inches to video anyway , where there is no definition of inches ( only pixels ) .
Regardless , the idea is still the same — images are shown in video at their size in pixels , but then browsers will scale the images to follow the text size to maintain web page proportions .
These new screen size numbers are only related to imaginary logical inches for text ( next section ) , and is certainly not about any real dpi number in any image file .
The same image will appear at a different apparent size ( inches ) on any other size screen , or on a different size monitor .
Meaning , other people with different size screens ( pixels or inches either ) will see these same images at a different apparent size than you may see .
For example , someone with a 640x480 pixel screen size ( a cell phone maybe ) will see these images larger , at 64 % x 67 % of their full screen 640 pixel width , on whatever size of monitor they have .
But regardless , even then , the 412x324 pixel image will always still fill the same 412x324 pixels .
This is because digital image size is measured in pixels , and screen size is also measured in pixels .
It really could n't be any simpler .
But the printer will certainly care about dpi , and these images will all print at three VERY different sizes on paper ( at sizes as shown above ) if saved and printed individually using the File - Print menu ( when printed individually from a photo editor program , not a web browser )
The imaginary numbers 72 dpi or 96 dpi are never used in any way by the video system to show images on the screen .
The 72 or 96 dpi number is about TEXT , and is NOT about images at all , and that number never affects any screen image ( not directly ) .
The video system simply shows pixels , directly , one for one , without any concept of dpi .
Again , a modern disclaimer about my text : Our Windows or Apple dpi setting , and also Windows or Apple browser zoom setting , does affect TEXT size on the screen .
And today , modern web browsers now generally also modify image sizes ( in pixels ) to maintain a constant page size relationship with zoomed text size .
Text size is discussed next .
The Origin of the Myth - One Shred of Truth
The imaginary numbers 72 and 96 dpi do sort of exist ( in their imaginary way ) in computer operating systems .
This existence does seriously confuse people who imagine these numbers might be about showing images , but these numbers do n't affect the images .
These numbers are only used to compute Text Size on the screen .
The reason is because text font size in Points is dimensioned in inches ( designed for paper ) , but screens are only dimensioned in pixels .
The definition of a Point is 1/72 inch — there are 72 points per real inch on paper .
A 12 Point font is 12/72 inch height printed on paper ( inches exist on paper , and paper is dimensioned in inches , and fonts are dimensioned in inches ) .
But we are in real trouble on the screen — screens are only dimensioned in pixels .
We desperately need some concept of inches to size this font , but unfortunately , there simply is no concept of inches on the screen .
Only the 1920x1080 pixels exist there .
But not to worry , the operating system simply dreams up and uses some fake 72 and 96 dpi numbers to compute text size on the screen .
If we invent some imaginary notion of 96 dpi SIZE ( if we simply pretend 96 pixels will cover one inch on the screen , more or less , without asking " what size of screen ? " ) , then we can use this to compute that the 12 point font should be shown to be ( 12/72 inch x 96 pixels per inch ) = 16 pixels tall in Windows .
16 pixels is a perfectly usable screen dimension , and we 're as happy now as if it were actually true , so long as we do n't ask any questions .
Programmers call this concept Logical Inches .
In computer science lingo , logical ( as opposed to physical ) means " This is NOT real , but let 's use it anyway , as if it were real , because it is convenient to pretend it is real " .
Logical is how we are going to think of it , regardless of how it might really be physically .
The easiest example is a disk file , which is perhaps several thousands of sequential bytes , but which some applications may think of it as being records of perhaps 80 characters each , or other formats ( just because we say it is , and use it accordingly ) .
That would be a logical record length , LRECL .
That software simply reads record length groups of bytes as if formatted records .
In the case of video screens , which are composed of pixels , and dimensioned in pixels , and there is no concept of inches , but some software still prefers to imagine screens as if instead inches of paper ( showing a text page on the screen , for example ) .
So the Macintosh and Windows operating systems assume one logical inch on the screen is some number of pixels ( Macintosh 72 and Windows 96 ) , because , well , because it would just be very convenient if it were somehow actually true .
These logical inch numbers were chosen because it was halfway close on computer monitors , sometimes .
The video system does not know the inch size of the monitor ( some are cell phone size and some are wall TV size ) , so there simply is no concept of real inches , so it is necessary that we make something up .
Real inches have an exact defined size , but a logical inch does not , it is whatever size the 96 pixels happen to be on this one specific screen , and the logical inch will be a different length on a different screen .
Do n't confuse " logical inches " with " real inches " — very different concepts .
Windows does have a video adjustment for this 96 dpi number for some cases .
The Windows Large Font setting can assume a different number to show the text at a different size ( the Large Font default is 120 dpi ) .
But otherwise the same imaginary 96 dpi or 120 dpi number is used for text on any and every screen , regardless of any details about the size of that system .
No image is affected in any way by this number — instead we are just playing fast and loose with the inch for text fonts .
A logical inch will be whatever size the 96 pixels actually are .
This is a very well - known situation , and yes , of course the programmers know this is not true ( at least those that work at this level ) .
It is trivial to show that screens only display pixels directly , like those 1920x1080 pixels .
No video system knows or uses ANY concept of dpi .
But as a rough guess about text size , this logical inch idea is actually not too far wrong ( which is why these numbers were used ) .
What should the accurate number be ?
There is really no answer possible , because the actual real world screen size numbers vary quite a bit .
For example , a 15 inch CRT monitor screen might measure 10.6 inches horizontally ( its actual bright image area ) .
If it is currently set to 800x600 pixels screen size , then the image is obviously 800 dots / 10.6 inches = 75 dpi ( pixels per inch ) apparent resolution in that case .
But reset the same monitor to different screen sizes , and we get very different numbers .
Monitors vary , even 15 inch monitors vary , but I measured a few screen widths in inches , and computed this for different CRT monitor sizes :
APPARENT resolution of different size CRT monitor screens Screen Size
Pixels 14 inch monitor
Width 9.7 inch 15 inch monitor
Width 10.6 inch 17 inch monitor
Width 12.5 inch 19 inch monitor
Width 14.4 inch 21 inch monitor
Width 15.9 inch 640 x 480 66 dpi 60 dpi 51 dpi 44 dpi 40 dpi 800 x 600 82 dpi 75 dpi 64 dpi 56 dpi 50 dpi 1024 x 768 106 dpi 97 dpi 82 dpi 71 dpi 64 dpi 1152 x 864 119 dpi 109 dpi 92 dpi 80 dpi 72 dpi 1280 x 1024 132 dpi 121 dpi 102 dpi 89 dpi 80 dpi 1600 x 1200 165 dpi 151 dpi 128 dpi 111 dpi 101 dpi
" If only I had … "
Almost everyone has said those four words at some time .
According to a new study , counterfactual thinking -- considering a " turning point " moment in the past and alternate universes had it not occurred -- heightens one 's perception of the moment as significant , and even fated .
Armed with a sense that life may not be arbitrary , counterfactual thinkers are more motivated and analytical in organizational settings , the study suggests .
" What we found is that people indicate stronger commitment to an organization when they think counterfactually and it helps to define who they are on a professional level , " says Haas School Associate Professor Laura Kray .
The study was conducted by six scholars , including Kray and her colleague , Professor Philip Tetlock .
" From What Might Have Been to What Must Have Been : Counterfactual Thinking Creates Meaning " was published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in January 2010 .
" For the first time , we demonstrate that counterfactual thoughts about one 's life have predictable consequences for how critical events and cherished relationships are understood , " the authors write .
" Although you might think that counterfactually thinking is just going to lead me down a path of regret , it is actually very functional in terms of helping people establish relationships and make sense of cause and effect , " says Kray , " Counterfactual reflection about pivotal moments in the past helps people to weave a coherent life story . "
Kray notes the " what might have been " scenario is a popular narrative device , as developed in the 1998 film , Sliding Doors starring Gwyneth Paltrow .
The film reveals two story lines : what happens when Paltrow 's character makes it through the " sliding doors " onto the train , and what happens when she does n't and misses the train .

" The irony is that thinking counterfactually increases the perception that life 's path was meant to be , " says Kray , " which ultimately imbues one 's life with significance . "
While one might argue that believers of destiny would be less inclined to be analytical , the research also found that people who think counterfactually and find meaning in their lives are more apt to believe life is not a product of chance and that they can make valuable choices .
Kray and Tetlock were first intrigued by counterfactual thinking 's relationship with fate following the 2000 presidential election .
Kray recalls conservative commentators talking about how it was evident George W. Bush was destined to be president , and there appeared to be no perception that the race could have just as easily gone the other way .
The questions arose , " What is fate ? , " " How do people think about it ? , " and " Is fate incongruent with personal choice ? "
The team conducted experiments with student volunteers to discover how counterfactual thinking heightens the meaningfulness of key life experiences .
The researchers asked one group of students a question in which the language prompted counterfactual thinking ; the other group was asked to respond only factually .
For example , when asked to write an essay on how they met a close friend , the counterfactual group was asked to explain all of the ways they might have not met this friend .
The factual group was only asked to recount the factual details of the first encounter .
When reflecting on the alternative -- never having become friends -- the participants who were prompted to think counterfactually viewed their friendships as more meaningful .
The factual group did not experience that feeling of significance .
The researchers produced similar results when asking students to identify a turning point -- or quintessential " fork in the road " moment -- in their lives in which a counterfactual world should seem most plausible and easy to imagine .

" Getting people to think counterfactually helps people see relations better and construct meaning in their lives , " says Kray .
In the context of business , Kray says subsequent research found having a sense of meaning fosters organizational commitment .
In combination with Kray 's earlier work showing that people who think counterfactually are more analytical , counterfactual reflection is proving to be a very powerful tool in organizational settings .
" How we react to counterfactuals is a great test of how open - or closed - minded we are on a topic , " adds Tetlock , who has studied how people think about what - if scenarios at the organizational and even country level .
" In my book
Expert Political Judgment
( 2005 ) , I find that the more imaginatively experts think about possible pasts , the better calibrated they are in attaching realistic probabilities to possible futures . "
Tetlock is the Lorraine Tyson Mitchell Chair II in Leadership and Communication , Professor of Leadership .
Kray , who teaches negotiation , is the Harold Furst Chair in Management Philosophy and Values .
Their study is also co-authored with Linda George , a UC Berkeley doctoral student in psychology ; Katie Liljenquist , Brigham Young University ; Adam Galinsky , Northwestern University ; and Neal Roese , University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .

Yeah thats true , you 'd think they would have just tried to put their best foot forward for the first actual trailer to the game ... unless we end up getting a new trailer some time soon with more than just a few seconds of gameplay .
EDIT : Also looking at Sega1991 's revelations within the trailer itself ... that sure seems like a strange thing to do .
Click to expand ...
I personally think it 's obvious that the whole trailer is one big bullshot , none of it is gameplay .
They had some early animations and artwork and they cobbled it together to announce the game .
It 's worth remembering this is the same fucking game that they hired a PR company to create a teaser for before development had even started !
I mean , just look at it - that hooky running animation , all the weird stuff Sega1991 and other fans are digging up , and weird stuff in the trailer itself , like Sonic only bouncing directly up when he hits the enemies - no momentum ... it 's all really weird .
My hopes are high , but at the same time I want to actually see undoctored gameplay before I come to any conclusion .
And I want to know the dev .
Specifically , is the backbone talk true ?
1997 DoD Briefing : ' Others ' can set off earthquakes , volcanoes remotely using electromagnetic waves -- By Lori Price , www.legitgov.org

DoD News Briefing : Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen
Q : Let me ask you specifically about last week 's scare here in Washington , and what we might have learned from how prepared we are to deal with that ( inaudible ) , at B'nai Brith .
A : Well , it points out the nature of the threat .
It turned out to be a false threat under the circumstances .
But as we 've learned in the intelligence community , we had something called -- and we have James Woolsey here [ * puke * ] to perhaps even address this question about phantom moles .
The mere fear that there is a mole within an agency can set off a chain reaction and a hunt for that particular mole which can paralyze the agency for weeks and months and years even , in a search .
The same thing is true about just the false scare of a threat of using some kind of a chemical weapon or a biological one .
There are some reports , for example , that some countries have been trying to construct something like an Ebola Virus [ OMG !
Who would do such a thing ? ] , and that would be a very dangerous phenomenon , to say the least .
Alvin Toeffler has written about this in terms of some scientists in their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic specific so that they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races ; and others [ LOL ] are designing some sort of engineering , some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops .
Others are engaging even in an eco- type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate , set off earthquakes , volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves . '
Just switch ' yours , ' ' others ' and ' they ' with ' U.S. , ' ' U.S. ' and ' U.S. '
This was in 1997 .
Imagine , after eight years of George W. Bush turbo - funding these lunatics , what they can do now .
Oh , BTW .
See , also , the list of dead scientists .
The most fascinating might be the Harvard scientist , Dr. Don C Wiley , ' one of the foremost infectious disease researchers ' in the United States , who ' got dizzy ' and his car fell off a bridge in Memphis , TN .
The bridge where his car was found is only a five - minute drive away and in the wrong direction from where he was staying , leaving authorities with a four - hour , unexplained gap until his vehicle was found .
Now Memphis police are exploring several theories involving suicide , robbery and murder .
That 's just a ' we - know - we 're - f* cking - with - you - and - there 's - not - a - damned - thing - you - can - do - about - it ' assassination that any detective on ' Law & Order : Criminal Intent ' could wrap up in the first half - hour of the episode .
US military behind Haiti quake , says Innsbruck scientist 09 Mar 2010 Innsbruck political scientist Claudia von Werlhof has accused the USA of being behind the Haitian earthquake in January , it emerged today ( Tues ) .
Werlhof said that machines at a military research centre in Alaska used to detect deposits of crude oil by causing artificial earthquakes had intentionally been set off to cause the Haitian earthquake and enable the USA to send 10,000 soldiers into the country .
High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program 27 Feb 2010 The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program ( HAARP ) is an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the US Air Force , the US Navy , the University of Alaska and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) .
Its purpose is to analyze the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance purposes ( such as missile detection ) .
The HAARP program operates a major Arctic facility , known as the HAARP Research Station , on an Air Force owned site near Gakona , Alaska .
The most outstanding instrument at the HAARP Station is the Ionospheric Research Instrument ( IRI ) , a high power transmitter facility operating in the high frequency range .
The IRI is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the ionosphere ...
As of 2008 , HAARP had incurred around $ 250 million in tax - funded construction and operating costs .

Rams owner Chip Rosenbloom released the following statement following Kurt Warner 's retirement announcement :
Warner
" Kurt Warner epitomizes the finest qualities that can be attributed to any athlete .
He is a gentleman , competitor and , most of all , a winner whose achievements and contributions go far beyond the field of play .
Kurt is one of the most compelling success stories in the history of sports .
His well chronicled journey included two NFL MVP awards , a Super Bowl Championship and countless honors for his philanthropy .
In a time when many shun the label of role model , Kurt embraced it and exemplified it .
He is a man of our time and for our time .
We all learned great lessons from Kurt 's humility , dignity and grace .
We will forever be thankful for the success he brought us and the unparalleled generosity he has shown the St. Louis community and beyond .
On behalf of my sister , Lucia , our partner , Stan Kroenke , and the entire Rams organization , I want to wish Kurt , Brenda and their beautiful family the very best as they move ahead with their lives .
We are honored and privileged to have Kurt as a treasured member of the Rams ' alumni family . "
Warner took time during his announcement news conference to thank the Packers , Rams and Cardinals for giving him a chance .
LONDON , Jan. 13 , 2010  -- Metropolitan police arrested Craig " Lazie " Lynch , also known as the Facebook Fugitivebecause he used the Website to taunt police searching for him over the last four months .
He was captured Tuesday night and charged with escaping from custody .
Lynch has been on the lam since escaping from Hollesley Bay Prison in Suffolk on Sept. 23 last year .
He had been serving the last of a seven - year sentence for armed burglary .
The facility is an " open " prison that focuses on preparing inmates for their return to real life .
Authorities say there was nothing spectacular about his escape .
He simply walked out .
One of the first things he did was to sign up for Facebook .
He used the site to regularly taunt police with details of his life outside .
He boasted about his scrumptious steak dinners and posed shirtless , making a crude gesture directed towards them .
When he made it to Christmas without being caught , he posted , " Yes !
Yes !
I f****** made it to Xmas .
I beat their f****** system and I love it . "
He even called into a television station to grant an interview about his escapades .
Initially , he claimed that he logged onto Facebook to get in touch with old friends , but soon he found he was teasing the authorities and getting quite a reaction .
Nearly 40,000 people signed up to his fan site .
A YouTube song was posted in his honor .
" I 'm genuinely surprised and shocked , " he told Channel 5 in Great Britain .
" At the end of the day I 've got convicted of second degree burglary , an offense which I 'm not , I 'm not exactly proud of and I 'm surprised that people actually want to follow a burglar , you know ? "
Facebook Fugitive Headed for a Tougher Sentence ?
But not everyone on his fan site was actually a fan .
Several admonished him for his exploits and warned others not to support an escaped convict .
Lynch told Channel 5 that he left prison to avoid participating in the illegal black market trade in drugs and alcohol .
A father of two , he says he also needed to sort out his business affairs in order to support his children .
At one point he said he was planning to turn himself in when he had finished sorting out his affairs .
" They 're not going to catch me , " he told Channel 5 .
" I 'm not going to give them the joy of catching me .
I 'm going to go there and give myself up . "
But John O'Connor , a former commander with Scotland Yard , said there is no justification for Lynch 's escape and that his antics on Facebook would only get him a harsher sentence .
" The fact that he [ was ] taunting police is really just childish , the only person he is hurting is himself . "
Even Lynch seemed to acknowledge that his actions were foolhardy .
" At the end of the day , it 's my kids and my cocker spaniel that are going to suffer , " he said .

About
Tremulous is a free and open source asymmetric team - based first - person shooter with real - time strategy elements .
The game features two opposing teams : humans and aliens .
Each team must attack the enemy ’s base and team members while defending their own base .
History
Around 2000 , development was started by players of the Quake II modification Gloom , which also features alien vs human teams with distinct user classes .
Following a long gestation period , Tremulous was originally released as a mod for Quake III Arena in the summer of 2005 .
id software subsequently released the full source code for its game engine and Tremulous transitioned to a fully standalone title over the following months , eventually leading to an initial release in the spring of 2006 .
A couple of minor patches were made to version 1.1 the game , and some further work was made towards version 1.2 .
This was released as the Game Play Preview ( GPP ) patch , though ultimately interest from the original developers waned and the community took over development and maintenance .
Downloads
The original downloads are still hosted on Sourceforge .
At this point however , Tremulous is obviously very old and there are no doubt better options in terms of clients such as Tremfusion ( source ) or GrangerHub ( source ) .
The original source code is also available .
There is an old discussion forum .
It does n’t get much traffic , and is mostly up for posterity .
Credits
The original development team is listed below , although many other people contributed following the open source release .
This year 's choice of speaker for the Woodbury Prayer Breakfast is stirring a buzz , much like that first cup of morning coffee .
In the past , good - guy athletes such as former North Stars player Bill Butters and former Vikings tight end Joe Senser , and widely respected business leaders such as Paul Ridgeway and Jay Coughlan , have drawn hundreds of people to hear inspirational stories about the role their faith has played in their lives .
Like the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington on which it is patterned , politics at the Woodbury event has been checked at the door as values held common are celebrated .
So this year 's speaker , an ex-Nazi - turned - born - again - Christian , who has drawn fire for comparing President Obama to Adolf Hitler and linking him to the antichrist , has raised some eyebrows .
But those involved with the event say that Maria Anne ( Hansi ) Hirschmann will keep with tradition by focusing on her own life story and keep out any potentially strident political messages .
" This is a faith - based community event , pure and simple , " said Alisa Rabin Bell , spokeswoman for the event 's organizing committee .
" It always has been and it always will be . "
It 's Hirschmann 's amazing life story that made her a strong choice as speaker , Bell added .
According to her autobiography , " Hansi , The Girl Who Left the Swastika , " Hirschmann grew up orphaned and impoverished in then - Czechoslavakia .
When Hitler 's army took over that country in 1938 , she was indoctrinated as a youth leader .
After World War II , she was taken to a Communist labor camp in Bohemia , but escaped , became a Christian and gradually made her way to the United States .
She learned English and taught school , rejecting her Nazi past .
She founded Hansi Ministries in 1974 .
I have recently played Ultima 8 ( again ) .
Who played this game before will surely understand me , when I say : I love it and I hate it .
It is the last game of a classic Ultima series and as the first one , it creates quite a good looking ' feel 3D ' engine .
But the game itself has a fantastic story ( as most of The Ultima series games by the way ) .
The story begins exactly when the Ultima 7 ends .
Avatar is cast to the world of Pagan , and he has to find his way out of there to help Britannia , which is ( once again ) under attack .
But you have to feel the story by Yourself of course :-) .
You can try the game here : http://www.freegameempire.com/games/Ultima-8
Now , why I love it ?
It is because of the world it creates , the way Avatar conquers the world of Pagan ( Without any real knowledge by the way .
It reminds me that there are no too much clever people there ) , a graphics ( well , it is quite old today , but it used to be something ) and of course the great story that is always part of Ultima series games .
And why I hate it ?
I always get pretty angry playing the game .
Controlling the avatar is dedicated to mentally strong people , especially when you do n't have a patched version .
You will probably die many times stucked behind a tree or in the corner , unable to jump over a rock 2 inches high or my favorite ; you will die countless times in the bottomless water pool 5 feet wide .
As you can see ( and we are slowly reaching the end of my analysis ) , this is simple the game you cannot miss .
Some of Ultima fans will only hate this game , without the love part I think .
But it will always have a small place in my collection .
In a world where real competition , modern technology and lack of special government standing means most American businesses have no choice but to adapt and innovate -- Wall Streets wimps only apparent skill is rigging the game .
[ See who joined Dylan Ratigan in the Idiot - Maker Rally → ]
In fact , on Wall Street there have always been only two basic ways to make money .
The first and most difficult :
Be a great investor -- to the best investors go the profits , rewarding those who are best at picking winning businesses for America and punishing those who fail through the loss of their money .
The second , and seemingly preferred method , exploit those who know less than you -- and take their money , even if you have to change the laws to do so .
Now , this second business was much easier to pull off prior to the internet and 24 - hour exchanges etc. as technology is the enemy of any business that makes its living overcharging customers who do n't know better or are given no other choice .
So bankers , facing an onslaught of web - driven transparency and reduced profitability during the last decade along with an increasingly educated customer - base became anxious to change the laws in 2000 and are even more anxious to protect those changes now .
While things like stock and bond trading became a very low margin business because of modern information -- the legalization in 2000 of a secretive market for crooked insurance with no transparency or accountability has been an absolute boon .
They called it credit derivatives -- where banks and insurers offer to effectively " insure " financial assets .
For instance , they were used to insure much of the real estate and pension liabilities in America the past 10 years .
To make money , the banks exploit two loopholes .
The first -- overcharge customers by depriving them of the type of competitive pricing only possible on an exchange like the New York Stock Exchange or Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
And the second , exploit the lack of transparency to hide the fact that you are keeping little or no money to pay claims while selling insurance and collecting fees on every house and pension payment in America .
The key to success here is that when there is a default or claim against that so - called credit insurance -- the banks keep all the past payment -- and the taxpayer under threat of collapse pays off the claims while getting nothing in return .
This quite simply , is a brilliant way to steal our money .
Now this method of " business " is only possible if the government continues to allow these crooked insurance contracts to be written in secret , allows them to hold little or no money in reserve for payment and allows them to sell enough coverage on enough vital national assets that if there is a default -- the taxpayer has no choice but to pay .
Needless to say , J.P. Morgan & Co. has never had more revenue and the Goldman Sachs bonus pool has never been bigger .
Considering the $ 23.7 trillion of taxpayer money being used to support these Corporate Communists one would hope they could at least make a few billion in profits with it .
In context , making a few billion risking a few trillion is a rather pathetic return after all .
As we talked about last week - allowing these outdated banks to take control of our government and change the rules so they are protected from the natural competition and reward systems that have created so many innovations in our country , you not only steal from the citizens on behalf of the least worthy but you also doom them by trapping the capital that would have been used to generate new innovation and , most tangibly in our current situation , jobs .
We do n't want a government commandeered by those in our banking system who have failed and been passed over by technological advancements , innovation and flat out smarts .
The government 's job is to restore the rules of investment , not indulge those who want to unfairly sustain their wealth and power at our nation 's expense .
What we want , is a Wall Street that would attract men and women who would seek to be the next Warren Buffett , or great venture capitalist .
Men and women competing to analyze the countless ideas of our best and brightest - investing in those who will best be able to bring their innovations to America and the world .

Related story : Next illogical step End of Constellation :
It is not all doom and gloom
Op-ed by Anatoly Zak Even before the White House made a proposal on Feb. 1 , 2010 , to eliminate funding for the Constellation program , a political hurricane had started brewing in Washington , D.C. Critics alleged that the end of the project , which aimed to return the American astronauts to the Moon , would undermine US space efforts and would even mark the end of the nation ’s leadership in space , giving the upper hand to evil powers like China and Russia .
The criticism is probably leveled by the same people , who six years ago were blindly cheerleading the Bush administration ’s shortsighted decision to start this project in the first place , without any solid fiscal or technical foundation .
With a minimum foresight and the knowledge of space exploration history , it was clear from the get go that the Bush plan was underfunded , poorly designed and would have to be scrapped sooner or later .
It is just unfortunate that it took six years , nine billion dollars and the change of occupant in the Oval Office to come to this realization .
Obviously , for every space enthusiast around the world , it would be sad to see any major space exploration effort to be axed in a budget crunch .
The frustration of legislators representing congressional districts with heavy involvement into a discontinued federal project is also understandable .
However there is a silver lining .
Every failure presents a new opportunity and even more so does the inevitable demise of the Constellation program .
NASA still can make it right , make it big , and remain a leader in space , if it chooses to do so .
First of all , the Obama administration promised to increase overall NASA funding , which along with recovering economy , puts the US space agency in a very strong position for drawing up an aggressive future strategy in space .
The goal of going to the Moon itself has not been abandoned but only postponed , likely for a historically insignificant period of time .
In the meantime , NASA and all its international partners will be able to send their astronauts to the International Space Station , ISS , to conduct scientific research and built foundation for human ventures beyond the Earth orbit .
The fact that US astronauts will temporarily fly to the ISS onboard Russian spacecraft , should bother no one but isolationists and nationalists .
It is much more tragic that under funding restraints of the Constellation program , a brand - new space station -- the largest and most complex man-made structure in orbit -- would have to be dumped into the ocean as soon as 2015 .
Perhaps , it still would not be the most unprecedented waste of taxpayers ’ money in the history of space program – just ask the developers of the Soviet N1 moon rocket and the Energia - Buran system .
( Both were abandoned practically on the launch pad , after years of colossal efforts . )
Beyond the station
Before the end of this decade , NASA would have a new manned spacecraft , capable of reaching the ISS and , most likely , the same vehicle would be easily adaptable for lunar missions .
Although the potential of the so - called “ private sector ” to build better , cheaper spacecraft is greatly over - hyped , there is little doubt that the US aerospace industry would be fully capable of building a state - of - the - art spacecraft for the federal government .
Hysterical cries in the American press about the loss of US capability to launch astronauts into space are completely unfounded .
In the end , it will be the decision of the American public and the US Congress on the ultimate goal of the manned space program after 2020 .
If the US economy grows and the federal budget can be balanced , many ambitious projects in space exploration , including a lunar base , missions to asteroids and expeditions to Mars would become possible by 2030 .
Unlike the Constellation , which was intentionally set up to be an “ in - house ” program , the future efforts to explore deep space should include a broad international cooperation with Russia , China , Europe and other countries .
No longer mandated to exclude foreign partners , NASA can return to the negotiation table with other space agencies and formulate a common approach toward future goals .
Based on recommendations of the Augustine Committee last year , NASA can allow foreign partners into the so - called “ critical path ” in future cooperative projects , meaning that their goals would not be achievable without hardware and support of other countries .
While it may or may not cut cost of the whole enterprise , it would certainly give space program an important political clout .
Interdependency in space as well as on Earth would help to ensure that governments make a habit of finding common solutions to international problems at the negotiation table .
As a first possible step to manned exploration of deep space , Roskosmos have proposed to convert the Russian segment of the International Space Station into an assembly platform for planetary ships .
European Space Agency expressed interest in the idea and NASA might consider taking them up on that offer .
Yet , another space station might be required in the lunar orbit , along with manned and cargo transports , landers and launch vehicles .
For future projects , space agencies could contribute and barter various hardware and services for common goals of reaching the Moon and Mars .
In other situations , two or more parallel systems , such as transport lines , could be set up , to provide redundancy for the lunar base or a Martian expedition , even in case of a major failure in one of the systems .
However all of this is in the future , while now , the US government has to quickly draft a new strategy for this decade .
Due to the enormous influence NASA activities exert on other space agencies , first of all on Roskosmos and ESA , it would be critically important for Washington to demonstrate that the US is still committed to a robust manned space program .
Well defined deadlines and budgets should demonstrate to contractors and international partners alike that they have little time to spare in preparing for the next page in the history of the manned space program .
To ensure it is happening , Russia , China and India will provide an additional incentive .

People , this is an interesting thing to follow first - hand .
Hyperion , the company behind AmigaOS4 , has been talking about its “ Most Ambitious Project ” for a while now , but on December 31 , they started teasing the Amiga community like crazy .
They opened a site called a - eon.com , which is most likely about the MAP .
The teaser site has the Amiga community scrambling to find answers .
The site gets new clues as time goes by , and so far , it ’s quite difficult to make out what , actually , Hyperion is teasing .
The thread over at AmigaWorld .
net about this subject is mandatory reading material if you ’re interested in this , as many possible interpretations and solutions are being discussed .
If you want to take a crack at it yourself , be prepared – this is pretty good stuff .
For instance , one of the clues shows an Amiga window with a question mark icon ; the background of the window contained what appeared to be random letters and numbers , but when put through a base64 decoder , it contained a hidden message :
What is X , if not a letter ,
Perhaps an Omen , or even better ?
The main theme so far seems to be the letter X , but there are various other clues which point into the direction of new hardware , and possible SMP support for AmigaOS – which could mean new hardware with multicore processors .
That ’s just one possible explanation though .
A new clue is supposed to appear within a few hours , so maybe we ’ll know more then .
I ’m posting this here , because maybe us OSNews people can lend a helping hand in decoding this mystery .
In any case , I have to hand it to Hyperion – this is class A hype generation right here .
We ’ll keep you updated .

More than half the people of Britain are strongly opposed to a mosque being built in their neighbourhood .
Only a quarter of Britons feel positive towards Muslims , while more than a third report feeling " cool " towards them .
These are the ominous results from the latest British Social Attitudes Survey .
So is Britain anti-Muslim ?
Is there a place for Islam in British public life ?
This magazine is proud of its secular , liberal heritage .
Our interest in Islam and Muslims is not religious or theological .
But it is clear that , politically and culturally , Islam matters , and on a range of global issues , from the so - called war on terror to the Middle East peace process to the future of Europe .
Here in Britain , much of the debate over terrorism and extremism , as well as race , immigration and multiculturalism , revolves - rightly or wrongly - around Muslim communities .
Since 11 September 2001 , and especially since the attacks in London on 7 July 2005 , many Britons have come to fear their Muslim neighbours : they worry about the bearded young man with a backpack sitting next to them on the Tube .
There is also a widespread lack of knowledge about the central tenets of the faith itself and the basic fabric of British Muslim life .
Fear and ignorance are a toxic combination , and myths and misconceptions abound .
Contrary to popular opinion , polls show that the overwhelming majority of British Muslims are integrated , loyal , non-violent and eschew religious fanaticism ( page 26 ) .
But the antics of a small cabal of British - born Muslim radicals - exemplified by the buffoonish Anjem Choudary and his Islam4UK group ( now banned by the Home Office ) - bring the entire Muslim community into disrepute in this country .
Yet publicity - seeking hotheads like Choudary have been aided and abetted by a sensationalist press that often conflates the actions of an angry minority with those of the peaceful majority .
Islamophobia now seems rife - in the words of one conservative commentator , " prejudice against Islam . . . is Britain 's last remaining socially respectable form of bigotry " .
In 2008 , researchers at Cardiff University revealed that more than two - thirds of the stories about Muslims published in the press since 2000 identified them either as a source of problems or as a threat - culturally , as well as in security terms .
More than a quarter of the stories propagated the idea that Islam is dangerous , backward or irrational .
This relentlessly negative coverage of Muslims and Islam must end .
The liberal left has always defended minorities in this country - be they Jewish , black or gay .
Today , it is Muslims who are demonised and bear the brunt of racist attacks .
" I try to imagine how I would feel if this rainstorm of headlines substituted the word ' Jew ' for ' Muslim ' , " wrote one leading Jewish commentator , in the wake of the 2006 row over the niqab , or Islamic face veil .
" I would n't just feel frightened , I would be looking for my passport . "
No religion or community is beyond scrutiny .
There is a debate to be had about the role of Islam in modern Britain .
British Muslims find themselves at , or near , the bottom of various socio- economic indices : poverty , unemployment , literacy and life expectancy .
But the American Muslim experience offers hope .
Muslims in America are among the nation 's brightest and best - adjusted minorities : in a Gallup poll , 41 per cent of American Muslims said they were " thriving " .
This figure drops to 7 per cent in the UK .
President Obama has appointed the pollster Dalia Mogahed , a veiled Muslim woman , as one of his advisers on inter - faith relations .
Sheacknowledges ( on page 32 ) that , as " corny as it may sound " , she is proof of the " American dream " .
Is America 's " melting pot " a better model for the integration of Muslims than Britain 's multicultural experiment ?
Or does secular , democratic India offer a better alternative ?
That is the argument of Ed Husain ( on page 28 ) , the former self - described " Islamist " .
Acknowledging the way in which many Muslims have been radicalised in recent years , he makes a bold case for reconciling a new form of political Islam with liberal democracy .
Husain and Tariq Ramadan ( on page 22 ) remind us that the strength of Islam has always been its ability to adapt to different circumstances and cultures .
Misunderstanding Muslims can only lead to further tensions and will make civic harmony impossible .
This week , the magazine attempts to offer a more nuanced understanding of a range of contentious issues , in particular whether Islam is compatible with the values and principles of western liberal democracy .
Meanwhile , British Muslims , alienated , frustrated and under siege , need our support .
CHICAGO  Nada Alkhaddar spends her days at the Muslim Women Resource Center helping refugees and immigrants deal with government and commercial bureaucracies that can make life in the United States seem about as easy as computing the Alternative Minimum Tax .
“ We help anyone , Muslims or Christians , from here or anywhere in the city , ” Ms. Alkhaddar said as she guided an Eastern European man through a long questionnaire from a local bank .
She adjusted her hijab and smiled as she worked in an office overlooking Devon and Western Avenues , an Indo - Pakistani neighborhood just north and west of downtown .
Despite her skills at navigating the obstacles immigrants face , Ms. Alkhaddar cannot seem to help the person closest to her and her three children  her husband , Ahmed Alrais  who is trying to get a green card .
Mr. Alrais came to the United States in the spring of 2008 after his life had been threatened for working as an interpreter for the United States Army in Iraq .
Unable to find a job during the recession and without a green card , he returned in February to the country he had fled to work again for the Army through a private contractor .

" In the isolated mountains of Ecuador , a community of four - feet tall dwarves appear to be immune from cancer and diabetes .
Here , two scientists are on a mission to find the ultimate cure for cancer .
Inbreeding among the small and remote Ecuadorian communities has led to a high percentage of Laron Dwarves .
One third of the world 's 300 Laron population live in the southern Loja province .
" My parents are normal , my grandparents were normal .
I have seven siblings , four of them are normal height and three of us are little , " says one Laron sufferer .
Dr Marco Guevaras and his brother Jaime believe the secret behind the dwarves ' apparent immunity lies in the absence of a hormone called " insulin - like growth factor 1 or IGF1 " .
Yet the scientists need to move fast in their research ; an expensive treatment has already been discovered to alleviate the symptoms of the syndrome in children . "
Journeymanpictures *** RELATED:Laron Syndrome - History / Background " Background
In 1966 in Israel , Zvi Laron and colleagues reported a genetic form of dwarfism in 3 Yemenite Jewish siblings with clinical and biochemical features of growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) , but with " abnormally high concentrations of immunoreactive serum growth hormone . "
The underlying defect was thought to be an inborn error in growth hormone ( GH ) synthesis resulting in an immunologically detectable but metabolically inactive GH .
Within 2 years , 19 additional Israeli patients of Asian Jewish ancestry were identified .
Subsequent work led to the identification of more than 250 patients worldwide , with the vast majority of cases being traced to Semitic or Mediterranean origins .
These patients were proven to have levels of circulating GH within the reference range but were demonstrated to be metabolically unresponsive to exogenous GH .
Initially termed Laron - type dwarfism , this condition is currently known as Laron syndrome ( LS ) , primary GH insensitivity ( GHI ) , or primary GH resistance . "

Over 350 new species including a miniature deer , a “ flying frog ” and a 100 million - year old gecko have been discovered in the Eastern Himalayas , a biological treasure trove now threatened by climate change .
- Over 350 new species including the world ’s smallest deer , a “ flying frog ” and a 100 million - year old gecko have been discovered in the Eastern Himalayas , a biological treasure trove now threatened by climate change .
A decade of research carried out by scientists in remote mountain areas endangered by rising global temperatures brought exciting discoveries such as a bright green frog ( Rhacophorus suffry ) which uses its red and long webbed feet to glide in the air .
One of the most significant findings was not exactly “ new ” in the classic sense .
A 100 - million year - old gecko , the oldest fossil gecko species known to science , was discovered in an amber mine in the Hukawng Valley in Himalayan regions of far northern Myanmar .
The WWF report The Eastern Himalayas – Where Worlds Collide details discoveries made by scientists from various organizations between 1998 and 2008 in a region reaching across Bhutan and north - east India to the far north of Myanmar as well as Nepal and southern parts of Tibet Autonomus Region ( China ) .
“ This enormous cultural and biological diversity underscores the fragile nature of an environment which risks being lost forever unless the impacts of climate change are reversed , ” said Tariq Aziz , the leader of WWF 's Living Himalayas Initiative .
“ People and wildlife form a rich mosaic of life across this rugged and remarkable landscape , making it among the biologically richest areas on Earth .
But the Himalayas are also among the most vulnerable to global climate change .
” In December world leaders will gather in Copenhagen to reach an agreement on a new climate deal , which will replace the existing Kyoto Protocol .
“ Only an ambitious and fair deal based on an agreement between rich and poor countries can save the planet and its treasures such as the Himalayas from devastating climate change , ” said Kim Carstensen , the Leader of the WWF ’s Global Climate Initiative .
The Eastern Himalayas report also mentions the miniature muntjac , also called the “ leaf deer ” ( Muntiacus putaoensis ) which is one of the world ’s oldest and smallest deer species .
Scientists initially believed the small creature found in the world ’s largest mountain range was a juvenile of another species but DNA tests confirmed the light brown animal with innocent dark eyes was a distinct and new species .
The Eastern Himalayas are now known to harbour a staggering 10,000 plant species , 300 mammal species , 977 bird species , 176 reptiles , 105 amphibians and 269 types of freshwater fish .
The region also has the highest density of the Bengal tiger and is the last bastion of the charismatic greater one - horned rhino .
WWF aims to conserve the habitat of endangered species such as the majestic snow leopard , Bengal tigers , Asian elephants , red pandas , takins , golden langurs , rare Gangetic dolphins and one - horned rhinos as well as thousands of plant and animal species left to discover in the Eastern Himalayas region .
Eastern Himalayas -
Where Worlds Collide describes more than 350 new species discovered - including 244 plants , 16 amphibians , 16 reptiles , 14 fish , 2 birds , 2 mammals and at least 60 new invertebrates .
Historically , the rugged and largely inaccessible landscape of the Eastern Himalayas has made biological surveys in the region extremely difficult .
As a result , wildlife has remained poorly surveyed and there are large areas that are still biologically unexplored .
Today further species continue to be unearthed and many more species of amphibians , reptiles and fish are currently in the process of being officially named by scientists .
The Eastern Himalayas is certainly one of the last biological frontiers of Asia with many new discoveries waiting to be made .

In a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine , four of 23 patients diagnosed as being in a vegetative state showed signs of consciousness on brain - imaging tests .
Even more significantly , one patient was able to answer yes and no questions using the researchers ' technique — indicating the potential for communication with people previously considered unresponsive .
Researchers ...
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Fifty - five financial companies failed to pay dividends in November on money they borrowed from the U.S. government , bank research firm SNL said on Wednesday .
That number swelled from 33 companies that missed an August payment on government funds , according to an SNL analysis of government data .
The rising dividend deferrals signal that even as some banks are deemed healthy enough to repay the United States -- Wells Fargo & Co , for example , said on Wednesday that it gave $ 25 billion back to the government -- many others are struggling .
U.S. regulators have closed 140 banks this year , the most since 1992 , as a real estate downturn and broader credit crunch have hobbled many banks ’ balance sheets .
Twelve companies have missed at least three consecutive payments of dividends on funds borrowed under the government ’s $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program , SNL said .
The research firm said only one -- Connecticut Bank and Trust Co -- of the 33 companies that missed a dividend payment in August managed to pay in November .
Another bank , Community Bank of the Bay , missed a payment in May , paid in August , and deferred again in November .
SNL said one company that had missed a TARP dividend payment in August -- Commerce National Bank -- repaid in October the full amount of the bailout funds it had received .
The 55 companies that missed payments received around $ 5.06 billion in funding under TARP , equal to 3.8 percent of the total funds spent under TARP ’s capital purchase program as of November 18 .
The government has said it expects to lose money from its TARP program .
TARP recipients are required to pay a dividend rate of 5 percent per year for the first five years , usually in four payments per year .
Under the program , the failure to pay dividends for six dividend periods triggers the Treasury ’s right to elect two directors to the institution ’s board , SNL said .
The next TARP dividend payment date is scheduled for February 16 .
The largest company to miss the latest TARP dividend payment was New York - based CIT Group Inc , which recently emerged from bankruptcy , wiping out its TARP obligations in the process .
DALLAS – The Dallas Peace Center jump - started Black History Month by inviting the Rev. James Lawson , one of the most famous of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ’s contemporaries in the civil rights movement , for a three - day tour beginning Jan. 31 .
The next day , Feb. 1 , was the anniversary of the sit-in by African American activists at a Woolworth ’s lunch counter in Greensboro , S.C.
It was a milestone of the movement .
Lawson organized the desegregation of downtown Nashville , Tenn .
Among the many activists he mentored was young John Lewis , now a noted U.S. congressman .
When bus -burning Klansmen nearly ended the Freedom Rides that were begun by another organization , Lawson ’s volunteers from Nashville went to Alabama and carried the actions through to a successful conclusion .
Here in Dallas , Lawson appeared at a special reception at the African - American Museum , church at St Luke ’s , a formal presentation at the Black Academy of Arts & Letters , and a luncheon with other veteran activists hosted by the Rev. L. Charles Stovall .
Stovall is a local hero of civil rights struggles .
A number of the long - time activists in attendance had attended the Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University .
A great deal of local civil rights history owes its leadership to those Methodist ministers , both African American and Anglo .
The topic at the final luncheon was “ How to Obtain Justice . ”
Speaking there , the Rev. Lawson said , “ What passes for justice in this country is sometimes criminal …
We have in this country a dominant political system that sees problems as an opportunity to create division and discord . ”
He went on to say that there are 90 million Americans living in poverty .
“ Five women a day , ” he asserted , “ are being murdered by their husbands , boyfriends , and others . ”
Foreign affairs soon entered the dialogue with condemnations of the U.S. role in supporting Israel ’s occupation of Palestinian land .
Lawson commented , “ American policy , military policy , is the number one problem for peace and justice in the world . ”
He warned that imperialist forces planned to build military bases “ up and down the East Coast of Africa ” and that America was in danger of becoming a “ colossal tyrant such as human history has never known . ”
Most of the questions for Lawson had to do with how to achieve unity in the struggles for justice .
“ By taking on specific projects that require mobilization , education and recruitment , ” he responded .
He said he was especially proud of the way that his hometown progressives in Los Angeles had come together to support the Justice for Janitors organizing drive .
“ The issue , ” he said wisely , “ is how you do the work . ”

A Jefferson County case that has waited four years to come to trial will have to wait four more quarters , a judge has decided .
A circuit court judge in the county 's Bessemer division said today he intends to grant a continuance sought by attorneys who do n't want to miss the University of Alabama 's national championship football game against the University of Texas on Jan .
7 .
In his motion seeking the delay , attorney Jon Terry argues that the trial in an accidental death case was scheduled for Jan. 4 " before certain monumental events occurred , " that some attorneys have tickets to the game , that jurors are likely to be preoccupied and that opposing attorneys went to Auburn .
" ROLL TIDE !! " the motion concludes .
Circuit Judge Dan King , an Auburn alumnus , said he planned to grant the motion .
" If I did n't , they 'd say , ' He just did n't grant it because he's an Auburn fellow , ' " he said .
" I would n't do that to 'em . "
Efforts to reach attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the case were unsuccessful Wednesday .
But in a motion filed this morning they argued that the trial should begin as scheduled .
" Simply stated , some things are more important than football , " the motion said .
Judge Scott Vowell , the presiding judge in Jefferson County and also an Auburn alumnus , said he'd never before seen a motion that requested a continuance because of a football game .
" There 's been some motions for continuances and I 've suspected what the real reason was , " he said .
" But this is the first one I 've seen that was this honest and candid about the reason . "
The case , Mark Traywick vs. Energen Corp. , is the result of a 2004 accident that took the life of Irene Traywick of West Crest .
She died as the result of an explosion after a car hit a gas meter and power box .
The motion to delay the trial gained national attention today , circulating among law offices around the country , according to a report on the Web site Deadspin.com .
King , who had not yet issued a formal order late today , said he would reschedule the trial to begin in a month or two .
News staff writer Stan Diel contributed to this report .
Would you choose to receive a small amount of money today or a larger sum next month ?
We know that it is worth it to wait longer for a larger reward , but sometimes the temptation for the smaller , immediate reward becomes too great and we simply cannot resist it .
Selecting the immediate reward is known as " future discounting " and often suggests a lack of self - control .
Studies have indicated that there may be a link between blood glucose levels ( our body 's energy ) and thinking .
For example , making difficult choices uses up cognitive resources ( or brain power ) and these resources can be restored by increasing blood glucose .
Psychological scientists X.T. Wang and Robert D. Dvorak from the University of South Dakota investigated how blood glucose levels impact the way we think about present and future rewards .
Volunteers answered a series of questions asking if they would prefer to receive a certain amount of money tomorrow or a larger amount of money at a later date .
They responded to seven of these questions before and after drinking either a regular soda ( containing sugar ) or a diet soda ( containing the artificial sweetener aspartame ) .
Blood glucose levels were measured at the start of the experiment and after the volunteers drank the soda .
The results , reported in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , reveal that people 's preferences for current versus later rewards may be influenced by blood glucose levels .
The volunteers who drank the regular sodas ( and therefore had higher blood glucose levels ) were more likely to select receiving more money at a later date while the volunteers who drank the diet sodas ( and who had lower blood glucose levels ) were likelier to opt for receiving smaller sums of money immediately .
These findings are suggestive of an adaptive mechanism linking decision making to metabolic cues , such as blood sugar levels .
The results indicate that when we have more energy available ( that is , higher levels of blood glucose ) , we tend to be more future - oriented .
The authors note that " the future is more abstract than the present and thus may require more energy to process .
Blood glucose as brain fuel would strengthen effortful cognitive processing for future events . "
Conversely , having low energy ( or low blood glucose levels ) may make an individual focus more on the present .
The finding that a diet soda drink increased the degree of future discounting suggests that artificial sweeteners may alarm the body of imminent caloric crisis , leading to increased impulsivity .
The authors conclude that if controlling blood glucose levels may affect our decisions for later versus current rewards , then " reducing the degree of fluctuation in blood glucose may offer a possible means for the treatment and intervention of some impulsive disorders , anorexia , drug addiction , and gambling addiction . "

Period pain is a common complaint Acupuncture may be an effective way of easing severe period pain , a South Korean review of 27 studies suggests .
Researchers said there was " promising evidence " for acupuncture in treating cramps , but that more work was needed .
In the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology , they noted two studies found little difference between real and sham acupuncture in treating pain .
Acupuncture is a less contentious form of complementary medicine than some , but its value is still disputed .
Period pain can be severe in some women and may be accompanied by nausea , diarrhoea , migraine and backache .
Common treatments include pain killers , applying heat and exercise - although a recent study questioned the efficacy of the latter .
This latest review involved 27 studies - which included nearly 3,000 women .
They addressed a variety of forms of acupuncture - from classical to acupoint injection .
Complementary therapies should not be used exclusively , at the expense of conventional treatment , unless significant improvements have been made and your doctor tells you otherwise
Professor Philip Steer
BJOG Traditional acupuncturists insert needles in acupuncture points located along what they describe as " energy meridians " - a concept for which many scientists say there is no evidence .
Sham acupuncture places needles away from these points .
It is not clear whether either form alleviates pain as a result of the placebo effect - the very ritual of undergoing acupuncture - or cause subtle changes in the nervous system and brain activity which can be beneficial .
Nice backs needles
The analysis by the team from Kyung Hee Medical Centre found that patients with severe period pain reported a greater reduction in their symptoms when using acupuncture compared with pharmacological treatments .
But they stressed there were methodological flaws in some studies , and that the findings did need to be interpreted with caution .
Nevertheless , there was " promising evidence " , they wrote .
In the UK , the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( Nice ) has backed the use of acupuncture in the treatment of low back pain - a move welcomed by some but criticised by those who say there is little evidence for its efficacy .
The editor - in - chief of the BJOG , Professor Philip Steer , noted that some women had period pain , also known as primary dysmenorrhoea , so badly they were " unable to function normally " .
" Women with primary dysmenorrhoea should consult their GPs or gynaecologists on the best treatment available to them .
Complementary therapies should not be used exclusively , at the expense of conventional treatment , unless significant improvements have been made and your doctor tells you otherwise . "

China 's wild tiger population may be as small as 50
By Patrick Jackson
BBC News
For every one wild tiger alive in the world today , there may be three " farmed " tigers in China .
They have been bred for their hides but also their bones , which are used to infuse some wines prized in South East Asia .
Some in the region believe that the consumption of certain parts of a tiger 's carcass can give strength and virility .
China banned the trade in tiger bones and products in 1993 but that has not stopped the practice , which is currently on the agenda of an international tiger conservation conference in Thailand .
The part [ of the farm ] which people rarely see is basically a winery in which the skeletons of grown tigers are cleaned and put into vats of wine
Judy Mills
Conservation International According to the World Bank , which leads the Global Tiger Initiative ( GTI ) , the trade is being spurred by privately run tiger farms in Asian countries .
It has called for these farms to be shut down .
Tigers on the farms are kept in cages and are also allowed to chase cows or chickens for the amusement of the paying public .
" Our position is that tiger farms as an animal practice are cruel , " said the World Bank 's Keshav Varma , GTI 's programme director , as he attended the conference in Hua Hin .
" They fan the potential use of tiger parts , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
In order to get an idea of what goes on in these farms , which are often presented as parks for tourists , BBC World Service spoke to Judy Mills of Conservation International , who has visited some of them .
' Speed - breeding '
The world 's entire surviving wild tiger population is somewhere between 3,600 and 3,200 , conservationists believe .
In China , there are now close to 10,000 tigers on farms , says Ms Mills , while other estimates suggest the number may be around 5,000 .
" These are speed - breeding factory farms , " Conservation International 's tiger specialist says .
According to her research , farm tigresses produce cubs at about three times or more their natural rate , bearing up to three litters a year .
Cubs are often taken away from their mothers before they are properly weaned .
These cubs , she says , are usually made to suckle from other animals , such as pigs or dogs - their " wet nurse surrogates " - so that the tigresses can produce more young .
" The part [ of the farm ] which people rarely see is basically a winery in which the skeletons of grown tigers are cleaned and put into vats of wine , " says Ms Mills .
The bones are steeped for years , she explains , and the length of the infusion determines the value of the wine .
Conservation International says it is very difficult to clarify the legal status of these farms in China .
" When I first visited a tiger farm in 1990 , it was part of a fur farm raising racoon , dogs , mink and other fur - bearing animals for commercial use , " says Ms Mills .
" The owner of the farm was showing me the log of orders for tiger bones and skins and other parts and products from tigers .
" Then in 1993 , because of international pressure , China banned its commercial trade in tiger bone and tiger bone products but , at the same time , these tiger farms were allowed to expand .
" It 's something the conservation community has been trying to address with the Chinese government ever since . "
Late last year , the Chinese State Forestry Administration promised to monitor tiger breeders more closely , and crack down on the illegal trade in tiger parts and products .
The fear must be , however , that with the Chinese Year of the Tiger due to fall on 14 February , demand for such items will be as strong as ever .
Read some of your comments on this story : I visited a tiger farm outside of Harbin , China , in 2008 .
I had read the sale of parts was banned in the early 90s but knew when I got there it must still be ongoing - there seemed to be thousands of tigers and lions running around and in small cages .
The place was a poor man 's Jurassic Park for tigers and lions , and it felt like it could go wrong any minute .
A rickety bus picked tourists up from the entrance , which was decorated with painted , faded wooden cartoon tiger cut outs and featured a gift shop full of tiger junk .
The bus went through a series of tall , rusty metal gates to the " farm " grounds .
The bus driver opened and closed the door to get the animals ' attention .
There appeared to be hundreds of them .
Someone on the bus bought a chicken and a jeep outfitted with metal caging around the body and tires sped in front of the bus and threw the bird out to the animals .
The tourists squealed as a tiger pounced on it instantly and ran off .
Another area featured baby tigers - one looked on the verge of death .
Its water supply was a frozen block , and it teetered around in a confused way .
I found the whole thing depressing and cruel .

After reading this article , it seems to me that the problem is not that tigers are farmed for hocus pocus wines and furs .
The problem is that this farming is done under poor / cruel conditions .
I like tigers .
I have a soft spot for most cats .
But in the end , if it reduces the risk of poaching ( and tiger extinction ) and there is a demand for these products , then this is no different from farming minks for their furs .
If they can guarantee reasonably good conditions for the tigers , then I have no problem with it .
Robert , Wales , UK
The major thereat to tigers is loss of habitat , how will shutting the tiger farms change that ?
Also , by removing the captive supply , the pressure on wild population will increase ; shutting the farms down will kill the wild tiger .
What will happen to the thousands of tigers already living in the farms ?
That is a very real issue animal welfare .
If they are shut down , farm owners no longer have financial supply / income to keep the tigers alive , who will take care of the tigers until they die ?
World bank ?
WWF ?
Zuzana , Las Vegas , Nevada , USA Totally inhumane .
I am sorry to say this , but most native Chinese support this appalling cruelty .
Words cannot express my anger and disgust .
I have visited certain parts of China and had the very unfortunate chance of seeing this and other atrocities .
I challenged a group of men and was literally chased away .
Tom , Manchester
In 2001 , I visited a tiger and bear farm in China .
One time a day , a cow was released in a jungle like pen where a waiting tiger was released .
There were short stratum stands for people to sit and watch from .
After the tiger killed the cow , a worker would use a four - wheeler with a cage on top to scare off the big cat to collect the carcass so tourist could take their picture next to it .
Ill even confess that I went to have a look .
It was difficult to accept but I had to understand that it 's apart of their culture , those farms and the belief of the magical uses for the animal 's body parts .
K. Tran , California , USA Conservationists need to ask themselves which is worse : tiger farms or no tigers ?
I 'm not attempting to justify the conditions on the farms or the efficacy of tiger parts in Chinese traditional medicine but here is a group of people with a strong economic incentive to maintain a breeding population of tigers .
Considering the lack of success in maintaining the population of wild tigers these farmers may offer the tigers ' best hope for survival as a species .
It worked for the American bison .
Scott , Port Orchard , USA
Just another trashy thinly - veiled China bashing post .
10,000 or 5,000 ?
Make up your mind !
Maybe the Panda breeding programs should learn from these " business - minded " tiger farms .
After all , those guys could produce so many more tigers than their counterparts in the well - funded Panda sanctuaries .
Western media is getting less and less credibility in the minds of overseas Chinese .
Jack , Vancouver , Canada During my gap year in China ( 2003 - 04 ) , a few friends and I went to the Harbin to see the Ice and Snow Festival , and to see the Siberian Tiger Park .
They state it 's a Research and Breeding Centre , but seemed little more than a tourist attraction .
Once we started the tour in a ' secure ' mini- bus , we entered into a tiger compound where we saw a 4x4 come screaming down , then the driver winds the window down , and threw out a pheasant .
Although I got an awesome photograph of the tiger catching it in mid-air , it was only until we did the walking tour through the main centre where we saw tigers in relatively small compounds , did we think ...' What the hell is this place about ? '
They maintain that they breed them with the intention of putting them back into the wild , but how can they proclaim that when a tiger is going to associate humans , or perhaps vehicles , with food !?
Although we enjoyed the experience of seeing tigers , some of them Siberian , roaming in what were large compounds , it was saddening to see the other tigers who were not given the same sized compound .
Still , all of us felt that although it was a shame to see them in such an environment , at least there are still some to be seen at all .

Its a complete disgrace !
Poor creatures which are supposed to be out in the forest are being bred for their hides and bones .
They deserved to be saved well before they are as dead as the dodo .
Ravi I think these farms should be allowed .
Without them tigers are more likely to be poached in the wild .
It keeps the species alive and may even add to the gene pool in the future or keep the species alive when it no longer exists in the wild .
Conservation organisations could work along side them and take one cub from each litter to be released to the wild one day .
We farm chickens , cows , sheep etc .
Why should we prevent sustainable farming ?
So long as they are not removing any more tigers from the wild to continue their business then I see no problem with it .
Just because we see tigers as beautiful exotic animals then we think it is a problem .
We take calves away from their mothers after a few days , so where is the difference in them taking the cubs away from their mothers so young ?
So long as the animals are treated well , slaughtered efficiently with minimal stress and their bones / meat / skins used then why not ?
Sarah , Stoke
The Chinese culture probably is n't going to change much , its been around for a long time .
Modern medicine is not necessarily available or accepted in many parts of the country .
I love to look at Tigers , they are regal and symbolic of great strength .
I would hate to lose all but those on farms .
The Chinese see them the same way , the rest of the world does n't mean a thing to them , but if they can eat a meal of Tiger or use a decoction of some part of him in their ignorance they believe they will acquire that parts strength .
I hope the conservation community is successful in its quest , but when you have a market that will pay for farmed , poached , stolen tiger artefacts , those who have little will try to fill the gap .

Some TTC employees called for a work - to - rule campaign in response to sustained criticism from the public and their boss , but it 's unclear if the protest got much traction .
Customers told CTV Toronto such a move would simply slow things down and did n't support any job action .
The Amalgamated Transit Union , Local 113 , did n't sanction the protest by employees , who got a dressing - down from TTC general manager Gary Webster on Saturday .
" We are in the customer service business , but some of the behaviour our customers have encountered recently would suggest otherwise , " Webster wrote in a message to his 12,000 staff .
" As employees , you -- and you alone -- are accountable for your actions .
The culture of complacency and malaise that has seeped into our organization will end . "
There have been photos posted of collector booth operators either sleeping or watching DVDs on the job , and a video emerged last week of a driver leaving his bus sit for seven minutes while he went for a coffee and to use a washroom .
That operator has been suspended .
The union plans to hold a news conference on Tuesday to speak about customer and labour relations .
But on the weekend , a Facebook group sprung up to give voice to operators ' frustrations -- Toronto Transit Operators Against Public Harassment .
One must request to join the group .
It contains photos of bad passenger behaviour , showing mounds of litter left behind and people sitting with their feet up on seats , among other things .
There were some public postings on another Facebook group : Employees of the TTC .
One person who identified themselves as an operator wrote on Saturday : " I have my Blackberry by my side and it's ready to start video taping my unruly and non paying passenger on my bus .
Then I 'll upload to Youtube ( sic ) and then send them to all the papers and all newsgroups to show the world what we hard working TTC employees have to deal with everyday .
" The cellphone journalism door swings both ways . "
When he criticized a member of the public for engaging in " TTC bashing , " that person responded : " So you can bash riders just because you 're an employee ?
Very mature .
' Two sides to every coin ' right ?
It 's sad that so many people experience the same disrespectful treatment .
I understand theres ( sic ) many shitty riders who try to scam the system , but how about not taking it out on nice decent riders who are just looking for a little help on their way . "
With a report from CTV Toronto's Austin Delaney
The news is somewhat " All Greece , All the Time , " but most of the pieces miss the more critical elements , and in today 's letter we will look at what I think those are , as well as at the important point that Greece is a precursor of a new era of sovereign risk .
Plus , we glance at a few rather silly recent comments from economists .
It will make for a very interesting discussion .
A few weeks ago I mentioned my friend Sir Walt Ratterman , who was in Haiti at the time of the earthquake .
Long - time readers know that every Christmas I ask you to make a donation to Knightsbridge and projects that Walt runs .
You have been very generous over the years .
Tragically , they have found Walt 's body .
For those interested , I will provide a few details about this true hero , toward the conclusion of the letter .
Before we get into the meat of the letter , I want to give you a chance to register for my 6th ( where do the years go ? ! ) annual Strategic Investment Conference , cosponsored with my friends at Altegris Investments .
The conference will be held April 22 - 24 and , as always , in La Jolla , California .
The speaker lineup is powerful .
Already committed are Dr. Gary Shilling , David Rosenberg , Dr. Lacy Hunt , Dr. Niall Ferguson , and George Friedman , as well as your humble analyst .
We are talking with several other equally exciting speakers and expect those to firm up shortly .
Look at that lineup .
These are the guys who got the calls right over the past few years .
They called the housing crisis , the credit bubble , and the recession .
And , in my opinion , these are some of the best in the world at giving us ideas about where we are headed .
Comments from those who attend the annual affair generally run along the lines of " This is the best conference we have ever been to . "
And each year it seems to get better .
This year we are going to focus on " The End Game , " that is , on the paths the various nations are likely to take as they try to solve their various deficit problems , and how that will affect the world and local economies and our investments .
We make sure you have access to our speakers and get your questions answered , and you 'll come away with excellent , practical investment ideas .
This conference sells out every year , and you do not want to miss it .
There is a physical limit to the space .
Every year I have to tell people , including good friends , that there is no more room .
Do n't wait to sign up .
There is an early - bird discount of $ 200 .
And while it pains me to say it , you must be an accredited investor to attend the conference , as there are regulations we must follow in order to offer specific advice and ideas .

A Path - Dependent World
Path dependence explains how the set of decisions one faces for any given circumstance is limited by the decisions one has made in the past , even though past circumstances may no longer be relevant .
In essence , history matters .
With regard to the future , the choices we make determine the paths we will take .
As I have been writing for a long time , we have made a series of bad choices , often the easy choices , all over the developed world .
We are now entering an era in which our choices are being limited by the nature of the markets .
Not only are we in a path - dependent world , but the number of paths from which we may choose are becoming fewer with each passing year .
Our economic future is more and more a product of the political choices we make , and those are increasingly difficult .
We have no good choices .
We are left with choosing the best of bad options .
Some countries , like Greece , are now down to choices that are either dire or disastrous .
There is no " easy " button .
Let 's look at how Greece came to its current rather dismal predicament .
And we will look at why it may be even worse than many pundits think .
First , we need to go back to the creation of the euro .
Most of the Mediterranean countries that are now in trouble were allowed into the union with an exchange rate that overvalued their currencies relative to the northern countries , but especially to Germany .
That meant that Greek consumers could buy products and services that previously may have been out of their reach .
Plus , with government debt at low rates , the Greek government could borrow more to finance deficit spending , without the threat of higher interest rates .
And Greece began to increase its debt with abandon .
Additionally , as it now turns out , Greece basically lied about its finances in order to gain admission to the union .
It never complied with the fiscal discipline that was required for entrance .
With the high exchange rate , however , came the consequence of higher labor costs relative to , above all , Germany .
While reviewing some economic facts about Greece , I came across the factoid that Greek workers had the second highest level of actual hours worked .
But even with that , Greece was running a trade deficit that is currently 12.7 % of its GDP .
And with the onset of the current recession , their fiscal deficit went from bad to worse .
Their total debt is now E254 billion , and they need to finance another E64 billion this year , E30 billion of it in the next few months .
Bottom line , without some help or a bailout , they simply will not be able to borrow that money .
And since a lot of that money is for " rollover " debt , that means a potential for default if they cannot borrow it .
European leaders said today that Greece will not be allowed to fail , hinting of a bailout .
But there are a lot of " buts " and conditions .
Between Dire and Disastrous
While German Chancellor Merkel has indicated a willingness to help , the German finance minister and other politicians are suggesting German cooperation will either not be forthcoming or only be there at a very high price ; and the price is a severe round of " austerity measures , " otherwise known as budget cuts .
Greece is being told that it must cut its budget to an 8.7 % deficit this year and down to 3 % within three years .
For my American readers , let 's put that into perspective .
That is the equivalent of a $ 560 - billion - dollar US budget cut this year and another such cut next year .
That would mean huge cuts in entitlements , Social Security , defense , education , wages , subsidies , and on and on .
And repealing the Bush tax cuts ?
That would just be for starters .
No " let 's freeze the budget " and try and grow our way out of it , as we effectively did in the '90s , or gradually cutting the budget a few hundred billion a year while raising taxes .
That combination of tax increases and budget cuts would guarantee a US recession .
Unemployment , already high , would climb higher .
And yet , that is what the Greek government is being asked to do as the price for a bailout .
A few facts about Greece .
Some 30 % of its economy is underground , meaning it is not taxed .
In a country of 10 million people , only 6 ( !!!!) people filed tax returns showing in excess of E1 million in income .
Yet over 50 % of GDP is government spending , and Greece has one of the highest public employee levels as a percentage of population in Europe .
And its unions are very powerful .
Nearly all of them have gone on strike over this proposal .
A National Suicide Pact
Now , here is where it actually gets worse .
If Greece bites the bullet and makes the budget cuts , that means that nominal GDP will decline by ( at least ) 4 - 5 % over the next 3 years .
And tax revenues will also decline , even with tax increases , meaning that it will take even further cuts , over and above the ones contemplated to get to that magic 3 % fiscal deficit to GDP that is required by the Maastricht Treaty .
Anyone care to vote for depression ?
And add into the equation that borrowing another E100 billion ( at a minimum ) over the next few years , while in the midst of that recession , will only add to the already huge debt and interest costs .
It all amounts to what my friend Marshall Auerback calls a " national suicide pact . "
Normally , a country in such a situation would allow its currency to devalue , which would make its relative labor costs go down .
But Greece is in a currency union , and can't devalue .
Or it would restructure its debt ( think Brady bonds ) to try and resolve the problem .
The dire predicament is the one where Greece cuts its budgets and more or less willingly enters into a rather long and deep recession / depression .
The disastrous predicament is where they do not make the cuts and are allowed to default .
That means the government is plunged into a situation where it has to cut the entire deficit to what it can get in the form of taxes and fees , immediately .
As in right now .
And defaulting on the interest on the current bonds would n't be enough , although it would help .
Why not just let Greece go under ?
Part of the argument has to do with moral hazard .
If Germany bails out Greece , Ireland , which is actually making such cuts to its budget , can legitimately ask , " Why not us ? "
And will Portugal be next ?
And Spain is too big for even Germany to bail out .
At almost 20 % unemployment , Spain has severe problems .
Its banks are in bad shape , with large amounts of overvalued real estate on their books ( sound familiar ? ) and a government fiscal deficit of almost 10 % .
While Spanish authorities say they can work this out , deficits will remain high .
The fear is one of contagion .
Some argue that Greece is only 2.7 % of European GDP .
But Bear Stearns held less than 2 % of US banking assets , and look what happened .
I have been trading emails with Lisa Hintz of Moody's , and she sent me the following note :
" It turns out from the BIS [ Bank of International Settlements ] numbers , that the largest holders of Greek debt are French , followed by the Swiss , although my guess is that a lot of that is hedged , and I do n't know that the BIS picks that up , and then the Germans .
The numbers as of last June were France E86 billion , Switzerland E60bn , and Germany E44 billion .
I have seen more recent numbers of France E73b , Switzerland E59b , and Germany E39b .
In terms of GDP , for Germany it is minimal - just over 1 % .
Of more concern , for France it is nearly 3 % , and for Belgium 2.5 % .
For Germany , the debts of Ireland , Portugal and Spain are much bigger problems .
They may , however , worry that if there is a contagion , they will have to take marks on that debt .
That would be a real problem - nearly 15 x the size of the Greek issue . "
The recent credit crisis was over a few trillion in bad , mostly US , mortgage debts , with most of that at US banks .
Greek debt is $ 350 billion , with about $ 270 billion of that spread among just three European countries and their banks .
Make no mistake , a Greek default is another potential credit crisis in the making .
As noted above , it is not just the writedown of Greek debt ; it is the mark - to - market of other sovereign debt .
That would bankrupt the bulk of the European banking system , which is why it is unlikely to be allowed to happen .
Just as the Fed ( under Volker ! ) allowed US banks to mark up Latin American debt that had defaulted to its original loan value ( and only slowly did they write it down ; it took many years ) , I think the same thing will happen in Europe .
Or the ECB will provide liquidity .
Or there may be any of several other measures to keep things moving along .
But real mark - to - market ?
Unlikely .
The entire EU is faced with no good choices .
It is coming down to that moment of crisis predicted by Milton Friedman so many years ago .
And there is no agreement on what to do .
As Ambrose Evans - Pritchard wrote yesterday : ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/7216363/Will-markets-call-EU-bluff-on-Greek-rescue.html) :
" The 27 leaders never even discussed how they might shore up Greece or the rest of Club Med. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was not willing to broach the subject at all .
The only relevant topic was whether Greece was complying with Treaty obligations , and how the country would slash its budget deficit from 12.7 pc to 8.7 pc this year - in a slump .
" ' They offered nothing , ' said Jochen Felsenheimer , a credit expert at Assenagon in Frankfurt .
' It was just words without any concrete measures , hoping to buy time . '
" Whether the EU has time is an open question .
Credit Suisse says Greece must raise E30bn in debt by mid-year , mostly in April and May .
Greek banks have been shut out of Europe 's inter - dealer markets , forcing them to raise money at killer rates .
They are suffering an erosion of deposits as rich Greeks shift money abroad .
This could come to a head long before April .
" ' Economically , we are in a very risky situation .
Greece is close to default .
We face systemic risk like the Lehman collapse and unless there is a bail - out for Greece , there will have to be a bail - out for the whole European banking system within two or three months , ' he said .
" Yet they are damned if they do n't , and damned if they do .
' A Greek bail - out increases the risk of EMU break - up , because monetary union can only work if everybody sticks to the rules , ' Mr Felsenheimer said . "
There is talk among some in Europe of a more centralized control of some countries that do not stay within guidelines , which means that Greece might be asked to give up some of its sovereign freedoms in exchange for bailout funds .
French President Sarkozy emphatically stated that no member of the EU would be allowed to default .
But he did not bring a checkbook to the press conference .
Selling this to a variety of national parliaments will not be easy , when they have their own problems .
And Merkel has problems on the home front .
There are reports she is putting the brakes on a bailout , as she is getting pushback from her constituency .
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung warned the chancellor yesterday that offering Greece any kind of bailout would be a betrayal of the trust of the Germans who so reluctantly traded in their marks for the euro .
" If the no-bailout clause of the Maastricht Treaty is going to be abandoned , then the last anchor of a stable euro will be destroyed , " warned the front - page editorial in the conservative newspaper .
" Chancellor Merkel has to be hard now so that the euro does n't become soft . "
Ultimately , this is a political decision for the Greek people .
They have roughly four options .
They can accept the austerity measures and sink into a depression for a few years .
This would mean the total amount of debt would go up rather significantly , putting a very large crimp on future budgets .
Debt is a constraint on growth .
Debt - to - GDP is already over 100 % .
A recent paper by Reinhart and Rogoff ( authors of the book This Time It 's Different ) shows that when government debt - to - GDP goes over 90 % , it reduces future potential GDP by over 1 % .
That locks in a slow - growth , high - unemployment future in an economy already saddled with government spending at 50 % of GDP , which is by definition a drag on GDP growth .
The second option is that they can simply default and go into a depression for more than a few years .
This would have the advantage of reducing the debt burden , depending on what terms the government settled on .
Would bond holders get 50 cents on the euro ? 25 cents ?
Stay tuned .
But it would also most assuredly mean they would not be able to get new debt for some time to come , forcing , as noted above , severe cuts in government spending .
From one perspective , it has the potential advantage of reducing government 's share of the economy , which is a long - term good but a short - term nightmare .
But it also keeps
Greece in the euro zone , which does have advantages .
However , it does little to deal with the labor - cost differentials .
The third option is that they could vote to leave the European Union .
While this is unthinkable to most Europeans , it is an option that may appeal to some Greeks .
They could create their own currency and effectively devalue their debt .
It would make their labor and exports cheaper .
They would still be shut out of debt markets for some time .
Any savings left in Greece would be devalued overnight .
Those on pensions would find their buying power cut by a great deal .
It is likely that inflation would become an issue .
And it would be a full - employment act for legions of attorneys .
Most people scoff at this notion , but money is flying out of Greek banks into non-Greek ones , and to my way of thinking that is a suggestion that some Greeks think secession might be a possibility .
It is also causing severe stress at Greek banks .
The final option is to promise to make the budget cuts , get some form of guarantee on their bonds , and borrow enough to make it another year - but not actually cut as much as promised ; just make some cuts and then promise more next year if you will just bail us out some more .
That just kicks the problem down the road for another year or two , until European voters ( mostly German ) get tired of taking on Greek debt .
The market is not going to let Greece continue to borrow without showing some serious efforts at cutting their deficit , and probably not even then without some external guarantees .
The history of Greek debt is not a good one .
They have been in default 105 years out of the last 200 .
There are some optimists , however .
Good friend and fishing buddy David Kotok thinks that this will all turn out OK .
Writing this week , he said , " Lastly , it is important to understand the territory of this issue .
The 27 members of the EU and the 16 of them that are in the euro zone , and most of the other 11 that want to be in the euro zone , will coalesce and deal with Greek debt in the fiscal policy arena .
Budget deficits will decline , although they may not decline as fast as projections .
Economic growth will occur , although it may not be as fast as projected .
Taxes will rise .
Public sector employment benefits and compensation will be pressured to compress , and the workers will resist but eventually compromise .
By the way , that will also happen at the federal level in the United States and with the 50 sovereign state debtors that make up our country .
Think of us as a US dollar zone , just as we think of them as a euro zone .
They are new at it .
We have had a century of practice and need only another few hundred years to get it right . "
My objection to that is , US states generally have a mandate to balance their budgets , so that the " debt - to - GDP " of a state is comparatively rather small .
And a US citizen is ten times more likely to move from one state to another to find a job than a European will move to another country .
As one person I read commented about unemployed Spanish workers in Madrid , " They wo n't even move to Barcelona ! "
It 's More than Just Greece
The lesson here ?
This is not just a Greek problem .
Debt and out of control deficits are a problem all over the developed world .
The Greeks are just the first .
As Niall Ferguson wrote this week in the Financial Times , the contagion is headed to US shores unless we get our budget house in order .
You can not spend your way out of a fiscal crisis .
The current path is simply unsustainable .
At some point , we can become Greece .
Yes , we have the advantage of having our debt denominated in dollars , but that is only an advantage up to a certain point .
The Nobel Prize economists ( who will go nameless here ) who say the US cannot default because our debt is in dollars miss the point .
Being the world 's reserve currency just means we can run up bigger bills , but if we go the route of printing money to pay those bills , that is devaluation and fraud , as the value of a dollar will diminish ; and that is tantamount to default .
Whether it is Japan or Portugal or the US or ( pick a country ) , the body of evidence clearly shows that there is a limit to the amount of debt a sovereign country can handle without a crisis developing .
That limit is different for each country , but there is a limit that the bond market will impose .
And there are many countries in the developed world that are approaching that limit .
We are in the fullness of time approaching the End Game .
In country after country , the choices that have been made over the last decades will yield a Greek situation , where there are no good choices .
And the longer the hard choices are put off , the more difficult they will become .
For some countries it could mean deflation .
For others , it will look like inflation on steroids .
Countries with sensible budgets and policies will thrive .
For most of the last two decades , investors have ignored country risk in the developed world .
That is no longer a safe option .
We will explore the consequences in later letters .
R.I.P. , Walt Ratterman
A few weeks ago I wrote about my friend Walt Ratterman , who was at the Hotel Montana in Haiti when the earthquake hit .
Walt 's wife Jeanne received an email only 10 minutes before the quake , which placed him in the courtyard , where he would have been OK .
After the quake there was an eerie silence .
We all assumed that Walt was helping those injured in the quake and that he and his friends would surface when they got a break .
Those who knew Walt understand the passion he brought to many relief operations .
Walt was known for sneaking into Myanmar in the bottom of a boat where , if discovered , he would have been summarily executed .
Walt was the subject of the documentary Beyond the Call , which showed him braving Afghanistan a month after 9/11 , Myanmar , and the most dangerous region of the Philippines .
Walt 's love of helping people who , for no fault of their own , could n't help themselves caused him to relocate his family to the West Coast , to be better able to continue his work .
Walt traveled the world to help the needy , visiting Asia , Africa , South America , and Central America .
Each time he brought food , medical relief , and solar power , and had a sustaining impact on all the lives he touched .
Walt was part of a team brought into Haiti by USAID ( United States Agency for International Development ) to bring solar power to Haiti .
Walt was working there on several projects , including a few hospitals where electricity brought them out of the dark ages , allowing them to perform surgeries and other treatments that were unavailable in Haiti previously .
Many of the projects were completed prior to the quake and provided much - needed support for the injured , saving countless lives .
The great irony is that Walt almost never stayed in nice hotels .
He stayed with those he helped .
The men and women who loved Walt mobilized to raise money and travel to Haiti .
My own readers have been very generous .
Six teams made their way at various times throughout the search and rescue phase of the operation .
Each of those teams brought much - needed food , water , or medical relief .
Dr. Sir James
Laws hired a bus in the Dominican Republic and loaded it with bottled water that was given to many who were thirsty in Haiti .
Sir Edward Artis loaded a 20 - foot truck with food and braved the road from the Dominican Republic as well , in spite of reports of looting and hijacking of other vehicles on the road .
The first team was given the emotional task of handling the morgue at the Hotel Montana .
Without complaining , each member of that team stepped up and did what was asked of them .
Each night this team cried themselves to sleep from the emotional toll of dealing with the dead that day .
Each of the Knights and friends of Walt reached out to their entire networks and brought awareness to the search for Walt and the hundreds of others trapped in the rubble at the Hotel Montana .
As time wore on it became obvious that a miracle was n't meant to be .
Hope gave way to preparation for the inevitable .
Walt 's backpack and laptop were found a few days before his body was discovered .
And then there was a wait for positive identification , before dental records confirmed that Walt was a casualty of the devastating earthquake .
He was one of more than two hundred thousand souls separated from their bodies in that quake .
No doubt
Walt was busy in the spirit world , calming and organizing this mass of men , women , and children for their trek to meet their maker .
Each of us who has been involved in the life of Walt , and now with his untimely death , knows that he lived a life of honor and that he died doing the work that he loved .
His death was certain to be a death of honor because of the way he chose to live his life .
Each of us has the opportunity to rededicate ourselves to living our lives in a manner more aligned with the values that Walt applied every day he was here .
Walt stared death in the face so many times and lived , that we all expected him to be immortal .
Each of us has limited time on this planet , and we can use Walt 's example to make that time count .
You , gentle reader , have given generously to make a great deal of difference in Haiti and over the years to Knightsbridge .
Would you join me one more time to honor the life and work of our fallen hero Walt Ratterman ?
The world does not have enough Walts , and he will be sorely missed .
Rest in Peace , my friend .

The NBA , Snow , and No Power
I note , for the ( now almost 10,000 ) readers of the Chinese language version of this letter , that there is a very interesting conference in Shanghai this spring .
I wish I could go , but I have a conflict , though next year I am planning on speaking .

This weekend I take most of my kids and their spouses and friends to the NBA All - Star Game , as well as my friend of longest standing , Randy Scroggins ( I am not allowed to say oldest friend ) .
We went to the first grade together and have remained close for all these years .
It will be a fun evening .
My last All - Star Game was some 25 years ago , here in Dallas .
I remember Isaiah Thomas getting the tip - off and missing his first shot .
Kareem pulled down the board , jumped up and baseball - passed the ball to Magic Johnson running down the left side , near half - court .
Magic caught the pass , dribbled once , and then passed the ball behind his back all the way down court to James Worthy , who was streaking down the far side .
Worthy dribbled once and then dunked .
All in the first few seconds of the game .
At least that 's the way I remember it , from the very top row in the corner .
My tickets are better this time , but I can only hope we see something like that .
I write this letter from a friend 's house .
Thursday we woke to snow , and it continued all day and into the evening .
We had almost a foot of snow , which is not a lot for the north of the country but quite a lot for here .
It has been decades since we had that much .
Trees are down everywhere under weight they had not grown accustomed to , as are power lines .
My power went out yesterday afternoon and will probably be out until Sunday sometime .
Just like a financial crisis , these things sneak up on you .
It was only supposed to be a light dusting of snow .
The problem would be " contained . "
We had a system that was not prepared for the weight of this much snow .
Oh well .
We figure out how to Muddle Through .
There are some facts and figures on my computer that did not make it into this week 's letter , but it is long enough as is .
Have a great week , and remember to enjoy your friends and family while you have them .

Lousy day ?
Do n’t try to think happy thoughts — just think fast .
A new study shows that accelerated thinking can improve your mood .
In six experiments , researchers at Princeton and Harvard universities made research participants think quickly by having them generate as many problem - solving ideas ( even bad ones ) as possible in 10 minutes , read a series of ideas on a computer screen at a brisk pace or watch an I Love Lucy video clip on fast - forward .
Other participants performed similar tasks at a relaxed speed .
Results suggested that thinking fast made participants feel more elated , creative and , to a lesser degree , energetic and powerful .
Activities that promote fast thinking , then , such as whipping through an easy crossword puzzle or brain - storming quickly about an idea , can boost energy and mood , says psychologist Emily Pronin , the study ’s lead author .
Pronin notes that rapid - fire thinking can sometimes have negative consequences .
For people with bipolar disorder , thoughts can race so quickly that the manic feeling becomes aversive .
And based on their own and others ’ research , Pronin and a colleague propose in another recent article that although fast and varied thinking causes elation , fast but repetitive thoughts can instead trigger anxiety .
( They further suggest that slow , varied thinking leads to the kind of calm , peaceful happiness associated with mindfulness meditation , whereas slow , repetitive thinking tends to sap energy and spur depressive thoughts . )
It is unclear why thought speed affects mood , but Pronin and her colleagues theorize that our own expectations may be part of the equation .
In earlier research , they found that people generally believe fast thinking is a sign of a good mood .
This lay belief may lead us to instinctively infer that if we are thinking quickly we must be happy .
In addition , they suggest , thinking quickly may unleash the brain ’s novelty - loving dopamine system , which is involved in sensations of pleasure and reward .
The kind of rush that a person gets from rapid - fire thinking may be transient , but “ these little bursts of positive emotion add up , ” says psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky of the University of California , Riverside .
Studies have demonstrated that happiness yields myriad benefits , including greater productivity , stronger social support and improved immune function , she explains , adding that “ even brief periods of heightened mood can lead to upward spirals . ”

January 18 , 2010
With 160 active - duty soldiers killing themselves last year , the US Army set a new record for suicides .
As Jason Ditz reports , " This surpassed the previous record of 140 in 2008 , and the previous record before that was 115 in 2007 .
The Army has been keeping track of suicides since 1980 , with the level suddenly rising to epidemic levels in recent years . "
First released by the AP on Friday , this story has been almost completely ignored by the mainstream media .
Part of the reason , I imagine , is that it was a fairly busy news weekend , what with the president throwing a surprise birthday party for the first lady and all .
But I suspect there�s more to it than that .
I suspect part of the reason is that the MSM ( and I include Fox News here ) realizes that people just don�t want to hear it .
The American people , those loveable idiots who drive around with Support Our Troops ribbons on the backs of their cars , just don�t want to hear bad things about our troops .
When anonymous government officials claim that Jessica Lynch fought a John McClane - like battle before being taken captive by Iraqi soldiers , that�s all the networks can talk about .
That �s all people want to hear about .
Rambo in Iraq .
Hell yeah , pass the popcorn .
But nobody wants to expose themselves to anything that would challenge their deeply - held , Hollywood - inspired beliefs about war .
They�ll give a shout - out to our troops during Sunday morning church service ; they�ll encourage their first - graders to write letters showing their support .
But they don�t want to know what�s really happening .
They don�t want to hear that , far from turning our boys into men , these wars are destroying them .
There�s , of course , the physical destruction , as many American soldiers keep coming home in body bags .
( Expect as many as 500 a month come this summer , warns retired General Barry McCaffrey . )
But there�s also the tremendous psychological destruction .
Any war is going to inflict hell on its participants , but " the Long War " has been particularly harsh .
Multiple deployments , some of them coming as the result of the military�s stop - loss program , have pushed many of our troops to the breaking point .
Psychiatrist Kernan Manion , who�s treated several returning Marines , states : " Frankly , in my more than twenty - five years of clinical practice , I�ve never seen such immense emotional suffering and psychological brokenness �literally , a relentless stream of courageous , well - trained and formerly strong Marines deeply wounded psychologically by the immensity of their combat experiences " ( h/t Antiwar Radio ) .
Manion continues : " There �s currently simply no terminology in the APA [ American Psychiatric Association ] literature for this .
When you �re dealing with cumulative stress from constant guardedness because of continuous exposure to danger �multiple firefights , patrols , losses of buddies and utter exhaustion from deployment �and then you have family problems , and relationship problems , and then on top of all of that you have commanders telling you you �re nothing but a worthless piece of shit , you simply can�t think straight anymore , and who could be expected to . "
In an attempt to cope , many soldiers turn to drugs and alcohol , and many others , as Friday�s AP story reminds us , end up killing themselves .
Needless to say , the effects of this psychological destruction remain even after one leaves the service .
As Dahr Jamail points out , " A 2008 court case in California revealed a Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) email that revealed 1,000 veterans who are receiving care from the VA are attempting suicide every single month , and 18 veterans kill themselves daily . "
But again , the American idiocracy , with all its meaningless symbols and gestures , doesn�t want to hear any of this .
Which is why we need to bring this to the idiocracy�s attention and explain why it�s yet another reason to bring our troops home .
SAVAGE LOVE Age and Consent
enjoyed your advice , humor , and politics .
But I never thought I would need your advice , being a well - adjusted hetero chick .
All that changed a few months ago when I got married .
Before we married , my hubby denied having any sexual fantasies .
I have lots and enjoy some kinks .
We talked , though , and he said that he would try .
Now I find out that he DOES have fantasies and that he lied to me .
He did n't open up to me about this , I found porn that he downloaded .
His thoughts are about teenage girls , like the rest of the fucking culture .
However , he lied and I am now feeling like I am not someone he trusts !
It took time for me to adjust to being with a man who had NO fantasies .
Now I know that he does have fantasies , but I feel too bad about our relationship to take advantage of it !
How do I get over being hurt about being lied to ?
Why in the hell would he lie when I shared my dirty thoughts with him ?
I do n't get it and I do n't know what to do about it .
Miserable , Mad , and Married
The answer to your question , MMM , is right there in your letter .
Why would your husband hide his sexual fantasies from you ?
Perhaps because he knew that if he shared his fantasies with you -- his boring , predictable , and perfectly natural heterosexual male fantasies -- he would be tried , convicted , and condemned along with the rest of the " fucking culture . "
And for what ?
For the sin of wanting to fuck the kinds of females straight men everywhere want to fuck .
Fact is , MMM , there 's more than cultural forces at work here .
Yes , the adolescent body , male and female , is the reigning beauty ideal , and the culture celebrates and sexualizes the young .
But there 's nothing arbitrary about this .
The reptile part of the male brain is wired to find fertility insanely attractive , and when women are teenagers they 're fertile as fuck and their offspring are likelier to survive .
And it 's not just men that are subject to the forces of evolution ; the reptile part of the female brain is wired to find tall , strong , powerful , and successful men attractive .
Why ?
Because these are the guys who can chase down , kill , and drag mastodons back to the cave .
Thankfully most modern adult straight males want to be with adult females and most find mature women attractive .
( Many men maintain that women are less likely to betray the reptile part of their brains and date men who are n't successful and attractive . )
Adult men who can form adult relationships with adult women but also find teenage girls attractive -- and that describes most straight guys , MMM -- are wise enough to ( 1 ) refrain from dating teenage girls ( they 're often insufferable and while they have firmer bodies they usually do n't know what to do with them ) , and ( 2 ) keep it to themselves for fear of annoying the women in their lives , which is what your husband was doing .
So now that you get it , MMM , what do you do about it ?
Get the fuck over it .
It 's perfectly normal for straight guys to find post - pubescent teenage girls attractive .
Since he was n't hiding his heterosexuality from you , I do n't think your husband can be accused of hiding this " fantasy " from you .
I started dating my girlfriend three months ago .
We are both virgins and it was established at the beginning that sex would most likely not happen .
She wears a chastity ring and is pretty religious .
Recently , however , she has been telling me that she wants to have sex .
I 'm worried because she is in love with me , but I am not in love with her .
She is an attractive girl , and I like her , but I am not in love .
My second fear is that she will have some kind of mental breakdown .
We have discussed my second fear and she agrees it could happen .
Should I have sex with her ?
Very Into Rubbing Girls in Nude
I suppose there 's a first time for everything , and this may be a first for me : I 'm actually ordering someone not to have sex .
Do n't do it , VIRGIN .
I 'm not opposed to religious girls who wear chastity rings losing their virginities before marriage , kiddo , but I prefer scenarios where the girl is a secret sexual athlete and the posturing about virginity is her cover .
This is not the case with your girlfriend .
She wants to have sex with you , VIRGIN , because she 's actually in love with you and she thinks you 're in love with her .
That breakdown she 's promised you she 'll have after she loses her virginity ?
Once she realizes she 's lost her virginity to a guy who does n't love her , VIRGIN , and who kept that pertinent info from her - - you say you discussed your second fear , the breakdown , but not your first , the fact that you do n't love her -- she 's going to lose her shit .
Do n't put her through that , VIRGIN .
Go find a nice , sexually active girl who wears a chastity ring on her middle finger , okay ?
In a recent column you replied to This Boy Wonders regarding his fantasy to initiate oral sex with his sleeping wife .
I have to take issue with one part of your response : " When it comes to long - term sex partners -- particularly live - ins , husbands , and wives -- a certain implied consent can be taken for granted … you would n't be the first married guy who initiated sex with his sleeping wife . "
It 's dangerous to talk about implied consent when it comes to married couples or long - term sex partners .
Even if this man 's wife would consent 99 percent of the time , if he tries to have sex and it's that 1 percent of the time when she would n't have consented , there is no consent .
I agree that his fantasy would be OK if they talked about it ahead of time , as you recommended , I just wanted to caution you against advocating " implied consent . "
I work with domestic violence victims ( mostly women ) and I 've heard many times from them of being forced to have sex because their abusers believed marriage implied lifelong consent .
Ana in Pennsylvania
Being forced to have sex -- being raped by a spouse or a stranger -- and being on the receiving end of an attempt to initiate sex by a long - term partner are two different things , AIP , and I was discussing the latter .
To clarify , when I wrote about " implied consent " this is what I was picturing :
As much as I might like to , I would never approach a strange man , however attractive he might be , and shove my dick into the crack of his ass without first getting his explicit verbal consent .
That would be sexual assault , and it would be wrong .
But I do that sort of thing to my boyfriend , gosh , all the time .
For the most part , my boyfriend welcomes my sexual advances , doll that he is , and on those occasions when he says no , I slink back to my side of the bed and read the National Review .
Did I sexually assault him ?
No , I have his implied consent to initiate sex whenever I care to , just as he has my implied consent to do the same , and we both reserve the right to say no when we 're not in the mood .
And it's that kind of consent -- the consent to initiate , even if initiation takes a form that would be regarded as sexual assault if it were attempted on anyone else -- that is frequently taken for granted in stable , long - term relationships like mine and TBW's .

By JIM GILES ( New Scientist ) [ 1 ]
WHEN thousands of protestors took to the streets in Iran following this year 's disputed presidential election , Twitter messages sent by activists let the world know about the brutal policing that followed .
A few months earlier , campaigners in Moldova used Facebook to organise protests against the country 's communist government , and elsewhere too the internet is playing an increasing role in political dissent .
Now governments are trying to regain control .
By reinforcing their efforts to monitor activity online , they hope to deprive dissenters of information and the ability to communicate .
The latest evidence of these clampdowns comes in a report on the Middle East and north Africa by the OpenNet Initiative ( ONI ) , a collaboration of researchers based in the UK and North America .
Among the restrictions it reports are clampdowns on Facebook in Syria and the use of hidden cameras in Saudi Arabia 's internet cafes .
Most of these actions are aimed at stifling political debate .
" Political filtering is the common denominator , " says Helmi Noman of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society in Boston , who compiled the report .
" It 's the main target . "
Noman asked volunteers to check whether roughly 2000 sites covering a range of subjects , including gambling , political news and humour , are accessible in various countries .
He also examined government eavesdropping schemes and the actions of local law enforcers .
The survey showed that governments in the Middle East and north Africa routinely block sites that host discussions critical of their policies or that cover human rights issues .
Opposition parties ' sites are also censored .
At times entire social networking services , including Twitter , are unavailable , and the same goes for the YouTube video - sharing site .
Orkut , a social networking site , is offline in the United Arab Emirates .
The BBC Persian site cannot be accessed from Iran .
The governments ' task of blocking internet access is made easier because many countries in the region have only a handful of service providers .
Governments also keep tabs on who is using the internet and what they are viewing .
In March , newspapers in Saudi Arabia reported that police had started visiting internet cafes to ensure that owners had installed cameras to monitor users , as the country 's law requires .
In Jordan , cafe owners have to record their customers ' names and monitor the sites they visit .
Noman says that filtering and monitoring have become more widespread as the internet 's role in political activity has increased .
" More activists are going online and more activists are being created online , " he says .
Monitoring has become more widespread as the internet 's role in political activity has increased .
What 's happening in the region is echoed to some extent in most other parts of the world .
Online users almost everywhere are subject to some kind of censorship , the ONI says .
" The Middle East is not on a different trend to the rest of the world , " says Jillian York , who helps to co-ordinate the ONI from the Berkman Center .
" Filtering seems to be increasing everywhere . "
China has developed an extensive system of filters which it uses to block access to content about sensitive topics , such as the protests in 1989 in Tiananamen Square , Beijing .
Other Asian nations , including Thailand and Vietnam , have taken action against blogs and news sites that host material critical of their leaders .
The ONI found few restrictions of this kind in the Americas , with the notable exception of Cuba , where many people are unable to even access the internet .
In western democracies , censorship is aimed mainly at sites offering child pornography or images of extreme violence .
Though few people object to this , there is a danger that innocent sites can get caught in the net .
A list of blocked sites that appeared on the Wikileaks website in March - and which the Australian government was considering using as the basis for a government - mandated filtering scheme - accidentally included the website of a Queensland dentist and YouTube videos about euthanasia .
Officials responsible for the filtering do not generally discuss details of the technology involved , but western companies are known to have sold filtering software to some foreign governments .
Search engines Google and Yahoo have conformed to restrictions demanded by Chinese censors to avoid being blocked themselves .
Online security specialists Websense and Secure Computing say their technology has been deployed without their knowing .
Other organisations based in the west are helping people defeat attempts at censorship .
In 2007 , researchers at the University of Toronto in Canada released software called Psiphon that allows internet users to bypass censorship controls such as those imposed by China on communication from abroad .
The Tor software created by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco is designed to disguise a message 's origin by bouncing it between several different routers .
Berkman researcher Jonathan Zittrain has developed Herdict , a site that allows users to report sites that they find blocked .
Twitter , Facebook and YouTube are high on the list of affected sites on reports from around the world .
The country from where the largest number of reports originates is China , with around 7500 complaints .

The takeover of the world by geeks has just made another giant leap forward .
Yesterday , Mattel announced that , as a result of a poll of fans , for Barbie 's next career , she will be a computer engineer .
We at GeekDad are all for anything that might encourage girls to pursue tech careers when they grow up , and this new Barbie might just fit the bill .
We especially like that its accessories were chosen with help from the Society of Women Engineers and the National Academy of Engineering , which explains the geek chic shirt with the binary code all over it , and the smartphone with Bluetooth headset .
We 're concerned , however , that the doll will create unrealistic expectations of what a job as a software engineer actually entails .
Some of these expectations may be encouraging and some discouraging .
For instance , Computer Engineer Barbie is , like most ( if not all ) Barbies , wearing high heels , which seems a ridiculously uncomfortable shoe choice for a job where nobody really cares what you 're wearing so long as it's decent .
Here , then , are five ideas that we think would make Computer Engineer Barbie more realistic ( in no particular order ) :
1 . The choice of a coffee cup or Mountain Dew can that , once put in her hand , ca n't be removed for two hours .
2 . A cubicle farm playset , with optional foosball table .
3 . A switch to turn on dark circles under Barbie 's eyes from having worked until 2:00 AM three days in a row to get all the bugs fixed before the new release is deployed .
4 . A wrist brace for when Barbie gets carpal tunnel syndrome .
5 . The choice between Mac Computer Engineer Barbie , Windows Computer Engineer Barbie , and Linux Computer Engineer Barbie .
Then they could publicize the sales figures daily to encourage geek parents to buy the version they want to win for their kids .

C++/Tk is an interface to the Tk GUI toolkit , known from many scripting languages like Tcl , Python or Perl .
The C++/ Tk library tries to provide not only the Tk functionality , but also its way of writing code , based on the syntax used in Tcl / Tk .
As a result , it is possible to write programming jokes like this
( in fact , the whole C++/ Tk library started from this joke ) :
Tcl / Tk hello world
C++/ Tk hello world
proc hello {} {
puts " Hello Tcl / Tk ! "
}
button " .b " - text " Say Hello " - command hello
pack " .b " - padx 20 - pady 6
#include " cpptk. h "
#include < stdio.h >
using namespace Tk ;
void hello( ) {
puts ( " Hello C++/Tk ! " ) ;
}
int main ( int , char * argv [ ] )
{
init ( argv [ 0 ] ) ;
button ( " .b " ) - text ( " Say Hello " ) - command ( hello ) ;
pack ( " .b " ) - padx ( 20 ) - pady ( 6 ) ;
runEventLoop ( ) ;
}
Apart from the scaffolding necessary in C++ , both programs look almost the same and produce the same result ( the actual look and feel depends on the platform , window manager , etc. ) :
If you click the button , the greetings will be printed on the console .
Interesting ?

How does it work ?
It works thanks to templates , operator overloading , implicit conversions and temporary objects .
Each C++/ Tk expression ends up as equivalent Tcl / Tk command in the string format , which is then fed to the underlying Tcl interpreter .
This means that C++/ Tk uses and depends on the Tcl / Tk environment .
It also means that C++/ Tk is portable in the same way as Tcl / Tk .
The added values are :
good type safety ( many errors , which would be run-time errors in Tcl / Tk , are caught at compile - time ; and many typos , which would be errors in Tcl / Tk are not errors at all in C++/Tk )
very easy integration of the GUI elements with C++ elements like call - back procedures and variables
possibility to add simple GUI to C++ programs with just few lines of code , but keeping the whole production cycle with the traditional C++ tools ( no additional compiler or preprocessor is needed )
If you think that the above programming joke is funny , feel free to use C++/ Tk in your own programs !

It is interesting how the Federal Reserve Board , long the champion of fiscal and monetary prudence when others spend money , has declared war on the idea that anyone should account for how the Fed spends money .
Think about it :
In the largest bailout in history , neither the public nor members of Congress can even make an intelligent estimate of how much money the Fed has actually spent , or exactly how it is being spent , or exactly who are the major beneficiaries of much of the spending .
We know taxpayers , consumers and jobless workers are not the beneficiaries , but we do n’t even remotely know the full story of exactly which institutions benefit from exactly which programs .
The stakes are very high , and as this battle unfolds it will continue to be the greatest show on earth , and one of the most important .
The HTC Desire has speculatively surfaced on the Modaco community forum .
What was thought to be the HTC Bravo , is said to be the HTC Desire which was also the code - named HTC Droid Eris , but formerly known as the Bravo .
Is this beginning to sound like a soap opera yet ?
All that really matters is if it actually does surface at the Mobile World Congress which kicked off today in Barcelona , Spain and when will it reach North America ?
The Desire will be similar in size to the HTC Hero , with the desired HTC Sense UI , an FM radio , 1GHz SnapDragon processor from Qualcomm , 512MB ROM and 576MB RAM , a beautiful 3.7 ″ AMOLED screen and what looks to be like a miniature optical trackball .
This would be a serious contended for Google ’s Nexus One phone , and with such convincing renders , I ’m even more excited about this release .
Note :
The date on the rendering shows February 16th , does that mean HTC plans to launch it tomorrow ?
